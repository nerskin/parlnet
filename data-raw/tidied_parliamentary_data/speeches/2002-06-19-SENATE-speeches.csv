"Senator KNOWLES,",LP,2002-06-19,"—Over the years there has been much debate about air safety and cabin air quality in the BAe146 aircraft. In fact, the Senate undertook an inquiry into the matter. This has been and continues to be a serious problem for those experiencing adverse reactions to the air contamination said to be emanating from faulty oil seals that allow fumes from aviation oil to enter the cabin. Today I refer specifically to situations that have been brought to my attention by constituents in Western Australia and about their employer, National Jet Systems group. It needs to be noted that National Jet Systems is not some tin-pot airline that just runs a few planes around the bush. It has 23 BAe146 planes, the majority of which are leased by Qantas. It is the second largest airline in Australia and, on a most conservative calculation, one could say that NJS would fly well over two million passengers a year.
It appears, on the evidence that I have before me, that National Jet Systems solve the problem of air contamination by suspending or dismissing staff that complain of adverse events following exposure. It also appears that National Jet Systems place such enormous pressure on their crews to keep their planes in the air at all costs that the crews themselves have been most reluctant to report faults that could ground a plane for any length of time. This has led to a culture of silence among most crews. They are now fearful of anyone going public because they have been threatened that they will all be sued for not reporting problems. Therefore, for someone to speak out they are running great risks. That is why I will not be referring to my constituents by name. The constituents have sought to raise their concerns with the Air Transport Safety Bureau, only to be told that the bureau cannot investigate anything until after there is an accident. CASA have proven to be less than helpful on this occasion as well.
As I said, there have been many reports done on the subject of contaminated air in the BAe146 jets. There is a further report by Professor Chris Winder entitled Possible contaminants in jet oil engine leaks. This paper was delivered at a symposium in Canberra in December 2000. In that paper, Professor Winder talks about the known toxicity of certain types of oils and the fact that:
... potentially toxic products have continued to be available long after their toxicity was recognised.
In this subject we are talking about products that can have extremely serious effects on the wellbeing of crew and passengers. My concern in this instance, and I would suggest the concern of any individual who travels, is that the crew can be affected by such contamination and thereby suffer a range of effects. These can include, but are not exclusively listed: proximal limb paralysis, weakness of neck muscles, inhibition of respiratory muscles, cranial nerve involvement, headaches, mental fatigue, depression, anxiety, irritability, reduced concentration and impaired vigilance, reduced information processing and psychomotor speed, memory deficit and linguistic disturbances. I am sure that honourable senators would agree that these symptoms are hardly the symptoms one would wish for someone in charge of flying an aircraft.
What worries me is that the symptoms described by Professor Winder bear an uncanny resemblance to those reported by the company doctor when assessing one of my constituents. The doctor wrote, under the heading of symptoms, that the crew member reported:
Mucous in the back of the throat, tingling sensation and paraesthesia of the head, pressure headache over the temples and bridge of the nose, nausea and constriction of the throat, feeling of irritability, sensitivity to light and sound, lethargy and fatigue, deterioration in memory.
Professor Winder talked about such contaminants being: 
... administered subcutaneously to mice—
and that the researcher—
... found a heightened incidence of lung and kidney cancers. 
Furthermore, he states that one of the contaminants:
... is listed as a prohibited substance under the Australian hazardous substances regulation.
Professor Winder says that the product is assumed to comply by default. I could go on for hours quoting this document; however, I simply quote from the conclusions of that report:
The jet oils are commercially useful product. They are known to contain toxic ingredients. Even the apparent toxicity of a jet oil reported from animal experiments in 1998 was not viewed as a significant problem. However, an increasing number of oil leaks in the 1990s around the world, and the increase in the number of flight attendants and flight crew reporting signs of toxicity after such events, suggests the toxicity of jet oils should be reconsidered. Firstly, the exposure scenario at altitude is utterly different from conventional exposures to the oils while using them in maintenance situations. Options for the control of exposure are all but absent. Exposure may not only be to gases and vapours, but also to particulates. The exposure may vary from unchanged oil mists, to combusted or pyrolised contaminants.
In light of this type of assessment done by an independent person, I am left asking why so many personnel have had to endure sickness and then suffer the indignity of dismissal because they were seen to be malingerers, grizzlers or hypochondriacs.
In an effort to dispel individual crew complaints, the company has insisted on sending the crew member to a doctor of company choice. When the report from that doctor has verified the crew complaint, the company, in short, has admitted that there is a problem that cannot or will not be fixed, then offered the crew a lesser position on a smaller aircraft or dismissal. I will quote from the doctor's report, which clearly states the doctor's opinion. The assessment the doctor gave is as follows:
The symptoms [Mr X] reports are consistent with exposure to jet oil fumes and I note his reports consistently correlate with documented technical faults. I find [Mr X] is perfectly fit to work as a pilot and to date has not suffered any significant long-term health effect as a result of exposure to fumes on the BAE146. He has, of course, suffered significant short-term health effects as a result of the fume exposures, and continued exposure would not be advisable. At the present time he seems to have completely recovered from the ill effects of the recorded exposures. He is therefore fit to fly all other aircraft types. In relation to the BAE146, he is also fit to fly the BAE146 jets provided you can give assurances that there will be no further cabin air contamination. If you cannot provide a safe working environment, then you will be placing him at further risk.
That is interesting because that has come from the doctor that the company suggested this constituent attend. The doctor went on to say that other issues need to be considered:
From my experience of seeing many flight crew from both Ansett and NJS it would appear to me that there are certain aircraft that are consistently reported to have problems with cabin air quality. In respect of NJS I recall Zulu Lima and Alpha to be frequently mentioned by flight crew as having oil leaks into the cabin, causing flight crew and passengers to be unwell. It may be then that there are certain BAE 146 aircraft that you can be confident do not have a history of cabin air contamination. These aircraft could possibly be considered safe for [Mr X] to operate. 
If you cannot give assurances that there will be no cabin air contamination then it raises serious air safety issues for both your staff and passengers. 
Given [Mr X]'s reports correlate with documented technical faults I would consider that it is highly unlikely that he is alone, as a pilot, in his experience of the ill effects of leaked fumes. I hold some concern that there may be under-reporting of such incidents by pilots for a number of reasons. [Mr X] has, in fact, demonstrated integrity and courage in objectively recording incidents and as a result has significantly contributed to air safety.
The doctor finished by saying:
There needs to be some system for reporting incidents independent of the operator that protects both air safety and the employee from fear of lack of job and/or licence.
May I remind the Senate that the letter from which I just quoted is of course from the doctor that the company sent the constituent to. This is the company's choice. The message is loud and clear: fix the problem and stop shooting the messenger.
A letter from National Jet Systems to their employee is an interesting one as well with regard to the question of air cabin safety. It says:
While the quality of cabin air on the BAe 146 aircraft is substantially under control— 
I emphasise the word `substantially'—
I cannot be absolutely certain that the cabin air on this aircraft type will never contain low levels of jet oil contamination. Considering your demonstrated sensitivity—
this is in the letter written to the constituent—
to BAe 146 cabin air contamination and the doctor's professional medical opinion, it is not appropriate to allow you to resume working aboard this aircraft type. I am prepared to offer you employment as a Dash 8 first officer.
How remarkable is that? They recognise that they cannot control the air quality and they have read the doctor's report that does not say that this constituent is unable to fly any 146, but they say they will take him off all 146s and put him on a Dash 8. The letter concludes by saying:
Your rejection of this offer of retraining and redeployment together with your unsuitability for flying duties on BAe 146 aircraft will leave me with little alternative but to reassess your continued employment by National Jet Systems.
In other words, he faces the sack. That is just absolutely and utterly disgraceful. It goes against the medical report and it goes against his ability.
Furthermore, in another letter to another staff member who is now, I might add, a former staff member, they state:
While significant advances have been made in controlling the 146 cabin air quality issue, we cannot confidently and absolutely guarantee that no cabin air contamination will occur while you are on board a 146 aircraft. We are not prepared to risk compromising your health. Accordingly, the 146 flying option is no longer available to you. As a result, you are hereby notified that your employment is terminated due to redundancy of your position. As you are not presently performing any duties, the termination will take effect immediately.
Once again, another person has been ignored by the company, and I would have thought that any company that would make those types of admissions about the quality of the air in the aircraft would have a greater responsibility to their staff and passengers than just to sack or demote the staff who complain. Additionally, the company should be taking heed of the advice by their doctor which finished by saying—and I repeat:
There needs to be some system for reporting incidents, independent of the operator, that protects both air safety and the employee from fear of lack of job and/or licence.
The pilot to whom I refer in this contribution has only last week been medically assessed as perfectly fit for duty and yet he is staring down the barrel of dismissal for having the courage to speak out about an issue that is vitally important to air safety in this country and around the world. He has not spoken publicly, and he does not intend to speak publicly, but he has certainly raised it with all the authorities and the company within his means.
I will finish by quoting two more sentences from the doctor to whom my constituent was sent by his employer:
He has reported several incidents to you and I note those you have included in your requesting letter and the corresponding technical reports of oil leaks and maintenance performed. I also note the consistency with which his reports correlate with documented leaks.
This pilot's courage in attempting to fix a wrong should be commended and acted upon instead of him being suspended or ultimately dismissed. I certainly hope that National Jet Systems will act responsibly in this instance with this particular constituent, but I also hope that they will act responsibly and isolate the issues that are affecting certain BAe146 jet aircraft. Clearly, it is not all of the aircraft—and I do not wish to imply that for one moment—but there are aircraft that have been identified as having a problem. They should be singled out, they should be grounded and they should be fixed—no excuses given. It is not good enough for both crews and passengers to suffer this type of illness. When I read some of this material, I suddenly realised why one day I had been very ill after a flight to Kununurra. I had many of the symptoms that have been described by both Professor Winder and the company doctor. I now can fully understand what the crews are going through and what many passengers go through. We cannot afford to ignore this any longer.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Aviation: Air Safety and Cabin Air Quality</title>,Matters of Public Interest,4,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2002-06-19,"—My question is directed to Senator Hill, Minister for Defence. Would the minister confirm that the party room yesterday directed the cabinet to consider next week reservations or declarations in relation to the International Criminal Court, in addition to a declaration under article 124? Given that the minister has said, and the ICC statute states, that it is the duty of state parties to first prosecute their nationals under their own laws, why is the coalition considering making statements asserting precisely the same interpretation as is already contained in the ICC statute? Given that the reservations are impermissible under article 120 of the statute, would not any reservations or statements of whatever sort be completely superfluous, without effect and mere political posturing?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>International Criminal Court</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question

I notice that Senator Hill has conformed to the Liberal Party style book—when he cannot answer the question he attacks the questioner or smears the Labor Party. I refer him to the question and I wish that, at some point, he would answer it. Is the minister aware that the member for Mackellar, Mrs Bronwyn Bishop, has stated that the ICC has `the power to charge our brave soldiers with genocide just for doing their job'? Is the minister taking Mrs Bishop's concerns seriously?

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2002-06-19,"—It seems to be another open question time on the side of the opposition. Once upon a time, when they aspired to be an alternative government, they actually planned for question time. They developed a theme and a set of questions to develop a particular political argument. Now that they have abandoned that sort of rational approach, they are all allowed to have a go at whatever seems to be of interest to them. Senator Cook, having failed in the trade area and the economic arena—he was the one who told us that the budget was in surplus when it was $10 billion in deficit—is now going to try his hand at international law. So he comes in here today, suggests that there is a misinterpretation of the provisions under the Treaty of Rome and asks how the government could have got it so wrong. As I interpret—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! It is hard for me to hear with so much shouting on my left.
—I could not hear the interjections. There is so much laughter in the chamber; apparently it is a light-hearted day today. The Treaty of Rome—
—Is that your answer?
—Senator Carr has other business at hand; we know all about that. And he is doing pretty well, I understand. The far left is taking over the Victorian division of the Labor Party again.
—The Victorian branch.
—The Victorian branch of the Labor Party. Anyway, Senator Carr, congratulations. I hope you do better than the last lot. As I interpret the provisions, the Treaty of Rome provides that if a country that is a party is unwilling or unable to provide a domestic response it is only in those circumstances that the court will have jurisdiction. If that is the point that Senator Cook was seeking to make in this instance, I would concur with his interpretation.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>International Criminal Court</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-06-19,"—Yesterday, questions were asked of me, Senator Minchin and Senator Coonan regarding AQIS and their contractors. I seek leave to incorporate an answer on behalf of all three ministers, to which is attached an AQIS bulletin. In doing so, I want to stress to the Senate that no individual affected by the retrospective decisions will be disadvantaged.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
This response is to questions that were asked to myself as the Minister representing the Minister for Agricultural, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Minchin, the Minister for Finance and Administration and Senator Coonan, the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue.
The Government absolutely refutes any suggestion that AQIS has sought to avoid its obligations to persons who have accepted engagement under common law contractors as meat inspectors and veterinarians.
At the time of establishing the contractual arrangements for meat inspectors in 1998, AQIS received advice that for general legal purposes and for taxation purposes, these individuals were deemed to be contractors and AQIS considered on that basis that superannuation was not payable. The ATO advises that in 1998 it was not consulted by AQIS in relation to this matter.
It was only in late 2001, that AQIS was given advice from its internal legal advisers that a superannuation liability existed where contractors were principally engaged for their labour. AQIS was not made aware prior to this time that a person could be deemed to be a contractor in some circumstances but an employee in other circumstances such as, for the purposes of superannuation.
AQIS sought advice from the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Finance and Administration on whether liability extended to meat inspector and veterinarian contractors because of the nature of work undertaken on its behalf.
Immediately this confirmation was received, AQIS set about calculating the amounts owed both for the Superannuation Guarantee Levy and as interest on the amount to the 486 persons who had been utilised as contractors.
The amounts owing for the superannuation guarantee liability and as interest are prescribed in the legislation and AQIS is in the process of obtaining independent audit advice of the accuracy of its calculations.
The individuals affected by this retrospective decision have been notified that a backpayment will be lodged with the Australian Government Employees Superannuation Trust early in the next financial year, so they can hardly be described as having been somehow disadvantaged by AQIS's failure to make progressive payments since the contractor arrangements were introduced. 
In 2002-03, for the third consecutive year, AQIS has delivered further savings through efficiency gains and the $2.75m cost of AQIS meeting its retrospective superannuation obligations will be met from this year's savings without recourse to the Federal budget beyond the 40% Government contribution.
AQIS has conceded a misunderstanding on its part and has acted appropriately and responsibly in making good that error. There has been no attempt made to cover up the error or to resile from its responsibilities. The Labor/CPSU allegations floated by various members of the Opposition yesterday are rejected out of hand as nothing more than CPSU bitterness over falling memberships being aired by the union mouthpieces in the Senate.
The use of flexible resourcing arrangements such as the use of contractors is provided for under the Meat Program Agreement negotiated with the CPSU and has been a key plank in the very significant efficiency gains which have delivered huge savings to the Australian meat industry.
For 2002-03 for meat inspectors, AQIS has issued an amended contract offering $29.43 per hour. Of this amount $2.43 will be forwarded to AGEST for investment in an approved fund of the individual's choice.
For veterinarians AQIS has decided that the 9% SGL will be deducted from the existing hourly rate.
AQIS is of the view that these rates will be sufficient to attract the number of common law contract service providers to meet its business needs in a contestable market. Again, it needs to be stressed that these are not employees of AQIS.
In relation to the specific questions asked of Senator Minchin, I advise that the Department of Finance and Administration has indicated that it is not aware of the former Minister or Department providing any advice to AQIS in relation to their decision in 1988. And further, individual Commonwealth agencies are responsible for ensuring they fulfil their obligations under the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1998. However, the Department of Finance and Administration provides Commonwealth agencies with information through their web site, through a help line and also an annual circular to assist them in understanding their obligations under the Act. The annual circular provides information on those persons who are covered by the Act.
I table the AQIS Bulletin dated 23/05/02 sent to every relevant party.
AQIS BULLETIN
MEAT INSPECTION AND VETERINARY CONTRACTORS
Important announcement regarding superannuation Important announcement regarding superannuation
In the course of updating our legal advice about the meat inspection and veterinary contracts late last year, AQIS was informed, for the first time, that it In the course of updating our legal advice about the meat inspection and veterinary contracts late last year, AQIS was informed, for the first time, that it had a the course of updating our legal advice about the meat inspection and veterinary contracts late last year, AQIS was informed, for the first time, that it had a potential liability under the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. Under this legislation certain independent contractors are deemed to be employees for the purposes of the Act. One of the exclusions is an independent contractor who is incorporated.
AQIS has since confirmed its legal advice with the Australian Tax Office and the Department of Finance and Administration. In this process AQIS has been advised that superannuation payments under the Act must be paid to the default fund, despite AQIS having factored a component for superannuation into the hourly rate, which has already been paid direct to all independent contractors.
Importantly, the legal advice has reconfirmed that you remain an independent contractor for general legal purposes and therefore cannot be considered to have employee status for any purpose other than for that of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992.
What does this mean for you with regard to a superannuation entitlement?
As a Commonwealth entity AQIS is obliged to make superannuation payments for you in accordance with rates outlined in the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988. AQIS has now completed all the necessary calculations for the period 1 July 1998 to 31 March 2002 and is currently making arrangements to transfer the total amount owing for the period, including interest, along with a breakdown of each individual's entitlements to the Australian Government Employees Superannuation Trust (AGEST).
AGEST will shortly be writing to you to provide you with details and to also ask you whether you wish to remain with AGEST (the default fund for the purposes of the Act) or to transfer your superannuation entitlement into another approved superannuation fund of your choice.
AGEST has provided a brief overview (attached) of some of the issues you will need to be aware of. 
Please do not contact AQIS or AGEST until you receive the written advice mentioned above. Unfortunately advance information about your entitlement cannot be provided.
What will happen from here on? Two things:
·	AQIS will make a further calculation of the superannuation entitlement from 1 April 2002 to 30 June 2002 (for independent contractors providing services in that period) and subsequently make this payment to AGEST during the course of July 2002;
·	New contracts will be offered in the middle of June 2002 for the 2002/03 financial year with on-going superannuation entitlements built into the package.
Any independent contractor who provided AQIS with meat inspection or veterinary services prior 1 July 1998 will need to contact the Export Manager in their State to provide details of the extent of the payments received for these services. In such instances AQIS will investigate any superannuation entitlement that pre-dates 1 July 1998.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-19,"—Yesterday I was asked a question by Senator Bartlett in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, and I undertook to get further information for the Senate. I seek leave to incorporate that information in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Senator Bartlett asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs on 18 June 2002:
(1)	I draw the Minister's attention to figures produced by the Immigration Department, which show that on 8 April this year 311 people on Nauru and on Manus Island were assessed as refugees. Of those 311,176—well over half—have family already in Australia. How many of these 176 people have been accepted into Australia since that time and how many people, two months after being assessed as refugees and with immediate family in Australia, are still being kept in detention offshore? Will the Minister give a commitment to ensure that these facilities are no longer kept separated and will he immediately enable these refugees to enter Australia?
(2)	I have the figures. I have quoted them to the Minister. They are from his Department. I am asking how much longer the people are going to be kept locked up when they have already been assessed as refugees. I also note that prior to the most recent assessment, 757 out of 1,129 people were assessed as refugees, so a clear majority and a very high percentage of people have been assessed as refugees. How does the Minister justify continuing to detain hundreds of people since they have been assessed as genuine refugees? 
Senator Ellison—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
Australia and the UNHCR are working together to determine the refugee status of asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus island. Of 340 asylum seekers on Manus and of 1,095 on Nauru, total 1,435, a total of 479 have been determined as refugees (226 on Manus and 253 on Nauru) as at 18 June 2002. More decisions are expected to be handed down in Nauru today.
The Government, at both Ministerial and senior officer levels, and UNHCR are in discussion with resettlement countries, seeking resettlement outcomes for those found to be refugees. As in any such situation around the world, these processes take time. To date, New Zealand has resettled 59 from Nauru. Canadian representatives visited Nauru recently to assess a number of cases. Australia will take its fair share and Australian processing for resettlement is under way, including verification of claimed family links. Already 12 refugees are in Australia. More will come to Australia progressively as processing continues.
Pending resettlement, refugees are being cared for by the International Organisation for Migration, which is internationally recognised for its care of refugees and asylum seekers.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Immigration: Refugees</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,speech

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2002-06-19,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to a question without notice asked by Senator Cook today relating to the International Criminal Court.
The Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, answered my question about the statement attributed to the member for Mackellar, Mrs Bronwyn Bishop, that the International Criminal Court has `the power to charge our brave soldiers with genocide just for doing their job' by in effect saying that, no, that was not true. I am gratified to see that the leader of the government in this chamber is prepared to put clearly on the record that this statement—on this occasion attributed to the member for Mackellar but typical of what I regard as a lot of right-wing, loopy criticism of the International Criminal Court—is in fact untrue. There is a campaign to demonise the court and to misrepresent its function, and that is partly to embarrass, it would seem, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General. The fact that the Leader of the Government in the Senate is prepared to put the lie to those rumours is appreciated by the opposition. 
We in the opposition support the ratification of the statute for the establishment of the International Criminal Court. The International Criminal Court is designed to deal with three heinous crimes: crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Those crimes, taken together, since World War II are responsible for 170 million casualties in the 250-plus conflicts that have occurred in the years since the end of the Second World War. There is a real problem in the world that has to be addressed globally, and there is a need for a court of this nature. The Minister for Foreign Affairs played a role in helping to establish it, with the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in 1998, and has proselytised around the world. There is a real need for this court, and it should be adopted.
In taking note of that answer, it would be easy for me to make a speech criticising the government for disarray and division in their own ranks over what should be done about this court, criticising the Prime Minister for temporising and for failing to show the leadership that a Prime Minister of this nation should show on such an important matter and pointing to the divisions within the coalition. The National Party apparently en bloc has one view—although that is not now confirmed—and there are deep, riven divisions within the Liberal Party itself. But I will not stoop to that, because there is a wider and more serious question.
The International Criminal Court is something that the Australian Labor Party, and I believe other parties in this chamber, support. If the government put the legislation before us, we will vote for it, and we will then have an international process through which the crimes to which I have referred can be properly addressed. It is in Australia's national interest that we be a foundation participant in the establishment of this court and that we do that forthwith and before 1 July. If we do that then we will have some say in how the court is structured and set up, and that is important because of this country's proud record in international human rights— a record that we need to continue. It is important, too, because the Australian government—with our support—have said around the world that they support this court. To not now proceed would be to humiliate the public and internationally respected position taken by the government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, and supported by the Attorney-General.
When the Minister for Defence, the leader of the government in this chamber, indicates that the malicious rumour mongering from the loopy right—the sort of thing that has been put around to demonise this court—is not true, we appreciate that candour and that directness. The wrong thing now would be for this division within the government ranks to be papered over by some weaseling out of the process by invoking some special arrangement under section 124. That would be the wrong thing to do, and I hope the government does not opt to do that.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2002-06-19,"—I rise to respond to Senator Cook in this very late motion—unprecedented, I must say—to take note of answers. The government outright rejects Senator Cook's accusation that there is disarray in the government over this very important and lofty issue— this we do not deny. But he seems to mistake open and proper debate for disarray. That may be the case in the Labor Party—when they debate they are at each other's throats; they hate each other—but we on this side quite openly, quite happily admit to you that there is a very vigorous debate going on in relation to the International Criminal Court, and we are very proud of that debate. It has been going on over several joint party meetings. There is nothing unusual about that at all. 
But I will tell you something about this side of the parliament that does not happen on the other side of the parliament. When we sign up to a treaty we do not, in the depths of night, sign treaties like you did when you were in government. If I remember the last treaty signed by your side of the parliament it was when Paul Keating signed, in the middle of the night, with the Indonesian government—no less than that dictatorship of President Suharto—a defence agreement which not even his own foreign minister knew about. That was a treaty that that Prime Minister signed us up to—no accountability to the people, no accountability to the parliament, no accountability to his own cabinet. That is how you sign up your international agreements; that is your record and form.
We on this side quite happily have an open and vigorous debate before we sign up to any treaty or agreement, because we happen to hold with great value the sovereign rights of this country. We just do not jump into international agreements, as you would have us do. Was it not this government that brought to the parliament the accountability of the hundreds, if not thousands, of international treaties you signed up to without accountability when you were in government? This government introduced accountability to the parliament by way of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. I happen to be a member of that treaties committee and I know that for 18 months we have been scrutinising the pros and cons of the International Criminal Court. And so we should.
Would you have us just rush in and sign any agreement according to the United Nations? We place them under the dutiful scrutiny that they absolutely deserve, unlike you who, when you were in government, signed hundreds, if not thousands, of agreements with no accountability. Your own Prime Minister signed up to perhaps one of the biggest agreements this country was ever committed to, in relation to a defence agreement with the then dictatorship of Indonesia, which of course fell apart the day that you lost office. It had absolutely no credibility at all. The International Criminal Court is worthy of debate, as I said.
—Do you support it?
—I can tell you, as your interjections would have it, the National Party believe that we should not rush in and sign the agreement. The National Party do not support wholeheartedly the signing up for the International Criminal Court. But this is a whole of government decision on which, in good time, in good debate, we will come to an agreement. We are not going to rush into it, as you may well have noticed. There are international pressures, as we are told, to sign up quickly so we may have an influence on the appointment of the judges. These are influences that ultimately do not force us to make a decision any more ahead of time than need be. So, unlike you, we see this as a matter of debate, not a matter of division. If you want to talk about division, time is against me but I would love to be able to spend a bit of time—and as the week unfolds I will—on the divisions on your side of the parliament with regard to your own factions and policies in Victoria no less.
We in the government have brought accountability to the agreements and to the treaties that governments must sign up to. They inevitably lead to debates on the pros and cons. And there is absolutely no reason or purpose to rush into agreeing to the International Criminal Court.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>International Criminal Court</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2002-06-19,"—It is clear that on the other side there is some considerable debate about this statute and whether or not this country ought to adopt it. What does this statute do? It punishes people; it does not punish countries, it punishes individual people who, for example, commit crimes against humanity. And what is a crime against humanity? Article 7 tells you what a crime against humanity is. It is a crime that consists of: 
(a) Murder; 
(b) Extermination; 
(c) Enslavement; 
(d) Deportation or forcible transfer of population; 
(e) Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law;
(f) torture;
(g) Rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity ...
and it goes on. What I want to know is: what is it about those sorts of crimes that the other side has concerns about? We on this side of the chamber want to punish people who murder or exterminate or enslave or rape or enforce prostitution on people. We want to do something about that, and we will. And it would be helpful to know what it is about this statute that plans to punish these sorts of things that has the other side concerned. 
Let us make this clear. This statute deals with individuals and it says to states that sign up to it, `You punish your individuals, you put your people on trial for these things, and if you do not—and if you have signed up for this treaty—we will.' It is not only Australians that that might happen to; it happens to people who do these things to Australians. If an Australian is overseas, travelling around the world, and is murdered, enslaved or raped, this statute is a means whereby he or she can be vindicated on an international basis by a court, in circumstances where the country in which they have become a victim of crime does not move to do something about it. In a world where there are more people travelling around from country to country, where more and more there is international trade and international contact, should we not take on board a statute which gives protection to our own people?
We gain a lot by international agreements. I have in front of me a booklet dealing with an inquiry into Australia's relationship with the World Trade Organisation. I think people in this chamber would agree with the World Trade Organisation. I see Senator Minchin there, a man who has done much for the economy and for the trade of this nation, and he would be a person who would support the World Trade Organisation. I would expect him, likewise, to support Australia's signing of the statute of Rome.
—That sounds like something the Vatican would put out.
—You talk about the Vatican, Senator McGauran; this is the sort of thing that the Vatican would certainly support. You ought to think very seriously about that, Senator McGauran. You find yourself in circumstances where His Holiness might well take a different point of view. This is a matter I would have thought that people of good conscience would be quick to sign up with. It is something our international partners have already signed up with. It is a statute that we had a great deal to do with and that we were in full support of until very recently. It is wrong to raise the expectation of the world just to dash that expectation simply because of some internal political problems.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>International Criminal Court</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-06-19,"—I find it quite concerning to hear the responses from the other side of the chamber because their track record on treaties and treaty signing is not a good one. They have a history. The evidence on the books says that they have signed these treaties willy-nilly.
—What is the evidence?
—There is heaps of evidence in the 1980s and 1990s. Mr Keating and Mr Brereton, prior to a particular federal election, signed up to an International Labour Organisation treaty and, after that election, as a result of their so-called obligations under that particular treaty, then tried to bring in some of Labor's industrial relations laws which have been very constraining to the Australian work force. That treaty was signed in the middle of the night without any accountability. The type of thing that we are demonstrating on this side of the house is the characteristic of caution. I applaud this side of the house for expressing that characteristic. 
I will share some of the concerns I have about the International Criminal Court and the ratification of that treaty. In this house we all have an abhorrence of war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is a matter of how you express that abhorrence for those crimes. There are those who use the argument that the statute binds a nonparty state— that whether you have signed up or not, it does make Australians subject to that particular treaty. It is not an adequate argument to say, `We are going to be subject to it anyway.' My philosophy would be that in Australia we should be, and we are, authors of our own destiny and we should stand strong in that regard. One of the major concerns they have in the United States is that a nonparty state can be bound by the treaty. Let me refer to the Vienna convention. Article 34 of the Vienna convention says that a treaty cannot violate the rights of a third-party state without consent. It requires the consent of a third-party state, so how can it actually purport to bind a third-party state without its consent? That is a good reason to express serious concern.  
We have a rigorous and functional legal system in this country which is the envy of the world. I am very proud of our legal system and I think it is tremendous that Australians can be judged by Australian law and by Australians. In this country, sovereignty was established under the Australia Act 1986. We did away with appeals to the Privy Council and we gained very important sovereignty at that time. So the statute is a concern in that it really is an anathema to the legal principles we hold dear. It is also a worrying precedent. If it is signed and it is binding on a nonparty or a third party, then what sort of precedent are we setting for the future?
A reference was made from the other side regarding the definitions of the treaty. I am concerned and I express caution about some of the definitions and their vagueness, specifically the definition regarding genocide and another definition regarding crimes against humanity. Article 7(1)(k) says:
Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing ... serious injury to ... mental ... health ...
Exactly what does that mean? I also refer to the Rome statute, war crimes article 8(2)(b)(iv). If you read this in a certain way, this may actually require an environmental impact study prior to going to war. What a curious requirement that would be. It reads:
Intentionally launching an attack in the knowledge that such attack will cause ... widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment which would be clearly excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated ...
How would you judge past experience in that regard with, let us say, Hiroshima or the Dam Busters?
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. The time for the debate has expired.
 (Senator Bartlett)—Thank you for bringing that to my attention. ",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>International Criminal Court</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1,speech
"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2002-06-19,"—Perhaps I might answer the question that the honourable senator was posing. This treaty has no retrospective effect at all. It will come into force on 1 July this year, and if Australia signs up to it that is when its effect will begin here. For all the crimes that have been committed over the years for which people have never been brought to account—and many are mentioned in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties: the genocide, the ethnic cleansing, the crimes against humanity that have been committed in countries such as the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Cambodia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Iraq, Liberia, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Burundi and East Timor—there will be no retrospective effect of this treaty. This treaty will have no retrospective effect against the perpetrators of those crimes. Those perpetrators are wandering free around the world, some of them living in great luxury, but there has been nothing available to bring them to justice.
—Who in Guatemala?
—I am a great believer in the parliamentary system. I am going to give you an accolade, Senator McGauran, so you ought to sit down in your proper seat in order to receive it properly. I am a great believer in the parliamentary committee system. I am aware that the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties have examined this particular treaty. As Senator McGauran said in his contribution earlier, they spent a considerable time in examining the treaty, its provisions and the public evidence from people right around Australia. 
The joint treaties committee is a great committee. Two Western Australians lead the committee: Ms Bishop and Mr Kim Wilkie. They are the chair and deputy chair. It is a committee that is not particularly balanced: there are nine government members on the committee but only six Labor Party people and one Democrat. The committee members put in a unanimous report, which is a bit odd when you hear some of the comments that are being made now by representatives from the other side, some of whom are coming out opposing the provisions. While it was a unanimous report, there was a reservation put in signed by five individuals—five of the 16. They did not oppose any of the recommendations, but they put in reservations. The five individuals were Mr Kerry Bartlett, Mr Steven Ciobo, Senator Brett Mason, Senator Tsebin Tchen and, lo and behold, Senator Julian McGauran. What has gone wrong between the deliberations on the report and the National Party meeting room? I bet Senator Minchin, who is in the chamber, is very keen to find out what is going on here. Senator Minchin would want the National Party meeting together with the Liberal Party as part of the Liberal Party. You ought to do that. You are at the beck and call of the Liberal Party in any case.
Now let us get really serious on this. One of the very important questions addressed by Senator Cook during question time—which, for a change, he did get a response on from the minister—was on the matter of whether or not there was any truth in the allegations made by the member for Mackellar, Mrs Bishop, when she stated that the ICC had the power to charge our brave soldiers with genocide just for doing their job. The Minister for Defence, thankfully, put that allegation to bed. I hope it will never be resurrected again. 
At page 91 of the report, the committee go into some detail on this very vexed question of what would happen with the ADF personnel. The committee note that they were reassured by advice that, at the highest ranks of the Australian Defence Force, there is support for the establishment of the ICC. At the conclusion of this section, they say:
In the committee's view, the risk of false charges would be no greater following the establishment of the ICC than it is at present.
I commend the report of the committee to the Senate and to the other place. But, importantly, I commend it to the cabinet. If it is going to be a wider cabinet, including the outer ministry, I commend it to them. Hopefully, we will get a positive decision coming out of cabinet—coming out of at least the government party room, which will be the party room of the Liberals, tagging on the Nationals behind them—so that we will sign up to the ICC next week. By doing that before 2 July, Australia can be a full member.
We have heard mention of the Vatican but we have not had mention of the Bishops Conference. There is a real need for a Bishops Conference on this matter. (Time expired)

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2002-06-19,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
As Deputy Chair of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee that considered the submissions and evidence given during the committee's inquiry into the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002, I would like on behalf of the minority report to summarise some of the points made in that. Labor senators believe that passage of this bill would lead to a dramatic further concentration of ownership in the Australian media industry. A plausible outcome of the passage of this bill is Australia ending up with as few as three main commercial media companies, which is as many free-to-air networks as are currently permitted. This bill, in our view, shows a complete absence of any long-term planning for the media industry that could deliver social as well as economic benefits to the community, just short-term gains for the existing media giants. Until an openly competitive market is established with new free-to-air television entrants allowed in to compete against the existing players and new opportunities such as data casting and multichanneling introduced, the cross-media restrictions in our view should stay. 
As it stands we believe this bill would lead to less competition in the media industry—not more. At present the ACCC has no capacity to deal with cross-media mergers and acquisitions. As it stands, interestingly, in the evidence it was established that there was nothing the ACCC could do to stop a merger between Telstra, the Nine Network, Fairfax, Radio 2UE and Nova. We know this because Labor senators put this scenario to Professor Fels and he said—and I quote directly from the evidence:
... it might well be quite okay under the Trade Practices Act.
This was an admission that we sought to clarify later in the hearings and was in fact confirmed. Two years ago the Productivity Commission recommended a media-specific public interest test as a key instrument for ensuring greater competition. That this bill does not include this test as part of the proposed new regime shows how weak the government's commitment to competition in the media industry really is.
The big media companies do not want real competition, and government policy appears to be disposed to helping them maintain their dominance in the media industry. Why else would the government be trying to get this bill passed? It has already failed several times. On any reasonable and rational examination of the issue, abandoning the cross-media restrictions is media monopoly madness. The government does not appear to care about Australian values of diversity and localism or the free flow of information and different opinions. They want to auction these off to their media mates. There is no public benefit or public interest test that would result from this bill, but it is a certainty, in our view, that this bill would mean less media diversity in Australia. Regional Australia would be particularly at risk as smaller media operations get swallowed up by the big metropolitan media companies.
The evidence presented to the committee was overwhelmingly against the passage of this bill except from the major media companies themselves. Consequently Labor senators, joined by the Democrats, find that they cannot agree with either the arguments or the recommendations contained in the chair's report. It is of particular note that recommendation 3 of the chair's report is to retain a version of the cross-media laws for regional media only. This recommendation seeks to create a new dual system of regulation for media ownership in Australia and suggests a whole new set of problems that have not properly been considered in our view. Our belief is this recommendation would add enormous complications to the already complicated regulatory regime proposed in this bill.
This recommendation also openly acknowledges what Minister Alston pretends is not true—that is, there will be further concentration of media ownership if the bill is passed. Government senators who read the submissions, heard the evidence and questioned the witnesses from regional media companies have blinked on this issue. Under the bill as it stands, some regional towns could see their major newspaper, radio station and television station fall into the hands of one owner. This cannot be in the interests of regional Australians—and it is not. Labor senators believe that if regional media warrant protection against media monoliths so does the rest of Australia. 
This bill also contains provisions that would require some regional broadcasters to provide local news services. While Labor senators recognise the attempts by the government to maintain local news services in regional Australia, the mechanism by which the government proposes to achieve this is an inconsistent and inequitable instrument that applies only to cross-media owners. Further, in our view it pre-empts the findings of a thorough inquiry into the issue that is currently being conducted by the ABA. Recommendation 2 of the chair's report recognises these problems but in our view proposes an ad hoc solution that further complicates the mechanisms of the bill. The more reasoned and sensible approach, preferred by Labor senators, is to recognise that regional news obligations are an entirely separate issue from cross-media ownership and require a separate solution.
Labor senators believe that the profit-making imperative of a large media company seeking to maximise cost-effectiveness and other synergies would not be circumvented by the superficial and unworkable editorial separation regime that the bill proposes as a condition of the exemption certificates. Many witnesses who presented evidence to the inquiry took particular issue with the government's editorial separation proposal. In fact, almost no submissions proposed this move. Fairfax even suggested that the government could find itself facing a constitutional challenge, as this provision allows government intrusion into the print media while the constitution only allows for regulation of the broadcasting media.
Some highly astute witnesses could not get past the fact that Professor Flint would be the watchdog guarding the media companies on this measure. Their scepticism may well have something to do with his record in the `cash for comment' scandal, where the ABA was found wanting in maintaining the rules under another self-regulatory regime. Professor Flint is a strong critic of the cross-media laws, yet he is the person the government has suggested should preside over the issue of exemption certificates which would enable media mergers to take place. The editorial separation proposal is unworkable, conceptually flawed and highly impractical. That is why Labor senators do not believe this measure would ensure media industry competition or maintain diversity between media companies which have merged.
The government believes that the advent of some forms of technology for delivering media content means the dominance of traditional technology is over. In our view, this is premature to say the least. Labor senators reject the argument that new technologies are delivering diversity so great that they make the current cross-media restrictions outdated or redundant. The Internet and pay TV have provided new platforms for the existing mass media but have not led to any new players in daily news production. Economies of scale will ensure that this remains the case. The existing mass media can transfer their content to the new media at marginal cost, whereas a new player would require massive capital. The lack of revenue associated with new media will also discourage new providers.
Labor senators believe that reliance on arguments about new technology also wrongly ignores the issue of content. Technology, new or traditional, is irrelevant in ensuring diversity if that content originates from the same source. The major new technology now frequently used for information on news and current affairs is the Internet. However, market analysis shows that the most popular web sites are those dominated by major media organisations, such as PBL's ninemsm, Fairfax's F2 and the ABC's abc.net.au. This argument also ignores the fact that, according to a 2001 ABA study, 88 per cent of people still use free-to-air TV as their primary source of news. This same study found that 76 per cent use radio, 76 per cent use newspapers, 10 per cent use pay TV and only 11 per cent currently use the Internet.
The objective of the cross-media rules is to ensure that the Australian population has access to a diversity of readily available sources of information on the daily developments in Australian society. Only the daily newspapers, free-to-air TV and radio—the `mass media'—fulfil this role. That is why the cross-media rules only apply to these platforms. Labor senators believe that diversity is about many different voices expressing many different points of view. ",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002</title>,"<title>Report of Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee</title>",Bills,21,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2002-06-19,"—I speak as Chair of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee to the report on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002, which was tabled out of session last night. The committee received 40 submissions, and public hearings were held in Canberra on 21 and 22 May. The committee—that is, the majority of the committee—is of the view that there is a need for reform of Australia's outdated media ownership laws. The committee accepts that the present restrictions on ownership have limited opportunities to exploit economies of scale and scope and have encouraged the creation of new financial instruments and other arrangements to avoid the regulations. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the bill be agreed to, subject to four recommendations.
The committee has been persuaded of the benefits to media companies, advertisers and consumers that would result from lifting restrictions on foreign ownership, bearing in mind that foreign investment in the media will be regulated under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 and Australia's general foreign investment policy. It considers that the repeal of restrictions will provide opportunities for access to global capital, resources and expertise for Australian companies as well as possibilities for Australian expertise to be promoted and advanced internationally. As for fears that an increase in foreign ownership will lead to less local content, the committee notes that Australian audiences have shown a marked preference for locally produced programs. There is therefore a commercial imperative for broadcasters to include Australian content. Furthermore, it is crucial to note that this bill will in no way alter the existing Australian content rules. Therefore, the committee considers that concerns about a diminution of locally produced programming should this bill proceed are unfounded.
Schedule (2) of the bill relates to the cross-media rules. The bill does not abolish the cross-media rules but, instead, proposes the granting of exemption certificates subject to the application of a public interest test administered by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. The committee believes that reforming cross-media ownership in this manner will permit the generation of synergies, allowing for a more efficient industry with enhanced economies of scale, which will ensure better quality and more diverse content for consumers. 
There has been considerable attention focussed on the question of the need for a broad based public interest test. In considering the need for a broad based, media specific, public interest test, the committee posed the question of what would such a test, if introduced, seek to achieve. The committee concluded that such a test would, firstly, need to maintain diversity of ownership and opinion in the media as well as preserve Australian content at levels acceptable to the community. Having established these objectives, consideration was then given to what the situation in the media would be if this bill became law and whether or not there was any specific threat to the protection of public interest in terms of these objectives. 
The committee concluded that the public interest is protected by the editorial separation requirements administered by the ABA, the preservation of the concentration rules and the retention of the rules regarding Australian content, and that a broad based, media specific, public interest test is thus not required. More importantly, in the light of all the evidence, the committee is of the view that the actual impact of the changes proposed in the bill to the regulation of cross-media ownership will not be great—in fact, we feel the impact will be very small. The outcome will be that around 90 per cent of Australians will continue to have access to three commercial television channels plus the national broadcasters and, as well, there will continue to be a diversity of radio and press.
The recent A.T. Kearney study into media ownership restrictions in Australia found that even in the extreme case of consolidation of ownership into a single company of the dominant newspaper, television and radio groups currently owned by News Limited, PBL and Austereo, the estimated relative influence of such a company, as measured by the market share of national metropolitan consumption of daily news, would, when averaged, be relatively unchanged. Moreover, such a scenario would also see the maintenance of at least three other major media groups in addition to the national broadcasters, and the percentage reach likely to be achieved by the consolidated company would still be significantly less than the total of that achieved by all other companies. However, the committee believes that it would further protect the public interest if there was a requirement that commercial interests should be disclosed in the context of any article or editorial comment where co-ownership exists under a cross-media exemption, when one co-owned media outlet made editorial comment about another in the same locality. 
Some organisations raised concerns about the editorial separation requirements of the bill, especially that they would allow for undue intrusion into the operations of media companies by the ABA, and facilitate government intrusion into the freedom of the media. The committee is convinced that the ABA will act both responsibly and appropriately in administering the editorial separation requirements. It rejects the view that these requirements will be the thin end of the wedge in facilitating government intrusion into the freedom of the media, and I add that, of course, the government already has the power to regulate newspaper organisations under the Corporations Law. 
The committee acknowledges the special problems faced by regional media—in particular, their higher operating costs and lower revenue base in comparison with their metropolitan counterparts. Regional media companies, for example, often have to operate over very large, sparsely populated areas and, on top of these higher operating costs, have lower advertising revenue than the metropolitan media. In relation to cross-media holdings of regional media and concerns about undue concentration of ownership in regional Australia, the committee recommended that the bill be amended so that, in regional markets, cross-media exemptions only be allowed in relation to proposals that could result in a media company having cross-ownership in only two of the three generic categories of newspapers, radio and television.
In relation to concerns that have been expressed that the local news and information requirements of the bill for regional media, which are the subject of a cross-media exemption, are discriminatory, the committee has recommended that the requirement for provision of local news apply to all media companies operating in regional areas. Further, to encourage regional media to provide local news and information, the committee has recommended that the government investigate the feasibility of providing appropriate incentives for regional media to provide local content, such as licence fee rebates. This would be an appropriate recognition of the higher operating costs and lower revenue base of regional media. 
In conclusion, I would like to use this opportunity to extend my thanks to the staff of the committee secretariat for all of their endeavours throughout this inquiry, and also to those who made submissions and to the members of the committee for their consideration of the issues which came before the committee. I commend this report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002</title>,"<title>Report of Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee</title>",Bills,21,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2002-06-19,"—I will be quick with this speech because I want to speak on the next paper as well and I want us to get up to it before we have to rise. As far as all Democrat senators are concerned—this is not just me; it includes Senator John Cherry, who will be taking over the area of broadcasting from me on 1 July, and everybody else—we consider that the best way to have and maintain diversity in the Australian media sector is to make sure that the cross-media rules are not scrapped and are not changed in the way that this bill wants to change them. We believe that foreign ownership should not be altered at this time. In fact, we think it is something that needs a lot more discussion and a lot more looking at before we even consider it.  
One of the minister's favourite statements about why we should get rid of the cross-media rules is that we should get rid of them because everybody can get a lot more media on their computers, either at home or at work, and that that is what people will be doing in the future, so we do not have to worry about it because there will be huge diversity available on the computer. As part of the dissenting report which was put in by both the Democrats and the Labor Party concurrently, we cited a recent ABA inquiry. I will quote a little from the dissenting report where it refers to the ABA inquiry because I think it is very instructive. The dissenting report said:
The ABA study found that 87.5% of participants reported using television for news and current affairs, while 75.8% used the radio and 75.5% used newspapers. By comparison, only 22.8% of those participants reporting Internet access also reported using it to obtain news and current affairs.
That is about 22.8 per cent of about 60 per cent of Australians, which is way under the number of those who use television, radio and newspapers to get their news and current affairs information. One of the other points we made right at the end of the report which I think it is worth mentioning—I do not think anyone has mentioned it yet—is that we believe a broader inquiry into the media industry would be a good idea at this point. Nobody believes that the cross-media rules that we have at the moment are the best that you can have; absolutely nobody believes that. But I do not believe that this bill goes anywhere near giving us the best rules. In fact, it would give us almost no rules at all; and, for those that it would give us, we had some evidence that they may be found to be unconstitutional. So I believe it is time to have a look at where we want to go on this. It is time to find out what we want to do and how to get there. That would be, of course, a much larger inquiry. 
The final point I make is that one of the best ways of ensuring diversity in media in news and current affairs in this country is to have a strong, well-resourced and vibrant ABC and SBS. Sadly, the ABC is underresourced. I know the minister keeps telling me that it is not, but it is. There is no question that it is. It is vastly underresourced. I think it was $127 million that was taken out by the ALP during its term of office and then $66-point-something million was taken out just in the first year and a half of this government's term of office. Nothing has been returned. More and more things have been required to be done by the ABC and SBS. Digitisation is a requirement on both of them but it is not being adequately resourced at all; it is not being anywhere near adequately resourced. They have to find the money from somewhere.
In a recent newspaper article that the minister wrote about cross-media rules, he made this point:
Since 1987, ABC News Radio has begun providing in-depth coverage of local, national and international news, ... 
Yes, that is right; it has. It has not been given a lot of extra money to do it with; in fact, none. The fact is that News Radio is only available in the capital cities. I understand that it would only cost about $11 million to get News Radio out to the regions to centres of 10,000-plus people. I think that would be money well spent, but the government, I dare say, is not prepared to spend it. So the ABC is vastly underresourced. If anybody wants me to detail that, I can detail it; I am more than happy to do so.
SBS could use a lot more money. SBS have just started up their multichannel in world news, which looks to me to be a very interesting and vibrant channel, but they need more money. They need money to be able to produce in Australia for it. They are getting feeds from all over the world, they are putting that on; that is excellent. But if they want any Australian production, they need money for it. I think the figure that I last heard was $18.6 million, and the government is not going to come up with that either. I hope to goodness they do, but I doubt it very much. I would imagine that they will stay underresourced in that area. I would imagine that the ABC will stay vastly underresourced in just about all areas. I do not know what is in the Macquarie Bank's independent study of how much the ABC would need to actually carry out its charter responsibilities and to digitise properly, but when I added all that money up it ended up at about $200 million extra just to carry out its charter responsibilities. I imagine that the Macquarie Bank report has probably come up with much the same. I do not know if the minister has it yet; I do not even know if the board has it yet. But I think it is something that should eventually be tabled in this chamber and I hope that I can see it. 
The point that I have to make is that the resourcing of the ABC and SBS is not adequate. The resourcing of the ABC is nowhere near adequate for it to fulfil its charter responsibilities and to digitise properly—let alone the archives issue. We could go into the archives and into Radio Australia and Cox Peninsula, but we had better not because I do not have that much time and I want to get on to East Timor; I could mention Cox Peninsula there as well. In conclusion, the Democrats will not be voting for this bill because we do not think it is adequate. If the minister would like to go back and try again, he can; but I cannot imagine anything that he could come up with that we will think is adequate. As far as this bill is concerned, we will not be voting for it.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (MEDIA OWNERSHIP) BILL 2002</title>,"<title>Report of Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee</title>",Bills,21,1,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2002-06-19,"—I also rise to, I think, conclude the debate on the report of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002. Before I start, let me pay tribute to Senator Bourne and her contribution to the media debate in this chamber over many years. We have not always agreed with the things that you have said, particularly relating to the ABC and other matters, Senator Bourne, but you have certainly provided very lively debate in the chamber on these issue, and that has been most welcome. While I am handing out bouquets, let me also hand one to Senator Eggleston, who chaired this inquiry into the bill. We actually moved through the issues in terms of government members examining the issues and the committee examining the issues and it has been a very worthwhile experience for all of us as we consider what is one of the most important issues facing this country as a free democracy; that is, how to regulate and help the free press and media develop in this country.
I want to lay to rest a myth about the whole process of change that is being put forward by the government. People seem to be conducting this debate in a way that would indicate that we are abolishing the cross-media rules. We are not doing any such thing. What we are doing is allowing companies, if this legislation passes, to apply for exemptions from the cross-media rules. The difference is very important, and I would really like to underline that. We are taking a very different approach from a country like New Zealand which 17 years ago abolished regulation in this area and left the whole matter of control to the normal market control mechanism, such as the Trade Practices Act. But in Australia it is very different. We are proposing that on a case by case basis companies can apply to vary the arrangements under the cross-media rules.
We have a slow motion roll-out of change which is in sympathy with the changing nature of media in this country. Unfortunately, if we leave the cross-media laws exactly where they are at the moment, we will be kept in a time warp created by Paul Keating in 1986, but the whole nature of communications, broadcasting and information technology has changed dramatically over that time. We need a more flexible regime to respond to that sort of change.
At the time when the Keating government brought in the cross-media rules they were trying, in the different markets, to separate out control because they were worried about the concentration of opinion and opinion leadership in the media. The way Paul Keating put it was that in a particular market, such as Sydney, a company could be the `prince of print' or the `queen of screen'. In other words, you could not control newspapers and TV in the one market. Although that might have been appropriate for 1986, by the time we got to 1996, when this government came into power, this whole regime was no longer really tenable. What we have been grappling with in the first stages of the Howard government is: how do we respond to the rapid changes?  
I will give one example. When the Keating government brought in this legislation, there was no Internet; the Internet did not exist. We also did not have pay TV. So we now have a greater diversity of mediums. We also have greater diversity of ownership. As this medium develops in a much more dynamic way over time, it is going to be increasingly difficult for people not only to concentrate ownership but also to concentrate the opinion leadership through the press. I would like to make that very basic point because the time for this debate is almost up. This point has not been made. We are not abolishing cross-media laws; we are just modifying them.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2002-06-19,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian Official Observer Delegation to the 2002 presidential election in East Timor, which took place from 12 to 15 April 2002. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted. 
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The Australian Official Observer Delegation, which I had the great honour of leading, visited East Timor from 12 to 15 April this year to observe the 14 April presidential election. The delegation observed voting at eight polling centres in the district of Bobonaro, which adjoins the border with West Timor, Indonesia. We also observed the start of counting in Dili. Over a relatively brief period of time, we had the opportunity to speak with a broad range of international and national observers and party agents in both the Bobonaro district and Dili.
Our role, from the Australian perspective, was to ensure that the election was free, fair and transparent—an assessment which we were able to make from our observations. It was run in a very efficient and orderly manner by the Independent Electoral Commission. Their preparation for this election rectified some minor deficiencies of the 2001 vote, in particular the very long voter queues. The time spent waiting to vote was significantly shortened from that of 2001.
Of enormous significance was that this was the first election where East Timorese electoral officials had a majority hand in managing the ballot. The process ran more smoothly and with fewer procedural errors than it had during 2001. I think that that augurs well for the conduct of elections in an independent East Timor. This was a ballot conducted without a new voter or civil registration process. Records of newly recorded citizens, including first-time voters, and any amendments to the civil register were made at the instigation of individual East Timorese people, and with the encouragement of the UNDP voter education campaign. 
In the 1999 popular consultation, the ballot of 2001 and this ballot, three different approaches have been utilised to develop and maintain an electoral roll. In this report, the delegation observes that it will be vital for the effective operation of future ballots and for the maintenance of an accurate electoral roll that the system is refined, and one method of establishing and maintaining a roll is settled upon. The next ballot will not occur for five years so East Timorese polling officials have the opportunity and should be involved in continuing electoral training and education to maintain their skills.
Voter turnout was very high at 86.2 per cent. The campaign period and the election itself were peaceful. That is further testimony to the importance that the East Timorese people placed on their participation in the democratic process. In our report, and on a personal note, I think it is important that the delegation congratulates the East Timorese people for the exemplary manner in which they undertook this final electoral step in advance of independence on 20 May 2002.
We made two recommendations in the report of the delegation. The first was that Australia continues to provide assistance to East Timor to strengthen democratic institutions and electoral processes, in particular through continuing training programs by the Australian Electoral Commission and in support for UN and UNDP civic education programs. We also recommended that the Australian parliament move quickly to establish an Australia-East Timor parliamentary friendship group. I am acutely aware that, as I speak, the annual general meeting of the IPU is considering that very matter, and I suspect that Senator Bourne and I would be there were we not here. We do hope that that is a recommendation taken up by the IPU. 
This is the third ballot in East Timor in which I have participated in a very small way as an observer. Beginning with the UN-supervised ballot of 1999, the popular consultation, where the East Timorese voters delivered an overwhelming vote, rejecting the option of special autonomy and supporting independence, moving to the ballot in 2001 to elect their first constituent assembly and then coming to the election of the president with the ballot in April of this year. These have been very important and extraordinary experiences and opportunities in many ways for me as a member of this Senate. 
In going to the Bobinaro district of East Timor in particular, I was again observing a ballot for the third time in that particular area. It is impossible to describe, in the time available to me this afternoon, the changes in that district, in those people and in the approach they have taken to participating in the democratic process that I have seen between 1999, 2001 and 2002. Suffice it to say, they have been all positive—all moving towards maximising the involvement of the East Timorese people in the process, all moving towards a free, fair and transparent election process and achieving that on every count and all ensuring a good solid foundation for the democratic future of this tiny nation.
In 2002, the International Electoral Commission ran 282 polling centres. To actually see the East Timorese in those centres carrying out the electoral work themselves was a very significant change, and a very welcome one from previous ballots. In the opportunity that we had to inspect polling booths, polling centres, and to meet with local officials and discuss the arrangements for the ballot we received universally positive responses from local people in relation to the entire process.
I place on record the very important contribution of the Australian Electoral Commission to that process and of Mr Michael Maley, in particular. To see an educational video on electoral training put together by the work of the AEC and Mr Maley, and to see the enthusiasm of the East Timorese participating in that video, was not just a heartwarming experience but an enormously reassuring one for where the processes might go from here. 
There are some people that it is very important for me to thank in this brief series of remarks. This was a campaign period and an election itself which can only be described as peaceful. A lot of the credit for that, most of credit for that, goes to the East Timorese people themselves, but also to the international civilian police in place in East Timor, including many Australians, members of the Australian Federal Police and the various state services. To UNPOL and the East Timor police service itself, a growing organisation, we place on record our thanks and appreciation of their work. 
I particularly want to thank Australia's first ambassador to East Timor, James Batley. I first met James in 1999 in what can only be described as very challenging circumstances. Since that time, he has represented our nation in an exceptional manner in his capacity as head of the mission in East Timor, and his appointment as Australia's first ambassador was highly meritorious and well-deserved. I am very pleased to have had the honour of working with him. On this most recent visit, I also want to thank his deputy, Mr John Michell, and a representative of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Alan Sweetman, who accompanied us and also made enormous efforts to assist us with translating and interpreting some of the more difficult conversations that one has.
I want to thank the members of the Australian Defence Force who supported not only this process, but the previous ballot in 2001. I want to thank Lieutenant Colonel Angus Campbell, CO of AUSBATT at the time, who ensured that he and his troops looked after us in an exemplary manner, including accommodating us in Maliana in their own facilities which was extremely generous of them. I want to thank and commend Lieutenant Phil Hickey who was responsible for compiling an extraordinarily comprehensive program for the delegation on both the day prior to and the day of polling.  
One of the highlights of having been involved in this process since 1999—and my involvement is a mere drop in the ocean compared with that of my colleague Senator Bourne—was to see Australia welcome the newly elected president of East Timor to our parliament this week, to see President Xanana Gusmao welcomed here. That is a fitting beginning to the rest of East Timor's future from the Australian parliamentary perspective, and I was very honoured to have the opportunity to meet him here again this week.
I want to thank my parliamentary colleagues who accompanied us on this delegation, Senator McLucas, who is in the chamber and Mr Hartsuyker, the member for Cowper from the other place. From previous delegations, I also want to be able to acknowledge Mr Fischer. Without some of the work that he had done previously, this would not have been as successful as it was. 
In closing I want to thank and acknowledge my friend and colleague, Senator Vicki Bourne, not only for her professional support in this delegation and the two preceding delegations, but for her friendship and for her moral support in what has at times, since we began this process in 1999, had its difficult moments. Without that friendship and moral support, it would have been so much more difficult. Australia can be rightly proud of the small role that we have played in this electoral process, but the East Timorese can be exceptionally proud of the decisions they have made and the roles they have carried out themselves.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Delegation to East Timor</title>,Delegation Reports,22,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2002-06-19,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, through you, let me thank Senator Payne for her very kind words. Senator Payne has mentioned most of the aspects of the report of the Australian Official Observer Delegation to the 2002 Presidential election in East Timor which need to be mentioned. I would like to reiterate in particular her thanks to our first ambassador to East Timor, James Batley, who was the head of mission there from the time we set up that mission in 1999 and stayed on until after East Timor became a nation, so he became our first ambassador. I think that is a very just way to finish the cycle of his participation in what was a very tumultuous, essential and interesting part of East Timor's history—probably the most interesting, the most essential and the best part so far of East Timor's history. Also, Senator Payne mentioned Michael Maley, who is a very important part of that history. He has been very considerably involved in the electoral process in East Timor since 1999 and he deserves far more recognition than we can give him, and probably far more recognition than he is going to get, for his part in bringing East Timor to the place where it is now.
Mostly, the people to acknowledge and to thank for their strength and their bravery are, of course, the East Timorese people. The strength and bravery that was shown by these people in 1999 is just so spectacular that it is really hard to think of it without bursting into tears—as I am going to do again! And if you have read Tim Fischer's book you will realise that is what I did all through 1999: burst into tears constantly. But it was just the most spectacular thing to be there and to see these people who in 1999 knew what would happen to them. Everybody told us what would happen to them, and it did. But they were so keen, they were so desperate to own their country and to get rid of the blight on it, which had particularly been the actions of Kopassus in East Timor, that they just said, `Right, we will put up with anything.' And they did. They put up with so much more than any of us are ever going to be called on to do, thank heavens. And they came through it.
In the 2001 election, there were real differences. Senator Payne and I had gone back just after the destruction in 1999. We went back in December 1999 and the place was such a wreck. It was burnt out; there were no roofs. We came in by helicopter to Suai, in the south of the island, and there was not a roof on any buildings at all except the ones that were being used by the Australian or the New Zealand battalions. 
Now it is so different, so alive. We watched the markets go from five buildings, where the old Portuguese markets were, to a huge conglomeration of a market on the same site. Now the markets are out somewhere else; they are just too big to be there. And that market building has been turned, as an independence gift from Australia, into an exhibition centre. I think it is a very worthwhile gift, something that we can all be very proud of. It looks fantastic now; it looks excellent. The market started as five little booths of people who were really quite scared of what was going on around them— and who could blame them; so was I—and has turned into a huge mass of people and makeshift buildings. You would not believe how many things you could buy there, from baby formula to socks with frilly lace around them, to vegetables and meat, from the butcher shop in the middle—as if you would put it in the middle but they did. It was extraordinary—I saw Lego there too. So you could get anything in those markets. And the difference was just mammoth.
I should give a few snapshots of when we were in East Timor this last time. We went out with the Australian Army. This was a first for me; I had not done it before in a ballot. They took us in four-wheel drives to booths that were reasonably remote. I was interested to see how well they were accepted by the East Timorese people and by the international community. The level of acceptance was extraordinary. Without any prompting from us at all, the international community, the people at the polling booths, found out we were Australian and praised our civilian military liaison officers. One person said to me that he thought that they should be giving lessons to everybody else and that they were certainly the most polite—which I thought was remarkable, but excellent.
We need not have worried at all about how well they were accepted by East Timorese people. The officers were not allowed to come any closer than, I think, 200 metres from the polling booth opening, so they would drop us off and we would walk down to the polling booth. We would go and do everything we had to do and come back and try to find them. It was easy to find them because you just had to listen, and where there were children laughing and screaming that is where they were. On one occasion they looked like they were playing water buffalo, with some little girls chasing after them. On another occasion they were playing soccer with some boys. They were obviously completely and utterly accepted. These are people who were in military uniforms and carrying guns. In 1999 that would have been the most terrifying sight any of these children could have seen. Now it is just accepted.
When we went there in 2001, one of the Federal Police officers who was travelling with us pointed out a little girl who was carrying her baby brother. He made the point— and it still sticks in my mind—that the baby brother would never have known the Indonesian rule because he was born after it; he would never have known what it was like to have Kopassus out there and not know whether his family was going to come home that night. It was wonderful to hear that; it was such a wonderful thought. 
I do not want to take up too much time, so in conclusion I would like to thank my parliamentary colleagues, particularly those on this delegation, who were a particularly pleasant bunch to get on with, thank heavens. I thank Senator Payne in particular because, as she says, we have been on three together now. On the first one we were sharing a room. Mind you, it was the best room in East Timor at the time because not only did it have a toilet and a shower but also what they called a mini bar, which was in fact a small fridge, I think probably from World War II. It had the only cold beer on the island at one point and neither of us drinks beer, so we were very popular with other people. It was fun. Who would have thought that would be fun? It was, and so was 2001 and so was this one.
I cannot say how privileged I feel to have been part of these three delegations after I do not know how many years. I think it was in 1978 that I started on about this topic and started getting really stroppy about East Timor and independence, and I have been stroppy ever since! After all those years of wanting to see it, finally seeing it was the most wonderful, wonderful thing. Seeing that flag raised in the independence ceremony— even though it was only on television because I did not get the invitation on my email until it was too late to get a flight—just felt fantastic. I am so pleased, despite the fact that I am leaving next week, that all this has happened while I have been here. 
I would like to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for inviting me to go on this delegation. I would like to thank my own colleagues for letting me go—it was their turn, really, and they let me go. So I would like to thank everybody for allowing me the huge privilege of being at those three ballots for the people of East Timor, and I would like to congratulate the East Timor people again.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Delegation to East Timor</title>,Delegation Reports,22,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2002-06-19,"—I would also like to make some comments at this the tabling of the report of the delegation sent by the Australian government to East Timor to monitor the presidential elections. In doing so, I also pay tribute first of all to the leader of our delegation, Senator Payne, for the lovely and accommodating way that she provided the two of us who had not been to East Timor before with information, advice and support. I commend her for her commitment to the people of East Timor over a long period of time. I also want to commend you, Senator Bourne, for your longstanding commitment to the people of East Timor and for your work on their behalf. I share your joy at the fact that democracy has been installed in East Timor in the time that you have been in the parliament. Thank you for the work that you have done on Australia's behalf to bring us to this point in time. I would also like to thank Mr Hartsuyker from the House of Representatives. I agree with Senator Bourne that we made an interesting—but very happy—group of people doing the job that we did.
I also thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the invitation and my party for their support in allowing me to be part of the delegation to East Timor. It was an honour and a privilege to go to such a new country. For me, it was a first-time trip and therefore I did not have anything to compare it with except the television footage. I have to say that, whilst Senator Payne and Senator Bourne talk about the change that they had witnessed and how wonderful things are, for me it was rather a shock. I have travelled in Third World countries before, I have travelled in countries that have been touched by war but I have not travelled in a country so soon after such horrific events have occurred. It did trouble me for some time afterwards, and I have a special place in my heart as a result of this trip for the people of East Timor, for their commitment and for their eyes-down, let's-get-on-with-it approach to their nation.
I also congratulate the people of East Timor and their leadership for the way they conducted the ballot. They were supported by a range of countries internationally who assisted them to deliver the electoral process on the day. I also commend Mr Michael Maley and all of the officers of the AEC who have been supporting the people of East Timor over the last few years for the very free and open way they have passed on their skills. The training that has obviously been delivered to the people of East Timor certainly by the Australian Electoral Commission, and potentially by others, has been delivered in a sustainable way. Most of the ballot places that we went to were completely managed by East Timorese. They were efficient, courteous and very effective. They knew their role exactly, and they knew our role. I have to commend everyone for the way the ballot was operated.
For someone like me, in my first experience in this situation, I could see trepidation on people's faces. This was the third time they had been through a ballot in a very short period of time. I expected more joy, but the very recent history of the people of East Timor going through an electoral process must have been in all those people's minds as they walked in to vote. We went to eight polling places, and at each place the ballot was conducted properly. People did go early. In all the places we went to polling was pretty well finished by 11 o'clock in the morning—it opened at seven—and there were very few people who voted later in the afternoon. In the one place that we did go where there was a queue, I remember the people pressed up against each other, very keen to get in and have their vote. 
As Senator Payne mentioned, the people conducting the ballot decided that they would not use a formal electoral roll because of the difficulties in maintaining that roll. The system that was adopted was perfectly legitimate. People went to vote and then their right index finger was placed in ink that could not be removed. A number of times we saw people walking in the street with that finger up, as a sign of `Yes, I've been to vote.' That was a positive event.
I also thank Mr James Batley and congratulate him on his appointment to the position of first ambassador to the newest nation in the world. I thank him for his assistance in making our trip easy. It must be difficult to organise a trip for four parliamentarians. There were no hitches at all, and I thank him for that. I also thank him for his hospitality and for putting on drinks for us on the Friday night that we arrived there so that we could meet with both East Timorese and Australians working in East Timor. I also thank the Australian battalion, particularly Lieutenant Colonel Angus Campbell for his hospitality. We stayed with the battalion at Maliana. As Senator Payne said, Lieutenant Phil Hickey was a wonderful host. It was a privilege to be there. I was also very fortunate in that many of the personnel who were in Maliana at the time were based at Lavarack Barracks in Townsville. It was interesting to sit down and read the Townsville Daily Bulletin with them—something that I do every day when I am at home.
I congratulate President Xanana Gusmao. It was wonderful that he was here in Australia this week. The election result was outstanding. There is certainly strong support for him and for democracy in East Timor. I wish him best wishes for the next five years of his presidency. Finally, I thank Senator Payne and Senator Bourne for their commitment to this new nation.

"Brown, Senator Bob",AG,2002-06-19,"—I move:
	(1)	That the Christmas Island Space Centre (APSC Proposal) Regulations 2001, as contained in the Territory of Christmas Island Regulations 2001 No. 1, and made under the Christmas Island Space Centre (APSC Proposal) Ordinance 2001, be disallowed.
	(2)	That the Christmas Island Space Centre (APSC Proposal) Ordinance 2001, as contained in the Territory of Christmas Island Ordinance No. 4 of 2001, and made under the Christmas Island Act 1958, be disallowed. 
I want to speak to the Senate about why the Greens are proposing that these regulations facilitating the building of a space centre, which will, amongst other things, facilitate rocket launches from Christmas Island, be disallowed. I am indebted to Christine Milne in my office for much of the information which I am about to give to the Senate.
I am moving the disallowance for three fundamental reasons. Firstly, the environmental impact of this space centre development, combined with the impacts of the detention centre for asylum seekers that the government is building and the proposed increase in mining leases—Christmas Island is being mined for phosphate—is such that the proposal should not proceed to the stage of a fully developed proposal under this ordinance until the full extent of its environmental impact is determined. Secondly, the ordinance provides a mechanism for the declaration of exclusion zones where yet another part of Australia is excluded from the provisions of the law—in this case the Local Government Act 1995 of Western Australia, the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of Western Australia and the Town Planning and Development Act of Western Australia. Thirdly, the ordinance excludes a community of Australian citizens—those on Christmas Island—from their rights under the law, and it leaves them to the mercy of the minister and the developer of the space station with regard to consultation about a development which will affect their day-to-day lives for a long while to come.
If we look at the environmental impact, it needs to be said at the outset that Christmas Island is an ecologically precious 135-square-kilometre Australian territory in the Indian Ocean. It is best known for its red crab migrations and fantastic rainforests, and it has numerous endemic species, many of which are endangered. Christmas Island is recognised as a world-class seabird breeding colony and has been listed in BirdLife International as a key area of bird endemicity. The forest on Christmas Island is the only remaining habitat for the endangered Abbott's booby, which is found nowhere else in the world. Christmas Island is home to the endangered Christmas Island shrew, the Christmas Island goshawk and the vulnerable Christmas Island frigatebird and Christmas Island hawk owl. Less obvious is the internationally significant terrestrial and aquatic subterranean fauna that occurs in caves, crevices and groundwater systems on the island and of which very little is known. The Procaris species, which are Aytid shrimps found on the island, is one of only three species known from this genus in the whole world. The other two are from Hawaii and from the Ascension Islands in the South Atlantic. 
The habitat of Christmas Island includes limestone scree slopes; inland cliffs and pinnacles; perennial springs and surface water; seacliffs; karst—cave formations; mangrove forests; coral and shell beaches and a few sand beaches; shoreline rock platforms; and a shallow water area supporting corals and sand areas extending 50 to 100 metres out from the land before the sea floor plunges towards the Java Trench, one of the deepest points of ocean in the world. This complex ecological interrelationship on the island and in its surrounding reefs makes it a fragile ecosystem which is worthy of the highest protection. As incredibly complex as it may be, the interrelated ecosystem is under sustained threat from both an invasive species, the yellow crazy ant, and a federal government which is failing in its responsibility to conserve biodiversity in Commonwealth areas. It is impossible to try to deal with issues on Christmas Island in an ad hoc manner, as is being attempted by producing this ordinance for one project without reference to the others. The whole ecological system is interlinked, so a holistic approach has to be taken to the impacts of a space launching facility, the detention centre—which is massive in itself—a new port and additional mining leases.
In recent years, Christmas Island has been under threat from the explosion in the number of yellow crazy ants, which have developed super colonies, attacking the red crab population and, in turn, the ecological balance of the rainforest. Fortunately, a huge research effort supported by the government is showing great promise in bringing this threat under control. But just now, as this threat is being brought under control, the small island's environment is being further threatened by the government's decision to build a detention centre and to exempt that construction and all its ancillary facilities, including a new port and an extension of the runway, from the provisions of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Coincidentally, the space base requires a new port facility and a runway upgrade. 
As if that is not enough, the government is at the same time encouraging an expansion of the phosphate mining and the construction of a space station or, more explicitly, a satellite launching facility. In spite of federal government assurances in the late 1980s— this was the Hawke government and I think the year was 1988—that no further clearance of rainforest would be permitted on the island, the Howard government is now considering an application by Phosphate Resources Ltd to develop new mining leases, 448 hectares in total, of which 320 hectares are primary rainforest. It should be unthinkable in this century that any government would consider the destruction of rainforest on an island such as this, but the Howard government appears to be determined—so determined that one has to ask just what commitments or arrangements the government has offered in its talks with the company involved.
Now we have before us an ordinance to facilitate a proposal by Asia Pacific Space Centre Pty Ltd, APSC, for the establishment on the island of a commercial facility for launching space objects, including satellites, and for related purposes. The ordinance is premature. Before a framework for decision making with regard to this project is approved, the parliament should be certain that there will be no detrimental environmental impact. What is the point of approving this ordinance and allowing the government to proceed to a fully developed proposal when the government still does not know what the environmental impacts of this project are and whether they can be mitigated? It is entirely possible that the impacts will be severe and that they cannot be avoided, in which case the project should not be approved. By this ordinance, the government is setting the taxpayers up for compensation to the company if final approvals were not to be granted. Or has APSC agreed to absorb all of the risk in what would then be a venture capital investment? I think not.
Why are earthworks already proceeding? This ordinance appears to be a catch-up after the fact. In other words, the government is pre-empting this ordinance and is therefore pre-empting this parliament and its right to deal with this ordinance. It is not good enough for section 13(2)(e) of the ordinance to state:
The Minister must not approve a proposal unless the Minister is satisfied that an Environmental Management Plan will be established and necessary environmental approvals under Australian law will be given, for the construction and operation of the facility and any associated infrastructure.
In the absence of such an approved final EMP—environment management plan—for the proposal, on what basis can the minister be satisfied that all approvals under Australian law will be given? It stands to reason that this ordinance should be withdrawn in line with the recommendations of Environment Australia, the federal government's overseer of the environmental impact. In its assessment report of the project Environment Australia recommended that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage:
... must approve the Environment Management Plan prior to the commencement of the construction of the project.
Yet earthworks are already under way at the site, because the minister has approved an interim environment management plan for earthworks. Drilling in the area of the launch pad is proceeding. This is a de facto approval for the project without a final environment management plan and without the necessary parliamentary approval. The kinds of works required are extensive, including construction of underground storage tanks for the petrol station and of huge storage facilities for highly dangerous rocket fuels, such as nitrogen tetroxide and dimethyl hydrazine. Storage of 710,000 litres of fuel is required. A hazardous store for pyrotechnic items used for launch vehicles needs to be constructed. There will also be an on-site diesel power station providing 12 megawatts of electricity—that is enough for a small city—a liquid oxygen plant, fire station and vehicle maintenance and wash down areas, not to mention storage areas for kerosene. 
Furthermore, by allowing the earthworks at the space centre site to proceed, the mining schedule elsewhere on the island is being completely disrupted. Areas that should have had mining completed and that should be now under rehabilitation for the endangered Abbott's booby habitat are not being rehabilitated, as all effort from mining works is being redirected to the space site. This is precisely what I mean when I say that this development cannot be assessed without reference to others. This is normal fare for this government, but it should not be accepted by the Senate. 
On 13 March this year, the Department of Transport and Regional Services illegally allowed survey work to commence on the detention centre facility before that proposal was referred to the Australian Heritage Commission, as required by law, therefore making a total farce of the so-called `prudent and feasible alternative' provisions of the act. The fact is that, as Environment Australia states at page 94 of its environmental assessment report:
Environment Australia is of the view that the proposed establishment of a launch facility on Christmas Island may not be an activity that will be compatible with the natural environment of Christmas Island and in particular the environment of South Point.
That is where the rocket station is going to be. It continues:
The proposal if undertaken would present this important natural environment with a range of potential impacts which cannot be completely ruled out through mitigation measures ...
While adaptive management of the launch facility may offer solutions in some cases, APSC—
the company—
has not been able to demonstrate to our satisfaction that it would in all cases be able to modify launch activities so that they might continue without causing further significant negative impacts upon the seabird colony. Therefore the only course of action to protect the colonies would be to discontinue rocket launches from the facility.
Environment Australia identified a range of environmental impacts of this proposal. The first was the unknown level of impact upon the South Point seabird colonies as a result of launches and a possible launch vehicle explosion over the island. Counts of the actual number of seabirds estimated to nest on the coastal terraces reveal that 6,000 pairs of red-footed boobies nest on South Point, making up 50 per cent of the total Christmas Island population. In addition, South Point is a breeding area for 20 per cent of the island's brown boobies, 20 per cent of the red-tailed tropic bird, 25 per cent of the golden bosuns—which are a subspecies endemic to the island; that is, found nowhere else in the world—40 per cent of the common noddies and 40 per cent of the greater frigate birds. I mentioned earlier the Abbott's boobies, which are found only on Christmas Island. 
At page 37, Environment Australia's report reads:
Unless documentation is provided showing otherwise, it must be assumed that the seabird colonies on Christmas Island, and that on South Point, are highly significant regionally, if not globally, and are currently comparatively secure from negative human impacts.
At page 64, it reads:
Based on the EIS it would appear to be a real possibility for launch noise at South Point to have a significant negative impact upon the nearby seabird colonies. In addition the breeding behaviour of some of the seabird species does not provide them with the ability to recoup losses beyond natural losses to which they have adapted.
Impacts could include the abandonment of nests or the nesting colonies; nests left unattended, with chick loss; and injury or death of juveniles or adults due to startle response, which may particularly be an issue with tree-nesting birds such as Abbott's booby. Individual Abbott's booby and frigate birds that fall to the ground are not able to become airborne again and generally die, unless given human assistance. Vibrations could lead to rock falls from cliffs. 
The second impact was on the land based fauna. Environment Australia was clearly concerned about the integrity of the EIS and recommended a comprehensive baseline survey for the Christmas Island pipistrelle bat and endemic reptile species. This survey should be completed before any construction activity on South Point, and the surveys designed should be approved by Environment Australia. I ask the government: has the survey been completed? If not, why did the minister approve the earthworks before the completion of that survey?
The third impact was on the karst habitats and water table. No attempt was made to determine what subterranean fauna occurred in the cave or ground water systems under South Point. Environment Australia recommended that ground probing radar be used to establish the presence in cave systems of subterranean fauna and that this be completed prior to the development of the final environment management plan. Launch vibrations could cause aesthetic or structural damage to the cave systems. Concern was expressed about the possibility of spills— that is, the release of hazardous substances into the ground water system—especially since, on Christmas Island, this is the only source of human water supply. It is a source of freshwater springs and is a habitat for native species. The company was requested to provide a report modelling the worst case release scenario for all hazardous substances so that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage could provide additional advice concerning transport routeing. Has this occurred and been incorporated? The Senate has no such report at hand.
The fourth impact I want to look at is the impacts on adjacent rainforest of launch plumes. The north and north-west border of the space site is fringed by primary rainforest. The southern area is adjacent to cliffside vegetation. As the launch vehicle—that is, rocket—ascends, it remains over Christmas Island for the first 25 seconds of flight and then passes over the shoreline and the fringing reef and out to sea. The launch plume, from the combustion of kerosene and liquid oxygen in the rocket engine, produces carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen, as well as 500 tonnes of deluge water, combined with the exhaust as steam or cloud droplets. Flora and fauna beyond the fenced area would be at risk of harm from the heat impacts of the ground cloud. APSC, the company, was required to report on alternative configurations which would allow for a wider buffer zone between the launch pads and the natural habitat. Has this happened? What did the minister decide before giving approval to earthworks, including drilling on the launch pad site?
Fifth, what are the impacts of the proposed water pipeline, from Jedda Cave to South Point through the national park, constructed on low-level concrete trestles above the ground? Or is there a plan now to underground the pipe in accordance with Environment Australia's recommendations, and what impact will that have? Sixth, the possible impacts of proposed runway extensions have not been assessed. Seventh, the alternatives are not assessed—that is, alternatives to the space station—because the EIS neglects to consider that by not proceeding with the proposal there would not be the range of potential impacts that the facility might cause to Christmas Island's valuable natural habitat and, following on, to the island's nature based tourism industry. Nor does it consider that, without the launch facility, the South Point site would be rehabilitated at expiry of the mining lease or could be used for another activity with less potential to significantly impact upon the environment.
Finally, the eighth impact is to ocean drop zones. The company intends launching to the south-east, east and south so that there will be drop zones along the flight point with the dumping into the ocean of the first and second stages. Fuel tanks will be dumped, with the possible development of kerosene slicks and the possibility of these reaching Christmas Island beaches and with adverse impact on the sea turtles. These factors should have, in the absence of mitigation, led the minister to veto the proposal.
I have some more points to make in this speech, but I reiterate that I move to disallow this ordinance for the space station. I seek the Senate's permission to incorporate the rest of my speech in Hansard. 
 (Senator Bartlett)—You may be able to speak in reply on the motion, and you could finish your speech then.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-06-19,"—Time is going to beat me and Senator Carr in trying to conclude this debate tonight. But I think it is important to point out to the Senate that, with respect to Senator Brown, most of the things he said are, as usual, inaccurate. The government has been very careful—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Quite recently the minister wrote to me withdrawing such statements, showing that he had actually misled the Senate. I do not want to have a speech like that let up with a statement like that. I think the minister can put his own points; I will accept that. But I stand by what I have said and I think we should look at the minister's own record when he makes a statement like that.
 (Senator Bartlett)—Senator Brown, there is no point of order.
—But it is important for the Senate to understand that Senator Brown makes these allegations and, in many cases, they could not be further from the truth. For example, the geotechnical drilling that Senator Brown spoke about is actually part of the environmental assessment, part of the environmental management plan that was gone into very fully.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-06-19,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I rise to speak on the Advance to the Finance Minister. It appears that this is a summary of advances from applications for funds advanced to the finance minister. Curiously, within that, there are a number of issues that require some further information from the government as to what they intend to do. I will go to one of them in particular: the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Appropriation Act (No. 1), where the explanation, it seems, for the requirement for the advance to the finance minister states:
This appropriation provides for Australia's assessed contributions to international organisations including United Nations Peacekeeping Operations ...
It goes on:
... Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) payments in respect of National Interest Business, compensation for detriment caused by defective administration and payments under the North American Pension Scheme (NAPS).
The information given in that document is that it goes to the United Nations Peacekeeping Operations: the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia and the United Nations Transitional Administration of East Timor—all quite worthwhile causes. It then goes on `and the APEC International Secretariat $434,277'. It says this is `in order to meet payment deadlines' and that it is urgent:
On 14 February 2002, the Australian Mission in New York received notification of Australia's current obligations for contributions to three peacekeeping operations ...
An urgent advance is required to ensure Australia maintains its very good record for timely payment of its contributions to International Organisations.
What we are not told, though, is why the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation or EFIC payment in respect of `national interest business compensation for detriment caused by defective administration and payments under the North American Pension Scheme' is urgent. One would imagine that if you were going to seek an urgent advance there would be some explanation as to what it is, what the payment is for and why there is an urgency for it. The document itself does not provide much detail at all, quite frankly. It seems very remiss of this government to make an urgent request for an advance to the Minister for Finance and Administration but provide very little information about what it is in fact required for. We would hope that the government might be able, in the time available during this sitting, to outline what that advance was required for and tell us why it is required urgently. It would allay the opposition's concerns: what is the `detriment caused by defective administration and payments'? Is that defective administration by the Howard government or is it some other detriment caused by mismanagement? It would be helpful if this government would at least provide some assurance that they are not to blame in any of this, the money is in fact urgent and there is a real reason for the urgency. 
Another application for an advance to the finance minister comes from the Department of the Treasury. We are told:
The government agreed to fund all spending by the States and Territories in 2001-02 as a result of increasing the First Home Owners Scheme (FHOS) grant from $7,000 to $14,000 for eligible first home owners contracting between 9 March 2001 and 31 December 2001 to buy or build a new home.
Some $90 million was set aside for that, we are told by this document, and the government has provided a further $194,998,000 in additional estimates `as a result of greater than anticipated demand for the program'. So the original grant was a third of what was really required. (Extension of time granted) Two-thirds more is required by the department to fund the scheme. One wonders how this government has been able to manage its budget at all, given its inability to estimate clearly what it requires. It required and sought $90 million, but the document says `We really need another $194,998,000'—an extraordinary unforeseen amount. Perhaps the government, during this couple of weeks that we have left, could tell us how it has managed to so hopelessly predict how much it would really require.
If we then look at the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee, which is seeking funding from the Advance to the Finance Minister, the explanation for the appropriation for an equity injection of an additional $6 million is:
... to operate in accordance with the Legal Services Directions, to deal with claims promptly and not cause unnecessary delay.
The requirements seem to go wildly beyond what would ordinarily be required. It seems that the department, in administering these funds, has missed out on the ability to project forward how much money is required. The document states:
SIFC has been requested by a major plaintiff law firm to negotiate a number of settlements during April 2002, of which 70% will be the subject of settlement conferences ...
One would seriously wonder how the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee had not been able to at least foresee requirements of that magnitude. Nevertheless, perhaps the government does have a realistic explanation. The explanation that it is simply urgent and unforeseen seems to fall a bit short.
We then have another application in the order of $15 million from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. The document states:
The Department seeks to make administered payments under the General Employment Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme (GEERS) and its predecessor scheme ...
We are told there is an additional $12 million appropriated through additional estimates to take account of that scheme:
In total, $20,128,849 is required for the remainder of the year for Outcome 2, of which $5,092, 813 is available from unspent appropriation leaving a net additional requirement of $15,036,036.
They really seemed to have missed their calculations on that one, which is quite extraordinary given the nature of the fund itself.
The Labor Party has highlighted that there are problems with that scheme. In fact, we are told that the employee entitlements scheme seems to be failing. An advance of that enormous amount of money to the finance minister during the estimates round seems to confirm that the government's employee entitlements scheme is failing employees and their families. We are told that it is riddled with delays, shortfalls in payments and cost overruns. This advance to the finance minister is only confirmation of that. It is clear that the government's scheme has failed to deliver 100 per cent of workers' entitlements when they really need them, while it seems costs are being borne by the taxpayer to the extraordinary tune of an additional $15 million. It is really surprising. The government says that it is urgent—and clearly it is—to meet the payments that are required. The increase in demand was unforeseen at the time of additional estimates. Surely an amount of that magnitude should have been foreseen. It should have been clearly dealt with by this government, rather than by getting an advance to the finance minister. 
We also have a range of others that I am not going to get to in the time available, but I will be putting them on notice and seeking additional information from this government about how and why these advances to the finance minister have come about. It is no wonder that their budget is in disarray when you look at the advances that have been called for from the finance minister to meet payments that they claim were unforeseen. Clearly, when you look at how some of the amounts are calculated and the advice that they have provided in these documents, there is no justification for some of them. Further and better explanation is required to assist in understanding why these amounts were unforeseen.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2002-06-19,"—I want to take only a few minutes of the Senate's time, but I rise seeing that we are on air. We have just heard Senator Ludwig from the Labor Party babble on in some sort of bewilderment with regard to this report to the Senate. He has said that the government is in some sort of financial disarray. His challenge was very weak and light-on—it was more a series of mysterious questions—but it may leave someone listening to the broadcast concerned that the government has some sort of problem with its economic credentials. That is far from the truth. He mounted a weak case; nevertheless, I am here to challenge it.
On any analysis of this government's economic credentials compared to the other side and on any survey ever taken—let alone the last election—if there is one area in which this government stands firm in the polls and in public opinion, that is on its economic credentials. I really do not know what point Senator Ludwig was trying to make. These are normal, procedural requests put before the parliament on any given day by the finance minister for an extension as needed to meet requirements. I believe most of them are set down in the budget anyway. They are simply requests as needed. There is nothing particularly unusual about it at all. Actually, Senator Ludwig gave a good example of the problems we have in the Senate: we cannot even make normal requests for extensions of funds without the Senate becoming obstructionist. It is even obstructionist about the most minor request from the finance minister, let alone the budget requests that we put. In fact, let us take it right back to the beginning. Since 1996, we have yet to place a budget before this Senate that Labor has no obstructed lock, stock and barrel.
Senator Ludwig talks about economic credentials. We came into government in 1996 with a $10 billion budget black hole and a $96 billion government deficit, meaning that there was a series of deficit budgets before we came into government. We had to make many tough decisions, from the first budget we introduced in 1996, to bring the budget back into surplus. Labor were obstructionist from day one. Quite frankly, the Senate has not changed its colours at all. Now that we are bringing in our sixth budget, Labor is being equally obstructionist. In fact, I think you are being worse than you were in 1996, if that is possible.
—I was not here.
—You were not here in 1996? Well, you have quickly taken up the colours of your party. We have had to lay down some pretty tough budgets, and on each occasion the Senate has been obstructionist. So do not come in here—
—And you never were, for 13 years?
—and talk about economic responsibility. I will not be distracted, given the time, but I can talk about the times we prevented certain budget procedures in 1993 because they were broken promises and increased taxes. In government, we have yet to increase any taxes. But, to get back to my main point of economic responsibility, we have attempted to introduce a surplus budget and reduce debt with every one of our six budgets, and Labor has attempted to obstruct us on every single occasion. If we could not have negotiated through the Independents back in 1996—and perhaps in the 1997 budget—we would have been in deficit. Labor would have driven this government into deficit. That would have had a cascading effect upon the whole economy with regard to interest rates and inflation rates. So, Senator Ludwig, do not come in here and try to preach some sort of economic credibility or try to paint some picture that this government does not know the economic direction in which it is heading. We know the direction in which we are heading; we have the format; we have the estimates laid down; we simply need to get them through an obstructionist Senate—a Senate that has been obstructionist from the first day we came into government in 1996. In fact, it has just got worse. ",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Advance to the Finance Minister</title>,Documents,29,1,speech

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2002-06-19,"—I wish to speak on the adjournment tonight on a couple of matters. The first is to is to pay tribute to the Hon. Doug Moppett, who died on Tuesday, aged in his early 60s after a battle with cancer. Doug Moppett worked tirelessly on behalf of country people in numerous capacities within the National Party. His various roles included vice-chairman of the state National Party between 1971 and 1986, state chairman between 1986 and 1991, and twice as a member of the Legislative Council—the first between 1976 and 1978 and the second between 1991 and 2002. He was dedicated to correcting the inequalities that county people experience every day, and he made an enormous contribution to the state's upper house and as a part of the parliament's committee system. One of Doug's main focuses was the central west and western division of the state where he lived. My thoughts are very much with his wife, Helen, his two children, Warwick and Peter. On behalf of the National Party team and my two colleagues here, Senator Boswell and Senator McGauran, I pay tribute to Doug's lifetime of commitment to country New South Wales, the National Party and his family. He was a very decent Australian; he made Australia a better place. Thank you, Doug Moppett.
The other matter I wish to raise tonight concerns a committee responsibility I have in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade—particularly the Defence subcommittee which inquired into the continuing controversy concerning the loss of HMAS Sydney in November 1941 off the Western Australian coast. This was a time of grave war crisis in Europe and the Middle East, and just a couple of weeks before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour, bringing the United States into the war. Many people in the community still understand the loss of HMAS Sydney in November 1941 as an inexplicable tragedy. For the 645 crew and their families it was a devastating blow—one from which many close relatives have never recovered.  
For the Royal Australian Navy, the loss of this glamour ship at one of the darkest moments of World War II, just before Pearl Harbour, was a blow operationally and for morale. For the Australian population who had feted the Sydney on her return from the Mediterranean some nine months before, it was a sudden and shocking reminder of the proximity of the war to our far off distant shores. What was so incomprehensible, and remains so today and why there is so much interest in this loss, was that the Sydney was lost with all crew, without trace, while 300 of the crew of the German raider Kormoran survived. In the 60 years since the loss of the Sydney, the debate on the fate of the Sydney,and the exact nature of the engagement and its aftermath has intensified rather than abated. As a result, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, particularly the Defence subcommittee, received 201 submissions and 204 supplementary submissions. I understand that that was one of the largest number of submissions ever received by the joint committee on inquiry. 
The committee tabled its report in March 1999. We made a number of recommendations, and tonight I want to bring to the Senate's notice the outcome of one of the committee's recommendations, which will be of interest to Sydney watchers, and it concerns the attempt to exhume the body of an unknown sailor that was buried on Christmas Island. On or about 6 February 1942, some three months after the loss, a Carley float containing a corpse was recovered off Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. It was explained to the committee that oceanographers and hydrographers agreed that it was possible and perhaps likely that the Carley float had come from the Sydney. There was no conclusive proof but the committee was told that, while there were probably very few living parents of the sailors who were lost, there remain many wives, children, brothers, sisters and other relatives who are alive. They are part of the Sydney family, and most would wish to know the identity of the sailor through DNA testing or other forensic methods, if that were possible. 
Unfortunately, this possible exhumation was unsuccessful, and I am advised that late last year the Department of Defence reported to the government that, despite an exhaustive 12-day search, the team was unable to find any trace of the sailor in the cemetery. I did not see this report given publicity. Members of the Sydney family might have picked it up, but I suspect that many Sydney watchers may have missed the fact that the exhumation attempt was unsatisfactory—it failed. The effort was considerable—a big effort made— but they were unable to find the body and, therefore, were unable to extend any forensic analysis to that particular potential evidence concerning the loss of the Sydney. This is a disappointment, but the effort was justified in terms of following every possible lead in this mystery. 
The other recommendation acted upon by the government was for the Royal Australian Navy to sponsor a seminar in conjunction with the Western Australian Maritime Museum and the HMAS Sydney Foundation to consider the likely sites of the wrecks of Sydney and Kormoran. The Royal Australian Navy report on the seminar is that, because of the huge possible search area and a lack of consensus among interested research groups, it is impossible to find a credible search area that would justify a further search. Not that many searches have not been done—Royal Australian Navy vessels are transiting and PC Orions are transiting and obviously they are searching all the time. I am disappointed by this outcome, but this is not a new position because of the difficulties of the search area. It was explained to the committee that it is not just a case of looking for a needle in a haystack—if you are looking for the Sydney—it is, in fact, looking for the haystack first. I understand that off the Western Australian coast, the water depth off the continental shelf can run to 5,000 metres. Looking for two vessels after 60 years at 5,000 metres is a not inconsiderable task.
I will maintain a watching brief in this matter and the defence subcommittee has some actions it is considering taking. At the very least, we propose to write to the many people who made submissions and keep them informed of the results of our inquiry. We owe it to those people and we also owe it to those who lost their family on the Sydney all those years ago. At a time of unprecedented commitment of the Australian defence forces in various parts of the world, I know there is a continuing interest not only in our present military commitments—in the Middle East, Afghanistan, East Timor, Bougainville and other places—but also in our past military history. The loss of the Sydney is still very important to many people, and for that reason I think it is important that they be kept informed of what happened to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and to advise them that there will be further work done on this very extraordinary naval military mystery.
