"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-07-11,"—To facilitate this, I move:
That the committee report progress.
—Madam Chairman, I make it clear that we are not seeking to have progress reported; we are simply—
—You are facilitating it, though.
—Play hard ball if you like. I am simply saying that, by indulgence, there is nothing to stop the Senate—by consent—from simply commencing the start of the committee stage process with prayers.
—Senator Alston, Senator Faulkner has moved that the committee report progress. I will put that motion. The question is that that motion be agreed to.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
—The Chairman of Committees, Senator West, reports that the committee has considered the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill, has made progress and seeks leave to sit again.
—I didn't move that we seek leave to sit again.
—I move that the committee have leave to sit again at a later hour.
—Madam President, on a point of order: I do not think I moved that we seek leave to sit again. I just moved that the committee report progress. I am aware of what the clerk is now saying, but I think you, Madam President, incorrectly reported the motion that I had moved.
—The motion is merely to report progress, and that has been carried. Progress has been reported.
Motion (by Senator Hill) proposed:
That the committee have leave to sit again at a later hour.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-07-11,"—I think that this farce has gone on long enough. I think it is time for the Senate to suspend debate on this bill, to finish this debate, to adjourn it, and for the electorate to have an opportunity to decide the issue of the full privatisation of Telstra. John Howard made a solemn commitment before the last election that only one-third of Telstra would be privatised. John Howard said that in the 
 life of this parliament he would privatise only one-third of Telstra and we are now in high farce mode debating an issue which the Prime Minister of Australia gave an ironclad commitment would not happen during the life of this parliament.
I think all senators are aware that a deal has been done on the issue of the full privatisation of Telstra. All senators are aware that behind closed doors yesterday Senator Colston met the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, for apparently one hour in Brisbane and understandings on this issue were reached. We say that this Senate has an entitlement to know what those understandings were. We have a situation where Senator Colston at no time is willing, or able, to make a contribution to debate. We had the situation, for example, with the Native Title Billwhere Senator Colston supported the government through thick and thin, but at no time did he make any contribution on the floor of this Senate, be it in the committee stage or in the second or third reading debates.
Senator Colston put certain demands, we understand, to the Prime Minister about accepting his vote in the Senate, because I think senators would be aware that, after the opposition campaigned for a long time on the fact that Senator Colston's vote was tainted, Senator Colston's vote was bought for the deputy presidency of the Senate. After arrangements were come to in relation to the first one-third privatisation of Telstra and a staff upgrade was agreed to in the Deputy President's office, I think eventually—only because of Labor Party and public pressure—reluctantly and belatedly Mr Howard agreed not to accept Senator Colston's vote in this chamber.
We know that one of the demands that Senator Colston has put to the Prime Minister is that his vote be counted by the government. I want to know what else Senator Colston put to Mr Howard. I think we are entitled to know what arrangements have been agreed between Mr Howard and Senator Colston. I think we are also entitled to know what the nature of any arrangements between Senator Harradine and Mr Howard and the government might be on this issue. I do hope that at 
 some stage during the debate both Senator Harradine and Senator Colston outline those arrangements to the committee or to the Senate as a whole.
The situation is this: the National Party throughout Australia have major internal concerns and major constituency concerns with the issue of the full privatisation of Telstra. We have two National Party members of the House of Representatives already, the member for Dawson, Mrs De-Anne Kelly, and the member for Kennedy, Mr Bob Katter. Both have indicated that they will not support the full privatisation of Telstra again in the House of Representatives. The problem is that, when this matter was debated first in the House of Representatives, Mr Katter was missing in action—he was not there—but Mrs Kelly did support the government on that occasion. But we all know that the key vote on this issue is the one that will take place in the Senate.
In the House of Representatives it does not really matter if a few National Party members, who have got the message from their constituency, cross the floor. But in the Senate it does matter because Senator Boswell and his team can actually affect the fate of this bill. If Senator Boswell's National Party colleagues—Senator O'Chee, Senator Brownhill, Senator McGauran, Senator Sandy Macdonald and Senator Tambling—join him, if even one of them crosses the floor, stand up for rural and regional Australia, stand up for their constituency, stand up for the bush, then they can defeat this bill.
The problem we have is this: there is no evidence that National Party senators have the same electoral instincts, the same survival instincts or the same level of intestinal fortitude that some of the National Party members of the House of Representatives have. I outlined yesterday the sort of representation that we have here in the Senate from the National Party. It is important that the Australian people understand the change that has occurred in the National Party over recent years. After all, we have a situation where the Country Party of old—the old National Party, the National Party of `Black Jack' McEwen, of Doug Anthony and of Ian Sinclair—has 
 long gone. The courageous National Party of yesteryear, I am afraid, is just a footnote of history.
The National Party of today is the Charles Blunt, Tim Fischer, Senator Ron Boswell National Party. I think, Madam President, that you would be aware that in days of yore you would not have had anyone like McEwen, Anthony or Ian Sinclair roll over on an issue like this, which is of significance to the National Party's bush constituency. They simply would not have done it. They simply would not have accepted the Liberal Party's domination in the coalition government. They just would not have sold out their constituency the way the National Party of 1998 is willing to do.
I do not know how Senator Ron Boswell and Senator Bill O'Chee can hold up their heads in the Queensland National Party. No-one up there takes any notice of them. Look at the influence they had on the issue of preferences to the One Nation Party, for example. First of all, Senator O'Chee came into the Senate and said that the issue of National Party preferences going to the One Nation Party was of no significance whatsoever because no preferences have been distributed. The fact is that they were distributed in eight seats and eight seats elected One Nation candidates. The amazing thing about two of those eight seats, the actual sitting members who were defeated, is that the incumbent party was the National Party. That is how wrong Senator O'Chee was on this issue.
Senator Boswell then said that, as far as he is concerned, `We don't have to worry about the issue of One Nation preferences,' because he was going to argue very strongly that One Nation be put last on National Party how-to-vote cards. The trouble is that no-one in the National Party machine in Queensland takes any notice of him. No-one believes him. No-one is going to take any notice of Senator Boswell at all, because Senator Boswell and the National Party in the Senate have no clout in that political organisation—and they know it. The National Party organisational wing wants Senator Boswell and his team to stand up on this issue. They won't do so. The 
 National Party, of course, are now completely discredited. They have sold out to the Liberal Party.
I think the classic example of this is Senator Sandy Macdonald. Senator Sandy Macdonald from New South Wales is someone who has virtually made no public comment in the whole of his political career. Can anyone recall, before the last week, Senator Sandy Macdonald actually saying anything about any political issue at any time? He hasn't. He came out of the bunker, he came out from the rock under which he was hiding about a week or so ago, and said, `I am going to ensure that we get a price for the full privatisation of Telstra. I will not cross the floor and I will certainly support anything that John Howard wants me to do, but I am really concerned about this issue.'
Where is Senator Sandy Macdonald today? He is not even here; he is not even in the parliament while this issue of very great significance to the National Party is being debated. He can't even be bothered to front up and represent the rural constituency that he claims he has some empathy with.
—Where's he gone?
—Senator Ray asked me where he has gone. I don't know where he has gone, but I know this: he is paired for the day. He is not in here arguing for the people that he alleges he represents. He is out of the building. He has gone. He is not interested. I have to say that he will make the same contribution to the debate today as the rest of the National Party in the Senate will. What a weak-kneed lot they are. What a gutless lot they are. How can you, Senator Boswell, when you think about the fine traditions of the agrarian socialists—
—Senator, your remarks should not be directed directly to Senator Boswell.
—How does Senator Boswell equate his own behaviour with the traditions of the old agrarian socialists of the National Party, the `Black Jack' McEwens, the Doug Anthonys and the like? I am sure `Black Jack' McEwen would be rolling in his grave.
I did notice in the newspaper this morning, and some of my colleagues in Victoria would know this well, that one of Mr McEwen's close relations—his nephew, in fact—is running for the seat of McEwen in Victoria that was named after Mr McEwen. He is running for the seat of McEwen, but is he running for the National Party? Oh, no. He is not running for the National Party. He is running for the only political party in Australia that will protect the interests of the bush and that will protect rural and regional Australia. He is running for Labor. It is great to see even Mr McEwen's own family have got the message in this regard.
We are entitled in this debate, for those who have come to arrangements with the government, to have them put before the chamber. The real point I want to make, why I do not believe the committee should have leave to sit again at a later hour this day, is that Mr Howard, before the previous election, made an ironclad commitment that the full privatisation of Telstra would not occur in the life of the Howard government during its first parliament. Mr Howard said that this would not occur. He gave a commitment to the Australian people that he would not progress the full privatisation of Telstra.
What we are debating is another Howard breach of promise—another non-core commitment. But this non-core commitment is very much more significant than many of the other broken promises that we have seen in the litany that has taken place since the election in 1996. It is an important principle. To keep the Senate here and to propose that the Senate debate a piece of legislation that Mr Howard said he would not consider bringing before the parliament is simply an outrage. It is an absolute outrage.
The Labor Party is being asked to cooperate with Mr Howard breaking his word to the Australian people. We won't do it. Why should we cooperate with Mr Howard in perpetrating this untruth on the Australian people? There is no suggestion that this matter would have any urgency. Even Mr Howard himself is not proposing to have the legislation proclaimed until after the next election, if he is to win it. As far as the Labor 
 Party is concerned, if the committee does get leave to sit at a later hour this day—if that occurs, opposition senators will certainly give leave to those senators from both sides of the chambers who would want to see prayers read by you, or whoever is presiding—leave will certainly be granted for that to occur. Let me make that clear to all honourable senators in the chamber. But we do not believe that this farce should continue.
We believe that Mr Howard should honour his commitment to the Australian people, made in the last election, to privatise only one-third of Telstra. We did not support that and we argued against it. The only reason that partial privatisation of Telstra actually occurred is the tainted vote of Senator Colston. That is the only reason the bill went through the parliament. Of course, the same operation is on again. We know the fix has gone in up there in Brisbane over the past 24 hours. We do believe that there should be an opportunity for this to occur. I have to say that, as far as the Labor Party is concerned, we are going to argue this issue out while ever the parliament sits. While ever the parliament sits, the Labor Party will not let Australians down, but we do not believe that the government and Mr Howard should be able to perpetrate this outrageous breach of commitment, the outrageous falsehood of Mr Howard's election commitments in the last campaign. I urge all senators not to grant leave for the committee to meet at a later hour this day. ",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-07-11,"—The Leader of the Opposition (Senator Faulkner) has exercised, in my opinion, very bad judgment this morning. His judgment is a reflection not only upon himself but upon his party and the values for which they claim to stand. What is the process we are on about here this morning? The process is to allow prayers to be read. Yet Senator Faulkner has taken the opportunity to abuse that request of Senator Boswell and, rather, to engage in a 20-minute speech of abuse against members of the National Party. Never have we experienced such bad judgment as we have seen this morning. What happened was that we re 
 turned to debate in committee, obviously from last night, as consideration was suspended.
—You wouldn't allow progress to be reported last night.
—The chair of the committee indicated that it was not within the sessional orders that she would read prayers. Senator Boswell rose to his feet and asked if it would be possible to read prayers, because it is the normal practice at the start of each day and to many senators it is a very important part of the total legislative process. That is all Senator Boswell wanted. He wanted prayers to be read.
—Hypocrite!
—Senator Evans, withdraw that.
—If `hypocrite' is unparliamentary, I withdraw.
—You know it is, and withdraw it unconditionally.
—I withdraw it unconditionally.
—We sought that prayers be read by leave. The opposition refused. They were not going to have that.
—Madam President, on a point of order: this is just an outrageous lie from Senator Hill. He is a liar. I know it is unparliamentary to say he is a liar, but it is also true, and you know it is true.
—Senator Faulkner, withdraw that.
—What—that he is an outrageous liar?
—You know that that is unparliamentary.
—I know that it is unparliamentary, but it is true. I withdraw it, but it is nevertheless the case.
—Senator Faulkner, you have not withdrawn it when you qualify it in that fashion. I ask you to withdraw that.
—I withdraw, Madam President.
—Madam President—
—You never asked for leave, and you know it.
—You check the Hansard . Senator Boswell said—
—You did not seek leave.
—You did not seek leave. Tell the truth! I moved that the committee report progress. That is what I did. You moved a motion and I was debating it.
—Senator Faulkner, you were listened to, and it is only reasonable that the Leader of the Government be listened to.
—Madam President, it was suggested that, by leave, prayers should be read. From the other side there was a loud No. Right?
—That is not true! That's not true!
—I was reluctant to see the Senate come out of committee because I feared it would be abused by Senator Faulkner. How right I was. Nevertheless, Senator Faulkner said, `We'll give you leave to come out of committee for prayers to be read.' I then moved the motion.
—I did not say that. Don't tell lies! You are a liar!
—No, you did not say that.
—You are a liar!
—You did not say that because you intended to abuse the process.
—You don't know what you're talking about at the moment.
—You do?
—Order! I am instructed by the clerk that the Chairman of Committees ruled that it was necessary to report progress for prayers to be read.
—You fool! Sit down, you fool!
—Senator Faulkner, you are persistently interjecting. I think your behaviour is wilfully in breach of the standing orders. There is a proper order of debate in this place and shouting at people who are speaking is not the way to do it. I warn senators to cease and to allow the Leader of 
 the Government to put what he wants to put to the Senate.
—Madam President, I raise a point of order. You have said there is a proper order of debate. Could you explain to the chamber why you called Senator Hill to close the debate when Senator Carr was on his feet. If there is a proper order, where does that stand?
—I have no idea what you are talking about.
—I thought Senator Hill was closing the debate on the motion that he moved. You have talked in terms of proper order. I am asking why you did not call Senator Carr, who was on his feet.
—There is no right to speak in reply on this motion. Senator Hill is now speaking to the motion that he moved. Senator Carr can speak next if he wishes to do so.
—Let us hear Senator Faulkner deny this. We then said, `We'll have to come out of committee.' He said, `We'll give you leave so that prayers can be read.' Okay. So we come out of committee so that prayers can be read, and what do we get then? Instead of having the opportunity then to seek leave for prayers to be read, we have Senator Faulkner get to his feet for a 20-minute attack on members of the National Party.
That is what I say was an exercise of bad judgment and poor leadership on the part of Senator Faulkner. We are still on the preamble to the bill. We will be going back to the preamble of the bill, and Senator Faulkner could have given his speech then, but he wanted to intervene in the opportunity for prayers to give that political speech. As I said, I think that was very poor judgment.
This debate should be brought to an end. We should go back into the committee after we have had the opportunity to ask for leave—I wonder if it will be given this time—for you to read prayers for those senators who do regard that as a very important part of the day's business of the Senate.
—Madam President, on a point of order: while the Chairman came up 
 and spoke to you on three occasions, Senator Faulkner shouted across the table at the Leader of the Government, Senator Hill, `You're a liar, you're a liar, you're a liar.' I ask that that be withdrawn.
—Even she knew who was telling the truth.
—Senator Evans, withdraw that.
—I withdraw, Madam President.
—I will check the Hansard  as to what went on. I certainly asked and required Senator Faulkner to withdraw that word earlier when he used it. If he has used it again, I will check it and see.
—Madam President, why can't he be asked to come to the table and do it now? He did it three times in a row. He knows he did it and he should come up there and comply with standing orders.
—Order! Senator Faulkner, it is alleged that you used the word `liar' while I was getting advice on another matter. If you did, I ask you to withdraw it.
—Thank you, Madam President. I did use the word `liar'. I do not know whether you were otherwise occupied, but I did use the word `liar' and I withdraw it.
—Thank you.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-11,"—I rise to speak on this motion that the committee report progress.
—It is not the motion to report progress; it is the motion that this committee sit again.
—I want to point out that last night the opposition moved a motion at two minutes to midnight to report progress. You voted against it, so we came back here to continue with the bill, as it was in committee. I was ready to go. The minister was ready to go. Other senators were ready to go. Senator Boswell called from the back—
—He asked if prayers could be read. 
—He did not move a motion. He asked, as I recollect, `What about prayers?' You have made a suggestion that he sought leave to have prayers read. As I recollect it, Senator Boswell asked about prayers. Our leader suggested that you have to go through the normal procedures of a motion, which was subsequently moved, and Senator Faulkner, quite properly, spoke to the motion that is now before us. Senator Faulkner pointed out that this bill, the way it is being handled, would be better off being deferred until after the next election. We had so much information given to us last night to indicate that there are all sorts of hidden deals going on with this bill—hidden deals, secret meetings—between the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and Senator Colston, who was not even here for most of yesterday; he was in Brisbane meeting the Prime Minister. When we sort through all the hours of debate yesterday—and Senator Hill has complained that we are still only on the opening clause explaining the philosophy of this bill—
—Otherwise called the preamble, you dope!
—The preamble. We are still on that. The reason we are still on that is that the opposition and the other opposition parties here have been trying to seek information about what is in the deal that has been agreed to between the government, the Prime Minister, the National Party, Senator Colston, who has now had a meeting with the Prime Minister, Senator Harradine, who has indicated by and large he is going to support this bill—he has only foreshadowed one amendment which will mean that the bill is still effective for two months after the next election—
—I am voting against the preamble.
—His voting against the preamble does not change the intent of the bill. Quite clearly, Senator Harradine has agreed to support the substance of the bill that after the election the Howard government, if it is re-elected, with no reference back to parliament will be able to fully sell Telstra.
We also had exposed here last night from the minister, in trying to explain some of the 
 details, that the deal that the National Party have signed up to is not what it seems—that instead of it being worth hundreds of millions of dollars it may be worth a couple of hundred at the most—and that we are going to have to wait until some stage in the future to find out what is in the rest of the package.
We are saying that this bill ought to be put off until we get the full details. Why should the parliament have to vote? That is why Senator Faulkner has spoken this morning asking that this bill be deferred. That is why we have used this opportunity to again point out that this is an ill-begotten bill which this Senate is being asked to vote on without its full intent being made available to the public.
We came into this chamber at half past nine this morning ready to get on with the committee stage of the bill. That was the will of the Senate as voted on last night. You people voted for that and we wanted to get on with the bill. That has always been our business here. It is you people who have sought to change the arrangement. But we came here at half past nine believing that we were to get on with the bill. We should get on with it now, get on with the issue of the bill, and let us test the will of the Senate.
—Madam President, I raise a point of order. There has been an exchange of views. I wonder whether we could move to saying prayers now and get on with the matter.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-07-11,"—I need to make it very clear at this stage that the Democrats remain completely opposed to what we see as a highly irresponsible piece of legislation. The reason that we are back here today is that the pork barrel has to be filled, ready to be rolled out. The fact that it is going to run down the hill and run out and, indeed, be totally empty in a few years time does not seem to bother this government. They will have Telstra sold but they think that they, hopefully, will be back in government, having brought the electorate into believing they actually are responsible.
I do think we have to look at how all of this has happened this morning. I have a bit of a feeling that we have been undone by 
 God, because obviously the intention was to simply say prayers before we began. While I support the intent of what the Labor Party is doing, I think we have basically lost the battle. This bill is going to be debated. I would like to see it debated in full so we can perhaps, Senator Schacht, get some of the answers we were seeking last night and also go through and debate the amendments in the vain hope that the bill may be slightly improved. Let's face it, we are heading into an election where the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) wants a huge pot of money in order to be able to buy votes. I think we should just get on with it today after we have said prayers.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-07-11,"—I agree that we should get back into the debate. I think there should be a full, honest and incisive debate on this matter because it is very important to the whole country and I, for one, cannot see how it can be adequately debated and completed in the hours that are left today. This issue is going to affect every Australian and the government has failed to give a guarantee to rural consumers that they are going to get local call rates to their local town and their local business centre. I cannot understand how the National Party could have failed to achieve even that in the bargain that is said to have been struck with the government.
I have a simple request to make here, and that is to ask the government and Senator Harradine—and I would be asking Senator Colston if he were here but he is not—whether or not they intend to again gag or guillotine debate before the day is out. We saw that happen three times the night before last, but I for one do not want to go into a debate which is going to be truncated at the end of the day for political purposes. I want to know that this debate will be able to run its full and proper course. I was amazed to see Senator Harradine gag debate three times in this Senate just over 24 hours ago to prevent senators from expressing themselves.
I want to know from Senator Harradine, in particular, because in the past I have thought that his application of goodwill to the Senate was above that of the Liberal and National parties, that he is not going to stoop to the 
 lowest form of contribution to debate in this place, and that is to prevent debate.
Before we have this vote, we should have a fair dinkum indication from the government that the debate will proceed untrammelled and that it is not just here to smooth the way for the Prime Minister, John Howard, to call an election some time next month against the interests of the Australian people, with a year yet to run in the proper course of events before we have an election and, of course, complicit with the Independents, because without the Independents such a thing cannot happen.
I notice that in a full page advertisement by Telstra in today's newspapers Tasmania has been left off the map yet again. I would like to know that it is not going to be left off the map, as far as this debate is concerned, because we do know that since Senator Harradine struck his bargain with the government in the selling of the first tranche of Telstra over 100 jobs have been lost out of Telstra in Tasmania. I do not want that trend to continue and I would like to know that we are going to get a better deal next time around. Of course, neither Senator Harradine nor the government has been open about just what is in the package for the people of Tasmania, let alone the people of the north island.
So there we have it. Before I give assent to this proceeding, I want to know that the gag will not be used on the debate of this supremely important matter for the people of Australia.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Boswell, Sen Ronald",NP,1998-07-11,"—I do not want to make any reference to prayers; we will just let that go. I do want to respond to some of the remarks made by Senator Faulkner. Senator Faulkner, you have continued to attack the National Party, and it is your right to do so.
—Senator, your remarks should be addressed to the chair and not directly to Senator Faulkner.
—Through you, Madam Chair, Senator Faulkner and his colleagues have continued to attack the National Party. 
 Let me say that the reason the National Party has taken this decision is, time and time again, to support the sale of Telstra bill. At every National Party conference, at every CWA conference, at every NFF conference and at every isolated children conference, it continually comes up that we are left behind in the communications race, we cannot educate our children unless we have the latest technology, we cannot get into the markets and we do not know what the cotton price is, the computer will not work and it takes 25 minutes to get a page off it—and that is if the sun is out and it is energising the batteries of the tower. All those things continually come up. Please get us into the 21st century, or the 20th century. We are being driven by steam out there. Our faxes will not work and we cannot hit the Internet when we want to. Please, if you want us to be competitive, if you want us to drive forward, if you want us to be the exporters that carry the rest of this nation on our back, then give us the tools to do it with. This is the one and only opportunity and we may never have another opportunity to get the people in the bush up to speed with their telecommunications problems.
Opposition members interjecting—
—Order! There are far too many people interjecting.
—I can go backwards as well as anyone. I can look over my shoulder and take them back to the 1950s, but that is not going to drive this nation forward. You cannot live out there unless you have the gear to work with, and this is the only opportunity we will ever have to have the gear to work with. So I do not want any more criticism. You do not understand the bush; you have never understood the bush and you never will understand the bush.
You are trying to frighten them. You are trying to make them fear things and you will not succeed, because the people out there know that they must move forward and they cannot move forward with you. I have discussed this with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and I believe him. That is one thing that you can never understand: you have to have deals. You cannot even believe which 
 way either of you vote; you have to have show and tells. You never even trust each other; between the factions, you are always fighting about party positions.
Look what has happened to you, Senator Chris Schacht. You should be up on the top of the ticket. You are dumped almost to an unwinnable position because your factions do not even trust each other. You are one of the senior members over there and you have been dumped, absolutely dumped. You have been deserted by the Left, you have been cut off by the Right, and you have floated down right to the bottom of the ticket. But we do trust our coalition partners. If we did not trust them we would not be with them, we would walk out on them; but we do trust them. We believe in the bush that a handshake is as good as your word. They have given us a handshake and we trust them. Let us not have any more of this, `the National Party has deserted the bush'. The National Party is trying to take the bush into the 20th century and this may be the only opportunity that we get to do it.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-07-11,"—We have all been bucketed upon one way and another and I think perhaps we all ought to turn our collective cheeks and do what Barney Cooney said: have leave to say prayers, have a minute's peace and then get on with the proper debate.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-07-11,"—It is hardly surprising that there is a concern within the Senate that this debate we are having now ought to be had, because we were stopped from having this procedural debate when this bill was shoved on the Senate program. We were stopped from debating whether it was urgent; we were stopped from debating whether or not we should have put it on the program and suspended the program as it was.
It is hardly surprising that the Senate should feel that it is time we actually talked about the reason we are debating this Telstra bill in the first place. The fact is that that debate has been cut, and it is hardly a fair go for the government to say that the Senate should just tug their forelocks and do whatever the Prime Minister and Senator Harradine now say we are supposed to do. That is very different 
 from the role Senator Harradine has played in the past. I just want to put into this debate the reason there is so much tension in the National Party at the moment in relation to why this debate is being put on.
—You're an expert.
—No, I am not using my words; I am actually going to use the words of Senator O'Chee in the Brisbane hearing of the original sell-out of the first tranche of Telstra. Senator O'Chee said to a Mr McLean:
But the government is also making decisions and has made a commitment in terms of the delivery of 64 kilobyte services, and that will be maintained. What other evidence do you have to suggest that there is going to be any problem? You accept the fact that there are going to be price caps and you accept the fact that there are going to be untimed local calls . . . 
Mr Maclean said:
I'm only suggesting that the shareholders will have a say that is not there now.
Senator O'Chee said:
But there are lots of ways in which shareholders can improve the efficiency of an operation. I just want to get it clear: can you give me any evidence that will show that private shareholders will choose and will effect a change in policy which will ensure there is not a 64 kilobyte access and that they will not use other ways to improve the efficiency of the operation?
This was about the National Party telling their constituencies that everything was going to be okay. The first tranche was not going to be a problem and they would be guaranteed 64-kilobit access. Another witness at a Perth hearing, Mrs Lewis, said:
There are many people who do not have quality services. We do not have any guarantee of the quality of service. Those of us who are going on to the farmwide project at the moment have been given very definite instructions that there is no guarantee that it will work for us. We are buying the computers and everything else at a reasonable price, but there is absolutely no guarantee that the service will work.
Senator O'Chee said:
Would you feel comfortable if things like universal service obligations which require equitable access to services, price caps, provision of tariff information and directory assistance were contained in the legislation?  

Mrs Lewis said, `Yes'. Senator O'Chee said:
Because that is what is being proposed in this bill. We are also going to legislate for the post-1997 environment as well. Would that allay a lot of the concerns that might exist in the bush?
Later on, in response to the statement `That information about the 64 kilobytes is not in the bill', Senator O'Chee said:
No, that is government policy.
That is what this is about.
—It's about prayers.
—No, this is not a debate about prayers. This motion is about whether the Senate has leave to sit again and debate this travesty that the National Party have assisted in perpetrating on the bush because it was the National Party in the hearings who abused the witnesses who dared to suggest that the capacity for broadband would not be available to the bush under the privatised model, and shareholders would have a say. And this is what is happening.
What can you say to the bush now when it was the National Party who were given the role of abusing the rural constituents who came to that committee? It was the National Party who did that. Check the Hansard. That is what has happened and that is why the constituents are angry. We are here today not to deny leave on prayers; we are here to have the debate, or part of the debate, which should have happened two days ago: that the Senate should have a say in whether or not this bill is being brought on, whether it is urgent and whether it requires to be dealt with now. Quite frankly, all that we have had is a minister saying that the Senate had to pass this legislation now to fulfil the coalition's promise at the last election that they would not sell Telstra during this term of government. That is the farce of what we are being asked to debate here today. It is not about whether prayers should be given; it is about whether or not the Senate itself ought to be costing hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars to debate a farce which is a breach of a commitment from the government itself.
—It will soon be time for Sunday morning mass. All we want are the prayers. 
—The question is that the committee have leave to sit again at a later hour.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
—I suggest you be invited to read prayers.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-07-11,"—Pursuant to contingent notice of motion, I move:
That so much of standing order 142 be suspended as would prevent debate taking place on the motion.
It is not enough for just the three gags of yesterday; now we have the guillotine moved by the government. Why are they so afraid of this debate? Why do they want to limit debate on this issue of the full privatisation of Telstra, something they claim is so important? I think the truth of the matter is this: because the coalition government is embarrassed by the fact that this is a debate about a broken promise of Mr Howard. This bill should never have been before the parliament if Mr Howard had kept his word. This is the privatisation of Telstra that Mr Howard gave a solemn commitment in 1996 would not happen. This is the big lie. This makes Telstra just another non-core commitment of the Liberal government.
Of course it is even more embarrassing for the government because it has caused enormous tensions between the coalition partners. We have got the National Party in open revolt with the Liberal Party and we have got the National Party in open internal revolt. We 
 have got the Senate Nationals under incredible pressure from their own organisation, particularly in Queensland, and they have not got the bottle to stand up on this issue and be counted on behalf of rural and regional Australia.
The National Party in the Senate have sold their rural constituency out. This is the final nail in the coffin of the old National Party, the old Country Party—the Country Party that used to have the herbs to stand up to the Liberals in a coalition government. That is the old Country Party, the old National Party of Jack McEwen, of Doug Anthony and Ian Sinclair. It has gone forever. The new National Party are the National Party of Charles Blunt, Tim Fischer and Senator Boswell. The new National Party are the running dogs of the Liberal Party. The new National Party are the National Party that are in coalition government to just roll over and have their tummies tickled by the Liberals. That is what this debate is about.
What has become clear is that the only way the Australian community, particularly those people who live in the bush, particularly those people from rural and regional Australia, can have Telstra protected with majority public ownership is for those people, all Australians, to vote Labor at the next election.
The National Party is signing its own death warrant with this particular bill. In some ways, we do not mind that. We have got a lot of differences with the National Party. We do not particularly want to see the National Party replaced on the political stage obviously by the One Nation Party. What the National Party is trying to do is prove that it has been able to extricate out of the government about $400 million worth of bribes here, another $150 million of bribes there and one or two other things that Senator Harradine and Senator Colston have not admitted to the Senate or the Australian people. We want to know about it. We want to know about what deals are being done with Mr Howard behind closed doors.
We say this: if this vote goes through, if you gag debate, if you guillotine this debate, if you get this through contrary to John Howard's commitments at the last election, it 
 will be done on the basis of the tainted vote of Senator Colston—a vote bought by Mr Howard and he just cashed in some of the investment yesterday in Brisbane. This is an outrage. The only way the Australian people can stand up on this issue, can have their rights protected, and the bush can be protected is to vote Labor at the next election after this extraordinary sell-out by the Nationals and Mr Howard.",SENATE,<title>DECLARATION OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-11,"—We have seen here today the final epitaph of the National Party as a political force in this country. This is an infamous day for their own supporters. A handful of National Party senators have sold out their regional supporters, who have stuck with them through thick and thin since the 1920s. For 70 years they have supported this National Party and, before that, the Country Party to deliver certain benefits to the bush. The old Country Party made no bones about it. They were not sophisticated. They said, `Just give 
 us bagfuls of money to help our people in the bush.' The National Party today, led by Tim Fischer and by Senator Boswell in this place, have sold out to the Liberal Party and have just become a mere shadow faction of the Liberal Party. They have sold the bush out, aided and abetted, it appears, by two independent senators. I will come back to them in a moment.
The National Party, including the Deputy Prime Minister, have supposedly been saying that the announcement last week of the new mobile telephone system for the bush is an enormous benefit for their own people. This will enable them to get coverage equal to what they have with their existing analogue. There was two-minute Tim Fischer in the press conference holding up the new telephone, having pulled in the minister for communications to smile and look like a puppy dog and hold it with him. He told the minister for communications to hold up the diagram to show the new coverage. This was a big announcement and a big achievement for the bush. Yesterday, the National Party senators got up in here and explained this was a victory for them and that this new mobile telephone coverage was wonderful. It was a $420 million program.
It has been exposed since that Telstra were going to do this anyway. The National Party was sold a pup. They were going to get this system anyway. Today in the Canberra Times, Mr Blount, the Chief Executive of Telstra, has belled the cat absolutely in relation to the National Party and the government when he says that Telstra is no government stooge. The article says:
The Federal Government had nothing to do with Telstra's decision to roll out a new mobile-phone network . . . 
—Madam Chairman, I raise a point of order. The committee stage is meant for the detailed examination of legislation. We have been in the committee stage now since 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon and we are still on the preamble.
Senator Robert Ray interjecting—
—I take Senator Ray's interjection. The point of order I am raising is that we are only on the preamble after all 
 those hours since 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon. The amendment before the chair is the amendment by Senator Lees to delete the preamble of the bill. I am supporting it. I am waiting for Senator Schacht and others to say why I should not support Senator Lees's amendment.
—On the point of order: I think Senator Harradine's point of order, taken half an hour ago in the committee stage, would have been exceptionally valid. We probably have spent too long on the preamble. Now that Senator Harradine and everyone else has said to the opposition, `You can have seven hours to debate this bill', I say to Senator Harradine that we should be able to spend that seven hours—the miserable time we have been allocated—in whatever way we like.
—Order! There is no point of order. The matter under debate is whether the preamble should stand as printed. It is a very wide-ranging preamble. Therefore, the debate will be wide-ranging.
—It is certainly a wide-ranging preamble; I made that point in the debate yesterday. It covers all the issues. The preamble mentions the social bonus. We have had National Party senators telling us both in here and publicly what a wonderful social bonus it is and what a wonderful deal it is for the bush. We have been asking what the deal and the full social bonus are. What is the package?
We had a claim in the middle of the week that it was the new mobile telephone system. Why did Tim Fischer get up and claim that at the press conference? Why did he stand there holding the new phone up when he should have not been anywhere near it? Mr Blount said that it has nothing to do with Tim Fischer and that it is Telstra making a commercial decision. But Tim Fischer is out in the bush saying that this is a great victory for the National Party. He misled. Either he is a liar or Frank Blount is a liar because both of them cannot be right. Frank Blount has said today on the public record that it is a commercial decision, but Tim Fischer is claiming credit for it.
Senator Boswell should read very carefully this very interesting article. Telstra might do him in, even on the mobile phones. First of all, yesterday Senator Alston told us in some of the debate how rough, tough and vigorous he is in telling Telstra what to do. He says that he has been talking with them on a whole range of issues. He says that he is a tough minister. What does Frank Blount say today in the paper? He says:
""You know, this Government has not even said boo to me.""
This minister could not even say boo to Frank Blount, yet he was in here telling us yesterday that he has made all these arrangements and got a good outcome. Frank Blount says that the minister does not even say boo to him and that, even if he did, he would ignore it.
Senator Boswell should read this article in the Canberra Times. Frank Blount then says:
A final decision on the technology and the suppliers—
for the new CDMA—
was expected to be made at Telstra's August board meeting.
It has not been finalised. The article then says:
Mr Blount declined to specify a timeframe on the profitability of the network, saying it depended how the roll-out proceeded—with profitability achieved more quickly if the more densely populated areas were targeted first.
Guess what, Senator Boswell? Despite two-minute Tim holding up the new phone on Wednesday—
—Order! Senator Schacht, could you please refer to the Deputy Prime Minister by his title.
—Is that who you were talking about?
—I am referring to the Deputy Prime Minister. He held up that mobile phone.
—The toy one.
—Yes. Do you know what Mr Blount has now said? He said that it will not automatically mean that the bush will get connected first. Telstra will put the new CDMA network into the city first be 
 cause they can make a bigger quid out of it. Senator Boswell has been dudded again.
—Ripped off again!
—Ripped off. What sort of party is the National Party? This minister will not say boo to Telstra. The chief executive of Telstra on the public record has said that it will go into the most profitable areas first with the CDMA technology. So you are not going to get this system operating in the bush at the time analog goes out in 2000. The statement also says:
Mr Blount also stressed the board's decision related to a commitment to capital expenditure and the roll-out but not the CDMA . . . digital technology underpinning the network. Even so, he said he was about 80 per cent certain that Telstra would choose the CDMA technology.
Telstra has not yet committed itself to put into place what Mr Fischer was saying on Wednesday is a done deal. You have been dudded again.
This is an appalling performance by the National Party. `Black Jack' McEwen would be rolling over in his grave. Even Doug Anthony and Peter Nixon would not have fallen for this. Even old Sinkers, the old war horse—
—Order! Senator Schacht, would you please refer to Mr Speaker by his correct name?
—Mr Sinclair is now affectionately known as `Sinkers'. Mr Ian Sinclair was occasionally referred to by my former and late colleague Mick Young as `George Sinclair'. Not even Mr Sinclair would have fallen for this deal, Ronnie. He would have seen through it, but Senator Boswell has rolled over.
The National Party cannot now claim that this was not part of its deal when, on Wednesday, Mr Fischer made it clear in a presentation that this was a great deal for the bush and that it was his. Telstra is a bit miffed that this announcement was made before it had a chance to table its statement to the Stock Exchange. Telstra said that that happened because there were some administrative glitches which meant that Telstra's announcement was held up. I hope it was not one of those declining Telstra fax services which 
 meant that their own statement could not get out in time. But what was going on whereby the minister, Senator Alston, and Mr Fischer could hold a press conference and claim credit for what Mr Blount now says is a decision of Telstra made on a commercial basis when the minister has never said boo to Mr Blount about it?
We know now that on this issue of the new mobile telephone system the National Party has been done like a dinner. It has fallen for the pea and thimble trick. It has sold out its own members and constituency, who will not even get the technology first. They will put it in the city first. What a bunch of dills the National Party members are. They should have said, `Let's get it written down. The new transmitters are to go into the country first.' When the year 2000 came around, everyone would have a transmitter and would at least be able to buy the phone. But they will not have all the transmitters in the bush, according to Mr Blount. In the year 2000, there may well be the day when the analog phone drops out and Senator Boswell's constituents have no phone. The CDMA will not be operating. You do not have that written into the legislation or the deal, because Mr Blount says that you have not.
The next deal for the outback concerns $150 million provided to Telstra for the capital upgrade. But there is no written legislation, legislative decision or regulation guaranteeing that the charge rate will be what is set in the announcement made on Friday by the minister and the Deputy Prime Minister. So far, the deal that the Nationals have got that has been published is for $150 million. You are selling $40 billion worth of Telstra to get $150 million for the bush. You will not tell us what the rest of the deal is.
—Why should we?
—`Why should we?', says Senator Calvert. Only a Liberal senator would say that. Only a Liberal senator would interject and say, `We don't have to tell the public of Australia what is in the deal and why $40 billion of Australia's biggest, most profitable, most successful and most important company has to be sold on a secret deal. We will not tell the people of Australia what it is 
 while the legislation is going through to do it.' It is typical of the sleaze of the Liberal Party. I am just astonished that the National Party has fallen for it.
Senator Boswell said in his speech earlier in this debate, `We do know what the deals is but that we are not telling you.' Senator Harradine says that he knows what it is but that he is not telling us. Senator Harradine indicated that he had a fair idea what it is. They all know. They will vote in secret. They know what the secret deal is on this legislation, but the people of Australia will not. If it goes on the track record so far, if the rest of the secret, sleazy deal is anything like what the National Party has so far negotiated, they will have been done like a dinner by the Liberal Party. All they have so far is $150 million spread over four or five years for the upgrade. For that they are going to sell a $40 billion company.
I point out to Senator Boswell that each year in the bush, irrespective of the $150 million, Telstra spends over $800 million on capital works. The money he is talking about is a mere pittance. Last night the minister had to back down from his outrageous claim on the cost of making 64 kilobits capacity available to all Australians. Two weeks ago he said that it would cost $26 billion. Last night, he crept away from that. We were not asking that it be made compulsory, that you had to all be connected, but that you had to have the capacity if you wanted it. That is what we in the Labor Party have argued for 18 months. However, last night, in about four minutes, he dropped from $26 billion to $15 billion. I have never seen $10 billion go so quick in all my time in parliament.
But what has Senator Boswell negotiated? Knowing what this minister is doing to him, he has nothing. Whatever he has will be minuscule compared to the long-term needs. Even if he gets something for online services in terms of kilobit capacity for the next year or so, as his colleague De-Anne Kelly, the member for Dawson, said, what happens in five years time when new technology comes in? There is nothing left of Telstra to sell. You cannot sell it again to get a social bonus to upgrade the bush further. We know that 64 
 kilobits will be needed and we absolutely support it as a minimum in the next couple of years. But by the middle of the next decade people will be arguing that they want that capacity increased to three or four megabits to get real-time online services. What will you sell of Telstra to get that to the bush? You will not have anything left. Where will you get the money from? The cities will get it; the rich suburbs and the CBDs will get it. They will get five megabits, but the bush will still be stuck with only 64 kilobits. When they ask where they will get it from, there will be nothing left to sell. Telstra has already gone. They will not want to raise taxes. People in the bush will have to pay an outrageous fee to get that further upgrade or they will not get it at all.
For a momentary gain here, they are selling $40 billion worth of Australia's best company, providing 100 per cent of telecommunications services to the bush, to get a few baubles onto the deck now. This is an outrageous performance by the National Party. It is their demise. This is the day they die. This is the day the old boys of the Country Party turn over in the grave and realise that One Nation, unfortunately, is going to replace them in the bush.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-07-11,"—First of all, Senator Schacht is again wrong. He is talking about $160 million. I do not know where that figure comes from. He believes what he reads in the press. The figure clearly was $183 million. Perhaps it was not him. I thought he mentioned the figure of $160 million.
—I said $16 billion, from what the minister was saying, for 64 kilobits.
—My apologies if he did not. I just heard it as I passed one of the sets. What I wanted to make very clear is that around this chamber, particularly around this area of the chamber, there is a great deal of insistence upon the need to ensure that rural and regional Australia is protected in regard to this measure. It is important to note that the government has agreed to this, and that is something that exercises one's mind when considering this matter.
We still have a little way to go today. There has been a substantial amount of time already put aside, and I think we ought to get to the details of the legislation. Before I do that, I am still very firmly conscious of the need to ensure that the people of the state that I represent are properly cared for. That is what I am elected for. I would have thought that the fact that Tasmania is an island state was an important factor to be recognised and that living on an island, wherever it might be, was very important. It is particularly important to have very good communications in those circumstances, and that is an important matter which I am sure is very firmly in the minds of the government. There are no secret deals around the place. The government knows my attitude about that, and they know the merits of ensuring that islanders are given the best of communications, particularly because they do not have the other land communications.
The amendment that I am moving states, in effect, that this legislation is automatically repealed unless it is proclaimed within two months of the new parliament. The position is that this legislation does not sell Telstra. It is legislation which enables the next government, whichever it might be, to sell another tranche of Telstra—say, 49 per cent, 75 per cent or the total.
—Why shouldn't it be the next parliament?
—Why shouldn't the next government have the right to make that decision?
—The question has been raised with me as to why the next parliament should not do that. The government has—I think quite properly—indicated that this is a matter that should be fairly and squarely on the table during the election as not only a never-never possibility of a policy but something which the people can vote for. When I say they have properly done that, I think maybe they have done it unwisely.
—No, very deliberately!
—I say unwisely because the Labor side expects to be in power after the next election. No doubt they will be running a strong campaign and those who 
 believe this is a very crucial issue will be able to vote for them, not the government. That is the position.
If the opposition does come into power after the next election, it has said it is not going to proclaim it. But if they get different ideas in the meantime, this amendment says that unless it is proclaimed within two months of the new parliament, it is repealed. That applies to whichever government is in power, whether it be the current government or the opposition. I think that is an eminently reasonable thing for people to expect.
I am against the preamble. I believe it is nothing more nor less than a poorly written piece of propaganda, and I do not think it is appropriate to have that in the preamble, particularly if it is able, in extreme circumstances, to be used as a guide to the interpretation of the law. I believe that we can now speak specifically on the amendments, and I would like to hear some responses around the chamber as to whether my amendment is acceptable or not. I hope the opposition will accept it and I hope the government will accept it.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-07-11,"—We have before us today a proposition which says that the Senate should be given seven hours to debate the privatisation of Telstra. Telstra is one of the most successful companies in our history and has taken—effectively, in terms of its infrastructure—the better part of four generations to build. The heritage and the legacy that we will be leaving for future generations of Australia as a result of this debate is, I think, one that requires a little more discussion than seven hours. The government would like to suggest to us—
—On top of 17 we have already had.
—It really would not matter to me if you said that it was 17 hours or just the remaining seven. The fact remains that you today have moved a guillotine motion to force this debate through to its conclusion within seven hours. The debate on the privatisation of $50 billion worth of public assets is to be rammed through this parliament. 
—It was only $42 billion a minute ago.
—You say it is $42 billion. That is part of the debate, isn't it? The value of Telstra is very much part of the debate. What we have here is a broader question about the value of Telstra which you do not want debated. You do not want that discussed in this country. It is very fortunate for the Liberal Party—but not so fortunate for the National Party—that this issue will be debated throughout the length and breadth of this country. It will be debated because Australians feel very strongly about this issue. A majority of Australians have demonstrated in public opinion polls time and time again that they are strongly opposed to the sale of Telstra. They have made it very clear. The reasons are very straightforward. This is a fundamentally strategic part of the Australian economy. I would go much further and say that Telstra has a vital part to play in the Australian way of life.
This debate goes to the very simple question of the way in which Australians communicate with one another. This government does not want to hear about that; it does not want to hear about the cost of its measures. It certainly does not want to hear about the way in which the National Party has undermined itself and destroyed its political credibility. For a very, very cheap price, the National Party has given away generations of supporters, the people who have defended the party for as long as Telstra has been being built. Those two organisations have been around for about the same length of time. It is an extraordinary coincidence, I suppose, when you look at the way in which generation after generation of Australians have invested in this entity to build this nation, and what we have got from the National Party is a miserable, sleazy arrangement to undermine that commitment of generations of Australians.
The National Party's actions are predicated on a great fear that time is catching up with them. What we have seen in recent times is that, throughout rural Australia, there is a complete rejection of the National Party because they have failed in their basic task in 
 political life—that is, to defend regional and rural Australia.
The National Party was founded in the 1920s in Victoria, in my state. It was founded to represent essentially the interests of small, individual holders, and it has built coalitions of support in government throughout much of this century. It has sought to establish through public ownership a whole network of enterprises to protect the living standards of people in regional and rural Australia. But what has it done now? It has capitulated to the economic rationalists. It has capitulated to those in the Liberal Party, those who represent the interest of big capital in this country, at the expense of small capital. What for? To save a few miserable seats in here.
The writing is on the wall for the National Party. All they are doing is putting in neon lights the fact that they are completely dominated by the Liberal Party. I do not know why they bother. They ought to just fold their tent and disappear into the night. Amalgamate with the Liberal Party and be done with it. They would probably get a better deal in an amalgamation than they have in this pitiful effort to try to present themselves as an independent political force in this country, because quite clearly they are not capable of representing the interests of regional and rural Australia. I say again that Jeff Kennett was right. In Victoria, where I know them best, the National Party are just not up to it.
—What did he say about McGauran?
—He said that about Senator McGauran specifically, but he was referring to the National Party more generally. I know there is some sort of coalition arrangement, or so they say, in Victoria. The coalition is pretty straightforward: you do what you are told. That is what it is. It is a simple agreement; the National Party does what it is told. What has been the consequence? We have seen seat after seat in Victoria where the National Party's vote has collapsed. Independents are being elected in provincial parts of Victoria which we have not seen for generations. We have seen the seat of Murray, which the National Party held for 25 years, lost to the Liberal Party. People know they 
 will not get value for money with the National Party. Why would they go to the middleman? What is the old story about the monkey and the organ grinder? Why would they waste their time? That is basically the proposition that is emerging here today.
The issue now is why the National Party simply will not do anything to stand up for the interests of their constituents. Why have they failed so miserably to get off their knees? Why do they need to grovel? Why do they need to basically prostrate themselves before the Liberal Party in such a disgracefully humiliating way? When I was at school, I used to think about the National Party. It perhaps was not in very kind terms, I would have to say. I have never had a fondness for the National Party, but I always had some respect for them. You might not have liked them, but you had a respect for them.
—They made a good deal.
—They were able to cut a good deal. We had Peter Nixon, Mr Ian Sinclair and Doug Anthony all following in the traditions of McEwen. They had the capacity to deliver, but we have seen none of that here and we certainly will not see it with this arrangement. In fact what we have got is the complete surrender of the National Party. We have seen an absolutely disgraceful performance from the National Party with their silence in Victoria. Three thousand jobs have been lost as a direct result—I say, a direct result—of the bid by Telstra to improve its share value by removing workers from its payroll. It has reduced costs at the expense of service to customers and, as a direct consequence of that, some 3,000 jobs have been lost in Victoria over the last 18 months. But have we heard anything from Senator McGauran? Not a word—absolute stony silence.
—He was after No. 2 preselection.
—Of course, he is No. 2 on their Senate ticket, but not a word has been heard from Senator McGauran. Have we heard anything from Peter McGauran, his brother? No, despite the fact that 20 per cent of the jobs have been lost in the family seat of Sale. So we have the intellectually handi 
 capped brother unable to represent the interests in the Senate and we have the great patriarch of the family in Sale but, despite the fact that 20 per cent of the Telstra jobs in Sale have been lost, we have heard not one word. Let us look at the situation with regard to the Mallee. Have we heard anything from Mr Forrest? Not a word—again, silence.
This demonstrates quite clearly that the coalition has degenerated into what is essentially a very bad marriage. They say to me that a really bad marriage is made up of a husband who is essentially blind and a wife who is essentially deaf. To me, that pretty much represents the situation with regard to the Liberal Party and the National Party today. You have a case where one of them, frankly, does not want to see and another one that does not want to hear.
The views of the electorate are being expressed. Whether you like it or not, you will be made to hear because, overwhelmingly, a majority of Australians just will not stand for your capitulation. As a consequence, you will be removed from the political debate in this country. Despite my antipathy to the National Party, I do have a soft spot for them, and I certainly would not want to see them go at the expense of what clearly is a fascist organisation like One Nation.
What really gets to the heart of this question, as far as I am concerned, is your appalling political judgment. In the Age today, you can see the expression from some of your members who are beginning to get the message from the organisation outside of these protected and cloistered walls. They are beginning to hear, for instance, Mr Katter say that he believes the deal you have done, the way you have prostituted yourselves to the Liberal Party, will be very damaging. He says in the Age this morning:
I think it will cost them very dearly in the next election.
—Did he say he was going to cross the floor?
—We will wait and see what he actually does, just as we will wait and see whether or not there is anyone in the cocky's corner here who actually has any 
 courage to defend their convictions. One wonders.
We hear from Mrs De-Anne Kelly that, although the package of measures was welcome—she is moving already—it did not address the central concern. She said:
It is going to be very hard for the Telstra board to justify spending billions in infrastructure in rural and regional areas where it is not going to pay for itself.
Quite clearly, there is deep concern. I am sure by the time you get home on Monday, Senator Boswell, you will know about it because your organisation will be on to you. The National Party is strange in some ways. It has this relationship with an extra parliamentary organisation, a bit like the Labor Party. I know that things are done in a parliamentary party, because the parliamentary parties know better, of course—there is a tendency, unfortunately, for people to accept things as being simple when they are not quite so simple—but, when you get home, you actually find that the extra parliamentary party has a few things to say to you. I suspect, Senator Boswell, that quite a few things are going to be said to you.
Quite frankly, the proposals that you are advancing are a complete con job. You are being completely sucked in. People are going to want to know whether or not you have been persuaded out of complete panic, or whether or not you have actually understood what you have committed yourself to.
Senator Ray explained the other day his experience as a younger man how positions would be taken by friends who came down from the country who were offered chocolates when, in fact, they were presented with laxatives. That analogy is similar to what is happening here. Senator Alston has offered what you think are chocolates. You will soon discover that they are in fact laxatives. When you go home, people are going to point out to you that they have had enough of taking the laxatives and they are going to take it out on you.
With regard to the business community of this country, we have already seen very deep reservations being expressed about the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and concerns being 
 expressed for the need for change within the Liberal Party. I hope you are not laid down as the traction in the battle between Costello and Howard. The business community, as demonstrated in the Business Review Weekly poll this week, have indicated that already very deep reservations have been expressed there on one central issue—that is, the failure of this government to deal with the issues that have been raised by One Nation, the threat of One Nation.
The poll of 150 top executives demonstrates that the preferred Prime Minister perhaps will not be Mr Howard for much longer. I hope you made sure you had a few side bets on the deals that you have entered into now because the whole operation of the Liberal Party is about to change. That poll demonstrates that 83 per cent of those 150 top executives are totally dissatisfied with this government, the way in which it has failed to respond to the threat from the fascists within One Nation.
You, Senator Boswell, are going to be used for traction in that fight. I say quite sincerely that it will be deeply disappointing to see your party replaced by extremist elements within rural Australia. You have not demonstrated the power of the National Party in this coalition but its impotence. You have actually given aid and comfort to One Nation by accepting what is a lousy proposition which will sell out rural interest in this country and will undermine the capacity of Australians to have high quality technology.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-07-11,"—I intend to comment about two—
—Madam Chairman, on a point of order—
—You were slow in getting to your feet. I will call you on the next occasion.
—Madam Chairman, you have called three speakers from that side.
—So you want to gag us and then take all the time as well.
—I want a fair share of the time. 
—Senator Boswell, Senator Harradine was speaking from the other side.
—Senator Harradine may be geographically placed on this side of parliament, but he is an Independent.
—Senator Boswell, I did see Senator Sherry first. I have indicated to you that I will call you on the next occasion. I think that resolves the matter.
—Senator Boswell knows full well that Senator Harradine is supporting your very poor package, and I am going to make some comments about the contents of the package shortly. I do want to raise a couple of issues with Senator Harradine quite specifically. We have seen yet another example of the failure of the National Party—Senator Boswell too slow to get to his feet. That is the story of the National Party right throughout the sale of Telstra and on most other issues. Senator Calvert and Senator Alston are muttering under their breaths, expressing their contempt at how bad the National Party is, how poorly they perform.
—I said that Bozzie is very quick on his feet.
—On this occasion he was too slow, wasn't he, Senator Alston? As I say, it typifies the approach of the National Party when it comes to representing rural and regional Australia. I will go to a couple of issues relating to the National Party. I am sure Senator Boswell will endeavour to respond and find excuses for their poor performance on this and other related issues over recent years.
I wanted to take up a couple of matters with Senator Harradine quite directly. I did listen to Senator Harradine's contribution yesterday about the economic gains, the bottom line improvement to the budget of government debt, that may or may not result from the sale of Telstra. He did not express a view. I think he did indicate that he had received conflicting advice about this matter.
I did spend some time in my contribution in the debate on the second reading on issues relating to the proceeds from the further two- 
 thirds sale of Telstra—$40 billion to $45 billion, around that figure—and the bottom line gain by the reduction of government debt, assuming an average of six per cent interest charges, vis-a-vis the loss of the payment of the dividend from the Telstra shares that the government owns, which at the moment is two-thirds. There is also the issue of the dividend increasing in future years and then at some point in time the loss to the government of the dividend, because even though debt is initially reduced there will be the loss of the dividends that increase in future through government owning two-thirds of Telstra. In the first five or six years the government will make a gain because of the reduction of debt, but in five or six years or maybe longer, even seven years—it seems from all the economic advice that I and the Labor Party have seen that it could be a maximum number of 10 years—the government will start losing money because of the loss of the dividend stream.
I would like Senator Harradine to indicate what his view is of that issue, which I think is very important. We have spent a lot of time rightly talking about the effects in rural and regional Australia of the loss of government ownership of Telstra, the importance of government direction to Telstra as at least a two-thirds publicly owned corporation and the government's ability to ensure a fair distribution of investment and that pricing policies in rural and regional Australia do not disadvantage people who live in those regions. We have spent a lot of time on that, quite rightly.
The issue that we are debating is the two-thirds sale of Telstra. That is another breach of the Prime Minister's commitment to the Australian people. He said that he would not be selling Telstra prior to the next election and that if they were re-elected then he would make an announcement and present legislation. Unfortunately, we are dealing with the sale of two-thirds of Telstra here today in the Senate and expected to pass this legislation prior to the next election. Senator Harradine is supporting that. He has indicated that.
I would like Senator Harradine to indicate, not just to the Senate but via the record to the Tasmanian people whom he represents—and 
 we should note that if we have a half Senate election, and we are assuming that we will, Senator Harradine will be up for election whenever that may be—what his position is. When that election occurs, will Senator Harradine be supporting the sale of Telstra, the two-thirds remaining government ownership of Telstra? What will he indicate to the people of Tasmania about his position? How are they expected to vote? What is his position? Does he agree with the sale of Telstra, the remaining two-thirds, or does he not agree with that? Quite rightly, people in Tasmania will want to know what Senator Harradine's position is. He cannot have it both ways.
Telstra is a major issue of public debate at the moment. The supporters of Senator Harradine in Tasmania will want to know whether to vote for him or not if they are concerned about this issue, as at least some of them will be. I would like Senator Harradine to tell us what position he will take in the forthcoming election. That is a very important issue that I would like Senator Harradine to address.
Senator Harradine has foreshadowed an amendment that if the legislation is not proclaimed within two months of the election then this legislation will be wiped from the books. I understand that Labor is going to support that amendment. But our position was made very clear by our shadow minister, Senator Schacht, yesterday. Senator Harradine, whether your amendment is passed or not, Labor, if it is elected, will immediately move to reverse this legislation if it is regrettably passed.
I would like to make a few comments about the National Party. Over the last week we have had some National Party members in the House of Representatives and a number of their senators, mainly via doorstops on their entrance to the Senate and I assume endorsed leaks from their leader, Mr Fischer, protesting about the sale of Telstra in a variety of forms. Mr Paul Neville said in the Daily Telegraph:
The government should sell only a further 16 per cent of Telstra and leave the telecommunications giant 51 per cent in government hands.
We will be interested to see how Mr Neville votes on this matter when it goes back to the 
 House of Representatives. In a similar theme, my attention was drawn to the Age  of Friday, 3 July, in which Senator Sandy Macdonald warned that his crucial Senate vote would support the sale of only a further 16 per cent of Telstra, leaving the company 51 per cent government owned. What is in this bill? Senator Boswell is looking a little bit bemused—and rightly he should be. I am sure Senator Sandy Macdonald is a little bit bemused. This bill does not say, `16 per cent of Telstra being sold'; it says, `Sell the whole lot off. Sell the two-thirds off.'
—It does not.
—That is the effect of it, Sen Harradine. Don't get too excited. I would like you to address the critical issues that I raised earlier in this debate. I have listened to your contribution to the debate. I hold some considerable respect for your negotiating skills. I would like a response to the questions that I raised with you earlier in my contribution.
Senator Sandy Macdonald is not the only one. I was a little disappointed that my leader, Senator Faulkner—though he did refer to a number of contributions to the issue of the sale of Telstra—did not go into a lot of the background of Senator McGauran. Senator McGauran has been extensively criticised for his performance by the Premier of Victoria. Mr Kennett has been very vigorous in his criticism of his colleague in the current coalition. Senator Boswell would recall the very vigorous criticisms of Senator McGauran by the Premier of Victoria about his supposed—I think it is probably true—lack of performance.
Senator McGauran made some headlines about two or three years ago. He had taken a trip to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands or to Christmas Island and he discovered a thong on the beach. He came back to Australia and complained bitterly about pollution of the environment because he had discovered a thong that had floated up on the beach. The environment is a legitimate concern, but that sent the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, into a rage. He said that if the discovery of a thong on the beach was the only contribution that Senator McGauran could make to public 
 debate in Australia, then his preselection should be removed.
But the National Party decided, in its wisdom, that Senator McGauran should be sent to Tasmania. Why was Senator McGauran sent down to Tasmania? The National Party do not exist in Tasmania. They made an attempt about 20-25 years ago. We—and this is one area where I am sure Senator Calvert would agree with me—are happy the National Party does not exist in Tasmania. They sent Senator McGauran down there as the Tasmanian liaison officer to re-form the National Party and to advise them in the state election in early 1983. It was a magnificent triumph! Senator McGauran was down in Tasmania rebuilding the Nationals, and I do not think they got more than 300 or 400 votes in any seat. They might have got a few more votes, but they got less than one or two per cent of the vote. Senator McGauran was sent down to Tasmania to re-form the National Party for the state election. It was an dismal failure. What has happened to the National Party in Tasmania? It is not surprising. I do not know whether Senator Boswell has been talking to Senator McGauran, but what was left of the old National Party—
—Do you mean Chester?
—In fact, I was going to get onto Chester Summerville, Senator Calvert. Chester Summerville, the former head of the National Party in Tasmania, has joined One Nation. That is a sign of the times. I have to admit to some slight embarrassment. One or two former members of the National Party, who were signed up by Senator McGauran, have actually joined the Labor Party. I should not be too embarrassed because Senator Faulkner rightly drew our attention to the fact that the nephew of Mr McEwen, formerly known as `Black Jack', the great dynamo of the National Party, is now standing for parliament. He is so appalled—
—In McEwen.
—That is right. In the seat named after Black Jack McEwen, that dynamo of the National Party. He has been motivated to stand for parliament.
—Which party?
—But which party is he standing for? He is standing for the Labor Party! The poor old National Party have gone into hysterics in the last week. Every time they have passed the media at the door of the Senate, they have been making impassioned pleas about the great deal they are delivering for the bush, regional Australia. We have had Senator Sandy Macdonald saying, `We will not allow more than 16 per cent of Telstra to be sold.' We will be interested to see his vote. We have had Senator McGauran making a lot of noise about it. My colleague Shayne Murphy has referred to a very interesting article in the Australian Financial Review —time does not allow me to go through it—written by Finola Burke. Senator Boswell, I urge you to read that article because it really does expose the way in which the Liberal minister, Senator Alston, has conned you. In reality, the amount of money that is to be spent on the package—
—Chicken feed.
—Absolute chicken feed. You have been conned, yet again. You have been rolled by the Liberal Party. Your problem is that your supporters see no difference between the National Party and the Liberal Party. Senator Boswell, in your heart of hearts, you know that is true. That is why you have been in absolute panic and overdrive in the last week trying to differentiate yourself from the Liberal Party. But it will not work. People out in rural and regional Australia—everywhere for that matter—are not silly. They know that the National Party no longer represents rural and regional Australia. By selling the remaining two-thirds of Telstra, you sell out their interests, Senator Boswell. You know that is what they are saying to you. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Boswell, Sen Ronald",NP,1998-07-11,"—This seven hours which has been allocated to the parliament to—
—Sell out your heritage; seven hours to sell it out.
—debate the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998 will be devoted to bashing the National Party. If that is the choice of those opposite, 
 every time they do so, I will get up and defend it. So you will not have seven hours—
—We have already gone 20 hours.
—We have already gone 20 hours. But if you want to do that, that is okay. I will stand up every time and reiterate our—
—Have you read the article?
—No, I have not read the article—but I will reiterate the position of the National Party. Senator Carr has raised some very relevant points. Yes, we do have a challenge; we certainly do have a challenge in the bush. We can walk away from that challenge and say that we will not take our people forward; we will not give them the communications that they need; we will not listen to the NFF, the people of isolated children and the country women who have all made representations to a Senate inquiry about their need for communication technology which they want.
And yes, we can get spooked, if we allow ourselves to, with the One Nation invasion coming over us. But that would be the very wrong thing to do—to react against what is not right, what is not in the best interests of the NFF, who represent the farmers through their commodity groups like the sugar group, the united graziers, the wool people, the grain growers. They all meet and they know what they want; they have a communications committee that has put their shopping list to us.
So, too, did the parents of isolated children. About three weeks ago they came down here and said to the National Party, `Please allow us to educate our kids through this technology that is available—but not to us; we cannot get it.' We listened to them. We listened to the CWA ladies when they came down and made their presentation to the Senate committee. They were unanimous in what they want.
That is what we have tried to get an agreement on—not only with the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Alston, but also with the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). On three occa 
 sions we have been down there trying to get—and we have done so successfully, I believe—a package to go to those in the bush that will take them forward, that will give them the latest communications.
We could walk away and say, `Yes, we've got to throw the anchor out because the hordes are coming.' But that is not the way to do it. You could try to outflank the One Nation Party by driving out past it further to the right and leading people back into the 1950s. Yes, it has some electoral appeal; it is what you call `populist politics'. You can do that. It is not hard to do what Pauline Hanson does. Anyone opposite can do it, and anyone on this side can do it—go out, listen to what people tell you, repeat it back to them, and your vote will go up. But it is not leading in the right direction.
This is something that I will continually repeat: the people who represent the bush through the commodity organisations—the United Graziers Association, the Cane Growers Association, the Cattlemen's Union—know what they need out there. So they come down here and make representations to us, and they then expect us to perform. That is what we are doing; we are performing. I will just give the chamber a typical example of our constituents' problems—and you are quite correct, Senator Carr; the National Party do keep in touch with their constituency. A woman rang me. Her name is Wendy—
—It doesn't matter.
—Well, it does not matter.
—It does matter.
—All right. Let us just get her name then. Here it is, Wendy Bailey. I have rung Mrs Bailey on a continual basis. She has had a problem; her phone bill is $3,200.
—You cannot remember her name.
—Of course I remember her name. I have it here, I have written it down and I will repeat it. She writes:
This package that is negotiated, it will be a big help to us . . . and we are very grateful to them for doing what they have done. 

That is just one way that the National Party communicates with its constituents. Mrs Bailey sent me a letter. I gave that letter to the Prime Minister and said, `Here is a cry from the bush; fix it up.' The response to that from Senator Alston was our increasing the time limit to 12 minutes and reducing the pastoral rate for a local call to 25c. There is the response. That woman is coming back and saying, `Yes, thank you. The National Party has helped us; it's a big help.'
I am also grateful to Senator Schacht because last night he pointed out that the National Party, while it may have gained this telecommunications reduction in price, was being conned and that it was not in the legislation—and that you do not trust the Liberal Party anyhow because they have disagreement between their factions. I put this to Senator Alston. He said, `Well, look, if you've got a problem with it, let's put it in the legislation.' I think he has given instructions to his office that an amendment will be brought forward, and I will move that amendment and Senator Ian Macdonald will second it.
—It took us to bring it to your attention.
—No, there is a difference. We actually trust people. We have been in coalition for 30 or 40 years, and there is a trust between us.
—They have dudded you, Senator Boswell.
—There is no dudding us. There is a trust between us. That is totally different from you guys. You do not trust each other. The Left does not trust the Right—in fact, they hate each other—and the middle gets squeezed out all the time. That is the difference. But Senator Schacht is quite correct because I have asked Senator Alston to give us an amendment, and he has agreed to pass that amendment.
We have been going now for 20 hours and there are six hours left of the seven hours. If you continually ask what the National Party have done or have not done for rural people, that is your prerogative, but do not expect me to fold because you put the pressure on. I 
 have had pressure on all my life. I have had to make a decision in this parliament on whether I try to drive the rural organisations forward and look after the bush, whether I try to give them communications that they can live with and whether I can get them out of the steam-driven communications they have now.
I have had to make a decision on whether I can do all that or whether I have to run scared of One Nation. I have decided that if you show fear you will always be frightened. I am not going to do it. I am not going to try to outflank Pauline Hanson to the right. I am not going to lead my constituents back into the 1950s because there is no future in that. Yes, there are problems in the bush. We know that. I have not rolled over and I will never roll over. I have stood up for the bush in this place on many occasions. I have crossed the floor. I have an agreement with the Prime Minister that he will take the bush into the 20th century in technology. I believe him and I believe that we need to go—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Opposition senators know that excessive interjections are disorderly and that remarks in this chamber are supposed to be directed through the chair. Would you please obtain some decorum. No doubt you will have an opportunity later in the day to respond to Senator Boswell's remarks in a formal way.
—We have been in this game for 75 years. We have been in tight corners many times. Yes, we could roll over and say that it is too hard. But what sort of representation would that be if you said, `It is too hard. We have to be careful of what One Nation does. Let's retreat and don't do what is right for our constituency'?
Senator Schacht, you are correct when you say that we are a party based on grassroots. We are a party that connects with all our constituency through their commodity boards and commodity organisations. We listen to them. They are unanimously saying to us as one, `Please give us a communications system that will allow us to carry our farming business, that will allow us to connect up with the 
 world markets so that we can see what the cotton price is today in London, England and what the market is for beef.'
—Have you given them 64 kilobits?
—Order! Senator Schacht!
—It is all right, Mr Temporary Chairman. They know they are wrong. They know that they want to go back into the 1950s. The National Party is a party for today and tomorrow. It has a great history, a great past. We are not going to look over our shoulder continually. The future is out there. The future is for us. We are going to take our people into the future and not look over our shoulder backwards.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-07-11,"—Originally I intended to try to bring this debate back to the preamble, where I think we have been for about seven hours. It was a vain hope, but I thought we might at least try to do that. However, I cannot let some of Senator Boswell's comments go unanswered. I begin by agreeing with him that there were lots of people that came before not only this committee hearing but also the committee that I chaired on the first sale. On the first occasion many people from the bush pleaded with us to listen to them about their appalling communications. I do not think anyone in this chamber will argue with that. It should have been done many years ago. We sat through all of that and then had to deliberate on whether or not selling this huge organisation was the way to fix the problems. I think at best, looking at all we can look at, which are the results of the sale of the first third, we can say that it has not delivered.
The people that came before the committee that I chaired explained everything—from their lack of access full stop to the breakdown problems and all the difficulties they had. They then listened to all the promises that the government made about how wonderful things would be. The government promised that things would get better once Telstra was privatised. In a moment I will go through some of the figures that I mentioned in my speech during the second reading debate. It 
 does not matter what measurement you take—whether you take the length of time to fix a fault, the length of time to get a phone connected in rural Australia—we have gone steadily and rapidly backwards in the last couple of years.
How this government believes that selling the rest is going to make things suddenly enormously better I do not know. One of the amendments I will deal with in a moment looks at preventing the sale until such time as we get the service levels back up to where they were three years ago—in other words, putting the sale on hold until such time as there is at least a basic service for the existing quality in the bush, and then reconsidering whether or not we do want to sell the rest.
The package, which we do not know anything about—presumably it has at least a billion dollars in it, by the sound of it—may, for some people in rural areas, finally get them a service that is at least reliable. Maybe some people will have better Internet access. Senator Boswell was right, again, when he talked about bringing some people in the bush up to date—in other words, 1998-99.
When this pork-barrelling exercise is over, the money has run out, Telstra has been sold and we are in 2004 or 2005, who knows what is over the horizon? By the look of it—we are on the verge of a whole raft of new technology—the private company is going to make exactly the same decision as it has in the last couple of years: `Sorry, it's too expensive.'
—That is why you have customer service guarantees.
—And that service guarantee is not worth the paper that it is written on, Minister.
—That is why you have fines, if necessary.
—This is why we have fines! Big deal! Eleven dollars or something for not connecting. Wow! If I were Telstra making $3 billion or $4 billion a year—
—A $10 million fine if necessary.
—You refused yesterday when questioned to even say what was going 
 to trigger the bigger fines. The company is going to say, `We can pay that.' Of course, we have to remember that individuals actually have to know where to get the forms they need to actually go and complain and then maybe be eligible for some of the payments. So I think that Senator Boswell is very misguided to believe that this really is in the long-term benefit of the people his party claims to represent.
Let us try to get back to the preamble and start looking through some of the amendments that we have, as we are able to do at this time. By the sound of it, the preamble is going to disappear. I am very pleased to note that not just Senator Harradine but also the government seems to now agree that it is basically a political statement, that it has got some real minefields in it and that we simply cannot make some of these outrageous claims about what the benefits of a full privatisation are.
I would like to move on and start looking at what we are trying to do in some of the rest of our amendments. We have, after all, only six hours left and some 50-odd amendments to deal with. I would like to look at the second Democrat amendment, which I understand will be the next one put because a couple of Senator Bourne's amendments, which she will explain shortly, are either lapsing or being moved further down the list. Our second amendment seeks to amend the most undemocratic and, indeed, constitutionally suspect aspect of this bill. This amendment seeks to modify the proclamation date for the legislation so that it falls after the new parliament takes effect, which is 1 July 1999. Remember, as we go to this next election, presuming it is a half-Senate election—if we have got rid of the double dissolution possibilities—the new Senate does not take its place until then.
This amendment assures that we actually test the mandate. In other words, we do not just look to the House of Representatives but we test the mandate in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. We believe that this is essential, because we really do not know how the next parliament will be constituted. If the Howard government is re-elected, 
 the polls tell us very clearly that it will not have a majority in this House.
We have to ask the government why the value of the Senate vote is discounted by simply putting the proclamation only in the House of Representatives. What happens if, as the polls suggest, the House of Representatives produces a party that does not actually have a majority? Who knows? We could see, hopefully, a couple of Democrats down there. We would, I would think, have Mr Andren back and maybe Mr Paul Zammit as well. We see in the South Australian parliament now a number of Independents in the lower house. We believe that it is simply not good enough to just push it through the House of Representatives. If we are to keep Mr Howard to his promise that Telstra will be sold only if the people approve it, then it must be tested in both houses.
We have had some undertakings from the Labor Party. Perhaps Senator Schacht would like to develop these further in terms of the promises from the Labor Party. They have talked about actually getting rid of this bill. We are seeking to hear, too, further commitments that the Labor Party will not move at any time while they are in government, if that is what the situation is after the election, to put this issue back before us. Also, by testing this issue in both houses of parliament after the election, it gives the opposition—whoever that is—an opportunity to make their points of view as well.
The Clerk Assistant (Procedure) has advised the Democrats that this clause actually breaches the separation of powers enshrined in the constitution. Section 51 makes it clear that this parliament is supposed to make the laws, yet this bill basically leaves the final decision to the Executive Council, to the cabinet, and it therefore breaches the constitution. It is dubious on political grounds, but it is also dubious on constitutional grounds.
My amendment is similar to the one which was accepted by all parties in the digital television bill last week; this is nothing new. It says that the proclamation date must be approved by the resolution of both houses. This will test the mandate properly. The National Party, hopefully, will have had the 
 opportunity to go back to their electorate and have further input from rural people, not just about the sorts of services they want but how they believe they can be delivered. Therefore, as we get further on in this debate, I will be moving, effectively, that we take the date out to 1 July 1999, which is when the new Senate is constituted, and then we make sure that this proposition is put before both houses. Hopefully we will not let the government do what this one is unceremoniously trying to do—that is, to stomp on the rights of the Senate.
I want to touch on a couple of other Democrat amendments which, when we get to those sections of the bill, will speed up the process. The Democrats' third amendment simply opposes the entire clause that lets the Commonwealth sell the rest of Telstra. We will oppose it absolutely. I remind the government here that the long-term picture is not the one that they paint. If you look at the forecast of where Telstra is going—and, yes, you do all your sums and you take off the debt repayments—if you put all the figures on the table, you will see that we will have a $4 billion black hole in the public purse six years out from now.
The next time I seek the call I will read some of the full budget impacts of the Telstra sale because the government conveniently leaves out things such as franking credits. It likes to put on the table only the sets of figures that it wants to talk about. I would also like to look at the enormous pressure that is going to be put on the regulators because of the profitability of Telstra. This is going to be Australia's largest company if this bill goes through, if this government comes back and if it is then proclaimed. It is going to be twice the size of BHP; it is going to be the size of BHP and the National Australia Bank all rolled into one. If this government thinks that it can do better than Jeff Kennett, who has not been able to resist the Crown Casino pressures and keep the regulations strong, I think everybody will be amazed. We have only to look at international examples to know the pressure that companies can bring on.
My colleague Senator Murray will be moving an amendment later on that will stop 
 Telstra, as a privatised entity, accepting any encouragement to make political donations. One of the worst scenarios that we could see is a very large company that spends a few hundred thousand dollars here, a few hundred dollars there, $10,000 here or there, and so, perhaps for $400,000 or $500,000, keeps political parties happy in a financial sense, and then expects whoever gets into government not to press regulation, because these regulations—these customer service guarantees—will need to be changed over time, as they would if it remained in public hands.
If it is in private hands, the pressure will be to leave it, `Do not make a fuss. Let us interpret it in the narrowest way we possibly can to maximise our profits,' because the profits of this company, if it is privatised, will hinge on weak regulation—the weaker the regulations, the less service they have to provide to the bush and the bigger the profits. It is a simple balance. It is a simple equation. We can throw into that mix the possibility of substantial donations which, I am sure, will be across the political board. They will be to all political parties to keep everybody onside and everybody happy. For political parties these days, struggling to afford the level of campaign that we will be going into, a $10,000 donation is substantial, and a $100,000 donation is more than a bit welcome.
Let us look again at the customer service guarantee in the bush. It will be pretty easy for new technology—and who knows what it will be beyond the year 2000—to be introduced into the cities. The market is there and the profits are there. That is not the case as we move out—and not too far out. Indeed, East Gippsland, which is not exactly the back of beyond, has no mobile service now. There is very poor access, particularly if we get bad weather conditions out in East Gippsland. That is not an area that anyone is going to be particularly concerned about. A few thousand voters out there are just written off. Some of the southern areas of New South Wales along the coast are popular holiday destinations, but who really cares if the people who have retired down there do not have a service?
It should not just be people who consider themselves rural and remote who should be 
 worried about what is happening. It should also be people who live off the major routes, away from the key capital cities, who require an extra service and, in particular, faults to be fixed. Just one example: the transmitter for the ABC in Albury-Wodonga keeps breaking down. They used to have someone on site. In summer sometimes it was something as simple as putting a fan in front of the cooling systems and keeping them on line. The last time they broke down, it was not for a couple of seconds or minutes, it was for hours. They were referred to someone in Newcastle, and they tried to point out to the intermediary on the phone that Wodonga was not next door to Newcastle. So I believe centres as big as Albury will be looking around in the future for adequate services. We should not just consider that people out around Broken Hill or people north of Oodnadatta are the ones who are going to be hit by this.
Away from the capital cities, there will be extreme difficulties—maybe not within 12 months, Minister; maybe the big barrel that you are going to roll out will cushion them for three years—but let us look to the future. Let us look to the new technology that is undoubtedly over the horizon, and then ask, `How on earth are we going to bother? How on earth are we ever going to get services out into anywhere other than our capital cities?'",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1998-07-11,"—I rise to support my Queensland colleague and friend Senator Boswell in the remarks he made in this particular debate. He has made some very sensible contributions, and he has done a hell of a lot of work towards this package for the bush, as has my colleague Senator Heffernan who lives in the bush and represents the bush. Senator Tierney, Senator Troeth, Senator Ferguson and Senator Chapman, my Liberal Party colleagues, are people who represent these areas. Senator Calvert and Senator Crane live in the bush. Senator Eggleston and Senator Lightfoot—
—I rise on a point of order. It is a matter of relevance. Why doesn't the parliamentary secretary table the list of all the Liberal senators and save his own time in 
 having to read all their names out? It is irrelevant what he is saying.
—There is no point of order, Senator Schacht.
—I live in the bush, Senator Schacht. I am one of the few senators in this chamber who lives in a rural town. I know Senator Heffernan does. You would not even know what it was. I think I heard you say that you were born in the East Gippsland area but, my goodness, it has been a long time since you have been in the bush. My Liberal colleague Barry Wakelin represents most of rural Western Australia. He has had a great interest in this bill.
—I rise on a point of order. I think the senator should be accurate with his information. Barry Wakelin represents the federal electorate of Gray, which is in South Australia not Western Australia, you dope.
—It is a point of information rather than a point of order.
—Senator Schacht draws attention to the fact that my colleague Barry Wakelin represents most of South Australia—the bush areas where Senator Schacht would never have been. Mr Wakelin has done a lot of work on this telecommunications package, as has my northern colleague Mr Warren Entsch, a Liberal member, who represents the Gulf area of Far North Queensland, the Cape York area and the Torres Strait area. He knows what it is like to have a decent telecommunications system in those remote parts of Australia.
You would not understand, Senator Schacht. You have come into this debate, and you have threatened to go out into the bush in the campaign to let everybody know about it. You say that as a threat; I say it as a promise. Please, please come out. You will not be talking to any of your colleagues out there, because there is no-one in the bush that represents the Labor Party.
I want to tell you this, Senator Schacht and senators, there are a lot of Liberal members who represent most of the rural seats—people 
 like Sharman Stone, who was mentioned before. You attacked the National Party before for not representing the bush, and then you had this ridiculous argument that, because the National Party is supporting this, it has lost the seat of Murray. It was won by a Liberal person, Sharman Stone, who supports this bill entirely, as do all the Liberal members who represent rural seats—Gary Nairn, who represents Cooma down onto the coast, Joanna Gash, Bruce Reid, Mr Ronaldson, Lou Lieberman and Barry Wakelin, whom I have mentioned. He supports these sorts of ideas. Wilson Tuckey really understands the bush and is a Liberal who has represented the bush for ages. Then there is Ian McLachlan, a Liberal, and Judi Moylan.
Senator Schacht, you should understand that these seats, which we won at the last election, were not won from the National Party; they were won from the Labor Party. The Labor Party used to hold a couple of bush seats, but the Liberal Party won them all because we support these sorts of policies. Senator Boswell has done a great job and so has his party. The member for Hinkler and the member for Maranoa are members of the National Party who represent rural seats, and they have had a tremendous input into this. It has come out as a great package.
Senator Schacht, you say your government had an interest in the bush. Your government was the one that wanted to turn off the analog system, which is the only one that is usable in the bush, in the year 2000. You said it was finished—nothing, absolutely nothing. That was your government. You said, `Turn them off,'—and you reckon you know what the bush is like. You reckon you have some understanding of the bush. You would not have a clue. You think the bush is a couple of trees in your backyard.
You should get out into central Australia—where, incidentally, I am going next week. I am going to drive from Townsville to Perth across the centre of Australia to see real Australians in the bush. You would not understand. You would not have any idea of what it is like being out there. I am taking this opportunity—as well as looking at a road proposal, which is a matter for another de 
 bate—and I am going to be publicising this tremendous deal that Ron Boswell, Warren Entsch, Peter Lindsay, Bill O'Chee and I have won for people in the bush. For the first time they can ring their neighbour five kilometres away and they will not have to pay trunk line charges for it. They can get it at the price of a local call and it will be untimed. That never happened under Labor.
I am going to use my trip next week to tell these people in inland Australia, in places where you have never been, what a great package this is. I am going out to do it very proudly and very happily. During the course of that I will be meeting my Northern Territory colleagues, Liberal Mr Nick Dondas and Country Liberal Senator Grant Tambling, because they understand the bush. They, along with Senator Boswell, Senator O'Chee, Senator Heffernan and I, understand that this is a great package for the bush. That is why—
—I raise a point of order. On the matter of relevance, can Senator Macdonald provide us with an itinerary of where he is travelling so we can publicise where he will be to assist him?
—Order! Senator Schacht, you know that is not a point of order. That is frivolous.
—I am just trying to help this man.
—If I had it with me I would table it; in fact, I would incorporate it. Would you give me permission to do that if I come in later?
—Absolutely.
—Okay, I might do that. Just now, I will tell you about it. I am going from Townsville to Winton through to Towbemorrey—you would not have any idea of where that was—along to Alice Springs across a dirt track that is barely accessible to four-wheel drive. I will be in a four-wheel drive. I will be explaining to people as I go what a great telecommunications package this is.
—I raise a point of order. On the point of relevance, Senator Macdonald has outlined that he will be travelling through 
 the electorate of Kennedy, which is the electorate of the member Mr Katter, who opposes privatisation. Will you be accompanied by Mr Katter when you meet his constituents to explain your sell-out, Senator Macdonald?
—There is no point of order. Senator Ian Macdonald is being quite relevant in the comments that he is making with regard to the bill and his intention to promote it in rural areas.
—You always know when the Labor Party are on the back foot because they will do everything they can to interrupt the speaker. Here he goes again. Come on, I have only got 10 minutes. You can interrupt me about another 10 times, but you know that what I am saying is true. You know that what I am saying means that bush people will have the best telecommunications systems available.
Senator Heffernan interjecting—
—They are not like the Labor Party, as my friend reminds me, who wanted to cut the bush off—finish with the analog system.
We have said that we will put in a system which is better than analog but which has the same sort of network. It will be a great system for the bush. People who have an analog system now and who come into the city find that their analogs do not work. Under our new system, announced by Telstra, they will be able to get a handset that they can use in the analog network—an improved analog—and they will be able to switch it over to the digital.
—How much will they pay for that?
—You would not understand. You do not care about people in the bush. Senator George Campbell, you would not know. You know what the wharfies are about. You know what all the unionists are about who want to stop Australians having jobs, but you do not understand the real people in Australia, the real people who do productive work for Australia. You know what the unionists do and you know what the wharfies do when they want to stop Australia. 
 I am talking about people who really keep Australia going. They deserve a better telecommunications system than your government was prepared to give them.
You wanted to cut them off. We are putting them online again. We are improving it and we are giving them the ability to use the same handset when they come into the city. People up my way will be able to use this new code diversion multiple access system out in Hughenden, out in Winton, out in Towbemorrey and in places you would not have even heard of.
—They would not recognise you where you live in Townsville.
—You would have heard of Barcaldine because your lot claimed to have started there. But the people in the Labor Party who started your group in Barcaldine would not recognise you now, Senator George Campbell. They would puke. They would puke at the way you people and the unions ran the country. That is where this telecommunications system will be—
—I raise a point of order. Can I say that the warning Senator Ian Macdonald has given to the local communities of a four-wheel drive weaving over the roads any time after midday on any day of the week is very useful.
—That is not a point of order.
—You can always tell when the Labor Party are being hit right in the guts. They always get up and put it about that `You have been drinking.' They always do it.
—I didn't say that.
—I know, when they say it, that I have got them. They know it and that is tremendous. I enjoy them doing it because that shows that we are actually getting to them.
—He agrees with Senator Wright, because he said that you cannot trust a man who doesn't drink.
—Only in moderation, Senator Campbell, and only when 
 I am not speaking. You know you have got them, and I am very pleased about that. Senator George Campbell would not understand people in the bush.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! I will have fewer interjections on my left.
—Can I ask you to stop the interjections at the same time.
—No. Just talk to me and ignore the rest.
—Madam Chairman, one of your colleagues, Senator George Campbell, is a member of a group that has done its best to ruin Australia, particularly inland Australia. The people whom these telecommunications announcements of the last couple of days will help are the people in central and remote Australia and the producers in this nation.
I congratulate Senator Lees. She is the first one on that side who has spoken about the bill today. She has indicated that she is moving an amendment to do away with the preamble. Senator Harradine has indicated that he supports the amendment to get rid of the preamble. Senator Alston mentioned at 8 o'clock last night that he would accept that amendment, so why have we spent since 8 o'clock last night until now debating an amendment which everyone agrees upon? It just shows to the people of Australia that the Labor Party will do anything to filibuster, to cost the taxpayers money, to keep this chamber going and to make the most ridiculous and contradictory speeches I have ever heard in the last several hours.
Madam Chairman, you, like me, would be concerned at the absolute hypocrisy of those who just chat, chat, chat all the way through. You would be embarrassed, as anyone who might happen to be listening to this would be, at the spuriousness of the arguments from the Labor Party. They are so shallow and they mean absolutely nothing. As I have said, we have all agreed since 8 o'clock last night that this amendment should be dealt with.
Why is the Labor Party continuing with this farce? That is why I think it is so important to support my colleague Senator Boswell and 
 to acknowledge the work he has done. I also acknowledge the work of Wilson Tuckey, Warren Entsch, Peter Lindsay, Joanna Gash and all those Liberals, joined with their National Party colleagues.
Senator Schacht interjecting—
—Nobody believes Senator Schacht. I guess in the next election you will have such a problem trying to save your own seat that you will not be doing any campaigning anywhere else. I think you are history.
—Senator Ian Macdonald, address the chair, please. Senator Schacht, that is enough interjecting.
—Madam Chairman, your colleague Senator Schacht is history. It is comments from people such as Senator Quirke and others like him which show that Senator Schacht is finished. He will not be coming back the next time that he faces an election, be it in three or six years. I do not quite follow his history, but he is gone. It shows that he has no credibility whatsoever in the Labor Party.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—I will have some silence from both sides. The amount of noise being generated in this debate is totally unparliamentary. Senator Ian Macdonald should be addressing the chair and be heard in silence.
—I see that Senator Faulkner has got his riding instructions from Senator Ray. They are lining up the big guns. Senator Murphy will come in now. Wow!
—Senator Macdonald, there is no need to be provocative.
—Madam Chairman, I refer to a comment you made in this debate yesterday. You said, `Isn't it terrible all the money that Senator Harradine is getting for Tasmania.' That was a precis of what you were saying. You were rousing on us for that. I do not know whether it is true, but I take your word. You say that we are giving Tasmania a hell of a lot of money. Does Senator Murphy agree with you? Is he 
 angry that we are giving Tasmania a lot of money? Which of the others comes from Tasmania?
—They are very quiet.
—It is very quiet, isn't it. One of the people sitting near Senator Murphy also comes from Tasmania, and that is Senator O'Brien.
—You wouldn't know it, would you?
—He has not said much in favour of Tasmania. I want to know whether he agrees with the Deputy President when she criticised us for giving a lot of money to Tasmania. Senator Mackay is also from Tasmania. Does she agree with the Deputy President in that we are naughty for giving a lot of money to Tasmania, or does she agree with Senator Schacht that we should not give Tasmania anything? Which is it? You were giving me some assistance before, but we do not seem to have it now.
I have a lot of important things to do, but I am sure that some of my colleagues will want to carry this on. It is important to acknowledge the amendment that Senator Boswell is going to move. I hope I have the honour of being able to second it and to speak to it when it comes. The whole package will do great things for all Australians, particularly those who in the past, and under Labor particularly, have never got anything. I think we should move on.
We all agree on this amendment. I guess Senator Schacht will get up and move that we put the motion, because we all agree to it. Why we further debate it makes my mind boggle. Perhaps we should move on to the amendments where there is some conflict rather than deal with an amendment that we all agree on. (Time expired)
—Madam Chairman, I raise a point of order. I remind Senator Ian Macdonald that the opposition will give him leave to table in parliament the itinerary for his grand tour through outback Australia in the next couple of  weeks. We would be happy to have that published so that he can invite Mr Katter and Mrs De-Anne Kelly to 
 accompany him on that trip. We will give him leave to table that itinerary.
—Order! There is no point of order.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-07-11,"—We are now into about the 20th hour of debate. We have spent seven hours on the preamble. In that circumstance, the points have been made again and again. My conclusion at the end of the debate so far is the following: the Australian Democrats, the Labor Party and the two Greens are vigorously opposed to the sale of Telstra, and the Liberal Party, the National Party and the two Independents support the sale of Telstra. The result is that we are going to lose Telstra and that we are going to lose the bill.
There are 50 amendments on the running sheet. Only two of them are Labor's. If we are going to lose the bill, we should do our very best to improve it. I urge everyone who feels passionately about this, including us, to move on with the amendments so that we can do our best to make it a better company for Australians generally.
I wanted to make a contribution to this debate and take up an important comment from Senator Harradine during the debate on the preamble. Senator Harradine did confirm his comments at the time that Telstra was debated in 1996 pointing out that he was opposed at that point to the sale of all of Telstra because it was a natural monopoly. I understand Senator Harradine to now say that things have changed, and that Telstra is subject to intense competition and is no longer a natural monopoly.
I think it would be helpful if he expanded on this statement. While it is true that Telstra has competition in a number of areas, Telstra is still unquestionably the dominant player in the telecommunications market. According to the most recent report I have seen from the IBIS Business Information Bureau, Telstra still enjoys 82 per cent of the telecommunications market, Optus has only 13 per cent and AAPT just two per cent. That is hardly significant competition to Telstra at this time. In anticompetition law and practice worldwide, around 30 per cent is seen to indicate a dominant player.
Even those figures ignore Telstra's strength in key markets. On local calls and exchange line rentals—26 per cent of all telecommunications services—Telstra has a 100 per cent monopoly. On domestic long distance calls, Telstra has 73 per cent of the market while Optus has only 12.5 per cent. On international calls, Telstra has 66 per cent while Optus has 24 per cent. Telstra has 64 per cent of mobile services while Optus has 29 per cent. Telstra has 82 per cent of data services, 74 per cent of directory services, 80 per cent of customer premises equipment and 100 per cent of pay phones, but only 30 per cent of Internet service provision. That is a swag of market power which is extremely dangerous to put into private hands. I would be happy to provide a copy of that IBIS report to Senator Harradine and any other interested senator, if they wish.
This week we saw Telstra obtain another monopoly service with the CSDA mobile announcement. This new technology, new service and new market is a 100 per cent Telstra monopoly, with no scope for switching between carriers. In all, these figures show that Telstra, if not a monopoly player, is certainly close to an effective monopoly in many areas. In rural Australia it is a monopoly player. Most Australians, probably all Australians, know that unless monopolies are in public hands they are a danger. When you have excessive power in private hands, it will be abused.
Telstra still has an absolute monopoly over local calls. There has been a much heralded entry of Optus into this market, but it has not happened yet. Indeed, if Optus is forced to pay the prices demanded by Telstra for access to the network, it never will happen. That issue, of course, is currently before the ACCC, along with other inquiries into various aspects of its operations. There Telstra is fighting tooth and nail, giving some idea of just how hard a fully privatised Telstra will fight. That is natural; it will look after its self-interest, and its self-interest will be to remain as big and as dominant and as much in control as possible. It is only the government and the public sector restraints which can hold back that natural urge.
The Telstra Chief Executive Officer warned in May that, if too many changes were made in favour of consumers and new companies, Telstra may not be able to be floated. Telstra's public relations department has been fighting this and other ACCC inquiries hard. All this is the kind of natural aggression that such a big beast will display. In May, Telstra released a statement warning against further regulation of transmission capacity, arguing that it would be harmful, was unnecessary and would choke further investment. It is warning us yet again of the style that it will adopt, which will be far more vigorous, when it is fully privatised. Even in the most competitive area of telecommunications, Internet service provision—the only area where Telstra is not dominant—it is now on the way to becoming so, with a reciprocal data alliance announced in May with OzEmail. That is hardly a move towards more competition, and comes among continuing claims about Telstra's pricing policies for Internet service providers.
For the Democrats, the picture is coming through of an increasingly aggressive corporate entity which could become more of a bully than a partner in our lives. It will aggressively defend its dominant market share and be prepared to do whatever it takes to expand its market share. That is not competition in the true sense; it is the natural attitude of a monopoly. The only thing standing between Telstra and total market dominance, apart from the ACCC—and the ACCC is testing many of its powers for the first time—is this parliament. We are about to give up that power. I wonder how effective the ACCC could be in controlling Telstra. Judging by the weakness of the British regulators in controlling British Telecom post-privatisation, I am not optimistic that Telstra's market dominance will not grow with privatisation rather than be reduced under competition.
I ask Senator Harradine, the National Party and the Liberal Party and Senator Colston to think carefully about these issues. Telecommunications is the fastest growing segment of the Australian economy. Telstra controls 82 per cent of it now and is very well placed to defend and even increase that share. It is to the credit of the Labor government previously 
 that it was under them that competition was introduced in the telecommunications arena. It is them we have to thank for at least the modicum of competition that exists at present. But now is not the time to give up Telstra from public ownership.
If Telstra is a natural monopoly, particularly in the local class area in the provision of the best basic network, it will take advantage of that position to maximise shareholder returns. Any private company—and any public company—naturally and correctly sees as its principal objective maximising profit and shareholder returns. The Democrats do not have the absolute confidence that the government and the two Independents seem to have that the ACCC and the ACA have sufficient regulatory means, rules and resources to take on Australia's biggest company and win. Telstra and its shareholders should note that, if it is to pass out of the hands of all Australians, this parliament should look carefully in the future at introducing an anti-trust regime and breaking it up.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1998-07-11,"—We are debating the preamble of the bill, and I want to refer to the part which says that the sale of the Commonwealth's remaining two-thirds equity interest in Telstra will benefit the Australian community. It is interesting that Senator Ian Macdonald, Liberal senator from Queensland, had to be dragooned into here to defend the National Party leader, Senator Boswell. What I want to know is: where are Senator Boswell's colleagues?  Where are Senator O'Chee, Senator Sandy Macdonald, Senator Brownhill and, of course, Senator McGauran?  Why aren't they in here arguing the case, to defend Senator Boswell for the deal they have done with this government?
Senator Macdonald was saying that he was going to tour the outback of Australia. The last time he toured the outback was when he was a frontbencher, and he lost his frontbench position. So, if there is going to be another tour around the outback for Ian Macdonald, the outback had better be careful. Of course there is plenty of wide open space out there, but I am sure it will do them no good at all.
 The deal that has been done and is being sung on such high moral acclaim by Tim Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister, is this $150 million deal to deliver a better service. This is what it is really about: a benefit to the Australian community, that some 37,000 households in the remote areas of Australia will get a better service.
I was looking at the Herald Sun today and I think nothing more epitomises the view of the bush with regard to that deal than the cartoon on page 24 beside the editorial entitled `The bush telegraph'. It shows the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, with his little toy mobile phone, saying, `Tim Fischer calling . . . How clear is the success of this Telstra privatisation policy with rural voters?' You then see him, still with his little toy mobile phone, saying, `Hello?' and the phone is going, `Beep, beep, beep.' Obviously the people in the bush do not buy it. They never have bought it and they will not buy it in the future.
Senator Boswell said, `Look, we were not spooked, we were not walking away.' I have to say that if they were not spooked they have certainly let the horses bolt. I want to go back to when this bill first came into the House of Representatives. Did the Deputy Prime Minister raise anything at that time?  Did Mr Anderson or any of the other Nationals, including De-Anne Kelly, raise anything in the debate with regard to the full privatisation of Telstra in so far as achieving better outcomes for people in the bush? No; not one thing.
We come to the report that has been referred to by Senator Macdonald. Was Senator Boswell a member of the committee?  No. A participating member? Yes. Is there a minority report from the Nationals in the committee's report about the full privatisation of Telstra? No, not one word. There was not one word about what they were requiring, even though a lot of supposed National Party voters gave submissions to the committee. There was not one word. There was no minority report. There was absolutely nothing.
It just goes to show how these people have been conned by the trinketry and the tricks of the minister and the Prime Minister. This is 
 the real trap that the Nationals find themselves in: the only way that they are going to get to deliver to the bush is for the full privatisation of Telstra to proceed. And that is why the people will not buy it. So they have to go out there and urge the voters to vote for them to get the full privatisation up. What a stupid position to be in.
Why have they not done anything about it before? I go back to the preamble where it says `will benefit the Australian community'. Why wasn't this done before?  We have already had a one-third sale. What did the Nationals say then with regard to services in the bush?  They said it would bring better services. Why is it that it has taken a One Nation success in Queensland to force these people out of their holes in the ground to try to represent the people that they claim to represent? It took a One Nation electoral success, and the record proves that.
You can go through the Hansard in the House of Representatives. Indeed, you can go right back to November and December 1996 when we debated the first one-third Telstra privatisation bill. Did they say anything then? Were the services better then than they are now?  No. So why didn't the National Party senators seek these sorts of guarantees then? Of course, they did not even seek a guarantee from the government by way of amendment to this bill as to the deal for the expenditure of $150 million that they have now struck.
It took us to highlight the fact that there was no protection for their deal. There was no guarantee that their deal would benefit the community, be it in the outback or anywhere else. There was not a single line in the bill about that. Of course, Ron ran down to see Richard and said, `Listen, mate. We need to have something in the bill, otherwise we will be ridiculed.'
—Senator Murphy, would you please refer to people by their correct names?
—Senator Ron Boswell and Senator Richard Alston, the minister. Senator Boswell said, `We need to get something. You've got to give us something more. Not a toy telephone, not a few trinkets, we want something more. We want a little bit 
 more. Please, Minister, will you give it to us? We're looking silly enough as it is.'
—They will get it, all right.
—Senator Carr is right; they will get it. They have already got it once in Queensland. That frightened them out of the burrow like a bunch of scared rabbits. They have gone in every direction. Nothing has epitomised it more. This cartoon may have been Mr Tim Fischer trying to ring his colleagues, because they have gone in every direction conceivably possible. Not even one of them can come in here and defend the Leader of the National Party in the Senate. Not one National Party senator can come in here and defend Senator Boswell for the deal that he has done. Senator Boswell said today, `We've been in coalition for 30 or 40 years.'
—Too long.
—Yes, too long for most National Party supporters. The National Party really have lost the plot. He said, `We've been in coalition for 30 or 40 years.' What an interesting scenario. It was just yesterday that Senator Boswell said that over the last week the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have actually got to know each other. They have spent 40 years in coalition and have passed one another in the corridor I do not know how many times, but they obviously did not speak, they obviously did not talk about things much, they obviously did not discuss Telstra very often, not even if you go right back to the first privatisation bill.
Where are we at? We have got the preamble in the bill that says the bill will deliver these benefits. The only thing we have seen thus far is this deal that is supposed to deliver to some 37,000 households that are, in essence, west of the Great Divide. In the Queensland election, where did you lose all your seats? It was along the coast. What are you going to do about the National Party voters there? How are you going to win them back, Senator Boswell? Are you talking to the minister right now—
—Order! Senator Murphy, would you please address the chair and stop talking to other members of the Senate.
—Is Senator Boswell going to try to win them back with another deal? Is he going to try to extend the deal? What the Deputy Prime Minister has said is really a question of integrity as well. The Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, Senator Alston, were big on announcements yesterday. They announced the expenditure of $176 million, but Telstra had already planned to spend that. That was already in their budget. It was already partly spent. How much of that is going to be spent in the bush? The report says $5 million to $6 million. I have to say that the Nationals are doing really well here! They cannot even negotiate. They cannot even get 10 per cent of the money spent in the bush, and they say they are performing. Senator Boswell said in here this morning that he was performing. Is that his best performance? I have seen some performances like that, and do you know where I go to see them? Punch and Judy, the puppets. Here we have the National Party puppets. That is what we have got. The minister and the Prime Minister are there with Senator Boswell and Tim Fischer. They have got them beating one another around the bush. That is all they have ever been doing.
The poor old National Party voters, particularly in Queensland, had no alternative. They have been deserted by those they elected to represent them in this parliament. Is this deal going to deliver anything to them? Not one little bit. All it does is provide for a few people in the back blocks, and that should have been done after the sale of one-third of Telstra. It should have been done for the people then, because we talked about delivering a community benefit at the same time. But there has been no community benefit.
Senator Ian Macdonald raised with me the issue of Tasmania. Tasmania was supposed to get $58 million, but this is very interesting because the money is very hard to track through the estimates process. As I said, what has essentially happened in Tasmania is that, prior to the one-third sale, 1,450 people worked for Telstra in Tasmania. We have got far fewer than that now and the number is going down. It would seem to me that the 
 only thing the money is being used for is to pay for the shipment of Telstra jobs across Bass Strait to Victoria. If that is what the money was intended for, so be it, but we should not mislead the Tasmanian people. I do not want the Tasmanian people misled again with regard to what is going to be the outcome of this piece of legislation.
It appears, for all intents and purposes, that Senator Harradine has said he will support this legislation. Senator Harradine is, in his words and the words of others, a man of principle. He is a man of principle on the basis that he says so himself. He has spoken on a number of occasions about mandates that governments have. If Senator Harradine is going to support this legislation, I think the Tasmanian people have a right to know what he will be doing when we go into the election. Will he be supporting the sale of Telstra or will he not? That is a very clear and unequivocal question.
Senator Harradine says that, if this bill is passed, it does not necessarily provide for the sale of Telstra. You could argue that it is an enabling piece of legislation, but if this legislation is passed before the next election and the coalition win that election with sufficient seats in the House of Representatives to form government but not the numbers in the Senate—but they are highly unlikely to win government again, given the stuff-ups they have made—then this bill will still become law because the Prime Minister just has to ring up the Governor-General and say, `Proclaim the bill.' That is why we are debating this bill right now. That is the question that Senator Harradine has to answer and has to make clear to the Tasmanian people. I also want Senator Harradine to tell the Tasmanian public whether part of the deal he has done to make him support this bill relates to Liberal Party preferences.
Sitting suspended from 1.00 p.m. to 1.45 p.m.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-07-11,"—I wanted to begin my remarks by referring to the comments of Senator Andrew Murray earlier in this committee stage of the debate. He expressed 
 concern that there were at least 50 amendments to be dealt with as part of this legislation. At least 41 of those are Democrat amendments, and we are very keen to turn our comments to debate some of those amendments. Once again, on behalf of the Democrats, I reiterate the lunacy of the time that has been allocated for this debate not only on this particularly important piece of legislation in relation to the privatisation of Telstra but also on the remaining legislation—namely, the copyright bills, which deserve more than two hours apiece in debate later this afternoon.
The lunacy of this debate is that, even if we treat this legislation as enabling legislation or dealing with the so-called hypothetical scenario in relation to the sale of Telstra, we are actually not being given enough time to debate or to discuss what we would consider an appropriate regulatory framework for this legislation. So, even if the government—and it looks like the government has the numbers to pass this piece of legislation—has the so-called will of the chamber, if not of the community, to support the sale of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra, we are not being given the opportunity to debate how we could improve or better the bill in some way, or certainly insist that there be an appropriate regulatory framework within the legislation to make sure that the needs of consumers and customers are dealt with.
That is a concern that Senator Andrew Murray raised earlier, and it is one that I reiterate, as will my colleagues throughout this debate as we try to get on record some of our amendments and the rationale behind them. I understand those amendments will be moved later on today by the government on our behalf—again, with minimal debate, and I think that is very sad. It is a shameful debate and a shameful day.
First of all, I would like to draw attention to issues raised in the debate on the second reading by Senator Brian Harradine when he claimed that massive job losses in Telstra were caused by the former government, the Australian Labor Party, and Kim Beazley. I am not quite sure where those statistics or that particular argument came from, but I suspect 
 it came from the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston). As Senator Harradine and perhaps others in this chamber know, we do not always rely on Senator Alston for accurate and factual statements.
Senator Schacht interjecting—
—Particularly where the Labor Party's performance is concerned.
Senator Kemp interjecting—
—Do not worry, we have our own concerns with the former government's policies, but we would like to put some facts on the record for the purpose of this debate in relation to job losses and Telstra, in particular the privatisation of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra and what that means for employment or unemployment. So we want to place on record the history of telecommunications deregulation and Telstra's work force.
All of these figures come from the IBIS Business Information and the Telstra annual reports. We do note that the deregulation of telecommunications in this country was launched by Kim Beazley back in 1991, with the selling of Aussat to became the basis of Optus. From June 1990 to June 1994, we saw massive slashes taking place in the work force. Kim Beazley and the former government slashed the work force of Telstra by a quarter from 87,000 to 65,000—a loss of around 22,000 jobs. But then Telstra started to put workers back on again, rising to 76,500 workers in June 1996.
By then, it was becoming apparent that Telstra was heading for privatisation, that people—certainly under this government—were keen to see Telstra privatised, at least partially. Of course, that is when a lot of financial commentators started saying that staff and jobs had to be shed if it was going to be more competitive, so-called. There was a claim that, essentially, it was overstaffed and, therefore, bodies needed to go.
BZW Australia, for example, who produced the first analysis of what sort of a body count was needed at Telstra if it was to be an attractive buy, suggested that around 7,000 
 staff needed to be cut between 1996 and 1998 to deliver a 27 per cent profit increase. Then, the day that Telstra announced a record profit—a $2.3 billion profit—it also announced that it would shed 22,000 workers.
The Democrats acknowledge that Frank Blount is not necessarily a cutter of staff—in fact, he put 10,000 new workers on. But the criticism of the Telstra staffing policy came from the task force scoping study, commissioned by the finance department to prepare Telstra for sale. As the Age reported in September 1996:
The task force has been worrying not just about Frank Blount's known reluctance to cut, but his instinct to build . . .
That clearly identifies that, if you are going to be competitive, staff have to go, that the bottom line is clearly about profits and competition, not necessarily about the protection of Australian jobs and workers. The article went on to say that the setting of a 22,000-person headcount target, if you like, by Blount contradicted his attack on `management by headcount'. Frank Blount also noted that Telstra was engaging in a significant change in industrial relations policies, clearly because of a change of federal government. Blount's comment was, `Everyone knows about it, they write about it, so I may as well say it: a Labor government's different from the current government.'
So the picture that we see is that, without the pressure of privatisation, without the criticism of the scoping study task force appointed by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) and Minister Richard Alston, Frank Blount would not have changed a management practice of, I believe, a lifetime and, therefore, retrenched 22,000 workers. He would not have moved in that direction had he not had the pressures of a looming privatisation, of changing industrial relations policies and of that scoping study.
It is not as though Telstra is losing market share. Optus has not challenged Telstra's market share in the way that was presumed. They are not as effective a competitor as was presumed. Telstra has 82 per cent of the largest growing market in Australia. Optus has around only 13 per cent. But retrenching 
 is the very first action taken by privatised Telstra. Telecom New Zealand reduced its work force by two-thirds from 24,500 to 8,500 in its first eight years as a private company. British Telecom is another example. It cut staff by 120,000 or 45 per cent from 1981 to 1994 as it was being privatised. Telstra management is now boasting that its retrenchments are ahead of schedule—18,000 staff of the now enlarged 25,000 target are gone just two years into a three-year program. And people are boasting about this?
During the last Telstra debate, I note that Senator Harradine expressed deep concern about the impact of Telstra job losses, particularly the impact on regional Australia. I draw to the attention of Senator Harradine and the chamber figures that were released quite recently in a return to order from Senator Vicki Bourne of the Democrats in relation to Telstra staffing levels. These figures show that in the year to March 1998 a quarter of all staff leaving Telstra came from regional Australia.
—Twenty-five per cent.
—That is about 3,000 of the 12,000 separations.
—Where were Senator Boswell and the National Party?
—That includes 248 Telstra workers who had to leave in Tasmania—one of the states for which Senator Harradine presumably is very concerned, as he represents it—and 617 in regional Queensland. I will take on board Senator Schacht's interjection. I wonder how Senator Boswell felt about that particular notion that those two regional areas were suffering the adverse impact of job losses and job reductions in the Telstra work force.
Senator Harradine's argument in relation to privatisation having no impact on Telstra employment is simply wrong. The facts and figures dispute that very premise. The evidence is there that quite clearly if Telstra was not sold there would be a lot more Telstra workers in regional Australia, a lot more faults would be cleared on time, a lot more connections would be made on time, and a lot fewer workers would be on the dole queues 
 under this government. If you think that the 25,000 job losses we are seeing now are somehow the end of the job losses that we will see in Telstra, then you are indeed naive, because the facts suggest otherwise. The experience in both New Zealand and Britain show that shareholders will demand that tens of thousands more jobs go in order to boost shareholder values.
I remind everyone, in particular Senator Harradine, that the day BHP announced it was closing its Newcastle steelworks, a loss of 10,000 jobs, the stock market cheered and the BHP share price rose. The day Patrick sacked 2,000 waterfront workers the share price of Lang Corporation leaped through the roof. So there are demands from shareholders if we are treating a company as simply a company that is making profits and not necessarily looking after consumer and client needs, not just in the bush but all over Australia. Private shareholders demand body counts. Telstra had to deliver them in order to be an attractive float prospect. Telstra in the future will be expected to deliver thousands more to the insatiable demands of the share market. So if people in this chamber back the sale, the loss of 10s of thousands of jobs will be on their heads, not just in regional and remote parts of this country but all over Australia.
I end with the point with which I began, that is, once again, the lunacy of this debate, not just the concocted timetable in which we are operating but the fact that even if this government gets what it wants—and it is looking very clear that the government will get the numbers in this place to pass this legislation, whether you call it enabling or hypothetical legislation or whatever you want to call it—we are not being given the appropriate and adequate time in which to debate in detail the amendments that are before us. I remind the Senate that 41 of those amendments are from the Australian Democrats. We not being given the opportunity to not only develop a regulatory framework in this legislation that will hopefully improve it but also ensure that consumer needs and the needs of all Australians are protected and improved under this bill. I look forward to debating in more detail some of the other amendments 
 that the Democrats will move if we are given the opportunity.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1998-07-11,"—In view of the comments that were made by Senator Boswell in this debate earlier, I feel that I have to respond. Before so doing, I think it is worth commenting on the point just made by Senator Stott Despoja—that is, the issue of jobs and jobs in Telstra. I have it on fairly good authority—and this might interest the Democrats—that the near 2,000 jobs that were to go in Telstra have been put on hold at the direction of Telstra management. They were told not to shed any jobs in rural and regional areas for the next four months.
One wonders why that directive has gone out. It will be interesting to hear the government deny it. I am told very reliably that this is what has happened. The government has given the directive that none of these 1,783 jobs, to be precise, are to be lost over the next four months. That is a very cynical approach, indeed, to the issue of employment, particularly at this time in the run-up to the election and while debating this bill in this chamber.
Turning to what Senator Boswell had to say, one must feel sorry for Senator Boswell because one does not know whether he is really in touch with what is happening in Queensland. If one looks at the performance of the coalition parties in the recent Queensland state election, one sees the real answer as to why we are seeing what is happening on this bill in this chamber. Clearly, the coalition, and in particular the National Party, was devastated at the last election in Queensland. One only needs to look at the figures to see that. I will come to that in a few moments.
The cat was let out of the bag many months ago, in the first instance, when the Prime Minister failed to kill off One Nation. Of course, One Nation has not only established itself but been legitimised by the actions of the coalition in Queensland. The Prime Minister missed the opportunity to say that the coalition would put One Nation last in the Queensland election—that was undoubtedly done for cynical reasons—and they are now wearing the consequence, which is that the 
 Liberal Party is less than a cricket team in the Queensland parliament.
What has happened to the National Party? It has been decimated. The vote of the National Party in Queensland has been ripped asunder because of the way they sidled up to the One Nation party. Their federal colleagues are now trying to get them out of that hole by pork barrelling. Clearly, this is something that will be rejected by the electorate when this government faces the electorate in the not too distant future.
The performance of the Queensland coalition government was pathetic in its own right. They have failed to understand, firstly, that were rejected by the people of Queensland because of their performance, and, secondly, that many of their supporters failed to find any faith or any trust in continuing their support of the National Party in Queensland. So what did they do? They deserted the National Party. They went across and they voted for One Nation.
If you listened to Senator Boswell, you would have taken the view that all of this was out in the very remote, very distant, parts of Queensland. But if one looks at some of the electorates one finds that National Party people who were in electorates within 50-60 kilometres of Brisbane, not even as much as 80 kilometres away, were affected by the impact of One Nation—the very cat that they let out of the bag.
It is interesting to look, for example, at the seat of Lockyer. Those who know Lockyer will know that it is a rural-cum-semirural area. It is interesting to look at the electoral results in Queensland on a polling booth basis. In some of the booths there, dramatic changes took place for the National Party because they had done themselves in.
Look at Boonah—they went from 69.92 per cent of the first preference vote down to 30.13. No wonder they are here pork barrelling, trying to get this bill through to try to win some of those votes back. The government have got the problem that no-one believes them. They have deserted them. This is a vain attempt to win back some of that support. Look at Laidley—61.62 per cent down to 23.11 per cent of the first preference 
 vote. In both instances, the One Nation vote was high. Senator Boswell can put across whatever view he likes, but he cannot make out that these places are isolated and remote. Boonah and Laidley are relatively close to Brisbane.
Look at some of their stronger booths and you will really understand why the panic set in. At the booth of Rosevale they went from 92.25 per cent of the vote down to 36.62 per cent of the vote. No wonder the National Party are worried. That is in the seat of Lockyer.
Go to the seat of Crows Nest in the so-called National Party heartland—which, coincidentally, was won on Labor Party preferences because Labor put One Nation last; that was our policy and we saw it all the way through—go to one of their polling booths, where you would hardly put anyone on to hand out how-to-vote cards because in 1995 they got 95.11 per cent of the vote, and you will see that that dropped to 57.4 per cent in 1998. The disillusionment out in the country is widespread, and not just on the issue of Telstra. Pork barrelling on Telstra will not resolve the problem for the government. In my speech in the second reading debate yesterday I mentioned an article by Paul Pickering in the Age of 7 July. He said, and I think it was very well put:
Surely it did not need Pauline Hanson to remind National Party backbenchers that it is the state that has provided and maintained infrastructure in the bush.
The people in the rural and regional areas trust the state. They are looking to the state to do that. In the state of Queensland, they were deserted by the then National Party dominated government. They deserted the National Party in droves. These people were not west of the Dividing Range; these people were along the coastal strip. What we are hearing today from the National Party and from Senator Boswell does not add up. They have lost votes everywhere: they have lost them in their heartland, they have lost them in the areas that they duchessed over a long period of time. Clearly, those people have faith and trust in the state providing infra 
 structure. The article in the Age  goes on to say:
They simply needed to look to their own past to understand that the only way to guarantee a continuing cross-subsidy for rural telephone services is through public ownership.
What the National Party is doing here today—and some of my other colleagues have alluded to this quite clearly—is putting forward its own death sentence. If it cannot rely on the figures that are there already in the bush in Queensland, then what can it rely on? It is no use for the National Party to come in here and talk up the fact that it will pork barrel and that that will resolve the problems in the country—because the belief in the country has gone.
As for the deal that the National Party claims to have done, through Senator Boswell, with the Liberal Party, we have already seen here today an amendment tabled on behalf of Senator Boswell. That amendment says `to avoid doubt'. Whilst that is not pertinent here, one wonders what other things the National Party has overlooked in its deal. What faith, what trust can the people of Queensland and the people of Australia put in the National Party: little or none? The answer is none, because it has blown its chances, it has blown its credibility
The new party that they have established and given credibility to in the state of Queensland—`they' being the National Party and the Liberal Party—is One Nation; that has been done not by the Labor Party but by the coalition parties. Whilst Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee in this chamber have rightfully condemned the One Nation Party and its policies, they have been absolutely unable to convince their colleagues in Queensland, as we saw in the state election, to put One Nation last. They are now trying to shut the gate after the horse has bolted. What they have is an electoral calamity. The Australian public should understand quite clearly that the only reason for their pursuing this bill now and not in some months time is so that they can try to duchess some of the support they have lost out in the rural and regional communities. 
The fact that the government seemingly issued an instruction yesterday to Telstra management to put a hold on the cut to rural and regional jobs speaks volumes: hold the rural and regional job cuts for four months—
—And then sack them afterwards.
—and then sack them; sack them after we have had an election. In this day and age people see through this sort of cynicism. They are fed up with it. You wonder why they are fed up with politicians. When you see that sort of performance from the National Party, it leaves one in no doubt at all as to why people have deserted the National Party in droves and, unfortunately, the National Party has just started to wake up to it.
The way to redress the problem is not to hasten this bill through. The government could have put this bill on the Notice Paper and debated it from 10 August. But no, the government wants it there so that it can call the election within the next few weeks. Meanwhile, what do we see? We see National Party supporters leaving the party in their droves.
Senator Boswell tried to create the impression that there is a large mass of people still warmly embracing the National Party out there in its heartland. If they are, then the figures belie that, no matter what electorate one looks at. This is the case even in close city electorates, like the seat of Redlands.
People throughout the rest of Australia might think Senator Boswell is talking about remote places, as I said earlier. Look at the seat of Redlands, a bayside area within 15 to 20 kilometres of the central part of Brisbane. What do we find? Just look at the figures. Kimberly Park: in 1995 the National Party got 53.26 per cent, and in 1998 it dropped to 36.73 per cent. Mount Cotton: in 1995 it got 51.39 per cent, and in 1998 it dropped to 34.95 per cent. Shailer Park: in 1995 it got 48.05, and in 1998 it dropped to 33.15. Thornlands: in 1995 it got 44.16, and in 1998 it dropped to 30.84—and that is in a near metropolitan area which was a National Party seat and still is a National Party seat for one 
 reason: the distribution of One Nation preferences.
It was One Nation preferences that got the National Party across the line—and just across it—in the seat of Redlands. We are not talking about people who are disenfranchised. We are not talking about people who are remote, who are living in desolate places. We are talking about people living within 15 to 20 kilometres of the central part of Brisbane. These people who previously, for whatever reasons, supported the National Party have deserted them. So Senator Boswell should not come in here and paint a picture that we are talking about people in remote Queensland alone, because we are not; we are talking about people right throughout the state of Queensland.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1998-07-11,"—The Labor Party has submitted this Senate and the people of Australia to a spray of accusations and rhetoric against the Liberal Party, the National Party, Senator Harradine, Senator Colston, and anybody else that it could think of on the way through. Its economic use of the truth has finally persuaded me to partake in this debate. The people of Australia will undoubtedly remember that the Labor Party gave an iron clad guarantee—as Ralph Willis put it—in relation to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Remember the Commonwealth Bank?
The Commonwealth Bank was sold by the Australian Labor Party. On 31 October 1993 the then Treasurer was asked:
So unlike before, this time your commitment is iron clad?
Ralph Willis: Absolutely yes.
So that is the credibility with which Labor comes to this debate on privatisation: promise one thing before an election, and then do another thing after it. That was with the Commonwealth Bank. Labor did exactly the same with Qantas.
This is one of the few times that I would even bother quoting the new Labor candidate for Dickson, the former Democrat leader, but this is a very telling point. She said this: `I think Labor in opposition won't sell Telstra, but I am more worried about Labor in govern 
 ment.' It is a very telling comment, isn't it? In opposition they will try to defend the indefensible, yet their actions in government speak so much louder than their rhetoric in opposition. Cheryl Kernot did put her finger on it when she said, `If Labor remains in opposition, they will vote against every privatisation that comes along but, as soon as they get into government—like they did with Qantas, like they did with the Commonwealth Bank, like they did with the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, and the list goes on—they would privatise them all.'
Indeed, at the time Mr Keating was asked on the ABC's Lateline program whether it mattered if Telstra was publicly or privately owned, and Mr Keating said, `Of its essence, no.' Now all of a sudden the Labor Party have gone very quiet, haven't they? When they are reminded of the record of the Australian Labor Party on privatisation, those opposite realise that they do not come to this debate with clean hands. The significant difference is this: when we privatise something, we do not use it to pay for recurrent expenditure; we use that money either as another capital investment in our country or to pay off the huge debt.
That brings me on to another point. Before the last election, what did Mr Beazley, the then Minister for Finance, promise the Australian people? Indeed, that promise was repeated by people such as Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray who partook in this debate. They gave us the solemn assurance `The budget is in surplus.' We now know that that was absolutely and utterly wrong; we were left with a $10.5 billion deficit. That has now finally been admitted by none other than the shadow Treasurer, Mr Gareth Evans, and the new Labor star, Cheryl Kernot. She also admitted the fact of this $10.5 billion deficit.
Therefore, it is vitally important that we as a nation address the problem of debt. That is what we are doing with this sale. It is to pay off the $96 billion worth of debt that accrued up until Labor lost government in 1996. With the sale of the remaining part of Telstra, we will be able to repay 40 per cent of that debt. The recurrent expenditure by Australian taxpayers on servicing that debt is in the 
 billions of dollars each year. If you pay off the debt, you will not have to keep on paying the huge interest rates on servicing that debt.
If it comes to credibility, before the last election in my home state of Tasmania, the Labor Party circulated a nasty little number—that is the only way that it can be described—in the form of a letter addressed to `The Resident' that was circulated in the electorate of Lyons by the Labor member. It was in the form of a fake Telstra bill asserting that the Liberal government would sell 33 per cent of Telstra. This is the allegation that they made. They said, `How much your telephone bill would rise in Lyons if John Howard was allowed to sell Telstra.' They had the map of Tasmania with towns marked on it and with a price underneath them. They claimed that in Queenstown the telephone bill would rise by $1,250. If you cross over to St Marys on the east cost it would rise by $910. Smack bang in the middle of Tasmania is Oatlands which would increase by $680. Ouse, $950; Deloraine, $680—and so the nonsense went on.
—May we have a copy of that?
—Yes, Senator Harradine, you may have a copy of that. What the electorate of Lyons in Tasmania has now come to realise is that, whilst they were very scared—indeed, my office was inundated with phone calls—the interesting thing is whether these messages were correct. I tried to contact the people in the electorate two days before election day, which was impossible, to try to disabuse them of this.
But I do not have to any more now, because one-third of Telstra has been sold. The people of Queenstown now know they have better telecommunications facilities than they ever had under Labor and, what is more, the price has not gone up one cent. Indeed, it has gone down. So much for the big Labor lie of a $1,250 increase in Queenstown, for instance, and trying to scare people in remote areas that they would be facing increased costs in telecommunications if the one-third sale of Telstra went through. That accusation has been completely and utterly debunked by the experience of the electors of Lyons. They now do not rely on me to tell them that that 
 is untrue. They can now read their own Telstra bills and know that the document circulated by the Labor member for Lyons—only three days before the election so it could not be effectively answered—was wrong. It was false; it was misleading. Of course, the dire predictions of that document never, ever came into being.
 Can I quickly turn to some spurious comments made by Senator Hogg in relation to One Nation and somehow the coalition's role in One Nation. I am not sure how it is relevant but, seeing that we were allowed to hear from Senator Hogg about One Nation, let me just remind the chamber and the people of Australia that at the last election in the electorate of Brand, which is Mr Beazley's electorate, who did he put before the Liberal candidate on the how-to-vote card?  None other than the candidate that was standing for Australians Against Further Immigration. And in Kalgoorlie, where the member is Graeme Campbell—most people describe him as `Pauline Hanson without a dress' because they have exactly the same policies—Labor put Mr Campbell at No. 2 on their how-to-vote card. That was their second choice in Kalgoorlie.
After the last federal election there was a by-election in Lindsay. The Labor Party, in their desperation to win that seat, put the Shooters Party first and Australians Against Further Immigration before the Liberal candidate. Now they claim that they come to the issue of the allocation of preferences with clean hands. They could have done so had Mr Beazley, in his own seat, put the Liberal candidate ahead of the Australians Against Further Immigration candidate. But they did not do so. They could have come with clean hands had they put, in Kalgoorlie, the Liberal candidate before Mr Campbell. But they did not so. They could have done so if, in the Lindsay by-election, they had put the Liberal candidate before the Australians Against Further Immigration candidate and the Shooters Party candidate.
—Will you put Hanson last?
—Order! Senator Cook, you know that interjections are disorderly.
—Isn't it amazing? It really does hurt the Labor Party when their record is repeated to them.
—Say it now.
—Order! Senator Cook, you know that excessive interjection is disorderly and all remarks in this chamber should be directed through the chair.
—Thank you, Mr Chairman. What got me into this debate was having to listen to the spray of nonsense from the other side over the past two days. I wanted to set on the record the Labor record in relation to the allocation of preferences—thanks to Senator Hogg's contribution—but, more importantly, the Labor Party's behaviour in relation to privatisation. Its record in government is in stark contradistinction to what it is now saying in opposition. I join with Cheryl Kernot—it is not often that I would do so—the lady that the Labor Party is now parading—
—Another defection.
—I do not do it very often, Senator Stott Despoja. I do not think, whilst she was your leader, that you joined with her very often either. In fact, didn't she sack you with a fax once? One of the better decisions! That aside, one of the few occasions on which I do agree with Cheryl Kernot was when she said:
I think Labor in opposition won't sell Telstra, but I'm more worried about Labor in government.
That sums it up in a nutshell, doesn't it? It was a very concise statement, very pithy and also very true—indeed, indisputably true. When you look at Labor's track record you find they have privatised everything and have then squandered the money. That is not something we will do.
—No, you are going to try to buy the votes of the National Party.
—No, we are going to pay back the legacy of debt that you left this country, Senator Carr. That is what we are going to do. We believe that if there is one important social justice issue in this country it is not to live in a profligate way now and force the next generation to pay off the debts 
 and the money squandered by government. We have to learn to live within our means.
I dispel one other assertion that has been made by Labor—that somehow the Liberal Party has not been true on the election policy that we would sell only one-third of Telstra in this term of government. We will not sell another single share of Telstra until after the next election. That is a solemn guarantee. We are going to have the legislation ready and, if the people of Australia accept us as the ongoing government, we will start the process after we are re-elected. If Labor gets elected they have the option not to proceed with it. But mark Cheryl Kernot's words:
I think Labor in opposition won't sell Telstra, but I'm more worried about Labor in government.
After the next election the people will have a choice on the sale of Telstra, with debt reduction by the Liberal government, or a dishonest sale of Telstra—it will take place anyway, according to Cheryl Kernot—with the money being squandered and Australia's debt position worsening even further.
The Labor Party do not come to this debate with clean hands in relation to privatisation, election promises and the allocation of preferences. You name it, their record speaks for itself. Their actions in government speak so much louder than their empty rhetoric in opposition.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-07-11,"—I will speak for only five minutes in response to a couple of comments—one by Senator Stott Despoja and one by Senator Murphy. I refer to Senator Stott Despoja's argument, in response to my argument that the drop in jobs in Telstra was predominantly caused by the deregulatory environment and that deregulation was agreed to by the Labor Party and the government. I normally do not say anything in this chamber unless it is backed up by fact. I have had this matter studied and have the details of it. This is from an impeccable source. In summary, the fact of the matter—
—Are you going to name your source?
—A senior member of the Parliamentary Library staff. The upshot, 
 in summary, is that telecommunications is a very high growth industry. Whilst its services are very capital intensive, the companies involved, particularly Telstra, are significant employers. But, as the industry becomes more capital intensive through elimination of manual exchanges and reduced dependence on traditional copper wire infrastructure, it is to be expected that employment growth will ease or actually decline. That is in the carriers. Of course in the service industry it is a very big growth area.
—Did he say 27,000?
—If you listen, you will understand that I am giving the summary of what I have been advised. You will recall that this has probably to do with the fact that the Telstra cable rollout program has been largely scaled down over the last 18 months. But to go on to the summary, the easing off in Telstra's employment growth since 1996 is the response to deregulation, to the extent that Telstra has lost market share in the long-distance markets. It is too early to say what impact privatisation has had on Telstra employment, but the predominant influences have been the impact of deregulation and the labour shedding effects of technological change.
Senator Stott Despoja also mentioned the added impact of the workplace relations legislation on employment in that particular industry. I agree; I voted against the workplace relations legislation. But guess who voted for it? The Australian Democrats. Led by who? Cheryl Kernot. And who is Cheryl Kernot now? Labor has her as a candidate.
As to Senator Murphy's continuous misstatements—he got the $160 million wrong; it was $183 million that flowed to Tasmania—he now says that I may be voting for this legislation because of some preference deal with the Liberal Party. Well, I have actually heard it all! I say this quite deliberately: in all of the elections I have stood in that I can recall, I have distributed my preferences half to Labor and half to Liberal. Maybe I should be more selective in future.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-07-11,"—I should at the outset inform the committee—and I am sure it will be a great 
 relief to them—that I am the third last speaker on the preamble from the Labor side. I will be followed by my leader.
—We have a speakers list, do we?
—We do on our side.
—Obviously it has been all worked out, has it?
—Yes, absolutely. It is absolutely in an orderly fashion, for the Liberal Party Whip. We will have Senator Faulkner, then we will have Senator Schacht sum up and then we will proceed. I am not trying to preclude other people from speaking to the committee; I just thought that I would at least put our side.
One of the things we have been trying to do in the committee stage is examine what are the unwritten, or written, protocols that we have not seen and that are associated with this legislation. We have the legislation, then we have an understanding out there somewhere as to what will be done, especially in rural Australia, as a result of this legislation but not included in this legislation. This has forced us into a fairly vigorous evaluation of the role of the National Party of Australia—what role they have played in this and what position they will be in to try to enforce agreements that may have been reached, albeit that those agreements are in a very vague form.
It has been regrettable that we have had to reflect on the fact that the National Party of Australia in this federal parliament is a bunch of weak, vacillating backsliders—people who have no ability to enforce agreements with their senior coalition party. It is a shadow of a party now over what it once was. Essentially, that exists because of the personnel that the National Party of Australia has in this particular parliament. One need only look at the intellectual dwarfs and lightweights that exist in the National Party of Australia—
Senator Brownhill interjecting—
—How often has he spoken?
Government senators interjecting—
—Loquacious Brownhill has said more words in that one 
 interjection than in any other than one speech this year. Congratulations! That interjection was your second-longest speech this year. Congratulations! Have a look at his colleagues in New South Wales. The National Party of Australia has 10 seats in the current House of Representatives. Four of those people are retiring at the next election, putting the cue in the rack because they don't want to stick around for the massacre that is going to follow. Mr Sinclair is getting out, Mr Hicks is getting out, and on they go: Mr Cobb is departing and, finally, Mr Sharp is departing. Four out of 10 of them are jumping ship, so I will ignore them because they will not be around to enforce the deal done.
Who else have they got left? They have Mr Anderson. What would he know about the bush these days? Mr Anderson has moved to Canberra. Mr Anderson lives with his family in Canberra. I do not mind that. For a senior minister with the family arrangements that he has, I think that is not a bad idea. But why not change your nominated residence to Canberra and be honest with the rural voters of New South Wales? They would understand why he moved to Canberra. They would understand why he is no longer in the bush.
Government senators interjecting—
—Order! Would Government senators please observe the standing orders. You know that excessive interjection is disorderly. You will have an opportunity to respond in debate if you choose.
—So Mr Anderson is no longer much of the bush. We have Senator Brownhill, who is constantly interrupting me.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. I do not know whether there is anything in the standing orders about hitting below the belt, but I believe that reference to Mr Anderson is totally unfair. If Senator Ray knew of Mr Anderson's circumstances in relation to his disabled child, he would not have said that.
—On the contrary. I said that I thought he had legitimate reasons to be in Canberra. What you then do, Senator 
 Harradine, is change your home base. That is the point of it.
—Paul Keating did, didn't he?
—I also think Mr Keating was right to move here. I have never criticised a politician for moving here, but don't pretend that your home base is in rural New South Wales, when it is not.
—There is no point of order in the matter raised by Senator Harradine.
—Thank you Mr Temporary Chairman. Moving through the ranks, we have Mr Causley, the member for Page—a failed New South Wales minister. What is his full-time job?
—Bagging Fischer.
—I have only ever heard him on one occasion hit the headlines—bagging Mr Tim Fischer. Well known for his loyalty is Mr Causley—constantly undermining the Leader of the National Party. Then we have Mr Fischer, with his toy phones, running around the country, promising everyone whatever they want because he is in a total and absolute panic.
—What has this got to do with the sale of Telstra?
—Thank you, Senator Calvert. We are looking at the ability of the National Party of Australia to enforce the arrangements it has made with your party. Through you Mr Temporary Chairman, to the government whip, he knows that the Liberal Party is going to do over the National Party. He knows that they are going to come crawling and grovelling back into coalition, because they lack the intellectual rigour and the intestinal fortitude to put the views of their own constituents.
This is the great tragedy. We all know that the Queensland branch of the National Party is a corrupt and rotten organisation. You could never make that accusation against the New South Wales branch of the National Party. They have been the intellectual backbone of the National Party around Australia. They have also stood for decency far more 
 than any other National Party branch around Australia. But, unfortunately, even though they have those two qualities, they now stand for absolute mediocrity. Therein lies the tragedy; their federal representatives are simply not up to the mark. Their federal representatives cannot represent them any more. They are only interested in cushy deals in government—in being obsequious in the coalition government—and not properly representing their constituents.
Moving to the uglier side of politics, why don't we consider the Queensland branch of the National Party. This is the branch where the President, David Russell, ignores their federal representatives—ignores their views on where preferences should go at the next election. He wants to undo the very good gun laws brought into this country—he wants to junk them. He wants to junk the basic economic policies in this country, all because of the backsliding attitude he expressed during the last Queensland state election. If you are looking for a scapegoat—if you are looking for someone who delivered disaster at the last Queensland election—it was the National Party of Queensland, both at their organisational level and their parliamentary level. Give credit where credit is due—there is a lot of uneasiness in the federal branch of the National Party. At least give them credit for that.
But what has been their overall attitude? First of all, we have Mr Katter. He does not believe in this particular piece of legislation; he has said so publicly time and time again. Then we have Mrs Kelly, the member up north; she has also stated several times publicly that she does not support this piece of legislation. So every time the people opposite get up and criticise us for our attitude, we have some allies in the National Party in Queensland that would not reinforce that view.
I personally have never heard what Mr Marek's views are on Telstra. I think he is too busy helping with race relations in his own seat—and offering out boxes of biscuits and all the rest of it—to bother expressing a view. Then we have Mr Neville, the member for Hinkler. I have not heard his view. I did 
 hear his views on cross-media ownership, where he took a very honourable position—indeed, I have to say, a courageous position. If it wasn't for Mr Neville, the member for Hinkler, I suspect the cross-media ownership rules would have changed in this country. I have not heard his views on Telstra, so I will say that, with him, the jury is out.
—He voted for it.
—Senator Calvert intervenes to assist me to say that he voted for the bill, but I do not know whether that was out of loyalty to the coalition or out of personal choice. Then we have the two great esteemed senators from Queensland. What credibility do they have? Remember the great statement that Senator O'Chee made to the ethnic councils in Brisbane? If One Nation won one seat, he would walk backwards from Brisbane to the Gold Coast. That means it is eight or 10 trips that he has to make. Why don't we give him leave now, and he can start his journey walking backwards now?
—He can start from Canberra.
—He could start from Canberra indeed. So Senator O'Chee generally has very little credibility. But we all feel some sympathy for the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, who comes from Queensland. He has been most concerned about this piece of legislation. He has expressed that concern—
—Not concerned enough to do anything about it.
—No, I will have to come to that—in sadness and in sorrow rather than in the heat of the moment. He has clearly been distressed by these processes, but the fact is, when push came to shove, Senator Boswell gave in. I am critical of him for giving in—and I say that so that he can hear it—because he has been conned. He has been made promises that will never be delivered. Senator Alston's modus operandi is to find out, without everyone else knowing, what Telstra is going to do anyway, and then he offers it up.
—The only people he cons are in the National Party.
—No, not the only people Senator Faulkner, there are others. He works out, `Look, $200 million is due to be spent in Queensland in the next year, it hasn't been announced, I'll get the boys in and tell them I am going to give them $200 million. It's already in the forward budget of Telstra.'
—It's in the business plan.
—In the business plan, as Senator Carr says. And what happens? They fall for it, hook, line and sinker. What we have here is a bankrupt New South Wales branch intellectually, albeit with their traditions of some intellectual rigour in the past. They have produced some great national leaders in Anthony and Sinclair over the years—I cannot bring myself to say Charles Blunt so I will not.
—He's part of the new tradition.
—He is part of the new tradition I think. So they basically do not have the herbs in this particular debate. But the National Party in Queensland, with its long tradition of gerrymandering and graft—of the deduct box and all the other practices that have gone on there—have behaved in their normal backsliding way, in which they have given in to the coalition just so they can retain their positions or, potentially, get up the greasy pole of politics. It is very humiliating.
If you think that story is sad, if you think that story is unfortunate, go to the rest of Australia. The National Party are not represented in this parliament at all from Western Australia, South Australia or Tasmania. Their last outpost is Victoria. What a marvellous set of representatives the National Party sends up from Victoria.
We talked earlier on about empathy with the bush. Do you know how close the two McGaurans get to the bush? Just down the road at the Flagstaff Gardens in East Melbourne—that is their idea of the bush. They both live in Melbourne and both no longer have any affinity with the bush whatsoever. The two McGaurans represent 66 per cent of the National Party. They are known in Victoria as the photo finish: not a half a head between them.
Peter McGauran was not even in the National Party when he was approached to run for Gippsland. Two days later he was endorsed. Then he was told that his Mercedes was not suitable for going around the electorate. So he bought a brand new Fairmont—cash on the spot—the next day, just to be more suitable to the electorate. Julian McGauran got into this place on a separate Senate ticket. Why was he offered it? Because dad was going to pay all the campaign expenses. That is how he got in here. It was not through ability or through anything else; they put up the campaign capital so that he could be elected. They ran a very good campaign, and he did get in here.
—I raise a point of order. We have been going for 25 hours and the opposition has not dealt with the details of this legislation in this committee. I submit that what Senator Ray is saying now is out of order and not consistent with examination in the committee stage of the bill.
—On the point of order, I notice now that Senator Harradine is coming to the defence of the National Party. We have had the Liberal Party and now we have Senator Harradine. We will never see Senator Colston down here and we will certainly never see the National Party defending their own party in this chamber. Senator Harradine knows that is not a point of order; it is an abuse of the Senate's procedures and I would ask you to rule him out of order.
—On the point of order, I believe that Senator Ray, for whom I did have some admiration maybe about 10 years ago, has actually shot himself to ribbons. The taxpayers are paying this parliament to be here today to debate a very important bill, the Telstra bill, and I do not think that Senator Ray has made many comments about it at all in his speech. I would ask you to bring him to order and to bring him back to the point.
—Further to that point of order—
—I think I am in a position to rule on the point of order, Senator Schacht.
—I would like to speak on the point of order.
—I am ready to rule, Senator Schacht. Senator Harradine's point of order is relevant. With regard to the preamble, which is currently under debate in the committee stage, it is important that senators make their remarks relevant to that preamble. I would remind Senator Ray of the requirement that his comments be made relevant to the bill.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Chairman, for your wise guidance. I will finish on this note. The real point about the preamble, just to explain it to Senator Harradine as slowly as I can—
—I'm voting against it.
—Yes, we understand that. But just because you vote against something does not mean we cannot have a say. You can walk in here and gag us five times but we are still permitted—humbly, on the one or two occasions that you permit us, the representatives of four million voters—to occasionally say something, if you do not mind.
The point is that the preamble is important because it is the one occasion on which we can express our view to say, `We know what is in the bill. We know there are other matters being determined offshore. If we are told precisely what matters are being determined offshore, we can then better evaluate when we go through the rest of the bill clause by clause.' That is the point. If the National Party of Australia are the only guarantor we have, we are entitled to go to their credibility to see whether they can cut the mustard to enforce whatever secret deal has been made that we are not being told about; hence our rather abrasive but very accurate assessment of this pathetic excuse for a political party that sold out their constituents and betrayed their history.

"Brownhill, Sen David",NP,1998-07-11,"—I have never seen a filibuster being operated like the one the Labor Party is operating on this bill at this particular time. Before I start my few remarks 
 on this, I would like to state my pecuniary interest in Telstra.
—I bet you can't do it in 15 minutes.
—Would you ever like to close your mouth and talk a bit of commonsense for a change?
—No.
—Order! Senator Brownhill, it is out of order to address senators directly. Your remarks must be directed through the chair.
—Through the chair, could I ask the Leader of the Opposition to keep quiet so that he can actually listen for a change? I have never heard anyone talk so much, say so little and listen so few times in the time I have been in this place listening to him.
I am a great user of Telstra as a telephone service. As far as my pecuniary interests are concerned, I have no knowledge of any shares that I own in Telstra, as my shares are all held through a power of attorney.
—You are not on the computer, I can guarantee you that.
—You would have told me already if I had any, I would imagine.
—You are not on the register.
—My wife and my children may have shares in Telstra, but they are all adult children and run their own businesses and that sort of thing.
I saw the height of hypocrisy here this morning when the Leader of the Opposition did not allow prayers to be said before the debate even started this morning. It was something that could so easily have been done. Even Senator Ray would agree that it could have been done by agreement among everyone. For the Leader of the Opposition to have—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Opposition senators' interjections are disorderly. I ask them to abide by the standing orders of the chamber.
—It does no credit to opposition senators led by Senator Faulkner. When I came into this place, I was told a couple of things by the likes of former senator John Button, who led the Labor Party in the Senate when it was in government with distinction and a lot of decorum. He always played the game properly. He did not lead Labor senators to the sin bin as much as these people should have gone to it in the last little while. Former senator Gareth Evans was actually not that bad a person. He played it tough, but he played it a bit better than the current Labor Senate leader now is.
It is time we got this debate back to the Telstra bill. After 13 years of Labor mismanagement, the Australian taxpayers were left with about $96 billion of debt by the Labor Party. The interest on the debt is over $8 billion. That money could be spent on health, roads and education, et cetera. The Howard-Fischer government committed themselves to using the proceeds of this Telstra sale to wipe out 40 per cent of that debt. Isn't that good? Why do you not want that to happen? Why did you create the debt in the first instance? Why did the Labor Party really want to perpetuate that debt on the Australian people? It is one reason why Telstra needs to be sold. I want it to be sold. I have always fully supported the sale of Telstra.
The Australian people flocked to the sale of the first third of Telstra. Something like 1.5 million people have bought shares in Telstra. You cannot tell me that they are all wrong. More people will own it and benefit from it, including both the users and the investors; that is the most important thing about this bill. There will be cheaper services from Telstra, and that will happen. Give it time to happen. By law, Telstra is required to reduce the price of a basket of its main services currently by 7.5 per cent in real terms, and you know it. Why not admit it and get on with the debate?
Labor, including those opposite, says that Telstra should not be sold as it is a monopoly. This is untrue. It is not a fact. This is an intensely competitive industry. Telstra has Optus, AAPT and Primus and other competi 
 tors. It is the real world out there, you monopolists.
What about the rural safeguards and the universal service obligations, which state that all Australians must have access to the standard telephone service and pay phones regardless of where they live in Australia? The sale will not change this. There will be subsidised connection costs. By law, residential connection costs must decrease every year by one per cent in real terms. As to local price call gaps, the Howard-Fischer government has introduced a scheme to ensure that local call prices in regional areas do not exceed the average local call cost in the major cities. This will stay no matter who owns Telstra.
Thanks to the Howard-Fischer government, the most remote 17,000 Telstra customers now receive a rebate on their pastoral calls of up to $160 per year. Last year, the government spent $250 billion on a regional telecommunications infrastructure fund to ensure that rural and regional phone users have access to the latest technology. To date, 93 rural and regional projects worth $49 million have been approved.
There is also $60 million additional to the RTIF from the social bonus, including $20 million for remote island communities such as the Torres Strait islands and Christmas Island. But you people do not care about them either. The customer service guarantee states that the level of service will not be affected by the sale of Telstra. This is a legislated standard binding all telecommunications companies. Get the facts. Talk a bit about the facts instead of having a diatribe against the National Party.
Why are you so worried about the National Party that you want to have a diatribe against us the whole time? You condemn Senator Boswell for the job that he has done. He has done a great thing for rural communities. If the service does fail, the customers are entitled to compensation from the company. The government has introduced legislation to strengthen that guarantee.
What about untimed local calls? These are here to stay. Under the previous government, the only guarantee covered residential customer calls. This government has extended this 
 guarantee to cover voice and data calls for residential customers and voice calls for business customers. An amount of $150 million is provided to abolish Telstra's pastoral call rate and provide untimed local calls in extended zones in remote Australia. That was announced just a couple of days ago. As to the price gaps, currently Telstra cannot increase the price of untimed local calls above 25c for local residential and business calls and 40c for local public phone calls. Look at a few of the facts and figures on what is happening rather than have a diatribe all the time.
Why does Senator Schacht not make some comments about the telecommunications ombudsman, for example? He has been a good debater over the years. Why filibuster and go through this diatribe? Labor should also take into account what we did with the CDMA in the analog-digital changeover, which was also announced during the week. The sale of Telstra will take our telecommunications systems into the 21st century in the way I want, living in a country area.
You people all talk about what you will do for the bush. None of you have ever lived in the bush. None of you have ever known what happens in the bush. You claim that you know everything.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-07-11,"—Once upon a time—
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. I have been seeking the call now for just on an hour. What are your reasons for continuing to ignore this end of the chamber?
—I am not ignoring that end of the chamber. Senator Faulkner had previously indicated his intention to seek the call. I have given him the call. You will receive the call in due course, unless Senator Faulkner wants to cede.
—I do not mind ceding. ",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1998-07-11,"—I thank Senator Faulkner. We have had quite a number of Labor Party speakers and, as we have seen, government speakers. I would like to answer a couple of the comments made by Senator—my mind has become a total blank.
—That's right, Senator Blank.
—I do not mean any disrespect. I apologise, Senator Brownhill.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—With due respect, I meant no disrespect.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. Whether somebody remembers somebody's name or not is irrelevant. Let us get on with the debate instead of having this hilarious mob of jackasses on the other side here behaving in the way that they are.
—There is no point of order. Before you proceed, Senator Lees, I ask both opposition and government senators to maintain the decorum of the chamber.
—There is a series of senators whose comments I would like to pick up. Senator Brownhill is quite right; we need to get back to the debate. It was not only Senator Brownhill who said this but there were some earlier comments from Senator Boswell regarding this whole idea that we will be better off as far as debt is concerned if we retire some of the public debt. That is a nonsense. Australia's net public debt is the second lowest in the developed world, the second lowest in the OECD. The only country that has a lower public sector debt is South Korea. Our problem is our current account deficit. If we go ahead and sell Telstra, particularly looking at the amount that you will let go offshore, all it will do is increase our problems because of the repatriated profit to overseas companies. If Senator Brownhill read the transcripts of the committee hearings, he would find that our net public worth will fall if we sell this. Keeping Telstra in public ownership, if we look at our total worth, is far 
 better for this country, particularly for future generations.
I want to try to get back to some of what we should be debating in this bill. Because I suspect that, by the time the guillotine comes down, we may never have got past the preamble stages, I have been progressively discussing Australian Democrat amendments. We do have a large number of amendments to this bill. Presuming that it is going to be sold, we want to make sure that what is sold is going to be reasonably workable. It is by no means going to be reasonable in terms of the situation as far as rural people are concerned. That point has been made more than enough this morning.
I want to run through, for the benefit of those who are continuing the filibuster, what we are trying to achieve in our amendments. To start with, one of our amendments looks at preventing Telstra from being sold until the Australian Communications Authority has certified that it has restored the levels of service back to 1996 performance. In other words, we want to ensure that they are repairing our phones when they break down and that they are putting on new services. We seek to put a hold on the sale, if it has to go ahead, until we have at least got services back to where they were before the first one-third was sold.
Secondly, our amendments require the indicative share price to be approved by parliament. This is Democrat amendment No. 5. We have seen time and time again that when shares are sold in a public entity there is a huge windfall gain to those who are buying the shares compared with those of us who do not buy. It is appalling that this government is so intent on selling that it is basically going to do it in a rush. Let us look at what happened when the first third was sold. It was sold for $3.30 per share. Within a day, the price shot up to $4. At the moment, the shares are just under $6. This is great for the 10 per cent of Australians that can afford it, but what about the rest of us? What we have now is an $11 billion windfall going to those who bought in—and that is the first third. Imagine what we could do with $11 
 billion in our public hospital system, in our schools, in our roads, et cetera.
We should look at the way that the Department of Finance handled previous sales. A wide range of stockbrokers have had some involvement, but none of that ever seems to register on the department. HSBC James Capel was one firm saying that it had to be at $4 per share. Look at what was happening in New Zealand with its float. An amount of $4 per share was again indicated. The finance department set an indicative range the first time of $2.80 to $3.40—well below any reasonable estimate. I have not heard anything from this government to explain the $11 billion windfall that it handed over with the first one-third sale. It must never happen again.
—Their mates the stockbrokers got it.
—It has not just happened with Telstra. If we look, Senator Schacht, at what Labor unfortunately did with the Commonwealth Bank, those shares were sold at 58 per cent less than they were worth. By the time the government received its final instalments, those shares were worth $2.8 billion more than what the government sold them for. In both cases, the finance department and its advisers delivered windfall gains to 10 per cent of Australians at the expense of the rest of us. In other words, we have seen the community ripped off time and time again. It should not happen again.
We need to move on. One of the amendments I mentioned before, which Senator Murray will be moving, is to prevent Telstra making donations to any political party. As we have been discussing, regulations are going to be critically important. If we are going to see a situation where $100,000 goes here and $100,000 goes there to different political parties, the incentive will be to keep on the right side of Telstra. But its profits are almost totally dependent now on regulation. We have to go into this debate now presuming that it is going to be sold. Senator Murray will develop the arguments as to why we should not have political parties involved at all with any potential donations from what will be Australia's biggest company.
Let us look at Democrat amendment No. 10. This is another accountability measure. The Department of Finance management of the first sale of Telstra, as I said, was an accountability disaster. At the very least, we believe that it demands that any decision involving public money and public revenue must be made by senior public servants. The way this bill is structured at the moment, basically anybody can be involved. It simply allows cabinet to appoint anyone. Your stockbroking firm could handle the sale. It could be handed over to one of our banks. We are arguing that it really could be a junior public servant with absolutely no skills whatsoever. So the Democrat amendment is trying to get at least back to the situation in the current act, which is that people are appointed on merit from the senior ranks of the senior executive service. I do not believe that something as important as this sale should be delegated any lower than that.
Amendment 11, which I discussed in my speech on the second reading, deals with foreign ownership. We believe that Australians are becoming more concerned and more aware of the dangers of foreign ownership when it is not necessary and when it has nothing productive to offer. If we are trying to set up new businesses and industries, there may be a case for encouraging foreign ownership up to that 49 per cent level and getting them to work jointly with Australians.
This is an established company. We do not need to hand over half, a third or whatever of the additional profits. I would just like to put on the record what happened with the first tranche. Foreign investors were allocated about 19 per cent of shares. Most of these were re-sold within a month, delivering windfall capital gains to foreign investors at the expense of the Australian taxpayers. The total windfall gain to foreign investors was around $1 billion. As one example, the Bank of Ireland was allocated the fourth largest shareholding in Telstra last December. It lasted in the market less than three weeks. It stayed on the register less than three weeks, and it went out pocketing $26 million in profit. Why are we letting that happen? Where is the commonsense? Where is the 
 logic in handing $26 million to the Bank of Ireland for an investment in Australia that lasted less than three weeks? I am sure they would have been very pleased, but there is absolutely no benefit in that for us.
We are asking this government to think yet again. We are asking the opposition and we are especially asking Senator Harradine to really look at why we have to privatise Telstra when the company is established and it is an extremely valuable company. If we have to privatise it, then let us at least leave the windfall gains and the profits here in Australia. As I said before, public debt is not the problem. It is the second lowest in the OECD; indeed, it is about two-thirds of what the average is in the OECD.
—It is half of Germany's and the UK's.
—If we want to look at some of the countries, Senator, it only about a quarter of Italy's debt. I am not suggesting for a moment—
—Don't worry about Italy. It's Germany and the UK.
—Germany and the UK are comparable and you are quite right, Senator, that it is only about half. The problem is not our public sector debt. It is our Bankcard, if you like—our balance of payments. If we sell offshore, the profits follow the sale. That ticks over on our current account deficit and up it goes. There is no logical reason; there is no economic reason.
—Is that the $10 billion debt we inherited from the Labor Party?
—If you do not know what the current account deficit is, Senator, I am not going to explain it to you now. I have been through some of the past records. We believe that if again we have privatisation done in this way—organised by the department—the level of foreign ownership we are looking at is quite unacceptable.
I will finish by speaking to our Democrat amendment No. 16, which seeks to modify the membership of the Telstra board by adding two independent directors. We would like to see one of these elected by the employees. Look at what has happened to 
 Telstra. There have been 20,000-odd retrenchments in that organisation, and morale is at rock bottom. If you look overseas—and perhaps I can use the example of Germany again—companies that have an elected member on the board are highly successful. The relationship between the establishment in the company—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order!
—Thank you, Madam Chair. The relationship between the workers in the company, and the board is extremely important. As has been found overseas, one director nominated by—indeed elected by—the work force is extremely important.
Looking at all the promises that have been made to the National Party, we believe there also should be a director with experience in the bush, in other words, someone who has genuine credentials—
—Not a National Party director, elected by them?
—We are arguing, Senator Schacht, that it should be somebody from rural Australia, nominated by the President of the Australian Local Government Association. I think it is extremely important that the government starts putting some amendments down on the table that reflect some of the deals that have been done with the National Party. If we wanted to spend another couple of hours on this debate—hours which we now do not have, looking at where we are—we would go through the promises that we know have been made and try to legislate for them, because it does not seem that the National Party is going to be coming in here with its own set of amendments. I believe that should be a real consideration of this government. Remember how big this organisation is going to be. It is going to be twice the size of BHP—the same as BHP and the National Australia Bank.
—How many countries in the world have government owned telecommunications?
—Senator Calvert, that is enough, thank you.
—This amendment does not interfere with the Telstra board's obligations to shareholders, but it recognises that Telstra also has responsibilities to its employees. It also has significant responsibilities now to keep up with service obligations that have been put upon it—service obligations that are going to eat into its profits and be resisted tooth and nail. As Telstra, with only one-third privatised, has been showing us with a steady deterioration in service over the last 18 months, they cannot be trusted. Having somebody on the board who is specifically watching what is happening in rural Australia is at least a small step in the right direction.
I go back to an earlier amendment—and I commend this in particular to Senator Harradine—and that is that we put a requirement into the sale that, until they get service levels back up to where they were, we do not sell. Until Telstra can prove on the ground that they can fix our phones and get them connected within the required time, we simply do not sell.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1998-07-11,"—I want to respond to a number of the issues that were raised by Senator Brownhill and others in the debate, and I will come to those. I was not surprised that Senator Lees forgot Senator Brownhill's name in this committee stage of the debate.
—He is forgettable.
—It is not so much that he is forgettable. That was only Senator Brownhill's third speech in this calendar year. He has made three contributions, one of which was 20 seconds in length. I am not surprised that his name was forgotten.
—Madam Temporary Chairman, on a point of order, just as an explanation: if you have a portfolio when in government, as Senator Faulkner well knows, you actually speak on issues pertaining to your policy area.
—There is no point of order, as you know. I call Senator Faulkner.
—I know which senator in the chamber from now on will be 
 known as Senator David Dolittle. I will come back to that, and I will come back to the National Party.
—What a comedian! Why don't you give up your day job and go on the stage?
—I do not want to just talk about a political party that is irrelevant. I do not want to just talk about a political party that is dominated by the Liberal Party. I do not want to just talk about a political party that is intellectually, morally and politically bankrupt. I do not want to just talk about a political party that has gone AWOL. I do not want to just talk about a political party that is out of touch and not up to it in this country. I do not want to just talk about a lacklustre political party.
—On a point of order, Madam Temporary Chairman: I draw your attention to a ruling made by the previous occupant of the chair, who ruled Senator Faulkner's continued attack on the National Party as being out of order. The previous chairperson drew Senator Faulkner's attention to the bill and ruled him out of order on relevance. Madam Temporary Chairman, I ask you to make the same ruling on the basis of consistency.
—Senator Boswell, I believe the previous judgment was not exactly as you have suggested. It was to require the senator to address his remarks at some stage to the preamble, which is the question before the chair. Senator Faulkner has just started, I hope he will do so.
—Thank you for that ruling, and I will. Let me assure the committee that, if I am not unduly interrupted, mine will be the second last Labor contribution on the preamble to the bill. If I am unduly interrupted, I might have to speak again.
Let me say that I am not just speaking about a political party that is the most embarrassing now in this nation. I am not only going to speak about the National Party. I did not mention the National Party, but Senator Boswell was right because I was going to refer to them. All those descriptions do apply to the National Party. I want to speak about 
 an individual as I address the preamble. I want to speak about someone who is venal. I want to speak about someone who is unscrupulous. I want to speak about someone who is mercenary. I want to speak about someone who is contemptible and despicable. I want to speak about someone who is the most useless and abominable representative the federal parliament has ever seen. That person is a person who last night skulked into this chamber, slimed into the chamber quite slowly to collect his TA cheque. That individual is Senator Malcolm Colston. I want to talk about him, too.
—Senator Faulkner, some of your remarks are unparliamentary. I urge you to be cautious about what you might further say about Senator Colston, your colleague in this place.
—If there is anything unparliamentary, I will withdraw it. Let me say that I want to speak about Senator Colston because I want every—
—On a point of order: Senator Faulkner just said, `If there is anything objectionable, I will not pursue it,' or words to that effect.
—No, I said that if it is unparliamentary, I will withdraw it.
—Senator Faulkner knows full well that he is not entitled to cast aspersions on other senators, let alone engage in that vitriolic diatribe that he is about to embark on and which, if he is not restrained, will presumably continue. There can be no possible basis for allowing that sort of bile to be spewed out in this chamber.
—There is no further addition to the point that I have already ruled on. I understood Senator Faulkner's words to mean to the extent that he had said anything unparliamentary. I remind you again, Senator Faulkner, that you may not cast aspersions on your colleagues in this place.
—Let me say that this is a very important point as we debate the preamble of the bill. The votes on this bill and on the preamble are tainted. They are tainted because of Senator Colston. They are 
 tainted because not only did Senator Colston rat on the Australian Labor Party and the people of Queensland who elected him to this place, not only was Senator Colston bought for the deputy presidency of the Senate in 1996 and not only was he bought—
—On a point of order: there is no factual basis for any of these aspersions. They would be utterly defamatory if said outside the chamber. They are clearly not addressing the preamble in any shape or form. They are simply a very personal and very vicious attack on a member of this Senate. Madam Temporary Chairman, there can be no possible basis on which you could regard them as anything other than casting the most serious aspersions on the individual senator. This is not an attempt to debate policy. This has got nothing to do with the preamble. This is simply the Labor Party getting its own back in the way that it knows best. We know how it operates down in the bowels of the town hall. We know what happened to Peter Baldwin. No doubt, Senator Faulkner thinks it is a badge of honour if you can survive the Baldwin attack.
—Order! There is no further point of order at this time. I will be listening very closely to Senator Faulkner. He has been reminded and I will recall it to his attention should he stray again. I call Senator Faulkner.
—I do understand why the government are trying to cover this up, why they do not want these things said in the chamber, but we are debating the preamble of this bill. I say that the vote on the preamble of this bill and the bill as a whole is a tainted vote. The vote in this chamber will not reflect the will of the Australian electorate, and it will not reflect the Australian electorate because the Howard government has done a slimy backdoor deal with Senator Colston to buy his support. A deal was done to upgrade a staff member of Senator Colston's to ensure that the one-third privatisation of Telstra went through this parliament. The will of the electorate is not reflected in these votes on the floor of the chamber. We know, anyway, that we are debating a preamble and a bill that Mr How 
 ard, the Prime Minister, categorically stated in 1996 would not be a matter brought before this parliament because he gave one of his non-core commitments, one of the Howard-type promises not to fully privatise Telstra. That is the breach of promise of this government. That is the breach of promise of this Prime Minister.
Many have been involved in this massive sell-out, not only Senator Colston, who did his deal yesterday in Brisbane with Mr Howard—and we are entitled to know what they discussed, what promises were made by the Prime Minister, what was offered up to get this tainted vote again for the government. I also want to know, as we move to a vote on the preamble to this bill and the full privatisation of Telstra, what was promised to Senator Harradine. Why is he going to vote in this way? I think we are entitled to know that before the preamble is put to the parliament, before the preamble is determined by this committee, before the bill passes this particular chamber.
I want to know why Senator Harradine has had this massive change of heart. He has always opposed cutting off debate before, but every time he has been in a stitch-up with the government, gag after gag after guillotine after gag, he has done anything to stop debate, anything to get in this massive fix with the government on Telstra. But there, of course, is the rub. It would not matter what Senator Colston did in this vote on the preamble or on the bill, it would not matter what Senator Harradine did, if the National Party, the representatives of the bush, were willing to stand up and be counted on behalf of their constituency.
Once upon a time, the National Party was the Country Party. Once upon a time, it was led by people with the political fortitude of Black Jack McEwen, Doug Anthony and Ian Sinclair. We did not agree with those people. We had a fundamentally different political, ideological position. We had a different view of the world, a different approach to politics, but they were tough. They, at least, were consistent. They, at least, argued hard for their constituency. They, at least, stood up for 
 people in rural and regional Australia. They stood up for the bush.
Since they have departed the scene—in Mr Sinclair's case, he is about to depart the scene—they have been replaced by a new leadership in the National Party, personified by Charles Blunt, personified by Mr Tim Fischer, personified by Senator Ron Boswell. That is the new leadership of the National Party, the new leadership that has just rolled over, turned turtle, on a principle that they have stuck with all their political lives—that is, every Australian should have a stake in the ownership of our telecommunications carrier in this nation.
Would Senator Boswell or Mr Fischer—two-minute Tim—have the guts to stand up? Of course not. They are not the Country Party any more. They are a pale and weak imitation of a once strong political force in this nation, and they ought to be ashamed of what has occurred.
—What a bore! You are just a bore.
—Senator Kemp does not like it. Of course he does not like it. He knows it is true, but he is on the winning side. Senator Kemp is on the winning side. He is one of the Liberals who are winning in this particular political battle.
What about De-Anne Kelly from the House of Representatives National Party, the member for Dawson? In the Canberra Times on 3 July, she said:
There is certainly going to be a much bigger National Party footprint on Coalition policy.
The only footprint in the coalition—
—Is on the forehead—right on the forehead!
—It is not on the forehead, Senator Carr. The only footprint is a great big hobnailed boot right up the backside of the National Party from the Liberals. That is the only footprint we have in this debate. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Senator Boswell, for this really gutless sell-out on behalf of the people you claim to represent. 
—Madam President, I rise on a point of order, and it goes to relevance. You ruled earlier about relevance, and I think that Senator Faulkner is becoming quite irrelevant. He has been irrelevant for the whole debate. He has become even more irrelevant in the last few minutes.
—I do remind Senator Faulkner, once again, that he is addressing the preamble to the bill, and I call that to his attention.
—As I was saying, the vote on the preamble to this bill and the bill itself could be influenced by the National Party. What about New South Wales National Party senator Sandy Macdonald? The Financial Review  of 1 July stated:
NSW National Party Senator Sandy Macdonald said last night his ""initial preference""—
that is, his initial preference—
was for the Government to sell just 16 per cent of its remaining Telstra shareholding, allowing the Commonwealth to retain majority ownership.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Senator Macdonald told the Australian Financial Review : ""If gradualism is what people in the bush want, then we will push for it.""
—He didn't push very hard.
—He has not pushed for anything. These are just weasel words. He is not even here. He is not even actually in the Senate today to do anything. He is not pushing for anything.
Senator Brownhill, in that pathetic contribution he made to the debate, is the only National Party senator, apart from Senator Boswell, to actually have a go. Senator Brownhill could not go the distance. He could only make a seven-minute speech in a 15-minute time allotment, and it was only the third speech he has made in 1998, one of which was of 20 seconds duration. This is the sort of representative the National Party has in this place. This is the sort of person that, on votes on the preamble to this bill and the bill, the bush people are depending on to stand up for their right, to protect their interests.
Mrs De-Anne Kelly referred to the Prime Minister's remarks on the Telstra privatisation 
 in the Sydney Morning Herald as `central to the government's profile'. Mrs Kelly apparently agreed with that, and she said:
But the profile is regarded as harsh and ugly by many people who feel their concerns are being ignored in the bush.
It is a harsh and ugly profile. People in the bush are not stupid. They know that these characters do not care. They know they cannot mount a fight. Senator Brownhill can make one seven-minute speech, one of three speeches in a year on their behalf, and that was some prepared screed he had been given by the Liberal Party to read out. At least Senator Boswell has a go, and I will give him credit for that. He has had a bit of a go in the debate—a fairly ordinary performance but, nevertheless, he has had a go.
—I rise on a point of order. You still have to bring the Leader of the Opposition, `Mr Iggloo', back to the point of relevance.
—Senator Brownhill, you know it is unparliamentary to name a colleague other than in the proper way.
—I withdraw `Iggloo' because that is only a trade name for him.
—Senator Brownhill, would you withdraw that remark please?
—I withdraw `Iggloo'.
—I did not ask him to withdraw anything he might say about me. That is only the fourth contribution he has made in the parliament in 1998. This is what you are dealing with—no-hopers. He can call me what he likes. He will go down from this day onwards fingered as `Senator David Dolittle' of the National Party from New South Wales. You know deep in your heart that the National Party has betrayed its past.
—Madam Temporary Chairman, do you intend to call the Leader of the Opposition into order in relation to his reference to Senator Brownhill?
—I certainly should, Senator. I also wondered if any of you would want to do that. Senator 
 Faulkner, would you please call your colleagues by their proper title?
—Yes, I was referring to Senator David Brownhill. How does it feel for the National Party members and constituents to know deep down inside that they have been sold out by their Senate representatives, led by Senator Boswell? How does it feel for them to have been betrayed on this vote on the preamble and the bill. How does it feel to have their past betrayed, the great gene pool of McEwen, Anthony, Sinclair—the greats of the past from the Country Party. Once upon a time, there was a Country Party. How does it feel to have let them down so badly?
It will give me no pleasure when the National Party—Senator Boswell and his colleagues—are wiped out in the next election. It will give me no pleasure to see that, because I am concerned that in some places they will be replaced not only by the Labor Party but also, it is quite possible, by another more odious political force—and we have always said more odious. The One Nation Party will move up on the rails and take their seats. We do not want to see that.
But I tell you this: what has become more clear during this debate is that there is only one political party in this country that will stand up consistently for people in regional and rural Australia. There is only one political party that will stand up for the people of the bush. There is only one party that will not sell out on Telstra. There is only one major political party in this country for whom a vote at the next election will guarantee that Telstra will not be privatised, that will stand up for the bush, that will stand up for regional and rural Australia, and that is Labor. That is all Senator Boswell and his cronies have demonstrated in this debate—that Labor will protect the interests of the bush, and these sell-outs, these gutless, lacklustre, no-hopers from the National Party are a finished political force in this country. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-07-11,"—We are debating the first of the Democrats 41 amendments, which relates to the removal of the preamble which the government, the opposition, Senator 
 Harradine, the two Greens and the Labor Party have all agreed should go. However, we are still on this matter. Whilst dealing with this matter we should refer to a section which says that legislation providing for comprehensive community and regulatory safeguards has already been enacted. That may sound like a protective device for consumers, but there is a danger that the interest of Telstra in the regulations, which government will continue to pursue, may result in their being tempted to exercise undue influence on the political process.
At schedule 2, after item 21, the Democrats do intend to move amendment No. 9 on sheet 1124. That directly relates to the preamble in this sense. It relates to the fact that Telstra must not make political donations. The amendment says:
Telstra, or any Telstra body, or any director or employee of Telstra or a Telstra body on behalf of Telstra, must not make, directly or indirectly, any donation, gift or related payment to any political party, candidate or member of parliament within Australia.
Why would the Australian Democrats be moving that amendment, and why is it relevant to the preamble? It is relevant to the preamble because it sets the tone for this bill, and the bill does provide for making Telstra particularly interested in the actions of political parties in this place. Our amendment will seek to introduce yet another fundamentally important accountability measure. It will ban Telstra directly or indirectly making any donations to any politician or political party. We think that would be fundamentally essential to the better functioning and the continuing better functioning of our political process.
Telstra, if it is privatised, will be Australia's biggest company. It will be twice the size of BHP or NAB. As such, it will have enormous financial strength. Anyone who thinks that Telstra will be some passive, gentle giant which will be nice to all Australians is not understanding the aggressiveness that comes from a monopolist. As a private company, with directors dedicated to making a profit for their shareholders, its commercial and competitive aggressiveness will increase fourfold, as will its desire to make more money.
Telstra's profitability depends totally on the extent of regulation provided by this parliament. If this parliament imposes service standards or universal service obligations or infrastructure requirements, Telstra's profitability will be affected. The Democrats do not think that Telstra will take that lying down. We expect this place, once Telstra is privatised, to be inundated with Telstra's lobbyists against any form of regulation, wanting to argue and confine and read down every single clause of the Telecommunications Act that imposes a duty or obligation on them.
I do not think Telstra will be backward about coming forward in the donations department. We have seen in Victoria, where the Crown casino monopoly depends entirely on the nature of regulation and revenue rules, just what can happen when a government and a captive company get too close. Telstra will be in a similar category. This will be Australia's biggest company, but it does control 82 per cent of the market, which is a substantial and aggressive near monopoly. The only thing standing between Telstra and monopolistic profits will be the powers of the regulator, which is the Australian Communications Authority, and this parliament. That is why, more than any other company, Telstra must be precluded from being involved in the political process.
We will be seeking this unusual amendment later on. It is set by the preamble, which says that regulation is vital to this company. We say that, if you have such a large company, you have to be careful of its political power. As a company, it will be too big. The direct impact of our decisions on its profits will be too direct. Accountability will demand that Telstra not be a political player. It must be precluded from making deals with politicians or political parties. It must be banned completely from making any donations or gifts. It would be an unusual ban, but Telstra's dominant position, size and unique regulatory position are unusual. I urge the government and Senator Harradine to show good faith by regarding this amendment favourably—to keep Telstra out of the political arena once it is privatised.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-07-11,"—We are debating the preamble of the bill to amend the Telstra Corporation Act 1991. We are looking at the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998 . The Greens (WA) were prepared to debate each of the amendments put to this bill. We expressed a deep concern, as did many people in the community, that bringing the bill on at this particular stage was totally out of touch with what the community was saying and that the outcomes were not going to be good. Despite all of that, the government decided they were going to do it anyway. The beginning of the preamble says:
The Parliament of Australia considers that Australians should be given the further opportunity to invest in Australia.
That is, we will take what you own, sell it for no—and it can be proved—actual net benefit to the Australian economy and throw you back a few crumbs to make you feel a bit better. At the end it says:
without the inhibitions imposed by government ownership.
Basically, right from the very beginning, you have the ideological stand that `government equals inhibitions; private equals good'. It is the old `four legs good; two legs better' from Animal Farm . Basically, it is ideology put into preamble. The preamble is a nonsense. Further on, it says:
The sale of the Commonwealth's remaining two-thirds equity in Telstra will benefit the Australian community with the majority of the proceeds of the sale applied to the retirement of government debt . . . 
Figures have already been given in this second reading debate that show quite clearly that it is a false accounting tool, that, in the end, Australia will be worse off by the loss of revenue, tax revenue and so on that is normally gained through such a successful operation. Basically, we have a situation where there is no real social bonus. It is a beads and trinkets effect. The reality is that the beads and trinkets will be thrown around during this election campaign, spending people's own money. It is a bit like saying to someone you are going to buy them a birthday present, asking for the money to do it, then buying them something really small and saying, 
 `Aren't I a good person?' That is basically the process we are likely to see during this election campaign.
The next paragraph looks at the legislation authorising the sale not having effect until after the first general election for the House of Representatives. That creates quite a few problems. We would have preferred that it pass through both Houses of parliament. There are amendments to be considered, but nobody really thinks that the government is going to take many of these amendments seriously at all because the deal has been done.
We have an amendment proposed by Senator Harradine that, in effect, says, `The faster you proclaim this legislation, the better.' How does that create any protection? Basically, it is a threat on the government: if you happen to be re-elected and you do not proclaim really quickly, you will have to put the legislation again. It is not an inhibition. Basically, it stops the ability to deal with a very strong message coming out during the election campaign. If, for some strange reason, this government were to get over the line in one way or the other, or in a very odd coalition at the end of the process, the impetus is that they should proclaim it as quickly as possible. If the coalition gets back in, that does not mean that they would actually put it to a vote necessarily. It just means they would give it a tick and proclaim it as soon as possible—no matter what the numbers were in the parliament and no matter what was said to them by the community, and not just by rural and regional Australia.
These concerns are not simply those of rural and regional Australia, though obviously rural and regional Australia feels more strongly in relation to competition policy and the new so-called competitive environment. They feel that they cut out. We have already heard the way the National Party were used in the committee stage processes to savage and monster people from the bush who gave evidence to the inquiry and expressed their concerns about the lack of consultation and the lack of accountability as a result of the privatisation in each tranche.
However, here we see the accountability of the parliament being threatened by the executive; it is undermining the legislative function of the parliament. We would have liked to give serious attention to an amendment. But there is no point now in having these kinds of amendments because the deal has been done.
We believe that pushing through with an unproclaimed bill in this fashion—`Don't worry, there's an election in the meantime; don't worry, we'll look for a mandate'—is a nonsense and a travesty. It undermines the legislative function of the parliament and erodes the accountability of the executive to the parliament. Basically, it means that the executive is not accountable. If we come back after the election, after the government has said that it is going to listen to the Australian people and the Australian people quite clearly tell it about Telstra during this time, the executive will not have to deal with it. Nothing in this legislation says that it will have to deal with that opinion which might be clearly expressed during any election campaign.
The open proclamation is at odds with the legislation handbook and the current drafting rules. It is inconsistent with the concerns about open-ended commencement provisions expressed by the Senate as long ago as 1988 and which are now reflected in standing order 139. It is at odds with the conclusion of the forward estimates in the 1998-99 budget papers. They are not saying the same things in relation to the proceeds of the Telstra sale; so that means that the last budget was incorrect.
It wastes significant public funds. We certainly have seen the spending of significant public funds already in forcing the Senate to deal with something which we were promised would not happen. Not only do we have to look at the cost to the Senate, but we have to look at the cost of the Senate inquiries that have taken place—the two Senate inquiries in particular. Add to that the three still outstanding inquiries: the digital data review, under subsection 481 of the Telecommunications Act; the AMPS regional coverage, under section 5103 of the Telecommunications Act; and also—and most importantly, because it 
 has been mentioned on a number of occasions—the Australian Communications Authority inquiry on review of the customer service guarantee.
So much of this debate now, and even in the previous tranche of this legislation, was dealing with the customer service guarantee. We still have an inquiry outstanding on the customer service guarantee. Yet although public funds have been put into that inquiry, we also have had public funds involved in two Senate inquiries at which strong concerns have been expressed but which the government has ignored. All of that has been ignored in this dingy process.
Returning to the substance of the bill, a lot has been said—and it is in the preamble—about telephone services being reasonable and about guarantees. Quite frankly, it has been established by many people in inquiries that the penalties are not necessarily enforceable and, on occasions, the amounts of penalties do not mean that people will comply. We have no real concept, as with many aspects of competition and privatisation we have seen lately, of how public interest is applied.
Let us go back to the basic question, if we are talking about preamble: what do we have a Telstra for? I would contend—and perhaps it is a naive concept—that a telecommunications company is there to provide telecommunications services. People expect that, when governments provide those services, there is some element of integration of public policy and public interest into that provision.
Yet, all throughout the preamble, we look at the gleeful benefits of commercial flexibility and profitability. Then you have to ask: profitability for whom? The answer of course is the shareholders. We have had very strong arguments during all of the inquiries in relation to what happens under corporate law, and that was argued strongly during the first tranche.
But we only have to look back in the Hansard to see the false assurances we were given at that time. We were told that we were overreacting, and that this simply did not mean there was to be a next tranche and that the rest would be sold off. We know that was not true. We know that was not true because 
 Senator Harradine made the same argument, Senator Alston made the same argument—`What are you making this fuss about? It's only the first tranche. This isn't the selling of the whole of Telstra; it is still in majority government ownership.'
Here we go. We are in the same parliament, the same Senate, and we are arguing now about the legislation for the sale of Telstra. Senator Harradine has said, `That does not mean it has to be sold.' We know that. But he has told the government that, if it does not proclaim this legislation straight away on getting back into government—if that is to happen—it will lose it.
So it does not really matter. According to that amendment, the government does not have to come back into this place to see whether or not the public view is still the same. It does not have to listen to anything that is said on this issue during the election. If the government happens to scrape together a mangy coalition as a result of all of this, if it happens to scrape over the line, whatever the community says during that election campaign means diddly-squat—nothing—because the bill will be proclaimed.
Senator Harradine has assured us that it will be proclaimed, because he has put a penalty in which will apply if it is not proclaimed immediately. The government will lose the legislation if it does not proclaim it immediately. No matter what else comes out in these other inquiries, no matter what comes out with the community, no matter what comes out in public polling; no matter what, there is a penalty if this government, in the event it gets over the line, does not proclaim this bill immediately.
I do not believe there is any point in our going through the detail of what is wrong with the legislation or what is right with the amendments that have been proposed. The deal has been done. To the detriment of Australia, and not just of regional and rural Australia, the deal has been signed. In the end, I guess it will be one of those issues on which members of the community will have a chance to speak, and they will do that by way of their vote during the election campaign. 
However, as the government knows, in election campaigns there are many things that the community comments on. Mandates are a false concept. This process is a sham and a disgrace to the parliament. But more than that; it is a disgrace not just to the parliament but to the people of Australia.
—I call Senator Stott Despoja.
—I am happy to defer to Senator Harradine for three minutes as requested.
—Well, the next person on the rough list that I have in the back of my head is Senator Schacht.
—Madam Temporary Chairman, don't we go from side to side? I indicated to you and you then indicated back to me that I would be the third speaker. There have been two speakers—
—You would have been, Senator Boswell, but I looked for you and you were not in the chamber at that time. I do appreciate that you are on the list.
—You said that I would be two speakers away. Now two speakers have been heard. I will defer to Senator Harradine—
—Senator Boswell, if other senators concur with that, I am happy to call you.
—Just very quickly—
—Senator Harradine, what are you standing for?
—Have you called me?
—No, I have not, Senator, I am sorry. I have called Senator Stott Despoja and I have indicated that there are four other people.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-07-11,"—Madam Temporary Chairman, I will take the call. I was willing to defer to Senator Harradine provided that the call could then come to me, but I do not think that is the wish of the chamber—
—That is between you two senators. I am happy to concur that way.
—Go, Senator Stott Despoja.
—`Go, Senator Stott Despoja,' says Senator Murray. I would like to take up Senator Murray's comments. Once again, in the time available to us, the Democrats will be addressing the amendments that we have before the chamber. Again, I remark on the inadequate time that has been allocated in this debate not only so that we can adequately and comprehensively debate whether or not we want to deal with the privatisation of Telstra, but also so that we can deal with the 50 amendments that are before us.
I believe that 41 of those amendments were to be moved by the Australian Democrats. People should know the reason why we want to move so many. In the limited time available, we have to ensure that if Telstra is going to be sold—whether you call this enabling, hypothetical or other legislation—and the numbers are certainly looking that way, then we are at least trying to develop some kind of framework and regulatory environment that is accountable, as Senator Murray has remarked in his amendments, so that we have workable legislation before us. For that reason, the Democrats will be moving amendments and not simply filibustering on this bill. But I remark again on the lack of time available to debate such an important issue.
Senator Abetz interjecting—
—I will take the injection from Senator Abetz who remarked in his earlier speech that we do not necessarily have to deal with this because it is not until the next election, et cetera. So why are we here on a Saturday afternoon giving this bill the tag of urgency which not only does not allow us time to develop debates on the rationale and detail that a bill of this nature and a bill that is this important deserves, but also does not give us time to investigate those particular amendments before us?
I will deal briefly with Senator Harradine's comments in response to my earlier remarks about the consequences of privatisation on employment and specifically unemployment. Senator Harradine, I take your point that deregulation of the telecommunications industry played a role in seeing jobs lost in that sector. Certainly, the deregulation process was launched by Kim Beazley in the former government.
But I put on the record once again that, while that deregulated environment did result in job losses, this did not preclude jobs being created. We saw jobs originally slashed from 87,000 down to 65,000 from June 1990 to June 1994. We saw those 22,000 jobs being lost, but then we saw the number of jobs rising to 76,500 by June 1996. What we then saw was job losses in the light of looming privatisation—this is in 1996. When it became clear that Telstra was going to be privatised and that profit was the key issue on the agenda, we saw the pressures and the push come from financial commentators. We saw this run directly contrary to the agenda of Frank Blount who, we have acknowledged, is not necessarily a cutter of staff. We note that the pressures of privatisation, along with the pressures outlined in the scoping study conducted by the work force that was appointed by Minister Alston and Minister Fahey, changed a management practice that Frank Blount had used for his lifetime so that, contrary to increasing staff numbers, he was looking to cut them. This was in the interests of the bottom line—profits, shareholders interests, privatisation.
We can see a direct link between privatisation and job losses specifically in rural areas. I draw the Senate's attention to a submission presented to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee on this topic from the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union. In that submission they point to not only a reduction in jobs—in particular a lot of outsourcing of work that was no longer considered either appropriate to or profitable for the telecommunications carrier—but also a direct reflection on rural areas as a consequence of privatisation. We have seen rural 
 and remote areas losing jobs and losing services.
I turn my attention in the time remaining to the amendment that was previously circulated in my name relating to Internet access, a key issue that has not been explored to the necessary degree in this debate and, guess what, we are not going to have enough time to explore it in the detail that I believe is required. The amendments, which I understand will now be moved by the government on behalf of the Democrats, will change the Telecommunications Act 1997 to exclude B-party charging of Internet service providers, or ISPs, by the carrier.
In February this year, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released statistics on household use of information technology. These statistics demonstrate that just under three million—2.9 million—households in Australia now have a computer. That is about 42 per cent of all households in this nation. They also found in February this year that 850,000 households had access to the Internet, which is 13 per cent of all households.
—Did you include mine?
—I think I am including yours, Senator Crane. We will make sure that statistic is included. Indeed, I would hope that most senators in this place have ready access to the Internet so that they can hear the concerns and read the e-mails from their constituents when they come to them directly and so that they can respond to them personally, I hope, too. An additional 470,000 householders indicated that they would be connecting to the Internet by February 1999.
In April 1998, the report entitled Electronic commerce in Australia by the Department of Industry, Science and Technology showed that 1.5 billion of the 21 billion transactions in Australia in 1997 were electronic. That has a value of—believe it or not—$16 trillion. This report also showed a dramatic increase in the number of commercial users and a significant presence of ISPs as hosts of active business websites. On the shopping front, this report also found steadily increasing on-line shopping, with 43 per cent of regular Internet users having shopped and a further 30 per cent who are willing to try. Clearly, an in 
 creasing part of our consumer interests and certainly our household life.
What was most significant was the finding that the amount of time spent on-line by dial-up users was closely related to the pricing plan of ISPs. These findings clearly show that the cost of access has a direct effect on the amount of access. However, as a hurdle to participation on-line, cost was listed third behind lack of defined need and availability. That is worth noting.
The Australian Democrats strongly believe that the Internet should be accessible and affordable for all. Access to the Internet is fundamentally important to the whole new communications environment that we are endeavouring to discuss here. For this reason, we believe that the costs of access should be limited to ensure they are not a barrier to access. We think cost goes to both access and availability. That is one of the reasons that we are moving amendments to the legislation today.
As the scope of on-line services grows, access to them will become an ever more pressing issue. The Internet already offers a means for accessing information which is vital for enabling participation in our society. For example, information on government services, policies and activities is already readily available on-line. The relevant minister has announced increasing awareness programs and, of course, created a single point of access for the Commonwealth.
There are plans for leading the delivery of government services via the Internet and increasing the levels of education on-line—things that we strongly support. The projected growth of health and educational services will also contribute to the growth of the Internet as a critical tool for students and families, and our broader community. These are all significant steps, but they all depend on availability and access and, of course, they are all very closely associated with costs.
The cost of accessing the Internet is, therefore, rapidly becoming a factor for an ever increasing number of families. In time, this is likely to become a cost that is virtually unavoidable—much like the telephone, if you like, in our society. The parliament, therefore, 
 in this debate today on our telecommunications legislation, has a duty to ensure that access to the Internet remains affordable. Putting safeguards in place now is one way of ensuring that we do not create an information underclass in the near future. We do not want a society divided into the information rich and the information poor. We must have this equity, and this is closely associated to costs. Moreover, preserving low cost access to the Internet is also an important means of entrenching the dynamic growth in the industry.
Despite the efforts of the Democrats, under the Telecommunications Act 1997 business customers will not be guaranteed ongoing provision of untimed local calls for data. This means that business users may be forced to accept timed charges for the Internet and other data calls. This decision, which rests with the telecommunications carriers, would add significantly to those costs already faced by small businesses and their consumers and add an unnecessary barrier to access to and availability of the Internet. Fortunately, residential customers, charitable bodies, welfare organisations, et cetera, are guaranteed ongoing provision of untimed local voice and data calls. This means that these customers are able to connect to an ISP in their local call zone for the purpose of accessing the Internet at the cost of an untimed local call.
Telecommunications carriers, however, are not prohibited from charging ISPs a separate timed levy for receiving calls, known as B-party charging. This opens the way for all customers, including residential customers and charitable bodies or welfare organisations, to be indirectly charged on a timed basis for accessing the Internet. The Democrats oppose this. We do not believe an imposition of this kind of charge is warranted. If ISPs are charged a timed levy for receiving a call to connect to the Internet, they will be forced to pass these additional costs on to their customers, presumably through increased fees. It could also be used by larger telecommunications companies to crush their competitors. The minister for communications has said that the government will not allow B-party charging. This is a decision the Democrats welcome. However, the government has not ruled 
 in legislation that such charges will not be allowed. So what we are looking for now is a legislative guarantee.
The purpose of the amendments before us, originally circulated and moved by the Australian Democrats, is to preserve the status quo by preventing carriers from charging the receiver of a telephone call where the receiver is the provider of an Internet service and where the call is for the purpose of connecting to the Internet. I consider this, as do my colleagues, a significant issue and worthy of commitment by government and amendment to the Telecommunications Act. We have set out figures demonstrating the rapidly expanding on-line economy and the considerable value of this area to Australia's economy and society. A significant barrier to this on-line economy is the cost of access and this amendment will go a long way towards fixing this.
I have outlined the rationale behind the amendment. I am sorry that it has to be done so speedily in this environment, when we have another 40-odd amendments being moved by the Australian Democrats, but it highlights what a farce this whole process is.
—It highlights the amount of time the Labor Party has wasted on it.
—I accept that acinterjection. Certainly, there has been filibustering on both sides. On the one hand, there has been a lot of filibustering from the opposition, which has given undue publicity to the likes of One Nation and has had a good go at the National Party—which is not something that I personally object to—and, on the other hand, from the government there has been a lack of information. And that is the problem. We have an important piece of legislation before us with a mammoth array of amendments and we have no idea what deals have been done. We cannot debate the specifics of what is before is. We cannot debate the specific impact, adverse or otherwise, of the deals that may or may not have been done in any part of Australia—regional, rural; who knows?—because we have no accountability with this legislation.
What the Democrats are aiming for is reasonable debating time on legislation and amendments, and not just in relation to this 
 piece of legislation, because we know we are moving on to two rather important copyright bills after dinner and we have been allocated two hours apiece. It is absolutely ridiculous. I do not know how this chamber can operate as a house of review, a proper house of scrutiny, without allowing adequate time for analysis of government and opposition parties amendments.
Once again, I reiterate our concern, on behalf of our party and the many members of the community who have been ringing our offices, e-mailing and faxing us today saying, `Why on earth are you here debating this legislation? Why is this being rushed through by the government when you are not even allowed to debate the amendments?' Do you know that Senator Vicki Bourne, our whip, calculated that at this rate the amendments are allowed less than 10 minutes each for debate. We have to do it in the preamble stage of the bill because there will be no other opportunities, as I understand it, available. That is a sham. That is an absolute sham and the Democrats resent it. But we will continue to try to fulfil our role as expert legislators, even if the rest of you are going to filibuster.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Boswell, Sen Ronald",NP,1998-07-11,"—Senator Stott Despoja was quite right when she referred to the Labor Party as continually attacking the National Party. We have been around for 75-odd years, and no doubt we have been under some heavy pressure in those years, but we can take it. But today, I think, the parliament sank to the lowest depths when Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner, but mostly Senator Ray, went through a list of the National Party members and attacked their integrity, ability and honesty, which had nothing to do with anything in particular other than to denigrate the National Party.
It was in complete contradiction to Standing Order 193, which should have been picked up, I add, Mr Temporary Chairman, by the chair and the person who was previously in that position. But I did not come in and claim parliamentary protection, because I think that is the coward's way. If you can see a head, you can kick it. You have been kicking plenty 
 of heads, and that is okay. I will come back at you. In the whole of this world, in the whole of this universe, there is only one country left now that has a publicly owned telecom—that is, North Korea.
—If you like Albania, go there.
—Albania, Cuba—they have all gone over. We have heard about the great icons of the National Party—the Anthonys, the McEwens and the Pages. They were great icons; they were men of their day. But they did not look over their shoulders. Their policies were the ones which pushed and brought Australia forward.
Senator Schacht interjecting—
—But you cannot lock yourself in a time warp, Senator Schacht. This party has been relevant for 75 years because it was prepared to move with the times.
Senator Schacht interjecting—
—Order! Senator Schacht!
—If there is not a message in saying that North Korea is the last country in the world that has a public telecom, if that does not give you the message, then I do not know what will. Nothing will, because you are a party that is committed to socialism, although you broke away and sold Qantas and a few other items. If you cannot get the message, if the phone is not ringing for you that Albania and Cuba have finally sold out, then you have a particular problem.
Let me assure you that the $160 we are offering in the form of a rebate plus the extension of a four-minute call to a 12-minute call gives people in the bush 2½ hours of free calls a week. So they are not doing too badly. They are getting 2½ hours a week when they can ring up their local community centre for nothing. That is on top of 25c for 12 minutes. If that is not a good deal for the bush, I do not know what is. It is a great deal for the bush. If you can not understand that, you do not understand the bush.
As for making the farcical claim that the Labor Party can stand up for the bush, you 
 will go down in the annals of history on your sell-out of the bush on native title. You have completely disconnected yourselves from every rural worker, every person who works in an abattoir, every blue collar worker, every person who works in a sugar mill or a cotton gin—you walked away from them. You said, `We don't care about you. We don't care about your jobs. You are sort of non-persons; you are non compos mentis.' You just walked away from them. So don't you ever go out into the bush and say that you represent them.
—We will be out there in the bush telling them of your sell-out.
—If you do that, you will be a laughing stock out there.
Senator Heffernan interjecting—
—Order! Senator Heffernan, you should know that it is disorderly to interject when absent from your own seat.
—We heard a complete denigration of not only members of parliament. I suppose most of us here when we get into this game can take the rough and the tumble and live with it. It gets hurtful occasionally, but you can stand up and it does not worry you. But you started moving onto party officers. People like David Russell, your president and the presidents of the state Liberal and National Party branches give their time because they believe they are doing something for Australia. They do not get paid. They get a lot of flak. They are always in trouble, but they take it on as a community interest. I have had my disagreements with David Russell on many occasions, but I do not want to see those people denigrated in this House. The most thankless job that you could ever ask anyone to do is to be the president of a political party. You are open to all sorts of flak. But to then bring up their names in here under parliamentary privilege and attack their character and ability is stretching things too far.
We could go through your previous leaders one by one and ask how they got $3 million houses. I have been in business all my life, and I ask myself: how on earth can you afford $5 million worth of real estate? How can Mr 
 Keating and Mr Hawke afford it when they have basically been on union salaries all their lives and then parliamentary salaries? But I do not do that sort of thing; I walk away from it. I discourage people that bring in those sorts of rumours because it denigrates this place. It lowers the tone of the place and it says to the people out there, `You know, you really shouldn't trust parliamentarians.' But you have made an open go of it today, and you should be condemned.
I reiterate: for a party to be relevant, it has to change. It cannot lock itself into the 1950s. When McEwen brought in protectionism, yes, it was great. We all lived well. We all had a quarter acre block and lived in beautiful three-bedroom homes with fireplaces, and that was on fairly modest wages. We cannot lock ourselves into that. That is when we had six million people and 180 million sheep. We rode on the sheep's back and the sheep underwrote the Australian economy. Those days are gone; these are different days.
Then we moved into the Anthony days. He changed with the times. He was a man relevant to the needs of that day, and he was a great leader. So was McEwen and so was Page. They were great leaders, and they took the party forward. But we cannot go back just because McEwen or Anthony or Page said that this was the way to deliver telecommunications. That might have been right—it probably was right—in those days, but we cannot lock ourselves in. We have moved forward. Telecommunications are a major requirement. It is what people in the bush want. They have a steam driven technology at the moment, and we have to get them forward.
—That is after 50 years of your representation, Ron.
—It is after 13 years of your representation of stripping the bush and sucking the equity out of their properties with 23 per cent interest rates. You deserted them in droves. You drove the bush into the ground. You should be ashamed of yourself, and if you ever go out there, Senator Schacht, please do not tell them you are an ex-country boy. They may forgive people for ignorance, but they will never forgive people who are 
 brought up in the rural communities and then rat on them.
Mr Temporary Chairman, we face a difficult decision. I am not enjoying this for one minute, but I have to make a decision. I have thought this through, and I have even prayed about it. I have to make a decision whether I take this National Party constituency forward—take it into the future—or say, `I am going to leave the technology where it is at the moment.' There will be only one chance—probably never another chance. There is a huge amount of money required to put that latest telecommunication infrastructure out there. This is going to be the only chance to do it. We are going to have to do it. We are going to have to bite the bullet. People cannot live out there without this communication.
As I said, gone are the days when you sent your cattle down to the local abattoir—or your milk into the local cooperative—and hoped for the best. Everything now is communications. Everything is sold on forward pricing. Everything is locked in. Therefore, not only do people require it but it is absolutely essential that they maintain their contact with the rest of the world. You cannot deny that.
Some of the people are saying, `Look, we have had Telstra out there, and the service cannot get any worse.' I know that. I cannot see that the service can get any worse than people being without a phone for three weeks or a month. What we have proposed in the community customer service obligation is that there will be a $40 fine. That is probably less than I would have hoped for. I argued with Senator Alston that it should be up to $100 every day, but that should come off your phone bill.
 We have now given people 2½ hours of free phone calls—increased it from 25c for four minutes to 25c for 12 minutes, and then put another $160 over the top of that, which works out, in my calculations, to about 2½ hours of free telephone calls to their local service community for a week.
—You could amend it, Ron. Move an amendment.
—Thank you, Senator Schacht. I spoke to Senator Alston, and he is prepared to lock that in under an amendment in the legislation today. I trust the Liberal Party and I trust Senator Alston, but—
—You shouldn't.
—I think we are beholden to you. You should not only trust people but you should lock those things in. Senator Alston has agreed that I can move an amendment, and I will be delighted to do it. I hope that you will second the amendment and express your concern to rural Australia too.
Let us just get back to where we are. It is so easy, it is so comfortable, to sit out on the sideline and say, `Let it all go past.' But is that really what regional and rural Australians want? Or do they want to pick up a fax that works? Do they want to connect to an Internet that will give them overseas prices? They do not want to connect only when the sun is up because it is charging and energising the batteries, and it will not work when there is a bit of overcast weather. That is taking your chance. They do not want that. What they want is something that everyone else in the rest of Australia has—a reliable telecommunications service that is affordable and can connect them to anyone they want to reach.
—Why haven't they got that now?
—After 13 years in government, you should not be asking me. After two years in government, we are trying to give it to them. You had 13 years in government where you never gave it to them, and all you ever did was suck the equity out of their properties, bankrupt them and destroy them. No wonder they gave you such a serve out in the bush. That is what they want—what everyone else in Australia has, and what everyone else in the cities expects. They just want the same. I say to them: this is your only chance—probably your last chance—to get it. If you want the National Party to get you all these things that you required in your NFF, isolated children, sugar and UGA resolutions, then this is the opportunity to get it. You may never have another opportunity.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-11,"—As indicated by some previous speakers, unless there is undue provocation on this particular preamble amendment—and we take a broad definition of that—I will be the last speaker for the Labor Party. In view of the fact that the government has gagged the debate and limited it so that many of the amendments proposed by various parties might not get debated before the government guillotines the vote later this afternoon or earlier this evening, I will take briefly an opportunity to mention a couple of the opposition amendments.
First of all, we make it clear that, no matter what amendments are moved to this bill, the bill deserves to be defeated outright on the third reading and should not go through this parliament by the time it finishes sitting today. We make that very clear. No amendment, no matter how good its purpose, will overcome the major deficiency of this bill, which is to privatise Telstra and to do it in a way that means the Prime Minister—if he can scrape back into office at the next election—can privatise Telstra after the next election with no reference back to the parliament after the people have voted. That is what the Prime Minister is up to. No matter how good these amendments are, they will not overcome the evil of this bill.
I want to reiterate that, in the first week of the election of the Beazley Labor government and the first week of the sitting of that new Beazley Labor government in this place, we will repeal this legislation to make it clear that Telstra will not be further privatised by any government, particularly a Labor government. I also want to point out what the two amendments we put forward in the debate relate to, although I suspect the government will oppose them.
Firstly, even with a fully privatised Telstra, we believe the power of the minister to direct the board in the national interest must be maintained. Why? Because, for the foreseeable future, Telstra will provide 85 to 90 per cent of the telephone connections in this country for 10 million Australian households. In the bush areas of Australia, it will provide 100 per cent of those. When it is providing 
 that essential service we believe, from time to time, the minister should have and use the power in the national interest. So we will move an amendment to have that power maintained even if, unfortunately, Telstra is fully privatised.
Our second amendment, because of the near monopoly of Telstra, is to maintain parliamentary scrutiny of this organisation. In the last 12 months the minister, Senator Alston, has written on behalf of Telstra to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Committee, which oversees Telstra, asking that they be excused from attending a number of the hearings of the committee where questions can be asked by senators from any political party about the operation of Telstra. I have to say the response was unanimous; even Liberal senators did not want to give up the right to ask questions of Telstra. So we told Telstra and the minister to go jump. All members of that committee—Labor, Liberal, Democrat and National Party—said no. Telstra must turn up at parliament, face the music and answer the questions about what they are doing in Australia because of this near monopoly position.
Telstra and its Chief Executive, Mr Frank Blount, are saying, `Of course, when we are fully privatised, we only have one group of people we are responsible to, and that is our 1½ million shareholders'—not to the 18 million Australian citizens who all rely on Telstra for some form of telecommunications. He does not want public or parliamentary scrutiny because some of the questions that may be asked, even by Senator Boswell from the National Party, may be embarrassing to the performance of Telstra. We believe that those are very important amendments.
I also want to turn to a couple of things that Senator Harradine has raised. He said that the job losses in Telstra would have occurred irrespective of the privatisation process, because of technological change, et cetera. By the end of this year, 27,000 jobs will have gone from Telstra over the last two years. It is the biggest single downsizing in corporate history in Australia—27,000 jobs. No other company or public service has sacked as 
 many workers as Telstra has in the last two years.
Some of those jobs, I concede, may have gone because of technological change. But the real reason is that this has been driven by the senior management who say, `We want to prove to the financial analysts both in Australia and overseas that, on the measures that show we are a profitable and efficient company, we have the employee ratio per connected telephone line down to the same level as it is in America.' That is the reason why it has taken place. It is so that, when they get down to about 50,000 people rather than 75,000 people, they will be able to say, `We have the same number of employees per telephone line connected as they do in the United States.'
What they fail to mention is that, in continental Australia, which is the same size as continental America, we have 18 million people whereas they have 268 million people. That is the fundamental difference. That is why you cannot compare Telstra and its operation in Australia with an operation in an American market or a western European market or a Japanese market. Japan has 130 million people in an area a little larger than the size of Victoria. That is why we argue that Telstra is an essential service to all Australians in our vast continent and, in particular, why people outside the major cities have to be treated equally.
Senator Harradine, that is the reason why the jobs have gone. It is because the management of Telstra want to be able to get a pat on the back from the international analysts, the stockbrokers and the share owners for having the number of employees, on average, down to the same level as an American telecommunications company. We do not think that is going to deliver the service to the bush. That is why, in the last 12 months, there has been on average a 15 per cent decline in the bush in fixing telephones, in connecting telephones and in fixing pay telephones when they break down. It has declined in the first full year of privatisation. You cannot tell the Australian people that full privatisation of the service is going to make it better, because it will not. They will contin 
 ually sack and reduce staff to make the place look more profitable and to improve the bottom line.
Mr Blount has been honest about this. He says already that they are only concerned about the bottom line and the profit. If that means 27,000 workers lose their jobs, so be it. If that means people in the bush take longer to get a telephone connected, so be it. He is only driven by one thing, and that is the profit. No matter what legislation we try to fix on the side here, it will not work.
In the end, the only way you and the community can guarantee getting Telstra to do things in the national interest is through this parliament and through the minister—in this case a weak minister who does not have the guts to tell Telstra anything. That is why Frank Blount today, in the paper, is quoted as saying:
'You know, this Government has not even said boo to me.'
What a damning indictment! Yesterday this same minister was in here saying that he was hairy-chested because he told Telstra what to do. He said that they did not like him because he argued with them. Well, Frank Blount has killed him today. He has knocked him right over and said, `He doesn't even say boo to me.' What a weak, spineless minister, when this organisation has to provide communications to all Australians no matter where they live.
Senator Boswell has been in here complaining that we have been unfair on him and the National Party in claiming that they have sold out the bush on the deal. He is not the only one. Senator Harradine and Senator Colston have done it, as my other colleagues have said. It was astonishing last night to see Senator Colston come into this place. He had apparently been away to Brisbane to meet the Prime Minister. He came in here through the back door and slowly walked around and got to his seat. He was there for a few seconds and then went out that door. He was in the place for about two minutes. Why did he do that trick? He wanted to claim the $145 per night TA to come back to Canberra. That is the reason; there can be no other.
Senator Colston did not speak, and I do not believe he voted. He went to Brisbane to see the Prime Minister. No wonder politicians get a poor reputation when that sort of attitude exists. Senator Colston voted for the parliament to sit all day yesterday—he voted for us to sit here—but he was not here himself because he went to see the Prime Minister. He then came back just in time to claim the TA.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. I believe that what Senator Schacht is saying is a reflection upon a senator. It is well known around this place that Senator Colston is quite ill. He went to Brisbane yesterday for a longstanding appointment with his medical adviser. It was quite a serious one.
—What—the Prime Minister?
—I do not know personally about that, but I did read in the press that he also saw the Prime Minister. That is an unfair reflection upon an honourable senator.
—On the point of order: I believe that the comments Senator Schacht made are unparliamentary. I am not aware of any requirement that you have to walk into the chamber to be eligible for the travel allowance, in any case. It would be appropriate if Senator Schacht withdrew.
—You get paid, so even more money is at stake. If it is a reflection, I withdraw, of course.
I now turn to Senator Boswell's remarks. Senator Boswell has come in here three times today defending the National Party deal. Each time he has come in, he has become weaker and weaker and more embarrassed and self-humiliated. I cannot recollect any other National Party senator—I may be wrong—all during today jumping up and speaking. They may have been gagged or they may be too embarrassed to speak et cetera. Senator Boswell then claimed great credit for an amendment circulated in his name. He said, `Senator Schacht, yesterday you said that we did not lock up the new arrangements for 
 lower call charges in the outback areas in extended zones et cetera.' He said, `As a result of what you have raised, I saw Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications, and he has agreed to an amendment, which has been circulated.'
That is the whole point. Yesterday we examined the deal over the new call charge rates for outlying areas in the outback. If I could point out that there was a fundamental flaw in the deal and Senator Boswell could not point out the weakness in his own deal in the previous three weeks of negotiations with the Prime Minister, for goodness sake, what else have they given away in the deal they have not yet announced? This is extraordinary.
The amendment on this piece of white paper is the final death notice of the National Party. It shows that they cannot negotiate. They have to rely on us in opposition reading the bill in a matter of a few seconds to point out the error, the gap, the obvious. Senator Boswell was listening to me, and I could see him starting to frown. He got up, went around and spoke to Senator Alston with a worried look on his face. He clearly knew that we had hit pay dirt and that he had not locked up the deal. Now they are scrambling to get the deal locked up and to make an amendment on that part of the deal.
I again point out to Senator Boswell that the only thing he has so far announced is $150 million expenditure over the next two or three years for capital works in the bush. Telstra spends $800 million each year every year on capital works in the bush, and even with all that there is a deficiency. So $150 million extra over the next two or three years will not make much difference.
To get $150 million, Senator Boswell has put his hand up to sell a company worth $40 billion that is paying a dividend of $1.5 to $2 billion per year every year to all Australians by way of revenue. What an extraordinary deal. I hope his accountant can do his taxes better than this. How could you sell a company worth $40 billion that already provides up to nearly $2 billion in dividends to get in return a one-off $150 million payment in three or four years? That deal could have 
 been fixed by changing the community service obligation to provide a charge on all the carriers.
Telstra laughed, took the money and said, `Thank you very much.' That is our complaint. If that is the negotiating ability of the National Party, no wonder it is being chopped apart out in the bush. That is why we have said that today is the day in which the National Party died across Australia. The one thing the bush wants is to keep Telstra in public ownership to provide the ongoing delivery of goods to them.
—Your socialist principles never let you understand.
—Senator O'Chee is the man who said that if One Nation won one seat in the Queensland election he would walk backwards from Brisbane to the Gold Coast. He now has to walk backwards 11 times to the Gold Coast.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order on relevance. I cannot see how what Senator Schacht has been saying for the last minute or so has any relevance to the discussion before us. Could you ask him to come back to what we are dealing with.
—Senator Schacht was responding to an interjection. It might be helpful if honourable senators remembered that interjections are disorderly and allowed the debate to proceed.
—And I was responding to the remarks of Senator Boswell in his recent contribution and pointing out why we make it clear that this is the day that the National Party died. The good old boys of the old Country Party handed themselves away. Unfortunately, as Senator Faulkner said, their seats will go to a party more odious than their own, which is the One Nation party. In a number of instances the seats will go to the Labor Party, because at this coming election we will be the only party campaigning in the bush as a national party aiming to win seats in the House of Representatives to stop the privatisation of Telstra. That will be a defining issue. When we see the National Party decline into irrelevance in Australia, it is all 
 their own work, and they deserve to be condemned for it.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-07-11,"—I will be very brief. We are still on the preamble after 27 hours. There have been a few people address the actual clauses in the bill but, significantly, those people have not been from the opposition. I feel that it has just been a gerrymander.
—We know about gerrymanders. We got 4,000,000 votes and you got 30,000.
—I mean a filibuster. Senator Carr knows the gerrymander.
—You voted for the gag and the guillotine. Don't tell us about filibusters.
—Quite so, and I rarely do that. I did it on this occasion because it was a shameful filibuster. Something needed to be done about it.
I want to refer to a couple of things. First of all, I remind the chamber that I am voting against the preamble. I do not know what all the argument is about. Secondly, Senator Margetts seemed to indicate a concern about an amendment of mine which would ensure that this legislation will not remain on the books unless it is activated within a period of a couple of months after the next election. The whole point about this piece of legislation, as I understand it, is that it is enabling legislation. It is not actually selling either a tranche of or the whole of Telstra. It is enabling legislation, which the government has given an undertaking will not be proclaimed until after the next election.
—Do you mean they are not going to flog it off?
—You say that you will be in office, so there will be no problem. Or will there? That is one reason that I have moved that, unless it is proclaimed within two months of the first sitting of the new parliament, it goes off the books; it is repealed. Senator Margetts expressed a bit of concern about that. I was doing that specifically because as a legislator I do not agree with unproclaimed legislation just laying on the books ready for the opportune time to lift it 
 out and to proclaim it. I do not think that is good legislation. The Clerk Assistant (Procedure), Rosemary Laing, had pointed this out to Senator Lees and other honourable senators. That is all that means. There is nothing hidden in it. It is only an attempt to put a brake on the executive.
I want to again make a point about Senator Stott Despoja's arguments about the reason for the loss of jobs in Telstra. I mentioned this before. In response, Senator Stott Despoja indicates that the source of her information was the submission by the CEPU to the committee. Even the CEPU would not say that they were disinterested observers. My material was obtained from a disinterested, very senior officer of the Parliamentary Library.
—You are voting for something that could allow a minority government to have passed into law something that will not be representative of the people's vote.
—You do not want to hear the truth, do you. Senator Stott Despoja has not taken into account the easing down of the cable roll-out. But that is a relatively minor point. I repeat, for everybody to hear, what this disinterested expert, a senior officer with the Parliamentary Library, has said.
—This is repetitious. You have already told us this.
—It is repetition, but I am responding to Senator Stott Despoja. There are people who have not heard this. The summary of all of the material is that telecommunications as a whole is a very high growth industry. It reads:
While its services are very capital intensive, the companies involved, particularly Telstra, are significant employers. As the industry becomes more capital intensive through the elimination of manual exchanges and reduced dependence on traditional copper wire infrastructure, it is to be expected that employment growth will ease and/or actually decline. There has been easing off in Telstra's employment growth since 1996 in response to deregulation to the extent that Telstra has lost market share in the long distance markets. It is too early to say what impact privatisation has had on Telstra employment, but the predominant influences on Telstra employment have been the 
 impact of deregulation and the labour shedding effects of technological change.
As I indicated before, deregulation was, rightly or wrongly, a policy of the Labor Party and of the current government. I want to advert again to a point I made previously, which is a point that was also made by Senator Stott Despoja and by the CEPU, and that is the effect that the workplace relations legislation is having on employment. Who voted against that anti-worker legislation? I did.
—We've heard this.
—Who voted for it? I do not think they would have done it now—the Democrats. Under whose leadership? It was Cheryl Kernot's. That anti-worker legislation went on the books because of her, and she was rewarded with being a candidate for the Labor Party. Well, there you go.
 I have a couple of things to say. Senator Murray has appealed to us to do something about political donations—that Telstra should be banned from making political donations. I agree with that and I will be supporting that amendment, as it is tidied up. I think that is only reasonable for the next five years.
 There is another amendment that I would like to support, and that is in respect of members on the board. However, part of the amendment says that the member should live 300 kilometres from the capital city. In my state of Tasmania, that would rather limit the number of candidates.
—You'd be well out to sea.
—It would actually go to the Nut, beyond Stanley. I just raise that point.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1998-07-11,"—I would like to make some comments on this legislation before us and on the behaviour that we have seen here for the last 27 hours. We are still on the preamble and have not yet got to the substance of debating the amendments before us. It is not often that I will stand up in this place and promote the position of the Democrats but, in this particular case, this filibuster has been all about stopping those Democrat amendments being put on the table and finding out where you 
 people stand on them. You do not want to declare yourselves. Why you have not declared yourselves is absolutely beyond me. You have had plenty of opportunity.
I want to deal with some of your policies in terms of this, but my next point is that you people do not understand. I say this as a person who comes from a remote area. Not so long ago I had to pay $8,000 to get a telephone line to my place, and I know that the technology we will need out in the bush will come from the skies. Unless Telstra gets the capital base to finance that, it will be forced out of the competition stakes, and you people have to realise that. The people out in the bush put a lot of capital into what they do, and they realise that Telstra needs a capital base and they need satellites circling around to send us down the signals for digital faxes and all the  other things that are required if they are going to get the same technology as you get in the city. They need technology that will not be interfered with by electric fences. How many people on the other side of the chamber have heard of an electric fence? Not very many of you. How many of you know the devastation they cause when you put in telecommunications equipment? You would not have a clue. You do not understand the situation.
I am going to try to explain a couple of things, to people listening here and to people in the gallery, as to why telecommunications has to be advanced, and I speak, as I have already said, as someone who comes from a rural area. The particular thing that I want to address is the unbelievably silly decision to phase out analog that was made a couple of years ago by the previous Labor government. You should listen to a little bit about the phasing out of analog and their performance. Mr Beazley, the current leader, was minister for communications and he never had a clue. We were told it was state-of-the-art technology.
—You voted for it.
—I got it wrong the same as you did.
—Senator Crane, I ask you to direct your remarks to the chair. I know there 
 are a lot of disorderly interjections coming from the other side, but please address your remarks to the chair.
—Thank you. I was provoked and I apologise, Mr Temporary Chairman. I shall not get it wrong. Just calm him down a little. When he is a bit excited that is how he behaves. I want to tell a story about what Mr Beazley did to us—
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. We are debating a bill, not having Grimm's Fairy Tales  related to us by Senator Crane. I would ask him to stick to the bill.

—Mr Temporary Chairman, on the point of order, yesterday we were regaled by Senator Murphy, at half past 11 at night, with a full 15 minutes about some retailer in Launceston who had a few problems with his phone.
—This is a story.
—This was a story, and it went on and on. At no stage did it have anything to do with privatisation. After we had allowed him to trot it all out and put it on the record, and after others had spoken, he got up for another 10 minutes to say how important it was and how much he wanted it answered by me. We spent half an hour on a story tale last night. I would have thought if Senator Crane has something to say that is relevant to the preamble—
—You are debating the point of order. There is no point of order. There has been wide ranging debate from both sides and there have been a lot of stories told from both sides. In this particular case, I would like to hear what Senator Crane has to say.
—This relates to why this bill must go through and why those of us who live in regional, remote and isolated Australia should have the opportunity to access the same services and the same conditions—or I should say similar conditions; we will never get the same—as our city cousins, no more, no less. This is about what happened with the analog system and the change to digital, which is part of this, and why we must not make the same mistakes again. One of the 
 things those of us who live in remote and isolated Australia need most of all is our little dish alongside our homestead or home so we can get that message from the skies to do all those things that can be done in the cities. That is why this must happen.
—You don't have to privatise Telstra to do that.
—Order! Senator Schacht, you are continuously interjecting. You were last night. You are today. Will you just give him a go, please?
—Thank you. Ever since I have been in this place, Senator Schacht has been one of those people who enjoys shouting. It seems to be something he practises and he comes into this chamber to do it. I am not sure why, but that is the way he is. He will not be here for much longer, thank goodness.
Let me go back to what I was talking about. I well remember the day when we got the analog service. For the interest of those people here and for those people listening, we live 100 miles, in round figures, out of Esperance. We got our first mobile car phone and, for 50 miles from Esperance or the airport, you could press the button and talk. The call would go through. You could talk to your family. You could talk to the local business. You could ring up your office in Perth. You could do whatever you liked.
Then along came this great deal! This is why we have to have progress and overcome these problems. This is what the CDMA, announced by us on Thursday, is all about; it will address those problems. So along came this deal. They said, `Kick out analog. You'll all be better off with digital. It'll be the answer to your prayers.' It will be absolutely wonderful stuff! You got into your car at Esperance, pressed the button and away it went beautifully. But, all of a sudden, when you came to the top of a hill and started driving down, you could not hear anymore. You would be talking away and all of a sudden your phone would go, `Brp, brp, brp,' and you would not hear anymore. So you would drive down the hill and come up again, pressing the button all the time and, bingo, on it comes again. I remember one particular time when my son was talking to me—
—Winston, what's this got to do with the privatisation of Telstra?
—This is why we have to get this right and why the Labor Party got it so wrong. I got three-quarters of the way up the next hill, and I said, `Hold on, Paul. I've been out of range. I'm only a couple of miles from the Esperance airport, but I've been out of range for the last couple of kilometres. Will you start again?' And he said, `What was the last thing you heard?' This is the type of system that the Labor Party gave us, and now they are trying to prevent progress by preventing those people who live out in the areas that I talk about—and I include myself in that—from getting the same access. This is an unbelievable performance. It is a performance of a party which has no appreciation and no understanding of the problems and the difficulties of second-class communication.
—Rubbish.
—They have no concept whatsoever. The further you go away from the city centres, the worse it gets and the more difficult it becomes—hence our response yesterday in terms of pastoral calls to fix one of the greatest social injustices that this country has ever had in its history since Federation. At long last, that is being addressed and there are other things that will be addressed.
We need Telstra to have a capital base to carry out a modern, proper system and, once again, that is coming out of the skies, because that is where it will come from. A lot of us never had TV until it came out of the skies into a little dish that was put there and paid for by ourselves. We will not get these other facilities until that happens. Unless Telstra is privatised, unless it gets its capital base, it will fall behind. It will become irrelevant. All the other companies circling the world will take over.
I heard somebody over the other side, I am not sure who, earlier say, `Rubbish.' That proves more than ever that they know nothing about what they are talking about. They need to get out there and try it some time. They need to get out on one of the old pedallers and get their legs going so they can talk to their next-door neighbour. They have never 
 experienced that; they do not know what it is like. They do not know what it is like to actually have to drive 50 miles to get to a phone to ring up their doctor. They have never experienced that. I doubt whether one of those on the other side has ever had to walk outside their house to ring their doctor. I doubt that very much.
—Well, you are wrong there.
—Maybe I am wrong, but there would be very few, and you would not know.
—And everyone on your side does?
—Yes.
—Do these multimillionaire aristocrats like McGauran have to do that? What a load of rubbish.
—You mean millionaires like Paul Keating.
—That is not rubbish; that is a fact of life.
—Order! There are too many interjections from both sides of the chamber. Will you please control yourselves? I call Senator Crane.
—I am going to conclude my comments in this debate by telling the chamber what some of the people in Esperance, my major home town, have said about the changes by the Labor government to wipe out the analog system and go over to digital. They said to me straight out—and senators want to note this—that the Labor Party's idea of progress was to reduce a service that gave you 50-miles coverage from Esperance back to 12-miles coverage from Esperance. They reduced a service that you could use up hill and down dale for that distance without any problems at all to one which cut out when you drove down the valley. Then it started until you got towards the top of the hill and, by the time you had gone over the top, it had cut out. Do you know what they said to me? They said, `If that's the Labor Party's idea of going forward, we think it's walking backwards very fast. In fact, we think it's drowning.' That is what they said to me.
The filibuster that has gone on in this place for the last 27 hours has been aimed at nothing more than preventing proper debate on this legislation and preventing the amendments that are before the chamber at this time from being dealt with. The performance of the Labor Party would have to be the worst that I have ever seen in this place in the eight years I have been here. I think it is a pitiful disgrace and the Labor Party ought to be ashamed of themselves for what they have done and how they have pulled this place down. I hope the bit that I have contributed makes the Australian public realise how the Labor Party are deceiving them.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,1998-07-11,"—I too would like to join Senator Crane in making a few remarks this afternoon about the impact of the sale of Telstra on regional and remote areas. Unlike the people on the other side of the chamber—who have rabbited on all day about regional and remote Australia but who generally come from electorates deep in the heart of metropolitan cities and would not know anything about remote and regional Australia—I do know something about remote and regional Australia because I come from the north-west of Western Australia, which is not only regional but also remote and the distances are very, very big.
I know what people in these areas think about the proposed sale of Telstra, and I can say here to the chamber and to the people of Australia listening on the broadcast that people in remote areas support the sale of Telstra because they know that the sale of Telstra is going to bring better and improved telecommunications services and it is going to bring them the benefits of competition. People in regional and remote areas feel that they have been let down, particularly by the previous government in terms of the technology provided to them for telecommunications. This government is certainly going a long way towards improving the level of services provided to remote areas.
A few weeks ago, I attended the Kalgoorlie central conference of the Liberal Party in Exmouth, where there was a very long debate about the need for improved telecommunica 
 tions services in the regions of Australia. People in regional Australia want access to fax. They want to join the modern world and have fast fax. They want to be able to access the Internet and all that has to offer. There is no doubt that this sale of Telstra is going to bring them those sorts of services through improved communications. It was the Labor Party which proposed to leave them back in the Dark Ages, a little better than the days of pedal wireless, because none of those services are there at the moment and all of those deficiencies can be sheeted back to the record of the Keating government.
One of the questions that has been constantly asked today by those on the other side is, `Why sell Telstra?' The answer to that is that we no longer have governments around the world owning telecommunications companies. As Senator Boswell quite clearly pointed out for the information of the Labor Party senators here today, the only country in the world which owns its national telecommunications service today is North Korea. North Korea would have to be one of the most backward and least developed of all the Third World countries of the world. From the amount of fuss that has been made on the other side today about the proposal to sell Telstra, it would seem logical to conclude that the ALP would like to keep Australia back to the standard of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with their probable pedal wireless level technology.
—Even Fidel Castro has got one.
—Even Fidel Castro, as Senator Abetz said, has got a privatised telecommunications company. What does privatisation of telecommunications bring? It brings competition. Competition brings better and cheaper services, and the people of the metropolitan areas of Australia are already benefiting from the large number of private competitive companies now operating in the telecommunications market, whereas the poor old people of regional Australia have no such competition.
—They have a private monopoly under you.
—They have a private monopoly which, in its partially privatised state, has not been doing as well as it should, but full competition will bring benefits to the people of regional Australia. It is said that the privatised Telstra will not provide good services to people in regional areas, but the level of service provided in regional Australia, as it is throughout Australia, will be protected by legislation through the government provided customer service guarantee.
—Joke.
—Senator Cook says that is a joke, but let us just listen to what that joke actually involves. This joke—the customer service guarantee—means that every person in Australia using a telephone from Telstra or any other telecommunications company will be protected by a customer service guarantee which will ensure that the level of services provided to all Australians will not be affected by any further increase in private ownership of Telstra or by the fact that any other communications service is privately owned. The government is, in other words, setting a level of service as a minimum which must be provided to people all over this country. If the level of service provided does fall below the legislated standard in any area, including the most remote areas of the Kimberley, since Senator Schacht has referred to them, customers will be eligible for compensation from the telecommunications carrier. The coalition government recently introduced legislation into the federal parliament which is aimed to strengthen that customer service guarantee.
This means that the Australian Communications Authority will be able to enforce customer service performance standards and fine companies up to $10 million for breaches of those standards. There are not going to be, I would suspect, too many breaches when a few $10 million fines are thrown around. One could almost predict with 100 per cent certainty that, after the first $10 million fine or anything like it is imposed on a telecommunications company, the companies concerned will honour the customer service guarantee. The fines are so heavy, the penalties are so 
 great and the bad publicity which will flow from having such a fine imposed on them will be so bad for the company's business that they will ensure that in future the customer service guarantees are met.
Some people have asked today what the benefits of the privatisation of Telstra will be. The first was mentioned the other day when Mr Tim Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister, announced that there would be untimed local calls in what used to be called the pastoral zone, which meant that areas in remote Australia between stations and small towns would no longer have to pay for timed calls to call each other, but would enjoy the same benefits enjoyed by people in the cities. Even though the areas between these stations and small communities are very large, they would have untimed local calls as people do in the cities. That is a major benefit and it is the first one of several which will be announced in coming days and weeks about the benefits to regional Australia of the sale of Telstra.
Also announced was that the cost of a call from these remote communities to a regional service centre would be reduced by more than 60 per cent. That means that calls to remote towns from pastoral stations, roadhouses, mining camps and such will be now at a new preferential or standard rate of 25c for 12 minutes. That means that these people will now be able to call in a doctor, contact the police or some other essential service, or just order groceries from a supermarket at a very low rate. That affects some 37,000 households and farming families all over Australia, a major benefit—and that will only happen with the sale of Telstra. It is one of the first benefits which will flow from the sale of Telstra and will mean that the government will allocate $150 million to enable this service to occur.
Senator Crane has referred to the absolutely disgusting event which occurred a few years ago when the Keating government decided to phase out analog phones, which was an enormous disadvantage to the people of regional Australia. Again this week, the federal government has announced a plan to get around the legally binding agreement which the Keating government made with 
 total disregard to the interests of people in regional Australia to phase out analog and just have digital services in this country. The federal government will sponsor through Telstra the establishment of a new mobile phone service altogether, which will mean that people in remote, regional and country Australia in general will have the benefit of being able to continue to use analog phone services with their broader coverage.
Finally, the general benefit of the sale of Telstra will be that the government of Australia will be able to reduce the debt of this nation by some 40 per cent. After 13 years of a federal Labor government, Australians were left with the legacy of a Commonwealth government debt of some $96 billion. That is a measure of the total financial irresponsibility which the previous Labor government exercised while they held the reins of power in this country. The most compelling reason for the sale of Telstra is to reduce that debt, which will be of enormous benefit to the people of Australia. One does not need to hear any more or any other reason beyond that to justify the full sale of Telstra in the national interests of this country.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-07-11,"—Earlier when I was sitting here I sent a pleading note to the chair. I must confess to the Senate that what I was pleading for—without any expectation of achievement—was for the dinner break to be moved from 6.30 to 7.30 p.m. to 7.30 to 8.30 p.m., because at 7.30 the Bledisloe Cup begins. Having spent 18 years in the front row, I have an attachment to the game and I will regret being down here for this debate.
—Don't bother, Andrew. We can do without you. You watch the cup.
—I am reminded of the words of that marvellous Australian comedian, Andrew Denton, who is a very funny man. He made the following remark about New Zealand, `I don't care. I don't care, as long as we beat New Zealand.' I feel the same way, but I would care more if I could watch it.
As senators will remember, we are dealing with the preamble. There are still 40 other Democrat amendments to deal with. In the 
 preamble there is a particular statement that I wanted to relate my remarks to. It says:
Telstra's Chair, and the majority of Telstra's directors, will be Australian citizens.
When a company moves out of public hands into private hands, effectively control goes into the hands of its senior management and its board. As we have remarked several times in this debate, and as other senators who are contributing to the debate have remarked, this is going to be a very powerful corporate beast, twice the size of the next largest Australian company. In that sense, you have to be particularly careful about the powers and ability of that board to deal with matters of its corporate responsibilities appropriately.
In relation to that element in the preamble, I will be moving circulated amendment 1105, which refers to the issues of corporate governance, and which envisages a corporate governance board. As senators would know, this is not a new idea. Some companies in Australia do have such boards, although senators would be aware that the Corporations Law itself does not refer to boards; it just refers to directors. The concept of a corporate governance board is between a body that conducts the normal operational and managerial functions of a main board and another board which deals with accountability issues.
This may seem a somewhat dry topic, but when we are talking about how a company of that size will be managed and how it is going to disburse its power and moneys, we have to realise that we have to be sure that the directors are governed by the company constitution under the most accountable and democratic system possible.
Company directors have extensive powers regarding the management of a company's business and internal organisation. Some of those internal management powers which may be termed corporate governance powers include the following. Envisage the average board as having a majority of executive directors and a minority of non-executive directors. This is what those people with a material interest in the matters at hand can determine. This is what the Telstra board members can determine. They can decide their own remuneration. So those members of 
 the managerial class and directors class sit around that board and decide how much they are going to be paid. I bet some workers would like to have that same ability. They can appoint and remunerate auditors and other experts. But the auditors are the people who are supposed to be making sure they are accountable. So they can appoint the people who are supposed to be their own watchdogs. What happens if the auditors fail? So there is a direct conflict of interest there.
Those directors can adopt any accounting practices they see fit within accepted accounting standards. Those directors can nominate themselves for re-election. It is like us all being able to fix up our own pre-selections. I think there may be one or two who can, but most of us cannot. They can appoint casual vacancies for directors, so they can perpetuate themselves. They can initiate changes in the corporate constitution. They can control the conduct of shareholders' meetings and voting procedures.
In instances where the interests of the shareholders do not coincide with the interests of the directors and the management of the company, the directors of the main board, having those powers, can make decisions which may lead to some very serious conflicts of interest.
Directors also possess the power to manage conflicts of interest with related parties. Shann Turnbull, who is somewhat of an expert in this area, in the Australian Financial Review on 14 November 1996, in an article entitled `Dictatorship of the boardroom', stated:
Many of our largest companies have directors who represent shareholders with related party trading interests. Examples are Arnotts, Cadbury Schweppes, Caltex, Coca-Cola Amatil, Coles-Myer and Qantas to name a few.
Existing practices concentrate powers with directors and provide them with absolute power to manage their own conflicts of self-interest and it can result in corruption and corruption of their duties.
I am not suggesting that the Telstra board as it is presently constituted is of that kind, but I am saying it is going to be given extraordinary powers. The fact that the members are Australian citizens is going to be a great 
 advantage, but the fact that this board is not constrained sufficiently is to the detriment of the proposed new operation.
A sure way to increase the independence and accountability of a company is therefore to have two boards, one concerned with managerial and operational issues—which is the main board—and one solely concerned with governance issues. The former should quite properly continue to have directors elected relative to shareholdings. That means those people with a financial weight have it reflected on the main board, but to protect minorities, minimise conflict of interest issues, avoid board capture and ensure accountability the corporate governance board should be elected by shareholders—in other words, by the shareholders en masse as opposed to those who have the most shares.
I am talking here of two classes of board, one having the main power and comprising the directors who are elected relative to shareholdings—so there might be a few very large shareholders controlling the board, as they do at present—and the other being the governance board, the accountability board, elected by shareholders. We believe that that creation, which has been developed in other countries and is already in practice in a number of companies in this country and worldwide, will result in a favourable creative tension within the company and will enable the boards to resolve very difficult issues of conflict of interest.
In listed companies such as Telstra, a separate board should exercise these internal governance powers, leaving the main board directors to concentrate on the management of the company's business operations while the second board would provide the valuable introduction of a system of checks and balances into corporate governance procedures—a separation of powers, in other words. This proposal has the added virtue of introducing a greater measure of self-regulation. The Australian Democrats believe this is a much less costly method of arriving at a remedy for conflict of interest or any issue of malfeasance.
The proposal we are putting here is a proactive one designed to prevent problems. 
 There are those who argue that the stock market is the proper arbiter of these things, but the stock market acts after the event and if things are going wrong in the company it means the shares will decline in value and the shareholders are therefore punished because there is not an appropriate constitutional mechanism to prevent these matters.
Independent directors, as presently constituted, are often anything but. If not recommended in the first place by the other directors in the control group that they are supposed to be independent of, they can be subject to board capture anyway unless, as is fortunately sometimes the case, they are exceptional individuals.
The corporate governance board proposal will both simplify and reduce the role, responsibilities and workload of Telstra's main board directors as well as increase their credibility by removing the powers which permit the perception or actuality of a conflict of interest. This should thereby improve the accountability of directors and the internal governance of companies and lead to better business management decisions by directors. Ultimately, this re-establishes the balance of company governance in favour of shareholders rather than management.
When we look at that preamble and those sections on page 2 we should refer to the powers and functions of Telstra's corporate governance board that I have itemised at 7D on my sheet 1105. The functions of the corporate governance board would be: to determine the remuneration of company directors; to appoint auditors and determine their remuneration; to review the appointment, remuneration and functions of independent agents, such as valuers, who provide material information to shareholders; to appoint persons to fill casual vacancies of directors; to determine whether amendments should be made to the company's constitution, whether at the request of the company's directors or on the board's own initiative; to decide issues of conflict of interest on the part of the company's directors and determine how those conflicts will be managed; and to control the conduct of general meetings and determine voting procedures. That list of functions 
 would deal with the major accountability issues which main boards at present find conflict with their own duties in the management and organisation of the company.
It is essential in our view that the separate governance board be elected on the democratic basis of one vote per shareholder than one vote per share. We have gone on in that amendment, which we hoped we will get to when this preamble is finally dealt with, to express how the preferential election of directors and the annual election of directors can enhance the power of shareholders. My great fear, as reflected in this preamble—and I doubt it is from a lack of willingness; I suspect it is from a lack of foresight and a lack of understanding—is that the government is going to end up giving too much power to a few individuals who will then distort the operation of this company and it will not work even as a company owned by shareholders in the full interest of all Australians.
I should point out that the Australian Democrats wish to also indicate with regard to the preamble that there are a number of areas which we have hoped that our amendments would deal with if this committee gets to them. Those amendments include maintaining the ministerial power to direct Telstra and to request reports. In terms of what I have been saying, it is important that there is an outside authority capable of doing that. We also wish to include in Telstra's universal service obligations low cost access of untimed calls to the Internet. Senator Stott Despoja spoke about that earlier.
We wish to strengthen the universal service obligations on Telstra's definition of standard telephone service to include high speed digital services. We wish to increase the powers of the Australian Telecommunications Authority to review and upgrade the universal service obligations and customer service guarantee to include new telecommunications services as they come online. We wish to extend the option of untimed local calls to a wider category of metropolitan and rural customers than that which is presently offered by the government. We wish to provide for civil damages as well as pecuniary penalties 
 against Telstra for breaches of performance standards.
The Australian Democrats have accepted that the numbers are against them on this bill. We have been utterly opposed to the privatisation of assets in this country over many years—two decades, in fact—and we continue to be opposed to the privatisation of Telstra. But if the numbers are against us, this committee should endeavour through amendments to at least make the new Telstra capable of serving Australia as well as possible. It is in that regard that we would like the committee to please give due attention to our amendments. They are the bulk of the amendments before you. It is obviously your privilege and ability to either agree or disagree with them, but they certainly should be heard.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-07-11,"—I want to deal with the matters that Senator Murray has raised in this debate on the preamble. It is probably one of the longest preamble debates in the history of the free world. Senator Murray and the Democrats have approached this debate in a constructive way. It is clear that senators from the Labor Party have decided that they do not want to go into any of the detail on the substantive issues of the bill and have decided, in a petulant and almost tantrum like way, to spend the day jumping up and down—
—Abusing the National Party.
—Abusing the National Party, as Senator Boswell says. Senator Murray, these matters that you have raised in your latest intervention in the debate are matters that you and I have debated in the Corporate Law Review Bill debate that took place three weeks ago, my diary tells me—it seems like a few years ago now. I am a little bit perplexed as to why, when the Senate had agreed and I think you had agreed, matters such as the corporate governance board concept—very much something that has been promoted by my friend Shann Turnbull—and some of these other corporate governance concepts would be referred to the Joint Statu 
 tory Committee on Corporations and Securities—
—I raised it because it is a single company.
—I thought that would be your response, Senator Murray, so I will quickly put on the record—because I think it is important—that the government has agreed in the debate to refer these matters to the joint committee. These matters are a radical departure from company structures in Australia and a fairly radical departure from company structuring in the world—I think the only exception might be Germany, but I stand corrected there—
—United States.
—Well, not quite so. Commentators in the United States of America tend to look to Australia in relation to corporate governance structures at board level. We lead the world in the appointment of non-executive directors to boards. We lead the world in the percentage of our public companies that have non-executive chairmen. We lead the world in many respects even on matters such as directors' remuneration. We were one of the first countries to require in our law disclosure of directors' remuneration. So I do get a little bit frustrated when people in Australia start saying that we are behind the eight ball when almost all international commentators say we are ahead of the game when it comes to corporate governance.
The government has referred, I think, each one of these issues to the joint statutory committee not only from the floor of this chamber but in a letter from the Treasurer (Mr Costello), which certainly has gone or is about to go, to the chairman of that committee making a quite specific reference of these matters to the committee.
I think the point that needs to be made in response to the interjection from Senator Murray was that Telstra is a special case. I think it is fair to say it is a majority public owned company at the moment. It is one-third owned by private shareholders. Senator Murray, if you listened to his last intervention as well as his interjection, would say it is a special company because it needs to serve all 
 the Australian community, its customers and it also obviously has a Corporations Law duty and fiduciary duty to its shareholder. It has to do both. I think Senator Murray and I would both understand that, if it does not serve its customers, it will not be serving its shareholders either. There is a nexus between the two. You have to ensure that in both the Corporations Law and in this privatisation bill you seek to do that properly.
The question I would ask—and I think it is a very important question—is: is it appropriate to try what is, without being flippant and without treating it lightly, a corporate governance experiment on what will be one of Australia's top two or three companies? Would you try what is effectively an experiment that will not be applied to any other top 500 company in Australia? Or would you proceed down the sensible public policy path which we have proposed and look at these proposals for what is a significant, if not radical, reform to the legislation on corporate governance in Australia, and that is to have the joint statutory committee receive public evidence from experts—even from directors of companies like Telstra—on relevant structures?
My own view, and the government's view, is that a corporate governance board tends to dissipate the responsibility of the board to its shareholders. The government believes that the proposal to have two boards reduces the responsibility of the members of the board to their shareholders. We believe that, if you want a dynamic corporate governance culture in Australia, directors of companies like Telstra need to be concerned about corporate governance and not be able to say, `That is the corporate governance board's role. They are the corporate governance people and we are the managers. We are going to get on with the hard job of managing.'
If you want good corporate governance, you need each director of every Australian company—be it Telstra, which serve such a massive majority of Australian customers, public listed companies or small private companies which have to fight in a far more competitive environment—to understand what corporate governance should be about. They 
 need to understand how the dynamics of corporate governance should be there to improve the way companies are governed, to improve outputs and to improve information flows to shareholders. Corporate governance should not be something about which we say, `Let's put it in a box and give it to this other group.'
I believe—and it has been reinforced by independent international commentators on company structures in Australia, including the recent OECD report and the Russell Reynolds report, which I quoted from in a previous debate—that Australia has led the world in setting up corporate governance committees, which are subcommittees of boards as Senator Murray would know, and having independent directors and independent chairmen. I have enormous respect for Shann Turnbull, who promotes these ideas, and I know Senator Murray has taken a close personal interest in Shann's ideas and is developing those ideas himself. They do deserve further expert consideration, because if we can improve corporate governance, through changes to voting structures and board structures we will be the first ones to applaud it. But I do not want to have a corporate governance experiment with a company the size of Telstra. I would rather have expert consideration of these proposals and, if they are good proposals, apply them to all of our public companies for the benefit of all Australian citizens.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1

—Oops, slips!
—I did not know.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Colston, Sen Malcolm",IND,1998-07-11,"—This evening I would like to first express my thanks to those members of the opposition who made such complimentary remarks about me in this place yesterday and today. They were greatly appreciated. Second, I state that my wife and my younger son have Telstra shares. I deliberately do not involve myself with the investments of my family, and I was therefore not aware of this until I 
 was kindly advised by the opposition yesterday.
Third, as I was unable to be present for the second reading debate, I shall make some comments now during the committee stage. There are several matters relating to this bill which are of some concern to me. One of my concerns is the standard of telecommunications services in Queensland, especially in rural and regional areas. I am also concerned about stable employment opportunities for Telstra workers.
At the time of the one-third sale, I was given assurances by the government and the Chief Executive Officer of Telstra about the employment levels of Telstra staff in certain areas of Queensland. Figures given to me recently indicate that these assurances have not been fulfilled. Indeed, an examination of the figures for 013 and similar operators in nine regional centres in Queensland shows an overall decline of some 12 per cent of the full-time staff. In other areas, figures from the Community and Public Sector Union indicate that, between March 1997 and March this year, 1,313 Telstra staff lost their jobs in Queensland. About half of these came from the commercial and consumer area, that part of Telstra responsible for looking after the needs of residential and small business customers.
During the debate in December 1996, I accepted the assurances given to me, but with some qualification. Indeed, I indicated then, and I will quote from Hansard:
. . . if assurances following negotiations are not kept, future negotiations would be of no avail.
I was conscious of this statement as I examined this legislation and, indeed, conscious of it as I reviewed disappointing staff levels.
Over recent years, the Telstra work force has been required to endure endless uncertainty and insecurity. Indeed, in some respects, the work force has been treated abominably. But we are talking about much more than mere statistics when we examine staff reductions and redeployments. Beyond statistics and beyond the fact that assurances have not been kept, we are talking about actual people and their families. I remind Telstra management of the impact its actions have had on the 
 staff. It appears that management has acted with little realisation that Telstra could not operate without its highly skilled, competent and conscientious workers.
Many staff members have not been treated well and, if morale is low, the atmosphere created by management means that morale must be at less than an optimal level. We hear Telstra consumers complain of falling service standards. While the impact on front-line service is far from quantifiable, surely the lack of high morale partially contributes to these falling standards. Many customers are quick to accuse the staff, but perhaps we need to reflect that the cause is far deeper. Telstra management needs to examine this issue. It needs to cooperate with its work force.
We need to reverse the now almost invisible social costs that have resulted since partial privatisation. We need to look at people, not numbers. The impact of staff cutbacks on small rural communities is enormous and goes beyond the telecommunications industry. It impacts on all levels of the community from the corner shop to the local schools.
In 1996 I was prepared to support the one-third privatisation of Telstra because it left two-thirds of Telstra in the hands of the government, but it is a quantum leap to move from one-third to 100 per cent privatisation. We are told that, through the government, we as Australians could realise some $50 billion as a result of complete privatisation. But what then? What could we do if we sold Telstra and then discovered that it was not the best course of action after all? There would be no remedying this situation. Our hands would be tied.
There has been the suggestion that many billions of dollars from the sale could go towards expanding networks in rural areas. Of course, if this occurred, it would be of immense value to those who deserve the same quality of service as those who live in urban areas. But there is some concern from regional areas that such an upgrade would be a one-off effort to placate growing regional disquiet. And, while the funds might be available in the short term, what of the medium- to long-term future of the telecommunications indus 
 try? What would happen to upgrading regional services in 20 or 30 years time? Indeed, given the rapid development of the telecommunication industry, who can judge what the medium-  to long-term will mean? Within a decade, will today's state-of-the-art technology be the equivalent of a piece of string between two tin cans?
At this stage, and without the benefit of a crystal ball, a continuing government interest in Telstra can provide some reassurance for regional customers that their long-term service requirements can be maintained. We can so easily forget that Australia, beyond the urban fringe, is an expansive land and provision of high-class telecommunication services is essential.
As I considered my list of concerns, I regretted that there has not been sufficient time to negotiate and debate the ramifications of the full sale of Telstra. Indeed, that was evident in the insupportably limited time given to a Senate committee which was examining the matter. We seem to be pushing this passage to a timetable which, given the importance of the issues at hand, can scarcely be justified. For example, only next month, we expect to have handed down in this place the report on community service obligations. Surely it is incumbent upon us as senators to examine the ramifications of the sale of Telstra in the light of this report.
In the context of my deliberations, I willingly acknowledge the extensive assistance provided by Senator Alston and his staff. The minister and his staff have been particularly helpful, but given the time available it has not been possible to arrive at an acceptable understanding of the effects of full privatisation.
It is possible that my vote on this bill will be decisive. On an important issue such as this, it is not an enviable position, but I am not going to abrogate my responsibility to arrive at a definite conclusion about how my vote should be cast. While it is incumbent upon each senator to examine the ramifications of the bill, so it is with me personally that I should weigh up all matters very carefully. Should I vote with the government, or even abstain, the bill will probably be passed. Should I vote against the bill, it will probably 
 not proceed. This is perhaps an obvious statement of fact for most in this chamber, but one with far more gravity when such a key vote is one's own.
On balance, I find at this stage I am unable to support the bill and thus will be voting against it. Overall, there remain too many question marks over services and employment, but particularly in regional Queensland. The potential ramifications of this bill, its impact on people and the social costs which may be involved deserve to be examined in a context not driven by political or electoral timetables. For us to do otherwise would be to short-change our future for short-term political gains.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-11,"—I would like to respond to the comments of Senator Colston. I think he appreciates above all else that his vote in this respect is critical and that there have been a number of matters of concern which have been raised with us by a number of senators which the government has at all times done its best to address. We believe that the bill does contain more than sufficient ongoing protections but, most importantly, that there is separate legislation, the Telecommunications Act, which looks after the interests of customers and consumers in a way that is unparalleled in any other country.
As far as the work force of Telstra is concerned, one can understand that if you are a Telstra employee you may be very comfortable in that position. But, in this day and age, no company can offer lifetime employment. Certainly, a company involved in the telecommunications arena knows that, unless it performs, it goes backwards. Indeed, when it is 30 per cent off world's best practice, it ultimately has to shape up or it will find that its competitors are simply eating up its market share.
It is therefore very disappointing that these concerns have not been reflected in Senator Colston's remarks. As Senator Harradine and the government have pointed out on a number of occasions, Telstra has been shedding staff now for several years. It is not a function of privatisation; it is a function of open markets, 
 which were deregulated as long ago as 1991 by the Labor government. Privatisation will not stem continuing moves to derive efficiencies from telecommunications services. It will not provide employment in the bush if there is not a demand for it. It is not possible, in this day and age, for anyone to tell Telstra how to run its business. To think that Labor is still arguing that it effectively wants to exercise a power of direction to tell Telstra what to do and how to do it simply defies the whole notion of commercial activity. There are, of course, ways in which an efficient Telstra can maximise its performance and in that way generate greater volumes of business. To the extent that there is higher demand, there is a greater level of need to service that demand.
What is critically important is that it is a matter of great regret to the government that the concerns that Senator Colston has now expressed, particularly in relation to what he sees as Telstra non-compliance, were not matters that he brought to the attention of the government over recent weeks. There has been every opportunity to have had exhaustive discussions on these matters. We have, at all times, been more than willing to learn of concerns and to do our best to address them to the extent that they involve policy matters within the control of the government or, if they are matters within the control of Telstra, refer them to the company. At all times, we were prepared to do that.
If I had thought that Senator Colston had the view that Telstra was in breach of undertakings, I certainly would have referred that matter to Telstra. That is not the way—
—That would be interfering in that commercial outcome. You said you would never do that.
—It is not. If Telstra had previously given an undertaking which someone subsequently regarded as having been breached then there is—
—You gave the undertaking. You did the dirty deal.
—They were never my undertakings, and you know it.
—You did the dirty deal.
—Telstra gave certain undertakings. If Senator Colston is of the view that those undertakings were breached, we would have expected that he would have brought that matter to our attention. We would then have raised it with Telstra. There was nothing to stop Senator Colston from addressing those matters direct with Telstra. Certainly, to the extent that Senator Colston does have concerns that can be addressed over the next couple of hours, we would still be prepared to look at those because we have never ignored concerns that have been brought to our attention that have merit. If Senator Colston, even at this late hour, is indicating that there are matters within the control of Telstra that require attention or that there are undertakings that have not been met, I would certainly be more than willing to revisit those issues.
It makes it very difficult if the first time we learn about them is now. If there are specific matters of concern, the government has always stood willing to address them. We do not want to see anyone welshing on undertakings. We certainly do not want to see anyone impact it adversely if it is within the control of government or within the control of the corporation. There are a number of matters that have been raised that clearly have to be seen in a macro-economic context, in a deregulation context and in a competition context.
If Senator Colston is still prepared to have those matters discussed and addressed and to take them into account when it does come to a vote on these issues, the government would be more than willing to pursue that path. If not, it is a matter of great regret to us that we are not in a position, at this very late hour, to give attention to matters which could have been raised over a matter of weeks and certainly in recent days. I do not think that Senator Colston would suggest that there has been any unwillingness on the part of the government to respond to matters he has raised. I leave it at that point.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-07-11,"—On that matter, I want to say simply that the outline Senator Colston gave of the difficulties with the rush to this decision and the 
 shortcomings in the government's argument are ones that have been cogently put here over the last two days. If the government has not been able to answer them, it has nobody but itself to blame. The fact is that there is enormous concern about the privatisation of Telstra and the inability of government to look after consumers throughout this country, not just in the bush, as well as the shedding of jobs which Senator Colston nailed as being one of the particular concerns he has.
They are real concerns and I do not see how the government can possibly think it is going to deal with issues of that magnitude in the next two hours. That is part of the lunacy of trying to shove this legislation through this place in such unseemly haste for political purposes—not for the good of this country but for political purposes. Whatever else, Senator Colston has stood where most Australians stand on this issue, where the opposition stands on this issue, and where the Democrats and the Greens stand on this issue. The government does not have a case except for political expediency. That is one that the Senate should reject.

This amendment seeks to modify the proclamation date for this legislation so that it takes account of what happens at the election. In other words, it goes out to July next year and it needs a vote of both the Senate and the House of Representatives,

—We are dealing with Democrat amendment No. 2 moved by Senator Lees.
—I would like to indicate that I actually prefer the Democrat amendment to my own inasmuch as it encompasses what is mentioned in the Greens (WA) amendment, but it also specifically mentions a date, which is July. It quite rightly reflects the fact that if we are going to see whether there is any agreement within the community the parliament is the means by which that can be decided. In July of next year we will have the make-up of the new parliament rather than the old, and I think that is a very important aspect and an improvement. I indicate that I will support the Democrats' amendment. Of course, if that is defeated, I will hope they support mine as the next best amendment. The reality is, I believe, that it is better than the one proposed by Senator Harradine, which would indicate that the most important aspect 
 of the timing is that it be done while the Senate is still in its current situation. I do not really think that that is necessarily giving us the means of listening to the people and a reflection of what the electorate is saying. That is what the government is saying, that it is going to the election to hear the people. Quite clearly, it might be able to close its ears altogether and still abide by what is in Senator Harradine's amendment.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-11,"—The opposition supports the Democrats' amendment. It is clearly much superior to the amendment moved by Senator Harradine in that it would be a vote of the parliament elected at the next election—it would be half a new Senate and a full new House of Representatives deciding the issue. Senator Harradine's amendment, which is better than the government's position, but only marginally so, says that the government gets two months to proclaim it. If it does not proclaim it within two months, it automatically lapses. It means that a minority government in the House of Representatives—and there is quite a possibility in the present political circumstances of Australia that you could have a minority Howard government, with One Nation members replacing National Party members on the crossbenches—
—It's odds on.
—I think that is clearly odds on—still, without an absolute majority vote of the House of Representatives, hanging on to a negotiated minority government position for at least a month before the parliament meets. Even before the new parliament with a minority government met, it could then proclaim the bill. I have to say that that may bring people into the streets in Australia for the first time in a long time. It would be a shameful thing if that is the loophole that Senator Harradine's amendment still allows. It is not as bad as the government position completely allows. But the Democrats' amendment says, `You can't do it until you get a vote of both houses.' As the new Senate, whenever the election is held, will not come in and take their seats until 1 July next year, that means that if the Howard government is elected as a minority or a majority it 
 then has to seek a vote of both houses, with an up-to-date elected parliament. That is the superior position, and we will support the Democrats.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-11,"—The notion that a proclamation should somehow be subject to a resolution of both houses of parliament is entirely inconsistent with the notion of parliamentary process. In other words, the normal way in which legislation is handled is for legislation to be voted on by both houses of parliament. If it is passed by both houses of this parliament, and that is no mean feat, as we all know, the government of the day has its legislation and it then has the capacity to decide when it should proclaim the legislation.
I can understand the view that if you simply leave it open-ended you may find that even years down the track there is legislation on the Notice Paper that could stay there for years.
—That is your original proposition, Richard, which we are now criticising.
—That would be an open-ended arrangement that would be—
—That's your bill. That's what you were proposing, Minister.
—Don't you ever keep quiet.
—Not when I am getting rot thrown at us like this.
—Order!
—As I was saying, the essential proposition in law making is that, if both houses of parliament vote in support of a bill, that bill then becomes law when it is proclaimed. That, of course, means that a bill is proclaimed when the government of the day chooses to submit it for royal assent. As we know, sometimes bills are dealt with very expeditiously after they pass through the parliament. There might be very good reasons why other legislation might not be seen as so important. There might be timing issues, even 
 in relation to the legislation itself. There may be different start-up dates. In other words, the government of the day has been authorised by the parliament to act on a decision of both houses. In other words, once you have got to the point where you have the parliament endorsing the legislation, it is then the government's call. The government makes the decision as to whether or not there should be a proclamation.
I can understand the concern expressed by Senator Harradine that to simply have an open-ended arrangement may mean that legislation is on the Notice Paper or on the statute books for sometimes many years. I think there has been a recent experience in this chamber which has probably been considered in detail by one of the Senate standing committees, which has identified that there is a need to cleanse the statute books of legislation that is effectively languishing—even though passed by both houses of parliament—by not in fact having been proclaimed.
—Why did you propose the legislation in its present form?
—I am in the process of explaining that. There is nothing untoward about leaving it to the discretion of the government, because the fact that the parliament has passed a bill then enables the government to make a decision at any time that suits it, unless that power is limited in some way. You are seeking, of course, to impose the ultimate limitation, which I will come to in a moment. In the normal course of events, either you have an open-ended capacity to have the bill proclaimed or, as Senator Harradine would propose, you put a time limit on that, and then it is a question of what is a reasonable period of time to allow.
There may be certain circumstances in relation to a particular piece of legislation that would warrant having a very tight time limit. I could understand someone saying six months would be a reasonable period. In this instance, because of the particular circumstances, Senator Harradine's proposition is that it ought to be acted on expeditiously or it ought to lapse and, therefore, a period of two months is a reasonable time.
In these circumstances, I would not quarrel with that, but I would quarrel with the notion that you can make proclamations subject to a resolution by both houses of parliament. Let us just say that this legislation passed through the parliament, that you had a double dissolution and you had an immediate change in the constitution of the Senate and that Senate was then asked to consider the matter all over again. In other words, you would be asking the government of the day to run the gauntlet of a differently structured house of parliament from the one that actually passed the bill and to run the very real risk that that second body might say no. That is an extraordinary proposition, because otherwise there is no point in legislation being passed by the parliament.
It may be a different matter in relation to delegated or subordinate legislation where we have disallowable instruments, where the legislation empowers the government to introduce regulations which can be considered and, in some circumstances, disallowed by either or both houses of parliament. But that is subordinate to the legislation itself. The notion that the legislation can be passed by both houses of parliament in good faith and then find that a differently constituted Senate or, indeed, House of Representatives could say that it did not favour the very legislation that had just been passed by the parliament is making a farce of the normal procedures and, indeed, all of the established arrangements that enable legislation to pass through this parliament.
—You will never get that stuff through unless you bring it back to the parliament. The bill cannot be proclaimed. You accepted it on the digital legislation. The bill cannot be proclaimed in those areas.
—Exactly!
—If I recall the digital legislation, there were a number of matters that would need to come back to this parliament as primary legislation, not legislation that was passed through the parliament that you would then say could not be taken any further unless it came back to the parliament again. That is an entirely different proposition. It is quite contrary to the notion that the parliament decides is the master of its own 
 destiny, that parliament considers the legislation on the merits and makes a judgment. What you are saying is that, even though both houses of parliament are in favour of a piece of legislation, that legislation can then be subsequently rejected because a decision is taken not to proclaim it.
I cannot for a moment understand how that can be consistent with normal democratic processes. It undermines the whole notion of parliamentary democracy. It is saying that there is no point in taking the view that legislation that passes through both houses of parliament becomes law, because there is absolutely no guarantee that that will be the case. In fact, as I have indicated, if you did have a change in the constitution of the Senate a very short time after the bill had been passed by both chambers, you could have the farcical situation where a bill that had passed through both houses, that was treated as legislation enacted by the parliament, was then not allowed to be taken any further. That is a decision that should be made by the government of the day.
—By the government of the day—after an election.
—After an election.
—I am glad you agree with me. The government of the day decides what legislation it introduces into the parliament. The government seeks to have that legislation supported by both houses of parliament. If it is supported by both houses of parliament, then I cannot believe that you could still contend that the government should not be able to process that legislation. Yet your argument is that somehow it is only the first base, that having got to that point you then need to go back through the whole process again.
Let us say the native title legislation was in that situation. You can just imagine that with some of the tortuous debates we have had in this chamber that have gone on for many hours—maybe 40, 50, 60 hours—once the bill finally gets through the parliament, this proposition would say, `I'm sorry, we're going to have to do it all over again. We will have a debate on whether the proclamation should be approved by both houses of parlia 
 ment.' In other words, we then embark on effectively the same debate all over again.
—Wasn't this in your own digital television bill?
—Senator Schacht raised that furphy and I responded to it but, if you want me to do it again, I will. The view we took in relation to the digital legislation was that, if there were matters that needed to be considered by the various review bodies that have been established, they will and then they will come back to the parliament for consideration—
—There are three major committees still meeting on this legislation.
—You are simply not interested, are you? If the review process throws up proposals that the government believes should be put in legislation, it will introduce that legislation and it will be voted on for the first time. Yet this is arguing that, even though you get your legislation through both houses of parliament a first time, somehow the parliament is then entitled to say, `I'm sorry, we still don't like your legislation, and we're not going to allow it to be proclaimed.'
That is a deliberate frustration of the democratic process, and I cannot for the life of me imagine, apart from the Labor Party, which clearly has an interest in simply stymieing every aspect of the legislation for the sake of it, how any open-minded member of this chamber could fail to appreciate that point. It ought to be abundantly clear that the whole purpose of our being here is to vote on legislation. If we vote for it and it passes, that should be the end of the matter. It should be up to the government of the day to make a decision on whether or not it wants to see the matter proclaimed and, if so, when.
Many pieces of legislation have been passed. I seem to recall that one part of the Corporations Law was lying around for years, and the Keating government was identified as having left a whole swag of legislation on the statute books but not taken any further. That is no doubt why Senator Harradine thought that it was desirable in the particular circum 
 stances of this legislation to impose a two-month time limit. I accept that proposition.
At the end of the day, if you get your legislation, you ought to be able to make up your mind within a period of two months whether or not you want to see it enacted, whether you want to see it take effect. That is, I would say in these circumstances, a sensible and measured approach. But to turn around and argue that both houses of parliament have to approve a proclamation is effectively saying that both houses of parliament get a second chance to reconsider the whole legislation.
—Of course—after the election.
—It might not even be after the election in relation to a particular piece of legislation. We have already said that it will not be proclaimed until after the election. You know that. It would only occur if we were in government that we would be in a position to do it. We have undertaken not to do it, and the legislation provides for that.
So the only issue is: how long after the next election? Senator Harradine is saying that it should be within two months, and that is what you have to do. Whereas the Democrats and the Greens are saying, `I don't care. You got your bill through the parliament. But, after the next election, this chamber effectively has a power of veto over the very legislation that the Senate itself has enacted.' That is a proposition that I have not heard before. It is certainly not one that is consonant with democratic practice. It is one that ought to be roundly rejected. I move:
That the committee report progress and seek leave to sit again.
Question put.
A division having been called and the bells being rung—
—Madam Temporary Chairman, I want to declare that, as far as I am aware, my wife holds Telstra shares.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1998-07-11,"—Speaking to this amendment, I have some questions which I would like to ask of the minister and his advisers.
—The minister has shot through on you.
—Order!
—It will take me some time to develop those questions. I know that Senator Kemp, who has a very keen interest in this matter, also has some questions that he wants to ask.
There was an announcement by the minister today that, subject to the sale of two-thirds of Telstra, an extra $20 million would be put into the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund. That extra allocation of $20 million will allow better telecommunications for remote and island communities. I am particularly interested in how this fund will be allocated to the remote island communities of Cocos, Christmas and Norfolk. Perhaps what interests me more is how it will apply to Australia's Antarctic territories.
As honourable senators would know, I have responsibility for the Australian Antarctic territories. One of the problems that we have always experienced down there—we have about 200 expeditioners in the territory every year—is that, to get in touch with their loved ones back home, people have to communicate by telecommunications back to the mainland of Australia. The division spends about $350,000 on telecommunications between Australia's Antarctic territories and the mainland of Australia.
This announcement today of an extra $20 million for the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund was specifically mentioned by the minister to apply to Australia's Antarctic Territory. There are many very good, very courageous, Australians down in the Antarctic Territory who do work in the wild frontiers of Australia, doing good work for Australia, looking after Australia's science, looking after Australia's interests in the Antarctic. But I would submit that they are entitled—as Australian pioneers, one might almost call them—to communicate back with loved ones at home: children, family, spouses, parents. At the present time, they pay a fee of 90c per minute to communicate via satellite from Australia's Antarctic territories back to their loved ones in Australia.
By contrast, those Australians living on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands or on Christmas Island currently get that service at about 30c per minute. That, of course, means that Australians working in the Antarctic have to pay three times that amount.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order, Senator Schacht.
—I am sure Senator Schacht would agree with me that those Australians who do that work in the Antarctic should not be disadvantaged. Currently—and I want to emphasise that because I will be seeking some support from Senator Schacht on this particular matter—those Australians pay that 90c a minute, but it does not seem to me to be fair.
I think the minister has recognised this today, because he did issue a media release indicating that $20 million in additional funds would be made available for the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund. That fund is in addition to the announcement that the minister made yesterday of something of the order of $150 million out of the sale of two-thirds of Telstra to enable people living in remote mainland Australia to communicate with their neighbours five or 10 kilometres away. In the past, those people living in remote Australia had to pay trunk line rates. That means that not only did they pay a lot of money but also they were timed calls. That was a situation that existed under the 13 years of Labor, and we wanted to cure that. So the minister announced that, upon the sale of two-thirds of Telstra, there will be sufficient funds to enable those people living in remote Australia to communicate with their neighbours at a local call rate and their calls will be untimed. That is the first time it has ever happened. It is a tremendous deal for remote and regional Australians.
—Madam Chairman, I raise a point of order. Could you tell Senator Macdonald which amendment we are discussing? I do not think it has anything to do with the Antarctic or Cocos islands.
—It is.
—Remote areas.
—I ask you to draw his attention to which clause.
—Senator Macdonald is not out of order. The resolution of the parliament has very broad ranging ramifications as an amendment.
—Thank you, Madam Chairman. You come from a regional area and I know that you understand, unlike Senator Schacht. Have you ever been outside the Adelaide suburbs, Senator Schacht, except when you have been chasing a vote for preselection?
—Please address your remarks through the chair.
—Chasing a vote for preselection, because he needs them. This deal for people living in remote and regional Australia which the minister announced yesterday provides for $150 million, but it is dependent upon the sale of the other two-thirds of Telstra.
In addition to that initiative, Senator Alston also announced yesterday that he was allowing a preferential rate for people living on mainland Australia but living remote from a service town. That is my interpretation of it; it has another description. It is a town closest to people living in remote and regional Australia which has normal services: a doctor, a pharmacy and that sort of thing.
In the past, under Labor, you could ring there at 25c for four minutes. Senator Alston announced yesterday that we are extending that to 12 minutes. You can get a 12-minute call for a 25c fee. Calls average about six minutes, they tell me, in these areas, so for the first time people in regional Australia who want to ring into their nearest town that has normal services are going to get that for 25c a call, and that is the same as Senator Schacht gets living in the leafy suburbs of Adelaide. It puts people out in Barry Wakelin's electorate in the north of South Australia on the same plane as Senator Schacht. Senator Schacht is not interested in that. He is not at all interested in people in regional Australia; he is only interested in those living in the leafy suburbs of Adelaide.
These are two tremendous initiatives announced by the minister yesterday, but they are dependent on the sale of two-thirds of Telstra. There are those two elements which I just reinforce, but I come back to the matter I wanted to raise in speaking to this amendment, which is just how that would affect Australia's Antarctic territory. Some of my colleagues in this place have actually been to Australia's Antarctic territory and they have seen the remoteness. They have been on a trip down and back. I think Senator Lees from the Australian Democrats has been down there. She would understand just how remote they are and how much these expeditioners miss their spouses, their partners, their families—in many cases with young children—and their parents. We here in this building are away from our families for a long time, and most of us ring our spouses or our children every night just to keep in touch.
—Madam Chair, I raise a point of order. It relates to relevance. Senator Macdonald is always very careful to make sure that everybody else is relevant. I believe the amendment we are dealing with is the timing of the resolution of the motion to parliament. I wonder whether you could direct him to speak to the amendment.
—No, he is lost in Antarctica.
—On the point of order, Madam Chair: this amendment relates to the proclamation of the bill, and I suppose Senator Macdonald is entitled to speak about the bill if it is all to do with the proclamation. But I would like to remind the senator that I would be interested in making a contribution about the clause itself when he concludes.
—I know Senator Kemp wants to speak, so perhaps I could curtail my remarks. I think the minister's adviser got the thrust of mine. Senator Harradine could speak and Senator Kemp could follow him if there is time.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-07-11,"—We had an extraordinary performance here from Senator Ian Macdonald, who seems, after the last division, to have suddenly been given the short straw by the minister in being asked to get up and ask a 
 few questions of the minister and his advisers. Even Senator Macdonald had given up assuming that the minister could answer seriously. He probably knew that Senator Kemp was taking over from Senator Alston, so we were asking his advisers. We had this extraordinary performance where we started on a Southern Ocean whip-around. We started in Antarctica, we whipped over to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and I think we might have got to Christmas Island. This, Senator, is about the resolution on the proclamation.
—Madam Chair, I raise a point of order. What Senator Schacht is engaged in now is nothing to do with—
—I am getting to the point.
—It has nothing to do with the amendment that is currently before the chair. How can he, who has filibustered for the last 27 hours, possibly relate what he is saying to the amendments moved by Senator Lees and me in respect of the proclamation?
—Order! It being 6.30, the sitting of the committee is suspended until 7.30.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.
—Before the suspension Senator Harradine raised a point of order in relation to the relevance of Senator Schacht's contribution. I would ask Senator Schacht to actually make his comments relevant to the amendment currently before the chair.
—I certainly will. The amendment before us, moved by the Democrats, that we support is to ensure that the Australian people have a genuine opportunity to decide this issue rather than have the government sneak this through after an election. As we pointed out, it is quite possible that after the next election One Nation will hold the balance of power in the House of Representatives.
—Thanks to the failure of the National Party.
—Particularly as a result of the collapse of the National Party, 
 including their performance over this bill in the last few days. But One Nation have a real prospect, on all the opinion polls at the present time, of holding the balance of power by taking a number of seats off the National Party in rural Australia. Although we do not have any brook with One Nation, they have indicated recently that they now support the policy of the Labor Party in opposing the privatisation of Telstra.
So, after the counting of preferences, you would have a minority Howard government. The Prime Minister of that minority government could say, `Well, I am not going to call parliament together for three months. I may have an opportunity to convince some newly elected One Nation members to come and join the coalition.' In doing so, he could keep parliament from sitting during that three-month period and, since the government has accepted Senator Harradine's amendment, he could proclaim the bill to privatise Telstra—even though a clear majority of Australians at that election for the House of Representatives had voted for the Labor Party, the Democrats, One Nation and, I would imagine, a number of Independents, including some people who had already left the National Party over the issue, such as Mrs De-Anne Kelly, the member for Dawson. There would be a combined vote of well over 50 per cent opposed to the privatisation of Telstra.
Because of the way the numbers worked out Mr Howard could say, `I am not going to the Governor-General a week after the election to hand in my resignation; I am going to test the confidence in my government on the floor of the House of Representatives when I call it together.' I think he can wait at least three months before he has to do so. So, while we wait three months for that test of confidence on the floor of the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister can, under Senator Harradine's amendment which the government supports, say, `We privatise Telstra,' and it is proclaimed.
—Just like that.
—Just like that. That is why I am surprised at Senator Harradine, who has been such a stickler for the powers of the Senate ensuring that executive govern 
 ment does not abuse what he would call the will of the people. I am surprised he does not see through the possibilities that the Prime Minister has. That is what is astonishing to us. We have been lectured on many occasions by Senator Harradine in the 11 years that I have been here.
—On a point of order, Madam Chairman: Senator Schacht is misrepresenting this particular amendment. The Prime Minister could not do that until after the first meeting of the new parliament. If you are going to address this amendment, please address it accurately. This is a measure which was perfectly in order and was the result of—
—Senator Harradine, you are raising a debating point. Do you have a point of order?
—If Senator Schacht can give me a chance to respond, I will.
—You do not have a point of order.
—Senator Harradine disagrees with my interpretation.
—Because you are wrong.
—You have had a couple of chances to speak in this debate on this point and you have explained your view. I have a different view about it. The real issue for us is that this legislation is totally unnecessary. It will give the Prime Minister an opportunity to get this legislation through on the numbers in the Senate at present rather than taking a chance on what the numbers will be after 1 July next year. That is the what the sham, that is what the political trickery, has been about from the very beginning. It is a finely designed rort.
We all remember the way in which the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, congratulated himself when he made his announcement at the Liberal Party conference that this is how the legislation would be designed. He said that, firstly, it did not break his promise that he would never move to fully privatise Telstra during the first term of his government and, secondly, it gave the people the opportunity to vote—and then, if he lost the election, 
 presumably the legislation would not be proclaimed. Normal, ordinary Australians would say, `That is a stunt. Why don't you win the election first and then bring the legislation in?'
The other stunt is that, by having the legislation now, you can actually adjust the figures and say, `We have got a pot of money for various bribes to the electorate. We can say now what it is and use that money to mislead the National Party,' who believe it is an extraordinary pot of gold but, in fact, so far it is only $150 million. That is what the real issue is here: it gave the Prime Minister and the Treasurer the ability to say, `We can fund a whole range of promises on legislation passed but not proclaimed until after the election.' It means the Prime Minister does not have to be tough about preparing his election manifesto of how to pay for all his promises. If he had to put that up front, a lot of this magic pudding—the sale of Telstra—would not be available to him. That is why it is being done this way.
The political point we have made today is that we find it extraordinary that the magic pudding for the National Party has been very small. It is only $150 million. As for the new mobile telephone network, Frank Blount is on television tonight confirming what I said three times in this debate today, that is, Telstra were doing the new telephone network as a commercial decision. It was reported again that he said, `This government, this minister, has never said boo to me.' This was happening anyway. The $400 million for the new mobile telephone network, which has been sold to the National Party as part of the magic pudding, was going to happen anyway. You can't have that.
All the National Party has is $150 million. But the Liberal Party is going to have a big bag of money from the sale that they can offer their voters in the cities to bribe them over the line at the next election. That is what we have found so extraordinary. We believe that the Democrats' amendment will keep the government absolutely honest. The parliament elected at the next election—the new House of Representatives and the new Senate—will have the decision to decide whether this goes 
 through, even if Mr Howard wins the election. We believe that is a much more honest and ethical way to handle this issue.
Again, I am surprised that Senator Harradine would put such a proposition. He said he disagreed with my interpretation. If that is the case, I think the real issue, Senator Harradine, is for you to forget your amendment altogether. If there is a dispute about what it means, vote for the Democrat amendment, which we are voting for. It makes it clear that there can be no misunderstanding by the Australian people that they have the final opportunity to vote in a new parliament and a new government, whichever it may be, to continue with a proper arrangement to ensure that Telstra is dealt with in that way and not in this background, back-handed, sneaky deal.
Not all the detail of the deal has been out but we think we know what some of it is. Some of it is not as good as the National Party first proclaimed. We have had that embarrassment for Mr Tim Fischer exposed today. We have had Senator Boswell having to move an amendment, on my suggestion, to try to protect his own electors, and the minister has had to accept it because the minister found that he had not covered all the bases in his own deal making. Goodness knows what Senator Boswell or Senator Harradine have given away in secret to get your vote up to the line here.
—Order! The time for the debate has expired. I will proceed to put the question that is before the chair, which is Democrat amendment No. 2 on sheet 1124. The question is that the motion be agreed to.
A division having been called and the bells having been rung—
—Madam Chairman, my wife and I own Telstra shares.
—My family superannuation fund and my wife have Telstra shares.

—I have some shares to declare, and I am informed that my husband and an adult son have some.
—I wish I had some.
—I do not have any shares but my wife does.
—I own Telstra shares.
—I declare an interest in Telstra shares.
—Madam Chair, I was informed yesterday that my wife and my younger son have Telstra shares.
—My husband may have some Telstra shares in a superannuation trust.
Question put.",SENATE,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-11,"—We have had a number of speakers on the Copyright Amendment Bill 1997 . I do not want to prolong the time of the Senate unduly. There are a number of amendments that will be considered. I do certainly express the hope that we will be able to achieve a package which will constitute a substantial step forward in copyright reform. I think it ought to be clear from the public debate that has been conducted in recent times that the refusal of the ALP to support a workable moral rights regime has led the government at this stage to withdraw this element of the bill pending further consideration and consultations.
The bill, when introduced, did contain provisions that would have vested the moral rights of integrity and attribution in the authors of works and the makers of films. The government remains committed to introducing a workable moral rights regime. It will be a regime that ensures that Australia meets its international obligations and, importantly, one that is fair to creators, producers and users of 
 copyright material. The original impetus for the establishment of moral rights came from visual artists whose lack of bargaining power sometimes leads to exploitation and mistreatment of their works. This is particularly so in the case of indigenous artists. However, once this bill was introduced the justification for comprehensive moral rights protection became obscured by a debate over a provision to allow an up-front waiver for contracted works and films principally led by elements of the film industry.
Following the release of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report in October 1997, where the majority recommended the extension of waiver at the time of commissioning a work or film, the government has held lengthy discussions over several months with the participants to try to broker an acceptable compromise on this issue that would satisfy all interests and maintain certainty and confidence in the industry. This has not proved possible to date. The government is therefore withdrawing the moral rights provisions from the bill.
However, we will continue to consult in an attempt to develop a consensus on a workable provision on waiver, and we remain committed to resubmitting the moral rights regime as a stand-alone bill in three months time or as soon as possible thereafter. It is a matter of regret to the government that this delay has been forced upon it, deferring the time that creators who most need protection will receive it. That is probably the most contentious aspect of the copyright legislation. I should, in passing, point to the hypocrisy of the Labor Party who now say that they are not in favour of a waiver for moral rights, yet prior to the last election they were. That, no doubt, will be well understood by those who have taken a keen interest in the subject.
There are particular factors that operate in relation to creative film workers, producers and directors. We have certainly endeavoured to ensure that all of those rights are respected. The moral rights regime would last as long as the copyright in a work or film, which would normally be 50 years from the death of an author of a work or 50 years from the making of a film. Where there are two or more joint 
 creators of a work or film they would each have moral rights. The majority and minority committee reports recommended that the bill be amended to provide that an author's right was not infringed when his or her joint authorship was misattributed.
Journalists' copyright is another important aspect of this legislation. The copyright in works produced by an employee usually vests with the employer. The exception to this is where the employee is a journalist. Employed journalists have retained copyright in their work except where it is published in a newspaper or magazine or is broadcast. The bill will leave journalists with copyright in their works when reproduced in books or photocopied for media monitoring services but transfer all other copyright to newspaper proprietors permitting them to develop on-line newspapers. The change reflects an agreement between the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance and some publishers. The proposed changes will leave employed journalists with their traditional rights to reproduce their articles in book form and to benefit from the photocopying of their articles.
The existing provisions of the Copyright Act give newspaper proprietors copyright in articles written by employed journalists for the purposes of publication in a newspaper or magazine or for broadcasting. The amendment will preserve existing employed journalists' rights but leave newspaper proprietors free to develop new modes of distribution, such as the Internet, for their publications.
We have taken account of the impact on media monitors. There will be a series of amendments to reflect the fact that media monitoring businesses will need to negotiate with publishers in relation to licensing the digital uses of newspapers to facilitate delivery of on-line media monitoring devices.
Media monitoring business has sought the introduction of a statutory licence to copy publishers' copyright material without their permission, subject to the Copyright Tribunal being able to arbitrate potential disputes about royalties for copying. The government rejected this proposal as it would have introduced a qualification of exclusive rights for which there is no demonstrated justification and 
 which might be inconsistent with Australia's international copyright obligations. The majority report and the ALP minority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on the Copyright Amendment Bill 1997 did not support the proposal put forward by media monitoring businesses.
The journalists union, the MEAA, has been consulted by the Attorney-General's Department in the development of the journalists' copyright proposals and, among other interests, the Australian Copyright Council, a peak body representing copyright interests, including the MEAA, was consulted in the final stages of drafting the bill and made no complaint about the extent of the consultation with journalists on this matter.
The National Competition Council considered a complaint from Media Monitors that the journalists' provisions breached the competition principles agreement which requires governments to consider the public interest in introducing anti-competitive legislation. In July 1997, the National Competition Council secretariat advised Media Monitors that the Commonwealth had complied with its obligations out of the competition principles agreement, and it did not intend to pursue Media Monitors complaint any further.
The objective of the journalists' copyright amendments is to ensure that publishers are able to use employed journalists works in the electronic publication and delivery of newspapers. Without the proposed amendments, proprietors will not be able to take advantage of these new technologies in the publication and delivery of newspapers and magazines. If publishers were impeded from taking advantage of new technologies, this could lead to limits on the access that consumers have to newspapers and magazines.
The Copyright Act does permit braille, large print and photographic versions of a work to be made for the benefit of print handicapped persons without infringing copyright. The Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee recommended that the Attorney-General consider whether restricting works for the print handicapped to these formats disadvantaged the print handicapped by denying them access to electronic copies. The government 
 has considered the matter and has some sympathy for the committee's recommendations. However, the proposed change would be a substantial change in the statutory licence which would require consultation with the copyright owners, whereas what is being done by the current amendments is simply replacing the expression `handicapped reader' with `persons with a print disability' and expanding the purposes for which copies may be made. The Copyright Law Revision Committee may recommend such a change when reporting on its simplification reference, but there would need to be consultation with copyright owners. The government will consider this issue after it receives the CLRC's report.
Photographers' copyright is also a very important issue that will be addressed in this legislation, and I will provide detail of that during the committee stages. We have also taken account of the Copyright Law Review Committee's consideration of provisions in relation to the protection of sculptures. Again there are some positive aspects. There are also recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission in relation to the creation of a right of adaptation for owners of copyright in artistic works. The government is in an advanced stage in its consideration of the ALRC report on designs, including the recommendation that the owners of copyright in artistic works be granted an adaptation right. The results of the government's consideration should be known shortly.
The government is also committed to introducing a new communications right. A discussion paper on this issue Copyright Reform and the Digital Agenda was released in July last year. The paper proposed, amongst other things, the creation of a technology neutral right of communication to the public. The government is considering submissions in response to that paper and will release an exposure draft of proposed changes to the Copyright Act in due course.
Turning to indigenous copyright, the final report arising from the ATSIC funded discussions paper on Indigenous Culture and Intellectual Property: Our Future is yet to be considered by the ATSIC board. When it is 
 considered, it is likely that the board will make recommendations to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and to the government as a whole arising from that report. When and if such recommendations are made they will be carefully considered by the government. In the interim, the government strongly supports the development of a mark of authenticity to assist in the marketing of authentic indigenous products. The introduction of moral rights requiring the proper attribution of creative effort and the maintenance of the integrity of artists' work will be of particular relevance and benefit to indigenous creators.
The Senate committee majority report also recommended that consideration be given to removing the one per cent ceiling on broadcasting royalties payable by commercial broadcasters for the broadcasting of recorded music. The question of whether the government should remove the current ceiling of one per cent of a broadcaster's income on the royalties payable by a commercial radio station for the broadcasting of recorded music is complex. As well as the interests of the owner of copyright on recorded music, the government has to consider the likely impact on the broadcasting industry and any likely flow-on effects a decision might have on the make up of music played on radio stations, bearing in mind that music recorded in America is not subject to any royalty for broadcasting.
There are also trade practices and competition issues to be considered. Consequently, while the government is giving consideration to this issue, it would not be appropriate to move an amendment on this issue as part of the current bill.
Another very important aspect of this legislation relates to parallel import barriers. The Copyright Act can be used by the owners of copyright in a label or packaging to prevent the import of otherwise non-infringing goods bearing the copyright label or in copyright packaging. This allows the importers of brand name goods to protect their franchises and to charge higher prices than would otherwise be the case. The removal of the parallel import restriction is expected to lead 
 to lower prices for the brand name goods in question.
The use of the Copyright Act to restrict the import of non-infringing goods has enabled the owners of the copyright and the labelling of such goods to charge higher prices than would otherwise be the case. The proposed changes will make it impossible to use copyright law to prevent the importation of goods which could otherwise be legally imported except for their copyright labelling or packaging. This misuse of the Copyright Act to restrict legitimate trade is beyond the purpose of the act which exists to protect intellectual property, not maintain non-tariff barriers. The removal of parallel import barriers should lead to a fall in prices of these goods and, to the extent that prices fall, the beneficiaries will be the public who would have had access otherwise to a wider range of cheaper goods. The only losers will be those who currently do very well from the high prices of brand name imports.
However, the government does realise that businesses have entered in good faith into arrangements based on the current provisions of the Copyright Act and, consequently, has moved to ensure that the new arrangements will not enter into force until 18 months after the commencement of this bill, giving businesses time to adjust to the new arrangements. Australia's actions in this regard are consistent with international trade law and Australia would not be alone, as senators may recall New Zealand's recent decision announced in its May budget to lift all restrictions on parallel imports.
Another important matter relates to the copying of art work. The Copyright Act permits educational institutions to copy an artistic work when this is incidental to the copying of text in a book. The relevant section 135ZM is ambiguous as to whether the owner of copyright in the artistic work is to receive remuneration for the copying. Both the majority and minority ALP and Democrat committee reports recommended repeal of the section apparently in the belief that this would ensure artists were paid if their work was copied. 
Under the Copyright Act as it currently stands, section 135ZM permits the incidental copying of copyright artistic works during the copying of texts by educational institutions. However, there has been some dispute about whether this means that the owners of copyright in these artistic works are to be paid for this copying, and the government understands to date that they have not received any remuneration for copying under this provision of the licence.
The Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee recommended that the section be repealed. It is arguable that artists are already entitled, however, to payment under the section, but the current provision is unclear and needs to be made unambiguous. If the section were to be repealed, it would be left to the courts to decide whether artists should receive remuneration. The government's amendments will ensure that artists receive remuneration without imposing additional costs on educational institutions. The proposed amendment has the support of VI$COPY.
Finally, I foreshadow an amendment in relation to photographers' rights. The bill presently provides in section 35A that newspaper proprietors may restrain the photocopying of more than 15 per cent of a newspaper or magazine in  relation to the reform of the employed journalists' copyright. All parties agree that the provision is impractical and unworkable and should be deleted. There are also further amendments which propose that the photographer and not the commissioner should own the copyright of the work, except for photographs taken for private or domestic purposes—for example, weddings, family portraits, et cetera—which will remain with the commissioner.
I know from my own experience that photographers have been agitating on this matter for very many years. The reflection of the outcome that I have indicated is something that I think should go a considerable distance to us waging their concerns. The bill presently provides for the commissioner of the photograph to own the copyright. I certainly acknowledge that there are a significant number of very important but discrete ele 
 ments in this legislation which I think do constitute a very significant step forward in copyright reform. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1998-07-11,"—This bill, the  Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 , would probably be better known if we were to call it Senator Richard Alston's `I hate the music industry' bill. This bill proposes to amend the Copyright Act 1968 in a number of ways. The net effect is to allow the parallel importation of CDs.
The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee held an inquiry into this bill. We received a significant number of submissions. The government's argument for the bill, as set out in the proposals—and I am taking some of this from the explanatory memorandum—is essentially that there would be a reduction in the price of CDs to the Australian public. Those estimates by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics vary from $1.60 to $3 and, of course, the ACCC, which certainly seems not 
 to be the consumer's friend, says somewhere between $3 and $10.
The government also put a proposition that there would be, somehow, an increased availability of sound recording titles to Australian consumers; that retail sales would be more competitive with Internet purchasers; and that retailers would have a choice of suppliers due to competition between local and overseas manufacturers and wholesalers. Last but not least, the government said, `To offer some protection for what is going to be a decimated music industry if this legislation is passed, we will have increased penalties for sound recording piracy, et cetera.'
The arguments against the bill are clearly those that go to the effects on the music industry, not the least of which is employment in the industry. Studies have shown that the industry employs a significant number of people. Submissions given to the committee during the conduct of its inquiry estimated that some 5,055 people were employed in live performance and merchandising while somewhere in the order of 4,350 people were employed in music retail, a further 33,500 were artists and some 13,300 were song writers. That is not a small number in terms of employment.
If you look at that in an overall sense, consider the fact that 95 per cent of the CDs sold in Australia are actually produced here. As I say, we have had many arguments put by the government and backed up—I don't know why—by the ACCC, the supposed consumer's friend. The ACCC has really done absolutely nothing to ingratiate itself with the Australian public by its arguments here.
If we go to the legal and constitutional committee's inquiry and deal, in the first instance, with the issue of price, we see the government produced no evidence—not one single scrap of evidence—that would support its argument for a price reduction. But, of course, we did receive many submissions that clearly demonstrated that, at best, we could hope that the prices would remain the same but, at worst, in some instances they may even go up.
No viewpoint was put better than Professor Ron Bewley's. In a submission to the com 
 mittee, he made a very good point with some good examples, saying that there was no evidence that a reduction in import restrictions would increase competition and reduce prices. He said we should consider price comparisons between the US and Australian markets of similar goods. The Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts has come in here on many occasions and said, `Look, it's about the US prices and it's about the prices somewhere else.' When we really look at some goods—and this is what Professor Bewley adequately pointed out—we see similar goods that are available in this country without import restrictions.
 Everybody buys torch batteries. I will quote the prices that relate to the small, AA-size Energiser four pack of batteries. In the US they cost $US3.69 which, converted into Australian dollars in February 1998—it would be a bit more now given the exchange rate and the dollar—was $5.65. But the price in Australia at that time was $7.95. In fact, I bought some the other day and they were about $8.50 or $8.60. Zip disks in a 10 pack cost $US129.99; in Australia, they cost $269. As I said, there are no import restrictions on any of the goods that Professor Bewley compared. All are more expensive, ranging from a low of 30.57 per cent to 40.62 per cent and up as high as 65 per cent.
Did the government endeavour to actually repudiate that? Did it offer any evidence to the contrary? No. In submissions received from CD retailers who import CDs they said the same thing. Did the government counter that? No. Did the ACCC counter it? No. They just maintained the position that somehow we would get cheaper CDs and that, because of the large retailers and more flexibility for retailers, there would be cheaper CDs.
Because of the late hour I do not want to take up too much of the Senate's time, but there are three important points that we need to deal with. Firstly, the government was never able to provide any evidence on prices. Secondly, as to protection for the music industry—which I will go back to in terms of the effect on employment and loss of income—there were many submissions, none of 
 which the government countered on the basis of how you promote the industry, how you look after the artists, how you look after royalties, et cetera.
Another very important aspect, which the government clearly seemed to want to hang its hat on in defence of its taking this move, is its capacity to protect the industry through legislative means—having new laws that applied new penalties. We found a fundamental flaw in this first up. Proposed section 130A, which was supposed to provide protection with regard to infringing copyright, goes to the matter of where CDs may be manufactured overseas and of pirated CDs exported to this country and sold on the market in competition with locally produced goods for which there has been no copyright agreement reached.
The minister—this is even picked up in the library's research document—had convinced those in the industry about the protection mechanism. The Bills Digest, which is from the library's Information Research Service, states:
Proposed section 130A reverses the onus of proof . . . 
That is just how much the minister for communications had convinced the library that that was what he was going to do. He went about the country trying to convince the public. He made a number of radio interviews on a number of occasions. In one interview, John Laws asked him:
Is it true that the Australian Federal Police have advised the Government that there's no way they could cope with the flood of pirated records if the changes were made?
He replied:
No. . . You can increase penalties and you can reverse the onus of proof. . . 
He then goes on ABC Radio National and says:
If anything we will strengthen it, and the reversal of the onus of proof just makes it easier to track down the source of any illegal imports.
Then he says on Sydney 2BL:
We'll be tightening the rules, increasing the penalties, reversing the onus of proof, making it absolutely clear that we won't have a bar of pirated imports.  

Again, in a recent doorstop interview at Treasury Place in Melbourne, he says, while talking about copyright laws:
. . . we will be strengthening them by . . . reversing the onus of proof. . . 
He goes on to make those comments any number of times.	 You may remember that when I asked Senator Alston, who is generally only too willing to give advice when it comes to legal matters, a question in this place about what he means by the reversal of onus of proof—the Attorney-General's Department said that the government will not reverse the onus of proof—he stood up in here and said, `I do not know what you mean by the reversal of onus of proof.' It can be found in the Oxford Dictionary . It is fairly clear.
But, that aside, if you go to this issue of the reversal of onus of proof, as is acknowledged by the Attorney-General's Department, in the bill you still have to prove a case. How do we deal with this issue when we get to the rules of evidence? Again, has the government responded to and answered those questions? No. Currently the music industry, with the laws we have in place, spends millions of dollars. It can be said that those laws are restrictive, but they are restrictive for a very good reason. The only way the music industry has any capacity to really protect itself and to protect the Australian artists, composers and all the people who are employed in this industry is through good, sound copyright laws, which we have, and it still spends millions of dollars defending that industry.
If we remove the parallel import restrictions, we will have imports flooding into this country. We know from Customs the problems that a country like this confronts already in a whole host of areas, let alone the illegal importation of CDs. There is a huge problem. But has the government responded to that, except for Senator Alston to say, `We'll reverse the onus of proof'? He has never acknowledged that, nor has the government. The Attorney-General's Department has because they are contradicting Senator Alston. I am pleased that the Minister for Justice (Senator Vanstone) is in the chamber. She might like to get up and explain how Senator 
 Alston got it so wrong. There is absolutely no capacity for the music industry to protect itself once you remove these laws.
The ACCC did its usual trick. Alan Fels seems to have become an officer of the government to the extent that we may as well not have an ACCC that is supposed to be a competition and consumer council. He does absolutely nothing with regard to that. I raised the question with him about the closure of small business and the impact on small business this will have in terms of distribution. He said, `Oh, no, no impact at all.' He made another suggestion about how you would fund artists. He said, `We'd get Woolworths and Coles and Myers. They'd provide some money for artists.' Yeah, and pigs might fly too!
The minister, the ACCC and that other wonderful organisation that is supposed to support consumers made another claim about the removal of the parallel import restrictions. They kept referring to a US Supreme Court case. I said to the minister, `Look what's happened. Look what has happened in the US. There's been a court case that has overturned their laws.' What they failed to tell the people and what they failed to address was the fact that that court case had nothing to do with the laws that we are proposing to remove here. It was a totally different issue. But of course we did not hear the people who champion the cause such as Alan Fels come out and say, `Oh, no, we were wrong.' No. They wanted to continue the myth that they had perpetrated.
The potential for pirated imports to come into this country is huge. Even Customs admitted—albeit they did not want to admit it but they did admit it—that they will have difficulty covering all of the bases. We know that, as is the case now, whether it is CDs or whether it is other matters. In fact, Customs have actually picked up and stopped very few. They said that they rely totally on the existing music industry for the tracking down of illegal imports. That statement alone says it all. Customs will have no hope.
Why does the government really want to change these laws, apart from the fact that it thinks it is a popular move with the general 
 public over the provision of cheaper CDs? Everybody agrees we would all like cheaper CDs. Nobody would dispute that. But the facts are that there is no evidence that we would get them. Indeed, the indications are that exactly the opposite would happen. There would not be cheaper CDs. We would wipe out our own music industry, which is a valuable export earner for this country, something we should be very proud of and something we should be promoting to a greater extent. But, no, not this government. Give it the old ABC treatment. That is what it wants to do. Here we are at 10 to 11 on a Saturday night. It really does show the disdain that this government has for the music industry, no less than it has for the ABC.
—If you're a farmer you are working all the time. Days of the week don't matter.
—I look forward to the day you work a full day in your life. The whole approach of this government to the music industry with this legislation has the stench of populist politics. I think they might be in the process of wanting to change their mind. It is this pious attitude that they have that will not allow them to do it. It is going to be up to other senators in this place to ensure that Australia does have and continues to have a very successful music industry and that we do have the resources we need to promote it and to make sure that it is a continuing and growing export industry for this country.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-07-11,"—I rise to speak on the Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997  on behalf of the Australian Democrats. Before I begin my remarks on this bill and explain the Democrats' rationale for not supporting the government's agenda in this case, I acknowledge the comments by Senator Murphy and the fact that we are debating this bill at five minutes to 11 on a Saturday night. This bill has been rushed through with undue haste, and I do not know if we will get through the second reading speeches, let alone any kind of analysis or comprehensive debate about the ensuing amendments. So, Senator 
 Murphy, I am with you on that one. It is not my idea of a fun night out, and it is probably a bit ironic, considering some of the issues we are debating.
The Senate is considering provisions which would remove copyright control over importation of legitimate copies of sound recordings. The government has claimed, in pursuing its policy agenda, that it has sought a wide range of views through a cross-section of the Australian music industry and copyright industries, including representatives of performers, record producers, music publishers and consumers. The Senate referred this bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which duly inquired and reported in April this year, and we have paid close attention to the findings and the recommendations of that committee.
The Democrats acknowledge that parallel import restrictions are an ongoing debate in this country, dating back to the Copyright Law Review Committee in 1988. That report was followed by the Prices Surveillance Authority report back in 1990. The Labor government of the day initiated this debate and they courted the issue before deciding to leave it for another time. That was partly due to something that we have readily acknowledged, and that is the complexity of the issue before us.
The Australian Democrats have welcomed at all stages a debate, a discussion and a review of the intellectual property laws in this country and also the participation of Australians in the international debate about property laws. I have said a number of times in this place that our intellectual property laws generally need to be refined to meet the modern day changes, demands and technologies, whether in relation to copyrights, patents or copyright designs, et cetera.
The United States case of Quality King Distributors and L'anza Research International and the Australian case of APRA and Telstra highlight the need for ongoing debate and discussion, and they highlight some of the conflicts within our existing copyright laws. I look forward to the opportunity, perhaps at another time, to discuss the digital agenda issues which, I believe, will expose some of 
 these further problems and provide us with opportunities to fix up our laws for the benefit of the community.
The Democrats position on parallel import provisions in the Copyright Act was put by Senator Andrew Murray in his minority report for the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee considering the Copyright Amendment Bill. He stated:
The Australian Democrats are opposed to oppressive, unnecessarily restrictive, predatory, monopolistic, oligopolistic or cartel-like market behaviour which can result from abuse of the protection afforded by copyright law.
Since then, the sound recording bill was also referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. In that report, I concluded on behalf of the Democrats:
The Australian Democrats recommend this legislation be rejected on the grounds that the projected benefits have not been established or are unlikely to be achieved.
I acknowledge this was a complex decision because the Democrats are very conscious of the need for territorial distinctions in a number of areas and the specific advantages of being Australian and having a distinctly Australian culture. However, we are also aware that we have to balance that up with the potential benefits that can follow globalisation of our economy through cheaper imports and more efficient allocation of the world's resources—hopefully for a greener and sustainable future.
The Democrats are also aware of the potential adverse effects of globalisation on some sections of our community and, often, the failure of governments to equitably share the benefits of globalisation. When this issue came to the Senate, we observed the opposition's position, which seemed a very simple one at the time. It was to simply oppose the legislation, but the Democrats confronted this with an open mind. We endeavoured to get to the bottom of this debate and worked very hard to expand it into the broader community.
It was a very wide-ranging consultation process which attracted considerable community attention. We also opened this up through an on-line consultation process, and 
 the responses here were quite significant and exposed what people considered were good and bad aspects of the bill. We were particularly sensitive in this process to the number of responses, on all sides of the debate, which said that they want to see more of an emphasis on new Australian music, whether it is rock-and-roll or whether it is country, and of course there were many laurels for the ABC's Triple J in promoting Australian music.
We made our offices accessible—Senator Bartlett and I in particular—for anyone who wanted to discuss this issue, and the result was quite overwhelming on all sides. We have spoken to just about everyone involved in this area, whether it be the ACA, the ACCC or the range of small, large or independent companies, and I defy anyone to suggest otherwise. This extensive process did highlight the complexity of this debate and the significant effect—and this is something that has not been recognised enough in this is debate—that  new technology is likely to have, not only on the music industry but on other sound recordings. I cannot say this enough: new technology will make this debate potentially redundant in the near future. So those who are relying on parallel import restrictions of sound recordings to make their businesses work need to recognise that this may change in the future, and they will have to work hard to get ready for the future.
I would like to turn now to some general issues in relation to copyright. Firstly, copyright can be argued to be a right but it is also an economic tool to correct market failure. Basically, the legislative theory behind the granting of a temporary copyright monopoly can only be justified to overcome the market failure and ensure the efficient production of more copyright materials. Of course, as with most theories, the reality is a lot more complex. The blind application—and this is what we have seen in most circumstances—of this simple theory can have effects across the Australian community and in the existing Australian music industry. It is these effects that we must consider to justify the grant of a parallel import restriction on sound recordings. 
The Democrats are concerned with balancing the public interests in having cheaper sound recordings and making sure that copyright owners, both authors and others, have adequate protection to encourage them and ensure that new materials can be made. The guiding principles should be that the benefits to the community in the granting of the monopoly must outweigh the detriment to the community. We have balanced and weighed up those particular arguments. After considerable thought, the Democrats believe the analysis supporting the government's bill has not taken into account the likely adverse impacts of changing the parallel import restrictions.
From a range of submissions from individuals and representative organisations, both small and large and including independents, particularly in the Australian music industry, it is apparent that Australian artists, record companies, manufacturers and retailers are likely to be adversely affected by this legislation. The government has recognised some of these consequences and identified local manufacturers, sound recording companies and composers as possible losers in this process.
It is also worth noting the recent decision in New Zealand to remove their parallel import restrictions. The New Zealand Institute of Economic Research recognised that there were likely to be significant detrimental impacts as a result of this policy change. For example, they specifically noted the adverse effects on creators by reducing the return to creators, the disincentive to invest in new creations and, of course, the legitimate concern about piracy—an issue which has come through this debate in Australia as well. At the end of the day we say these detriments outweigh the potential benefits.
Other areas of concern for the Democrats include free riding and circumvention of copyright laws, both of which are likely to be detrimental to the Australian music industry. These are all valid concerns and I am sure the government would agree. We do not believe that they have been addressed in this bill.
We believe that strong and enforceable intellectual property laws are necessary. They 
 can attract technology and foreign investment as a basis for economic development. But, where there are no strict international obligations to meet minimum standards, Australians should carefully consider each circumstance and, of course, look to our national interest. That is what we should be looking to. We understand and we have considered these arguments, but we also believe strongly that we should be looking out for ourselves in that marketplace and dealing fairly and equitably with all comers in the marketplace.
The premise of the government's legislation, as referred to by the former speaker, was that removing parallel import provisions will reduce sound recording prices. In relation to CD prices, the Democrats are not satisfied that there is any evidence which conclusively establishes that the price of sound recordings will fall if parallel import restrictions are removed. In fact, the data that was presented to the committee was obscured by different comparisons, the age of the data and a whole range of inconsistencies. This analysis is made more difficult, of course, because of the changing global music industry and pricing differences in different intraterritory regions, as well as discounting across age and music styles. These complexities—and they are complexities—make any assessment of price difference inconclusive. That is certainly something that was very obvious to us in the committee's deliberations and is reflected in the Democrats' dissenting report.
The government seems to be relying on the Prices Surveillance Authority report from 1990 to support the bill. But, unfortunately, the major focus of the PSA report was sound recordings made up mostly of cassette tapes. In 1989 cassette tapes made up 56 per cent of the market compared to 29 per cent for CDs. Of course, in 1998 CDs make up 94 per cent of the market. This is significant, given that the PSA report concluded that Australia remain towards the top of the price range for sound recordings, except in the case of CDs. We also consider that it is significant that the PSA report attracted considerable disagreement about its analysis and findings at the time. So it is by no means a reliable study for this bill.
Interestingly, data presented to the committee showed considerable CD price variation within the Australian market for top-40 release CDs. By way of example, the Spice Girls' Spiceworld could be purchased at Brashs Miranda for $19.95, while the same sound recording at HMV City Sydney was $26.95 and at Sanity Roselands it was $29.95. Similarly, Savage Garden's CD was available at Sanity Roselands for $30.95, CC Music Preston for $29.95 and JB HiFi Heidelberg for only $23.95. So the claimed price drops by government and others of up to $7 seem quite unlikely when you can see the absolute differentiation in prices, not only on an international level, but within the domestic market. If price was the only or the most significant factor in this debate, we believe that consumers would be ringing around for the best prices, and the $10 differences would be crippling those most expensive stores already. So, clearly, price is not the only issue here.
Other data presented to the committee showed price comparisons between Australia and the United States across a range of products, and actually showed that Australian products were generally 30 to 65 per cent more expensive. The significant issue here, of course, is that the United States does have parallel import restrictions in place. Therefore, factors other than parallel import restrictions are involved in the so-called higher prices in Australia compared to the US.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission suggested there was price discrimination, that increased competition would reduce prices and that present prices were the result of monopoly rents. Ron Bewley provided an analysis of the concentration of some Australian industries which showed that the music industry in Australia is not as concentrated as other industries, such as—and I referred to them earlier tonight—the cinema, tea and toothpaste industries which have been considered to be sufficiently competitive even though they are so-called less competitive than the music industry.
The ACCC also referred to the findings of the PSA report in relation to `exceptionally high' company profits of an average return to 
 shareholders' funds of 55.2 per cent in 1989, compared to the company average of 10.9 per cent that year. The ABS actually found that operating profit before tax for record companies as a percentage of total income was in fact 6.1 per cent.
If monopoly profits are being taken, this, yet again, was not established by the committee. The evidence was not definitive because the existing reporting requirements for corporations are not sufficient to give us a clear picture. We acknowledge that. Greater accountability and transparency in corporate accounting is something that the Democrats call for to clear up some of these claims and perhaps give us an insight into the real turnover, profits and finances.
Perhaps the most significant issue in this debate has been Australian culture. We are a distinct group, with the benefits of multiculturalism and a diversity that makes us unique, interesting and creative. The Democrats believe the Australian music industry makes a significant and valuable contribution to our unique culture. But increasing globalisation and the predominance of entertainment from just a few overseas countries is having a direct effect on our culture. We have to balance these effects by promoting Australian culture, including the Australian music industry.
Promoting Australian culture with parallel import restrictions alone clearly is not enough. It is not satisfactory. Other forms of direct industry assistance are needed. This might be assistance targeted at those areas which have a particular need. The Australian content requirements should be reviewed, with the possible introduction of recent release Australian music content requirements. We believe that would be a start. We also advocate touring support, Internet set-ups, point of promotion distribution and anything else which can actually produce effective promotion of Australian music. That is something the Democrats strongly promote.
We are also concerned about the contraction of radio station ownership and the move to syndicated formats, which tend to adversely affect Australian music. I am happy to hear that the government is considering some of 
 these matters now. I assure them that the Democrats are more than happy to provide them with some good ideas on this topic.
The other big issue here is piracy. The Australian Democrats accept that piracy is detrimental to sound recording copyrights. An issue before the committee was the level of piracy and how parallel import restrictions actually reduced piracy. I am concerned that the new technology which allows sound recordings to be stored and reproduced means that copying is likely to become easier to do and harder to detect. This is significant because the bundle of rights that is copyright is not the same as the traded good. The Australian Democrats support measures directed at reducing piracy, particularly electronic piracy.
Royalties are another significant issue. Royalties are the only financial return to Australian artists for their sound recordings. Therefore, the adverse affects on royalties are a serious issue. The Democrats concluded that this is another issue on which this legislation should be rejected. Even though the majority of Australian artists record, manufacture and sell their music in Australia, we are concerned that the removal of parallel import restrictions will open the way for their music to be taken offshore and imported back into Australia. This will undermine their royalty flows. The Australian Consumers Association showed royalties to be around 24 per cent of the cost of a CD in 1997. This is a substantial proportion of the value of a sale and is likely to provide considerable cost benefits if the royalty payment can be reduced or avoided. This bill does not address this issue.
The impact of this bill on jobs remains unclear. The committee heard a high mark of jobs—50,000 jobs—potentially being affected, but we also heard a low mark of around 3,886 jobs. Of course, the true level is somewhere in between. This is an important issue. We know perfectly well that we should not be squandering jobs for the sake of untried economic theories. We should make sure that we are not left with low paid, low skilled jobs when we could have access to better paid, high skilled jobs which will benefit all Australians. 
As a sweetener for this bill, the government has proposed reversing the onus of proof. The evidence before the committee raised considerable doubt as to whether or not this measure would achieve its desired ends.
I have set out the major concerns that the Democrats have with this bill in relation to costs, piracy, royalties and Australian culture. It has been a complex decision, but we have made the correct one. We have concerned ourselves with the likely impacts of technology which will make our decision potentially redundant or irrelevant in the near future. We believe that, on balance, this bill in its present form will not achieve the aims set out by this government. The impact on Australian artists, possible royalty reductions and piracy are significant. For those reasons, we strongly oppose the bill before us and the economic theory on which it is based. I seek leave to incorporate the last remaining paragraphs of my speech if that is acceptable to the chamber.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The specific market conditions, the bill's increased piracy measures and the global actions to reduce piracy are not sufficient, in my opinion, to protect Australian artists' sound recording copyrights and the existing delicate balance relied on by Australian artists to reap the rewards of their copyright are threatened by piracy.
I am concerned that even though the majority of Australian artists record, manufacture and sell their music in Australia, the removal of parallel import restrictions will open the way for their music to be taken offshore and imported back into Australia. This will undermine their royalty flows. The Australian Consumers' Association showed royalties as proportion of the cost of a CD in 1997 to be 24%. This is a substantial proportion of the value of a sale and is likely to provide considerable costs benefits if the royalty payment can be reduced or avoided. This bill does not address this issue.
The Australian Democrats are always reluctant to reverse the onus of proof without some very good reasons. We have not been convinced this measure will stop piracy and we think the plaintiff will still be required to make a case, and will be open to significant penalty for the slightest evidence from the defendant. This does not appear to assist possible plaintiffs.
However, artists and those employed in the Australian music industry need to re-assess their industry 
 in light of the evolving technology to deal with substantial changes just around the corner. I believe these advances will impose change and reform on this industry. These reforms are not distant and the industry at every level must address these changes. The Government has a role in assisting this change, and I hope there will be positive and collaborative move to make Australian music, as a key element of our distinct and unique culture, a success for the future.",SENATE,<title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-07-11,"—The Greens are opposed to the Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 . I am not going to elaborate greatly on the words of the speaker before me or the speaker after me. Being sandwiched between Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Lundy frees me up to be a little bit self-indulgent rather than explanatory. Members opposite will agree that the argument that Senator Stott Despoja has put was extremely enlightening, and I think, from the looks on faces opposite, it may have changed a few minds. I have no doubt that it will be followed by an equally enlightening dissertation from Senator Lundy.
I, like Senator Stott Despoja, was very open minded about this legislation when it hit the decks here last year. We knew it was complex and we knew that it was not the first round. I decided to keep a completely open mind about it, recognising that at the two ends of the debate were, firstly, the carrot of a drop in prices for CDs if the legislation went through, and, secondly, the stick belting the Australian music industry around the head if the legislation went through. It was with those two things in mind that we set out to find out what to do.
The Australian Consumers Association was off the mark very quickly. I find few people more impressive in lobbying than Mara Bun and her associates. They do a phenomenal job for consumers right around this country. They did produce a very compelling case for a fall in prices of CDs were this legislation to get through.
Politics being a matter of the short term, something has happened since then to knock some of the stuffing out of that argument—that is, the fall in the Australian dollar. This means that the comparative gain they were able to put to us in terms of prices if this 
 legislation went through has been somewhat whittled away in the meantime. I recognise that if the dollar goes back up, and if the so-called floodgates are opened and imports are allowed into the country, so the gain to consumers may well increase, too.
On the other hand the very compelling arguments from the music industry—including my good and long-term friend Peter Garrett, but many others, both performers and creators, not to speak of some small retailers as well—that this legislation would have a devastating effect on the home-grown industry had to be taken into account. I was extraordinarily impressed by the genuineness of Mr Ross Gengos, who has Abels Music here in the ACT, and the arguments he put forward against this legislation. They were genuine, they were very compelling and they gave me reassurance that the right thing to do was to block this legislation.
Here was a retailer who felt that the government had got it wrong. Here was a retailer, moreover a home-grown business which puts its money back into the local market, that was not frightened by the argument that to oppose this legislation was simply to support the multinationals. From Peter Garrett—if I can truncate his argument—came the news that performers like him, or bands like Midnight Oil, may get up to $1.70 in royalties per CD under the current circumstances. In other countries it is different. If the CDs were to be produced in Malaysia or Singapore or, more particularly, the Philippines, the return to the Australian performer might be as low as 30c, or even lower. Now that is a dramatic difference.
If we have the imported CDs competing with the Australian CDs successfully, obviously what we are faced with is that the local performers and the creators behind them are going to lose out dramatically. Add to that the concern about piracy and the potential for large numbers of CDs to come into the country, with no stipend at all going to the performers who create the music in this country—none at all. You can see why the home-grown music industry is very worried indeed. 
The argument about multinationals was one that worried me quite a bit, because I am no defender of multinationals. There are too many woodchipping corporations ripping the heartland out of the world heritage forests of Tasmania—and one in particular, North, is about to push into the Jabiluka valley with a uranium mine in the north of this country—for me to want to get very close to corporations with those sorts of scruples. However, we cannot tar them all with the one brush. But when Senator Alston, the minister in charge of this legislation, started to criticise me for lining up on the side of the multinationals, I recognised that the argument might have been very hollow indeed.
We had to try to find somewhere in the world where this issue might already have been run. Norway was the case in point. In between 1963 and 1993, Norway dropped the protection of the local industry. It was found that the local industry did get knocked about, but that the prices did not necessarily fall. So in 1993 Norway reintroduced the prohibition on the easy import of music from elsewhere other than from the European Union.
The proof of the pudding there is that the parliament in Norway, a country with similar circumstances to our own, voted just a couple of months ago to defend the parallel importing arrangements they have in that country and not to change them. The experience they had had in the past did create problems for the industry.
—You're wrong, Bob.
—I am sure the minister, who did not know before but has just checked with his advisers, is the one who is wrong, not me.
—No, you are inventing arguments to support multinationals. You are wrong, just wrong.
—Order!
—In Norway it was the equivalent arch-conservative party that recently made a move on the home-grown music industry. It is extraordinary, isn't it? The problem is that they failed, and they failed miserably in the parliament. It went down by 
 a vote of 66 to 29. I think the margin is not going to be as big here tonight, but I hope it goes the same way because the same arguments do pertain.
—You are supporting the multinationals in the guise of supporting the consumers.
—Let me tell you the thing that impressed me most in all of this: it was the approach to Senator Alston's office last year by my office, and I have no doubt other people—
—Support the bill and the consumers association.
—Order!
—I would not make a CD of it, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I am quite happy if he keeps going. In the approach we made to Senator Alston's office we said, `We think we are listening to the arguments of the local music industry. We'd like the consumers to have the potential for lower prices, but you come up with a package that is going to help the music industry in this country—that really is going to help them. Don't come up with something like those multinationals are talking about, flagged when the Keating government tried this legislation, because they welshed on that. Come up with something that we can see has got teeth in it and is really going to protect the local industry.'
But the government did not; Senator Alston's office has still to come out with such a package. You would have thought that if the government really wanted to win this debate they would have come out with a package that was going to stimulate the Australian music industry which could have, amongst other things, raised the mandatory content of Australian made music going out on the airwaves from radio around this country. But, of course, they did not.
I do not know how Senator Alston runs his office. Maybe he is too busy beating the ABC around the head and trying to scare people about the ABC. I do not know why the office failed to come up with a package. I thought to myself: if Senator Alston, with all the 
 backing of government, really wants this, the government could come up with a package that is going to reassure people like me about the music industry. They did not really try. They came around and asked, `Have you got some ideas, Senator Brown?' and I said, `Well, I have, but I really do not know the industry well enough. You come up with the package that is going to convince us.' But it did not arrive. I can honestly say that that was the clincher. I suspect that Senator Alston simply came up with the economic rationalist doctrine: get rid of any protection, throw it open to the market and, at the same time, pull the rug from under the home-grown industry.
—But you are the ones supporting the multinationals.
—The senator opposite says, `You are supporting the multinationals.' Who is going to make the profits from imported CDs if we open the floodgates? The answer is the multinationals—the ones who operate branches elsewhere as well as those they operate here in Australia. That argument does not hold water.
I want to thank everybody who lobbied me on this. It has been a very difficult matter. From the Australian Consumers Association through to the people in the industry—in all its diversity—the lobbying has been clear and concise. It has been very heartfelt at times, but it was done in good spirit, and it has left me with the very clear idea at the end of the day that I am making the right decision here.
I also want to comment on my home newspaper, the Mercury. A couple of weeks ago, it printed a full-page article against my stand on this issue. A number of letters were sent to the Mercury responding to that article. None of them have been printed. If that were to become the even-handedness with which debates in this country are run, then none of us would be adequately informed or would get a fair go when trying to determine the facts on which to make decisions on important issues like this. As it is, I feel good about backing the Australian industry. I feel good about having made a tough decision which is going to ensure that music and the creative arts—the things that help to make Australia different and that give us pride in this coun 
 try—will be defended. I oppose this legislation and hope that other members of the chamber who may not have made up their minds will go the same way.
Finally, I have discovered that Australian consumers do not mind paying a dollar or two extra to support their industry. They really do not. They can think beyond the dollar being the only measure that is important to this country. It is a pity that Senator Alston and the government were not a little closer to these consumers. They would find out that there are other values in this country besides an open market and the lowest dollar being the determinant of everything that is good, true or valuable for Australians.",SENATE,<title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-07-11,"—I also rise to indicate that the opposition will be opposing the Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 . One of the more interesting observations throughout this debate has been the sheer procrastination of the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) in presenting this bill. Time after time, we have seen it turn up on the Notice Paper  before being shifted down the legislative program. The reason for this is of course that the government did not get it right the first time around, and they are still not getting it right. They are still trying to find ways to make this flawed and faulty—and, in fact, irretrievably bad—policy work. We have watched this legislation moving down the government's program of business to the point where at 11.30 on a Saturday night, on the last day of this sitting, we finally have the opportunity to debate the Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2).
I want to canvass a couple of the features of the legislation. Firstly, there was the shameful attempt by the government to utilise taxpayers' money to fund an information campaign prior to this legislation even being dealt with in this place. The government knew that, if people were asked how they felt about the future of the Australian music industry as compared with the government's unprovable claim that somehow CD prices would drop, a $750,000 campaign would be needed to prop up their assertion. The government needed to 
 spend that amount of taxpayers' money just to give this bill some credibility upon bringing it to this place. The minister has consistently been unable to demonstrate the facts in this debate—even to gain credibility with his own backbench. Who else do we find in the list of people within this information strategy that the government had to target? Senator Kemp, you are on the front bench, but all your backbench members were actually listed by this minister as targets in this information strategy to be funded by taxpayers. Where is the credibility of the policy they are putting forward?
Let us look at who else was targeted within this information strategy: editorial staff of major newspapers and of radio and television stations. There is nothing like running a taxpayer funded campaign to target the means by which we communicate in this country. All this was necessary because this is a flawed policy and it needs all the help it can get.
As we have just heard from Senator Brown in his due consideration of this matter, there was an attempt at negotiations between him and the minister concerning a contemporary music fund and, perhaps, a little bit of industry support designed to offset the more negative effects of parallel importation.
I have no doubt that those discussions were in good faith on both parts, but, once again, the minister failed to deliver. Even his own frontbench, the cabinet, did not find it within their hearts to support a boost to industry development with respect to contemporary music. The minister failed to deliver. Hence, you have already heard from Senator Brown the implications of that failure to deliver. The issue goes on.
As the last vestiges of credibility for Minister Alston slip away, we find now a series of amendments put forward by the minister which seek to address one of the fundamental flaws within the legislation, and I will turn to those throughout my contribution. The fact that these amendments have come up at this point that address some of the highly critical implications of the effect of this bill on our international obligations only serves to highlight once again the fact that it 
 is unworkable and bad for the Australian contemporary music industry.
Turning to the report, as with most contentious bills, we were afforded an opportunity—in fact, it does not always happen with this government; they tend to gag and guillotine debates—to conduct a Senate inquiry with respect to this bill. It is very important to note that the report arising from that inquiry did not enjoy bipartisan support. In fact, the government chose to stand alone with respect to that report. The Labor Party and the Australian Democrats prepared their own report. Some 192 submissions were received by the Senate committee and over 160 opposed the bill. The only real supporters of changing the Copyright Act to allow parallel imports of recorded music were major retail chains like Woolworths, Professor Fels from the ACCC and, not surprisingly, the suitable government departments that were the proponents of this policy shift in the first instance.
There is no broad community or industry support. The majority of submissions expressed the view that this policy is harmful to the industry. What is most critical to understand is that this bill will wipe out the private property rights that exist on hundreds and thousands of musical works. The restriction on parallel imports ensures that those Australians who write and perform unique and original works receive the royalty payments to which they are entitled. This is the principle being undermined with respect to this bill. Despite the simplistic arguments by the minister—the minister for irrelevance on price—our opposition to parallel imports is based on protecting our cultural identity. Along with protecting our cultural identity is the protection of thousands of jobs and thousands of small businesses that rely on that industry.
In challenging the minister's assertions, I would like to first turn to the claim that there is some sort of monopoly. In fact, there are five multinational companies operating. Unlike other areas of distribution of content, at least the parent companies of those five major companies are spread across five different countries. Regardless of that, there are well over 250 independent Australian 
 owned record companies. What sort of monopoly is that? I do not believe one exists. It is a reflection on the minister's adherence to very simplistic mantras. We heard Senator Kemp interjecting earlier. In fact, he sat there and said it is about monopolies. How can it possibly be about monopolies, Minister? It is extremely misleading for you to describe five multinational subsidiaries and 250 Australian record companies as representing a monopoly.
There is also the issue of our international obligations. Australia is a signatory to the Bern convention for the protection of literary and artistic works. We are also signatories to the Rome convention that protects performers and producers of sound recordings. As a member of the World Trade Organisation, we signed the TRIPS agreement on intellectual property rights. I must stress that most other countries have sought stronger controls over intellectual property and copyright. The members of the European Union and North American free trade agreement have already ruled out parallel imports of CDs. Yet this government is going the other way. It is going backwards by trying to wind back copyright protection.
In their scrabbled attempt to try to address the concerns raised, I am sure that, if they were doing their job by the Attorney-General's Department about the potential infringement upon these international conventions, we would see pulled together a series of amendments which would make some pitiful attempt to sharpen up the sanctions in the bill and sharpen up the references to these international conventions to try to, again, scrabble together a bill that has any hope of not being completely torn apart by subsequent legal challenges, if they are successful in getting it through.
This government wants to repeal a system that has allowed Australia to develop an internationally respected music culture. This is what the Australian Music Publishers Association informed the Senate committee:
Copyright cannot be viewed through the narrow perspective of industry protection. It is the lawfully established, internationally accepted way of defining and protecting creative intellectual products . . . the Australian music industry is not seeking protection in the sense of special treatment. It is 
 seeking to operate on exactly the same basis as our competitors in the English speaking world.
In considering the implications of this legislation, the Labor Party looked carefully at inquiries conducted in other nations. In England the Monopolies and Mergers Commission concluded that uncontrolled importation of CDs would result in a worse situation for consumers. They found that the removal of parallel import provisions in the UK would be damaging because of the increased risks of piracy and the threat that weakened copyright protection would cause. A report to the Irish government also concluded that parallel imports would erode the share of revenues returned to local composers, publishers, venues, recording and production companies and record retailers. If this was to happen, then their music industry `will wither and die'.
Most importantly, jobs and prosperity in Ireland were found to be dependent on the protection of intellectual property rights. It is worth pointing out that Ireland—like Australia—has one of the most recognised and respected music industries in the world. It is also worth noting that Ireland looked to Australia for inspiration and guidance on what type of regime to put in place with respect to intellectual property.
I also want to mention Norway. After experimenting with parallel imports, they recently reversed their decision after a trial period which saw a 40 per cent rise in music piracy and the virtual collapse of their industry. Australia must learn from these examples. This government has shown that they will not. They instead choose to remind blind to overwhelming international evidence that this is bad policy.
These examples demonstrate that a number of recognised government inquiries have concluded that strong copyright laws are required in order for music industries to survive and thrive. That is the conclusion. Copyright laws also protect those who have invested in and nurture cultural industries. Major record companies do enjoy a level of prosperity; however, Australia benefits in numerous ways from having internationally successful entertainers and performers.
Then there is the issue of music piracy arising from the uncontrolled imports of CDs. Pirated CDs mean no income for artists, composers or record companies. The Senate inquiries with the Australian Customs Service and the Australasian Mechanical Copyright Owners Society confirmed that parallel imports would make identification and prosecution of pirated music virtually impossible.
To demonstrate the point, in the explanation circulated with the government amendments, they actually try to address the concerns of this nature raised in the Senate inquiry report, but in the pitiful way of propping up the sanctions by a mere 10 per cent in the vain hope that increasing sanctions in what is effectively an unenforceable law will somehow slow what will be a tidal wave of pirated CDs if this legislation is passed.
We know CD piracy is particularly rife in Asia, and Emmanuel Candi from ARIA has pointed out that the sophistication of pirates is so advanced that they the facilities to manufacture CDs in container ships that move up and down coastlines. Yet we are told that this does not pose a threat here.
The Office of Strategic Crime Assessment has forecast an increase in CD piracy due to technological advances and increased skills in avoiding detection. They have told the Minister for Justice and the Attorney-General that there will be an increased demand for criminal enforcement of copyright offences. They also stress that, as piracy is such a lucrative business, the cost of civil action is factored into these people's illegal operations.
The Australian Copyright Council stated that, if this bill proceeds:
It will be much more difficult for copyright owners to initiate a customs seizure of pirate recordings because it will be very difficult to differentiate pirate recordings from non-pirate recordings.
An estimated 20,000 consignments of CDs enter Australia each year. However, the Customs Service does not open or check every container that arrives. Customs inspect an average of two per cent of all cargoes entering Australia. They might check invoices, but they do not have the resources to actually check the containers or boxes.
Senior police officers advised the music industry piracy investigations that `they will not undertake copyright investigations in any circumstances'. If they found any serious breaches, they would refer them to the vastly underresourced Australian Federal Police, whose job it is to investigate major criminal activities. None of these are viable solutions or viable proposals on behalf of the government to deal with the piracy problem.
Music industry piracy investigations have seized 270,000 illegal units. By contrast, the Australian Customs Service seized only 1,000. In fairness, the job of Australian Customs is not to check each and every CD to ascertain if it infringes on licensing agreements. Furthermore, the US administration has urged the Howard government not to allow parallel imports because of the piracy problem, but in true arrogant fashion they are still proceeding.
Before the Senate votes on this issue, we should look very closely at who are the winners and who are the losers from allowing parallel imports of CDs into Australia. The losers list is a long one. It includes the thousands of musicians who play in bands or perform live. Without industry support, the live scene—which employs thousands of Australians directly and indirectly—will suffer. The result is massive job losses, and included are the managers, crew members and roadies who support this industry.
Australian composers and writers of original works need a strong record industry to nurture their intellectual talent. The result of this bill will be less Australian music on the radio and in music stores, and more generic overseas music. Live music venues will suffer. Many of them  will close down as fewer local bands are available and this will in turn force even more people into unemployment.
Manufacturers of compact discs are the losers because 95 per cent of CDs sold here are made here. These manufacturing jobs will go, along with those people employed in graphic design, negative making, printing and the whole chain of events that occurs in the production of a CD. The advertising and marketing of recorded music brings in millions of dollars, and the future of many 
 music publications, video shows and a host of related industries will be at risk.
Then there are record stores. The music retail sector employs thousands of Australians, many of whom are specialist sales people. If this bill is passed, Woolies might add another checkout lane, but it will be at the expense of small and family owned businesses right round the country.
Who are the winners? We know Woolworths will win and a few major retail chains that have the buying power to directly import stock from overseas warehouses. I cannot actually find any other winners. They are the only ones I know. We will just leave it at that.
—What does the Australian Consumer Association say?
—It is a short list. The government interjects across the chamber and comes out with its litanies of monopolies, multinationals and things like that, but let us ask who the winners are in this legislation. We know who it is. It will be Woolies and other major chain stores which have the earning power and capacity to buy the quantities that will allow them theoretically to reduce their prices.
I have deliberately left the issue of CD prices until last, because this debate is about copyright protection and ensuring that composers and performers are not ripped off. As the Australian dollar continues to slide, it is now more expensive to buy CDs from Europe and America than it is to purchase an Australian manufactured CD. If imported CDs are so cheap, perhaps Senator Alston can explain why US and European CDs are selling for between $35 and $40 in Sydney.
While Senator Alston is answering that one, perhaps he could retract the statement that Australians pay more than consumers in Europe and North America for CDs. The claim by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) that under this amendment imported CDs will sell in Woolies for around $24 is patently ignorant and demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of this issue and the economics that traverse it.
The Liberal member for Sturt, Christopher Pyne, let slip on Foxtel on 14 May the real agenda when I asked him what evidence he had to support the claim that CD prices would drop by up to $7. He said that the government's guarantee was based on the fact that Woolies told them so. That is it; that is all the evidence they have. That is what this legislation is based on, and the whole credibility of the government's claim that somehow the  Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997  will result in some benefit for consumers is based on a Woolies say-so to the PM. Well, well, well! Once again we have very sophisticated policy making on behalf of this intellectually deficient Minister Alston.
There will be no winners from the government's proposals. Consumers will not enjoy cheaper prices. Small retailers will be squeezed out and investment in Australian music will decline and jobs will be lost. Like musicians and composers in New Zealand, Australian musicians and composers will migrate to countries that reward creativity with strong and effective intellectual property laws.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-07-11,"—I have been listening to the contributions on the Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 , including those made by Senator Lundy, Senator Brown, Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Murphy. They have put forward the case why this bill should not be passed, because the evidence quite clearly is against the passing of this bill. If you look at the argument put against that made by the senators I have mentioned, you have to go to the second reading speech. The second reading speech, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, is that speech which underpins this bill—it sets out the logic, if you like; it sets out the reasons; it sets out the basis upon which the government is putting forward its case—and on the first page it states:
At present, the provisions of the Copyright Act can be used by the owners of copyright in sound recordings to stop anyone else importing copies of their sound recordings.
What is wrong with having an ability to stop somebody else from selling your goods? Is the government's proposition that the present 
 law which stops people from selling cars belonging to other people should be repealed, that people should be able to sell the cars of others?
We are looking in this bill at people who write music, who discover music and who add music to our culture. They also expect to get a return from their efforts. They have to go and earn their money. Their money is not determined beforehand, as is the pay of everybody in the well of this chamber. Everybody here gets a regular pay from the resources of the Commonwealth, and that gives a bedding to those people who are in the well of this chamber. We do not feel the cold hand of doubt as to whether or not we are going to earn some money from the abilities that we may have.
This bill must be approached on the basis that we are people who are well paid, regularly paid and paid according to an act and that we do not have to worry about going out and earning our own living. The Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) will remember those hard days when his ability, which was considerable, was the basis upon which he earned his fees, not a regular payment according to a program set down by a tribunal.
—He has had a hard day today.
—He has had a very hard day.
—I made real money in those days.
—I quoted Charles Dickens the other night, and I think it is proper that I quote him again tonight, because he points out the tragedy where people are not able to get a full return for the efforts they have put into their writing.
Senator Sherry interjecting—
—Perhaps the Romans and the Greeks denied them this. This was the speech that Charles Dickens made—and I referred to this the other night—when a banquet was held in honour of the great man at Hartford on 7 February 1842 when copyright law was not as progressive as it is now and when people were not seeking to turn it 
 back, as this bill attempts to do tonight. Charles Dickens had this to say when he was talking about Sir Walter Scott, who was a great writer:
It was well observed the other night by a beautiful speaker, whose words went to the heart of every man who heard him, that if there had existed any law in this respect, Scott might not have sunk beneath the mighty pressure on his brain, but might have lived to add new creatures of his fancy to the crowd which swarm about you in your summer walks and gather round your winter evening hearths.
That is what we are protecting here. Those people who will listen to music written by Australians, as they take their summer walks and gather round their winter hearths, and those people who have that mighty pressure imposed on their brains, as Charles Dickens would say, and who give us those pleasures should be properly rewarded.
The minister might well find on re-reading this second reading speech that this harsh statement should be put aside. The statement says, and I will repeat it:
At present, the provisions of the Copyright Act can be used by the owners of copyright in sound recordings to stop anyone else importing copies of their sound recordings.
It seems to me to be very reasonable that people should be able to earn money from their intellectual efforts. They do not have the comfort of being paid under a system which returns them a salary, no matter how and to what degree they use their brains. Intellectual property is perhaps the most need of protection in this day and age as new technology comes on board and it is only proper that we have every regard we can for it.
Further on in the second reading speech the government goes into its justification for this bill when it says:
Concerns have long been held that the importation provisions of the Copyright Act have been used to obtain higher prices for records and CDs than those prevailing in some other countries, notably the USA.
As has been said tonight by many speakers, nobody can resist and oppose a system that returns lower prices for anything, as long as all other relevant matters are taken into account. For example, in the Telstra bill that 
 we discussed earlier in the day, this was said on page 14 of the second reading speech:
Telstra has a vital continuing strategic role in the national economy. Australia's long term national interest therefore demands that it not simply be sold off to the highest bidder but that it remains an Australian owned and Australian controlled corporation.
The government is saying there that there is more to be taken into account than simply matters of price and that matters such as the strategic interests of the national economy temper the enthusiasm we all have to get lower prices in. And it is the same here. Simply looking at price is not sufficient. The evidence quoted in the second reading speech is that concerns were raised by the Copyright Law Review Committee on which it reported in 1988. That is a decade ago.
In a matter as vital as this, you would expect more recent evidence than that, so you look for what this more recent evidence is. The second reading speech goes on to say that the Copyright Law Review Committee was followed by an inquiry into the prices of sound recordings by the then Prices Surveillance Authority in 1990—eight years ago. It says:
The PSA found that prices of sound recordings were unreasonably high in Australia and recommended either partial or full removal of copyright control over importation of legitimate copies, thereby introducing direct competition as a mechanism for reducing prices.
That is eight years ago. The second reading speech goes on to say that in the meantime the Labor government did not do anything and that that took up some time. And now we come to the present position. The government faces up to that and says it will do something about it, but it will not do anything without regard to possible changes in market behaviour since 1990, which is a reasonable point. There is no evidence produced, except the comment that:
In our election commitments we said we would consult the industry and the community on the most effective means of lowering prices for music CDs, and we have done so.
The result of that is it is not detailed, except in terms of conclusions without any evidence to support those conclusions.
What happened, amongst other things, is that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee conducted an inquiry into this. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that is perhaps one of the most prestigious committees in this parliament. The majority came back with a report which says that this bill ought be passed. That is a reasonable proposition, if the evidence is there. But if you look at the conclusion and recommendations in chapter 5 of the majority report you will find a couple of comments that give some concern. For example, one is in paragraph 5.18 which says:
Nevertheless, the Committee—
that is, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee—
sees the possible merit in an inquiry which establishes the economics and `work practices' of the industry more definitively and in more detail. Such an inquiry, by an organisation such as the Productivity Commission, would provide useful information in any discussion of the need for a music industry policy as advocated by some who provided evidence to the committee.
So here we have a report which says that we really need more evidence but which then, having said that, goes ahead and draws a conclusion. The majority report has this to say at paragraph 5.19:
The Committee received much evidence on the potential effect of the Bill on Australian composers.
I love my Australian music, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I take it that you do too.
—What's your favourite, Barney?
—I have a lot of favourites, but I mention two of our national songs, the national anthem and Waltzing Matilda . They are songs that everybody in Australia would know. Haven't we got some pride in them?
—What about contemporary songs?
—There are a lot of contemporary groups. On your next trip through Melbourne, I will take you up to my son's rooms. He has got lots and lots of these things. He is very proud of them. He does not 
 mind paying a reasonable price. I will just read this again:
The committee received much evidence on the potential effect of the bill on Australian composers.
You have heard that evidence being related by speakers before me. It goes on:
With some exceptions, the majority of royalties received by Australian composers are derived from recordings of their work by Australian artists, usually the bands of which they are members. These recordings will usually not be internationally released. In only a small number of cases will Australian recordings be made overseas and then imported into Australia.
The point that was made by the people who gave evidence to the committee was that, unless you had a local music industry that was able to make CDs on which their music was recorded, they were not able to get time on the air, whether through radio or television, and then perhaps go on to be known as great artists around the world. That is the point that was made. Yet this conclusion by the majority does not address that point. It simply gets over it by going on to say in the next paragraph, 5.20:
Falls in royalty income as a result of lower-priced CDs are likely to be compensated through increased sales.
The difficulty with all this is that what is being looked at here is policy and a particular attitude to things, and that is fair enough. Paragraph 5.2 of the conclusions of the majority says this:
In principle and in practice, competitive markets yield the best possible prices for consumers.
Then it quotes the Australian Chamber of Commerce. Of course the Australian Chamber of Commerce is going to take a particular approach and of course there is a principle that people might want to follow. If you want to follow a particular economic theory, or a theory in anything, fair enough. But the test should be applied, and the test is the evidence. How does the principle face up in the light of the evidence?
The United States is a place from which music, art, films and matters of the soul generally pour in great abundance. It is very interesting to look at what they say. The chairman of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, Senator Eric 
 Abetz, received a letter from Genta Hawkins Holmes, the US ambassador. She addressed it to `Senator the Right Honourable Eric Abetz, Chairman, Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee.' She made some comments and she said she would circulate a statement, which she did. She gave the committee a statement that has this to say about copyright holders:
In the view of the United States, elimination of the ability of the copyright holder to control parallel importation of their work is contrary to the basic structure of international copyright protection where protection within each country is granted by the country's laws and limited geographically to its borders.
She is saying, `Don't go down the path that this bill goes down.' The statement continues:
The United States maintains that price-distorting practices in the manufacturing, distribution and retail industries that are based on anti-competitive practices should be addressed through anti-competition laws rather than through the unrelated act of lowering the level of protection provided to the copyright holders.
That is from what is clearly the most successful country in the world, the country that dominates culture, and that is its approach. It says, `Don't go down the path of this bill.'
In the closing minutes of my address, I would like to say something about the people from the Attorney-General's Department who have worked hard on this for many years now. I see some of them here. They are deserving of great commendation for the work they have done. They have not had success in the sense of getting the bill on the statute books, and I hope they do not tonight. I know they are simply carrying out policy and they have done a lot of work, but in the end, in spite of all that good work and in spite of all the deeply felt and deeply held beliefs that the government has, the evidence in this matter is against this bill going through. If it did go through, it would be unfair on those people who have to face the uncertainty of earning their living. In a certain sense, we earn our living in a very easy way. Perhaps it is not so easy over the last couple of days, but at least it is regular. These people's income is not regular, and their intellectual property should be protected.

Sunday, 12 July 1998",SENATE,<title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-07-11,"—Senator Cooney says that the work is regular. He should speak for himself. It is a bit different being a minor party senator in a state like Western Australia. However, I understand what he means, that the income comes at a regular rate.
Tonight we are talking about the  Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 , a very important issue. It is not a very large bill. As bills go it is a very short bill, but it is a bill which has generated a great deal of community concern, especially from young people and from the music industry. It deals with issues of cultural importance and these often get left out of the economic rationalist equation. Economic rationalism deals with free trade, competition policy and all those things that are pushing a lot of people's buttons at the moment. One example in recent times has been the level of concern and the furore that occurred as a result of a decision in the courts relating to the New Zealand trade treaty agreement. It was not a furore caused by the court decision but rather a concern about the impact of those treaty decisions on legal frameworks within Australia and New Zealand and the impact on local content and so on.
I bring this up because culture really does get left out in a lot of these considerations of so-called free trade. We know that in the negotiations currently for the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, culture does not get a guernsey. Theoretically, if the Multilateral Agreement on Investment is signed then we may find that on issues of culture, music, theatre and other forms of culture in Australia we are unable to come to a situation where we can continue to develop and nurture Australian culture and Australian industry in cultural areas.
I am not going to go into the history of this issue of parallel imports and CDs over the last 10 years. I am sure my ALP Senate colleagues have the ability to do so and have covered this area in far more detail than I have or would be able to. Suffice to say that no government has yet found an adequate way to address the parallel import issue of 
 sound recordings. Other people, as we know, have tried.
In a nutshell, the copyright regime currently provides that in Australia, under the parallel import restrictions found in sections 37 and 38 of the Copyright Act for musical and literary works, and in sections 102 and 103 for sound recordings, it is illegal to buy copies of CDs from an overseas outlet and market these copies in Australia unless a licence is obtained from the person or company in Australia authorised to assert copyright.
What is the argument under free trade? The free trade argument is that the current system creates a concentration in the market which does not benefit consumers in terms of more open competition. The free trade people also argue that lower prices may stimulate a larger volume of sales and therefore maintain profitability for a large number of players in the industry.
The most consistent argument put forward by competition and consumer lobbies is that, if copyright holders are able to control the distribution chain beyond the factory gate, opportunities are created for monopolistic exploitation. In this way, large multinational record companies can abuse the parallel import restrictions by ensuring that only their subsidiaries in Australia have access to the company's product. Without competition, they are only limited in what they charge by the general price demands of a CD. They are arguing that they might be controlled by the large companies.
Another argument put forward for a lifting of the restrictions is that major record companies in Australia, with licences to import from overseas companies, are not interested in catering for minority tastes and take a long time to fill orders. It has been suggested that record companies are only interested in the mass market. There may be a level of truth in this.
It is important to note that this issue has been a particular thorn in the side of Professor Allan Fels, and he pushed strongly for the lifting of parallel import restrictions when he was head of the Prices Surveillance Authority. 
 During the debate on the issue in 1992 he stated:
The importation provisions of the Copyright Act impose a barrier to free trade. Without such a barrier it would be possible and profitable for parallel importers to import goods into the high price market from the low price market.
Having acknowledged those arguments and perhaps even conceding that parallel import restrictions are not the most efficient or desirable way to support our domestic contemporary music industry, the fact remains that the impact of removing these restrictions would have a number of damaging effects on our cultural integrity. I will give some examples.
There is real concern over the issue of royalties and intellectual property for Australian artists. Royalty payments in Australia tend to be a lot higher than, for example, in the United States. Thus, if an Australian artist's product was sold overseas by the copyright holder and then imported back into Australia, the artist's royalties could be cut by more than half. Things are much worse with overseas remaindered or deleted stock for which artists receive no royalties whatsoever. One of the people who rang me to lobby me was a person who likes to sell compilation albums and would prefer not to pay royalties at all.
Another example was in the 1992 debate on this issue. It was recommended that parallel importation only be permitted from countries which gave adequate copyright protection to address the danger of pirated copies flooding the Australian market. It was accepted that it would be very difficult to distinguish between a legal and an illegal copy. The original government legislation appears to have no restrictions on where imports originate. On the other hand, if the government seeks to amend this bill by restricting the countries from which parallel imports can be received, Australia appears to run the risk of breaching a number of international agreements. Just selecting out countries is obviously going to be a problem.
Another example is that small music retail businesses undoubtedly will be hurt by these changes. It is unlikely that small retailers will be able to compete with the overseas purchas 
 ing power of large overseas chains such as Blockbuster and HMV. In a way, we could simply be shifting the power of multinationals to control the market from the productions sector to the retail sector and we would have gained nothing. At least in the production sector there exists some obligation to invest in the development of Australian talent. In addition, an increase in pirated copies will have a detrimental impact.
The savings figure with regard to latest releases appears to be questionable. The minister has said that the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics has predicted prices would fall by around $1.60 to $3. This is a far cry from the $10 savings figure touted earlier in the debate, but even those lower revised figures may be wrong now due to the recent fall in the Australian dollar.
Comparisons with overseas regimes are often erroneous due to language barriers. For example, Senator Alston has commented that the proposed changes will align us with Japan, our major trading partner. In fact, parallel importation is prohibited from domestically produced sound carriers in Japan which represent over 80 per cent of the market. In Australia, the opposite applies—80 per cent of our market comes from overseas English speaking countries. In addition, it appears that quite a few countries have experienced very negative impacts from removing import restrictions. Other countries such as the United States, the UK, Canada and New Zealand do not allow open slather on parallel imports.
There seems to have been little analysis of the effect of this legislation on Australia's involvement in the World Intellectual Property Organisation, WIPO, or of Australia's international standing as a country with strict copyright laws. There are probably associated international investment issues connected with our reputation as a country which protects intellectual property. There is a real fear that Australia could be used as a platform for copyright fraud.
At present our law enforcement agencies are finding it difficult to stop pirated material. Unless there is a significant increase in resources, not just fines, this will become 
 even more difficult in a free trade environment. There could well be a significant effect on struggling local artists. Quite aside from the fact that record companies may be less able to promote and nurture local talent, bands which produce their own CDs, now the majority, first of all will have to compete with a flood of cheap deleted stock from overseas and, secondly, will probably have fewer small retailers to stock their material and will find it more difficult to convince music supermarkets to accept their product.
The live music touring industry will be affected. Touring seldom takes place without product release and recordings are seldom released without live performances to support them. Any reduced level of recording due to reduced record company investment will result in less touring. This will go on to affect pubs, clubs, the music press, printers and royalties from live performances by grassroots performers who do not receive recording royalties. We already know that a lot of these venues are having difficulty now.
Australia does have a CD manufacturing industry. There are at least eight CD manufacturers in Australia who have invested millions of dollars in plant and equipment. I understand that Sony's plant alone employs 600 people. We have maintained trade barriers to protect other manufacturing sectors. Why are we making an exception here in relation to the music industry? I should make it clear that I have no desire to see oligopolies maintained for multinational record corporations. That has never been my intention. The consultations that I have had with the Western Australian Music Industry Association, with independent musicians and with small recording companies seem to suggest that the multinationals have not done nearly enough to develop the local industry and have benefited more than any other group from the current import restrictions. Various speakers have spoken tonight to mention that they have an obligation to do much better than they are doing now.
However, the issues that I have raised previously point to the fact that a free trade regime is not overall of benefit to Australian society, either. What is certain is that this debate is ensuing without any coherent music 
 industry policy—zero. For example, the grassroots industry has asked for sensible strategies to free independent musicians from the stranglehold of the multinationals. They have asked for, first of all, the provision of interest free loans for bans to produce CDs, assistance with marketing and promotional plans and provision of funding for quality music which may not necessarily have widespread commercial appeal. They have asked for the facilitation of radio stations and record companies committed to the full-scale production and promotion of 10 to 12 emerging acts each year and increasing Australian content on radio—not a lot to expect, I think most people would agree.
I am not claiming that the Greens (WA) or indeed the groups we have liaised with are the font of all wisdom on the development of music policy. I am sure that a whole range of music industry policy initiatives would come to light if input was invited from the industry and the community. I acknowledge that the ALP has committed to a number of very positive initiatives in recent weeks. However, one thing is certain: Senator Alston would have spent his time in a far more productive fashion over the last 12 months if he had concentrated on proactively assisting the Australian music industry, rather than waging a full-scale battle against it. We have to work cooperatively with industry. Simply waging a war on it is not going to help. There are some real issues in  relation to assistance for the small players in Australian industry. This bill, unfortunately, does not solve their problems and does not, we believe, bring a net benefit to the Australian music industry.",SENATE,<title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1998-07-11,"—I have listened to this debate for almost an hour. I think it is an hour—
—One hundred minutes, actually.
—Yes.
—It seemed longer.
—No. A number of the contributions were very worth while. Of course, the nature of the subject as such is that people cannot avoid dealing with the particular issues and if they have a particular 
 point of view they will repeat what others have said. I was very interested in Senator Cooney's remarks about the letter that was sent to the chairman of the committee, Senator Eric Abetz, and the view that was taken in that letter about whether the use of copyright law to prohibit parallel importing and give distributors exclusive rights is an inappropriate use of copyright law—whether the copyright law should be used as a trade barrier. I wonder whether to use the copyright law for that purpose is an appropriate tool, because copyright law is intended to be used to protect the ideas of the creators. Despite the presentation given by Senator Cooney, the question is whether it was ever intended that copyright law should be used for that purpose.
Time is at a premium, and I believe that Senator Alston wants to respond to a number of matters that have been raised in the debate. I will allow him to do that by not saying much more, other than that I have studied all angles of this matter—from the consumer side and from the recording side—and a number of other aspects as well. I am conscious of the points that have been made by ARIA, for example, but I am particularly conscious of points that have been made by the Consumers Association. Of course I am also conscious of points that were made by Allan Fels. I am not convinced that viewpoints from that source are necessarily all-inclusive. I heard somebody talk about economic rationalism—it might have been Senator Brown—and I understand the point. But I did listen closely to what the Consumers Association and other organisations that have been in touch with me have said. I have also had the opportunity of talking to a number of musicians. On balance at this juncture, unless the minister convinces me otherwise, I will be supporting the bill.",SENATE,<title>COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-07-11,"—Given the time, I will not speak for long. I would simply like to reiterate how crucial this legislation, the Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 , is and that it should be voted against. I am probably one of the few people in this place who has actually signed a recording contract with a record company as a musician. It is no great secret that I did not become an internationally 
 renowned superstar, and that in itself probably gives me good grounds to look for opportunities to kick multinational record companies in the head, because they did not give me the chance to have the fame that was rightfully mine.
In that sense, I probably came to this legislation thinking it was a good idea—cheaper CDs and wreaking my revenge on the multinationals. But, having sat through almost all the committee hearings and having read every single submission, I was particularly impressed by the evidence from the grassroots musicians, the small record companies and the independent companies. It is not the multinationals that will suffer if this legislation goes through; it will be the grassroots musicians and those who are most responsible for developing music in this country and keeping it fresh, vibrant, growing, earning export dollars and generating a great cultural asset for our nation. The people least likely to suffer are the multinationals. It may be that their overseas arms will get a bit more money than their Australian based sections, but they will be able to adjust. The local industry, the local labels and the local musicians are the ones that will suffer.
The other part of this is that there are no guarantees that CDs will be cheaper. The suggestion that Australian CDs are dearer than those in most other countries in the world is simply not correct. If this legislation goes through, it is potentially a major disaster for the Australian music industry.
—Senator Faulkner.
—Yes.
—You are walking between me and Senator Bartlett.
—I know that.
—Senator Faulkner!
—This isn't the only aspect that is involved, and there are other issues the industry needs to address. Technological change will mean major challenges for that industry in the near future, and more media support and more radio support for new 
 Australian music of all varieties is desperately needed. But that is no excuse for bringing down such a major negative impact as this bill will provide if it goes through.
As I said, in listening to all the evidence provided to what was a very extensive committee hearing, the most impressive thing was the unanimity of view from people at all levels of the industry—all those who actually know how it works—about how much damage this legislation will cause if it goes through. I urge the Senate to make sure that it does not go through. It will be not a kick in the teeth for multinationals; it will be a kick in the teeth for Australian music.
—Minister?
—Madam Deputy President—
—Madam Deputy President, on a point of order: Senator Faulkner walked between the speaker and the chair. I called him to order and he disobeyed my calling to order. I would ask you to report that to the President because I find the behaviour in the chamber is degenerating. It does not matter what time it is. I found his behaviour unacceptable and I would ask you to report that to the President.
—I will take that on board.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1998-07-11,"—In the four minutes that I have left, could I firstly indicate that  the government is very concerned to ensure that there are no transitional difficulties that might result from the introduction of this legislation, the Copyright Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 . We do not believe there will be, but, given the ferocity of the scare campaign that has been run by the multinational companies and their propensity to scale back the very meagre assistance that they already give, I simply confirm for the public record that if the legislation is passed the government will introduce a $10 million music industry package. This package will 
 provide initiatives to help distribution of bands on the Internet and development for travel—for touring and for festivals. We will extend the Contemporary Music Export Fund and there will be a business development support program to assist with business plans, to assist in promotion and to assist in travel to regional areas, and there will be pilot programs conducted in Tasmania and South Australia. I also table some documents. Let me just say—
—No, hang on.
—The minister can table documents.
—We do not accept the proposition that independents will not benefit from this legislation. It is the multinationals which have put so little back into the country. There are very many independent artists who will benefit very substantially. There are very many independent record companies as well as retail chains who fervently believe that prices will fall dramatically.
I am amazed to hear that Senator Bartlett could have sat through committee hearings and not taken any notice of people like Phil Dwyer, who acts for very many independent record artists, and heard his stories about the difficulties imposed by the multinationals. You ought to know what happened to Savage Garden. You ought to know that Savage Garden had to rely on independents and got no assistance at all from the multinationals.
You should also know what the evidence from the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, the Australian Consumers Association and the ACCC is in relation to the extraordinary high price of CDs in comparison with the rest of the world. I am surprised you have never been outside Australia. It is a great shame that you have not looked at comparative record prices. You ought to know that sales of CDs in this country are falling quite significantly because people are purchasing on the Internet and waiting until they travel overseas.
There is a lot to be said for freeing up the industry in ways that will completely protect the copyright of Australian artists. Indeed, there is no basis for believing that they will 
 be jeopardised unless they consent to their records being sold offshore and released simultaneously with the domestic release. That simply does not happen. Ninety per cent of sales occur in the first three months and hardly any records are sold overseas in that period of time. Maybe the Peter Garretts of this world are big enough and brash enough to be able to do it, but I can assure you that the vast bulk of Australian artists' work is released domestically and the great bulk of their sales occurs in that first three months.
So there can be no basis for suggesting that somehow Australian artists will get less copyright. Indeed, we have increased the penalties for piracy. We know that piracy is not a problem in developed countries like Australia in any event. You know, however, we have also reversed the onus of proof in terms of the evidentiary onus. It seems to be completely beyond Senator Murphy's ability to distinguish between evidentiary onus and the ultimate onus.
—Order! The time for consideration of the bill has expired.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-07-11,"—Madam President, I am tabling a petition from 65,291 citizens of Werribee, and other interested persons. I am unable to table the petition in the usual way because it is not in the form prescribed by the tabling of petitions under Standing Order No. 70. Given the large number of signatures on the petition, it would have been difficult and time consuming for the petitioners to amend the petition to bring it into conformity.
The petition draws the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and me as Minister for the Environment to the proposal to construct a prescribed waste landfill facility at West Road, Werribee, adjacent to Australian Wetlands Site No. 18.
—Order! There is too much noise in the chamber and too many people moving about.
Senator Carr interjecting—
—Order! Senator Carr, cease interjecting, and will other senators take their seats or leave the chamber.
—I recently met with a delegation of people from Werribee and listened to their concerns about the proposed facility. They were brought to me by the Hon. Barry Jones MP. I recognise that a number of members and senators have been taking an interest in this matter—in particular, I mention Senator Synon, who has been involved with this issue. I am mindful of the proximity of the proposed landfill site to Port Phillip Bay and the Bellarine Peninsula Ramsar wetland. The site is approximately 600 metres 
 from the boundary of the Ramsar site and 3.5 kilometres from the sensitive shore bird habitat areas.
—Order! There are too many senators standing in the chamber. Please leave the chamber or take your seats.
—The Victorian government has responsibility for the management of the Ramsar site. I am advised that an environmental effects statement has been conducted, which concluded that the proposed facility would not significantly impact on ground water or surface water in the vicinity.
The Victorian Environmental Protection Authority's independent evaluation of the potential impact of the proposal on ground water has agreed with the EES findings. I understand that should the proposal proceed the landfill operation would be subject to Victorian EPA controls, including controls to protect the ground water. The advice from my department has been that on the basis of the Victorian assessment there is a low risk of adverse impact to surface water and ground water as a result of the landfill and a correspondingly low risk that the ecological character of the Port Phillip Bay Ramsar site will be adversely affected by the proposal. However, in view of the extraordinary level of public concern as demonstrated by this petition, I have asked for additional advice on the matter and will report further to the Senate in due course.
In conclusion I remind the Senate that the Natural Heritage Trust is funding the preparation of management plans for Ramsar sites, which will enhance management practices and ensure the protection of the biodiversity of Australia's precious wetlands in the future.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Landfill</title>,Adjournment,11,1
