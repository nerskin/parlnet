"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2004-06-22,"—It is appropriate that I foreshadow that the Democrats will be moving amendment (2) on sheet 4278 in this committee stage. As Senator Murray indicated before we adjourned last night, the Democrats want to insist on the amendments which the Senate has made in respect of the schedule dealing with gift deductible recipients. He also indicated that we will be opposing the amendment moved by Senator Sherry in respect of the Constitution Education Fund. The amendment I am foreshadowing is to add nine councils of social service to the list of gift deductible entities.
The reason why we are doing this is that we need to make a point to the government over the course of the next couple of days that the government's response in respect of the whole issue of definition of charities has been quite inadequate. One of the other bills on the list for debate today is the Extension of Charitable Purpose Bill 2004. This bill is all that is left of the government's response to the charities definition inquiry, which reported in 2000. That inquiry, the chamber may recall, was formed as a result of discussions between the Treasurer and the Democrats about the need to properly define what a charity was and to ensure that the 400-year-old definition of `charity' was brought up to date.
One of the areas that pretty much the entire charitable sector disagreed on was the appropriate definition of a charity for the purposes of political activity or lobbying. It is worth noting just how out of touch the government has become on this issue. Indeed, in terms of its original draft charities bill, which came out of part of its response to the charities definition inquiry, the government has thought to curtail the activities that a charity could engage in in lobbying, research and advocacy activities. It was part of what had been a consistent view by government over many years that it did not regard advocacy and research as a legitimate charitable purpose.
The particular approach the government adopted was in complete contrast to a more modern understanding of what was a charity for the purposes of tax law. In fact, it is worth noting that the charities definition inquiry, which was headed by Justice Shepherd, made it quite clear when it said:
The Committee recommends that charities should be permitted to engage in advocacy on behalf of those they benefit. Conduct of this kind should not deny them charitable status even if it involves advocating for a change in law or policy. Submission from both charities and governments have demonstrated that charities are increasingly asked to represent to governments the interests of those they seek to benefit and to contribute to the development and administration of government policies. The Committee considers that the definition of a charity should not prevent these developments as they represent an effective means of delivering outcomes for individuals, charities and governments. 
That was its recommendation, and it is most unfortunate that the government chose not to follow that recommendation through. It is not just that but, in dropping its own charities bill, which was announced in the budget, now there will be no reform at all in this area and charities will be required to continue to rely on an inadequate and ad hoc approach by the Australian Taxation Office.
The Democrats are seeking to move to add to the list of gift deductible entities the most important advocates on behalf of the poor in this country, which is the Australian Council of Social Service and its constituent bodies. It is, in our view, absolutely disappointing that the government has for so long sought to resist the recognition of ACOSS and its constituent bodies as charities and as gift deductible entities. I think it is perfectly reasonable and totally consistent with the view taken by the charities definition inquiry that this parliament should recognise the fact that the work that the Australian Council of Social Service does, and its various constituent bodies, is of a charitable nature. It is work that is for the advocacy of the most poor and disadvantaged in our society. Our parliament should recognise that. It should recognise that those purposes are worth promoting. If the bulk of its expenditure ends up coming back in terms of lobbying on behalf of those people into this place, then that too is worth promoting, because I think we need to be reminded in this place, time and time again, of our responsibilities to ensure that policy is in line with advantaging the poorest and most disadvantaged in our society.
I should also point out that the government's view on advocacy and research is increasingly out of line with what is coming out of the courts. It is worth noting, for example, the case in October 2002 in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal dealing with the tax status of the Australian Conservation Foundation, where Mr Gibson determined that the Australian Conservation Foundation was a charity for the purposes of Victorian taxation law. He made it clear that it is time for governments to come up to speed on these particular issues. He said:
It will I think be obvious that it cannot be said that a charity ceases to be a charity if its activities are predominantly said in some unspecified sense to be “political”. But if the central object of an organisation is to procure a change in the law, at least in a field that is not otherwise charitable, then this object does not fall within any of the four headings of charity that the law recognises and accordingly the organisation cannot be seen as charitable.
He made it quite clear that the evidence showed that because the purposes of the ACF were consistent with national legislation in terms of protecting the environment, obviously it was an organisation which was pursuing purposes which were charitable. I think that approach could certainly be said to apply to ACOSS.
The Democrats commend this amendment to the chamber because we think it is important that this chamber completes the work that the government has failed to carry through, which is to start bringing our definition of `charity' up to date with what it needs to be in the 21st century. We are currently operating off a definition of `charity' which is now some 400 years old. It is time to recognise that times have moved on, the courts have moved on and the whole nature of the work that charities are doing has moved on. Certainly it is time for the government to recognise that its long and consistent campaign to downgrade the importance of research and advocacy in promoting the needs of the poor and disadvantaged in our society needs to end. We need to ensure that the Australian Council of Social Service and its very important work on behalf of the poor and disadvantaged is recognised and that Australians who make contributions towards its work are in themselves recognised through it having deductible gift recipient status.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-06-22,"—You pulled it without me being able to speak against it. I was going to highlight the inconsistency of trying to insert the Australian Republican Movement and the Real Republic Ltd.
—It was inconsistent.
—There is an inconsistent approach, given that we were trying to remove—
—If you two senators wish to have a private conversation together, I recommend that you seek the leave of the house to do that. Otherwise, Senator Sherry, you should address your remarks to me.
—I just wanted to highlight the inconsistency. We are attempting to remove the Australian Constitution Education Fund, basically on the grounds that it is a political front for the monarchist movement.
—It's constitutional.
—The Australian Democrats would not agree to that, I point out, Senator McGauran. Then they were proposing to put in the Australian Republican Movement and the Real Republic Ltd. Turning to the Democrats' second amendment, the Australian Council of Social Service and its state bodies perform an important role as peak bodies for welfare groups in their respective jurisdictions. Whilst ACOSS is principally a lobby or research group, its primary objective is to highlight issues affecting the most vulnerable in our society—arguably a charitable purpose. If providing relief to the poor is considered charity then it is not too much of a stretch to say that arguing for that relief is also charitable. 
The fact that the review into the definition of charities and other organisations recommended extensions to the definition of `charitable purposes' to include organisations such as ACOSS and its state bodies adds weight to providing it with specific listing as a DGR in the tax law. We agree that the Australian Democrats have made the point on a number of occasions, in response to the minister's claim, that we have some 400 years of tradition here and it is time to update the 400 years of English law in the Australian context. That 400 years of law, whilst it might have stood the test of time, was established before even Australia was established as a nation, so there is some updating required. Labor understand the government's concerns that ACOSS may not meet the public fund requirements. Labor consider that this is an administrative issue which can be resolved without the need to oppose the Democrat amendment. Therefore we will support the Democrat amendment.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 7) 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-06-22,"—ACOSS made an application for DGR status in a letter to me dated 19 May 2004. That application is proceeding in the normal way and is being given appropriate consideration, as you would expect with any serious application for DGR status. Given that the government is currently considering ACOSS's application for specific listing—and I had in mind advising the organisation when a decision is made on the issue—my current view is that it is not appropriate to simply have it listed until it has satisfied the various parts of the application that every other DGR applicant must satisfy. The provisions for becoming a DGR deliberately constrain DGR status to a closely targeted subset of charitable and other not-for-profit organisations and, given the targeted nature of the gift provisions, the government's general approach has been to list an organisation specifically only where it does make a direct contribution to the public interest. My colleagues who have made remarks about that may well be correct in that ACOSS does contribute to the public interest, but that is part of the general consideration of the organisation's application.
In addition, as a matter of process and, may I say, good tax administration—something that is constantly urged upon the government—an organisation is generally specifically listed only after it has satisfied the Commissioner of Taxation that it meets certain integrity standards known as the `public fund requirements', which is a process that is very important. It is not just administrative, with due respect; it is integral to ensuring that there is some integrity in the framework of how DGR applications are processed. I am certainly not aware that the commissioner has come to a view about ACOSS. I must say that I have an open mind about whether ACOSS should have DGR status. I am very mindful of the advice I receive, but sometimes I accept it and sometimes I do not, depending on other matters that may be brought to my attention, including submissions made by the organisation. They have made a sound one and quite a comprehensive one.
However, at this stage and for the reason that this very important process has not yet run its course—and when I say `process' I am not talking about ticking boxes; I am talking about the consideration of whether the public fund requirements are met—we are unable to support the Democrat amendment at this time. But we will obviously undertake to consider the matter taking into account the fact that there is Democrat support for this and in fact support from the opposition as well. Obviously I will seek to try to have this matter finalised as soon as possible, but given the way in which it has actually come into the debate I am unable to agree to it on behalf of the government at this time. I would certainly appreciate its not being pressed at this time for those reasons. We will be having a very full debate about the response to the charities inquiry in the course of consideration on that bill; so, although there were some matters raised by previous speakers in relation to charities more generally, I will save my comments until the debate on the later bill. 
 (Senator Lightfoot)—The question is that Democrat amendment (2) on sheet 4278 be agreed to.
Question agreed to. 
—The question now is that the committee does not insist on its amendments disagreed to by the House.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-06-22,"—On behalf of the Australian Labor Party, I am speaking on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2003, so-called. That is my description: the so-called choice of superannuation fund bill. Once again, the Liberal government has introduced a piece of superannuation legislation that, if passed in its current form, is destined to make our superannuation system more difficult for consumers to understand and navigate—much more difficult than the Liberal government has already made the current superannuation system. This is a bad piece of legislation in its detail and construction and particularly in its safeguards to protect consumers that will, for many Australians, negatively affect their retirement savings. The government has carried out this deal with those habitual deal makers and publicity seekers, the Australian Democrats.
This piece of legislation continues a pattern followed by the Liberal government since its election of introducing legislation in a very confused and ad hoc manner in this area, the result of which has been to make the superannuation system even more complicated and more expensive to consumers. You would need a finance degree to understand the Australian superannuation system. This legislation, at least for many Australians, will require them to make so-called choices without the advantage of having a finance degree to carry out what are very important decisions. The principle and concept of choice sounds great, it seems fine when the choices are clearly set out and when they are understood, but this legislation fails because it is unsafe choice. It is deregulation without the necessary consumer safeguards, and choice without the necessary safeguards does not serve the interests of either consumers or the superannuation industry.
Firstly, I acknowledge that for many fund members choice already exists. The so-called choice legislation that we are considering will apply only to employees under federal industrial law and not to those under state industrial law. So when the government talks about choice it is a choice that is being allowed only for federal industrial law employees, and even here it is restricted. The government is allowing the restriction of industrial agreements and workplace agreements. We know that most people have so-called choice when they retire. When they get to retirement they are able to take their lump sum and to pick a provider if they choose to invest that money in an income stream product. 
What we also know is that, within a current superannuation fund, at least 80 per cent of fund members are able to pick an investment choice within that fund. When this general description of choice is used there is some confusion. A considerable majority of Australians can choose an investment within the superannuation fund that they are in at the present time. They can pick a high-growth or high-risk fund, overseas shares, Australian shares, bonds or cash. They have the ability to pick the investment. Most of them do not do it, but they have the ability to do so. But we are talking about the requirement that a substantial proportion of Australians—nine million people—will have to pick a superannuation fund to be a member of.
—That is better than forcing them into one.
—We will get to that in a moment, Senator McGauran. We are talking about the failure to safeguard consumers, about what the Labor Party believe are shortcomings in protecting consumers, particularly from fee rip-offs that occur and we argue will occur more widely, and about the evidence of what happened in the United Kingdom when this approach was tried. A so-called free market, an unregulated market, places huge demands on consumers. They need to have high levels of financial literacy to be able to make an informed choice. Of course, the fact that superannuation is compulsory in the first place is an interesting illustration of market failure. If the market were perfect, then 100 per cent of Australians would have superannuation. The fact is they do not; they never did. At best, the coverage was 40 per cent. We have had to make it compulsory for them to pick up superannuation—a clear market failure—so that some 88 per cent of Australian workers are contributors to superannuation funds. The remaining 12 per cent are under the cut-off point.
One has only to look at those consumers who invested in Commercial Nominees. That was a superannuation fund. Where consumers chose that fund as their preferred fund—because some people do have so-called choice—this was the biggest case of theft and fraud in a superannuation fund in the last 10 years. While they may be the minority, there are, nevertheless, many funds that have very significant exit fees of up to thousands of dollars. If the government were consistent in its ideological position in wanting so-called choice, why does it permit exit fees? They are a barrier to exiting. Most people will not exit a superannuation fund if they have to pay thousands of dollars in penalty exit fees, even if there is a negative return. They will not do it because the penalties are so high. The government will not take up one of the fundamental protections, which is to ban exit fees. They should not be permitted. On the other hand, there are many who do not exercise the right to choose a fund because they do not have the necessary financial literacy to navigate the complexity of the superannuation system or, as I have said, they are trapped by excessive exit fees.
The Liberal legislation that we are considering is unsafe because it is so complex and it does nothing to reduce the bureaucracy and the problems people have in trying to navigate the Australian superannuation system. What will happen is that the millions of Australians who are required to choose a fund will be given a product disclosure statement. They are given the information: it is a 60- to 80-page document. Within that 60- to 80-page document that millions of Australians will now need to read in order to understand how to choose a fund, the fees will be buried somewhere. So Australians will get a 60- to 80-page PDS and, in order to make an informed choice, they will need to understand it. 
Labor argue that there are many Australians who, in the absence of having a finance degree, will find it difficult to understand the PDS document. They will also find it difficult to identify fees, because we do not believe the fee disclosure pages that will be in this 60- to 80-page document will be adequate. And what will be the behavioural response?
—You say, `Force them into a fund they don't understand and leave them there.' That is really clever, that is!
—Let us take up that argument, Senator Campbell. You are still allowing employers to force employees into a fund under AWAs. You are not allowing total choice. If you were consistent in your ideological position, you would not allow employers the right under an Australian workplace agreement to say, `You can't have choice.' You allow an employer a veto within your own choice bill. You are not consistent.
Let us deal with the problems that will occur when millions of Australians cannot understand a 60- to 80-page product disclosure document and identify all the fees and charges that are in there. What will they do? Many of them will do nothing and be in a default fund. That is fine—there is provision there for a default fund—but many of them will think, `I had better get some advice on this; I'll go off to a financial adviser.' This is where we have significant problems with our current system. What the government is proposing will increase the problems that will occur. All the international evidence suggests it will cause significant problems. 
The government are saying that people reading these PDSs and switching from one superannuation fund to another, as they choose, is going to put `downward pressure on prices'. Notice the wording—`downward pressure on prices on fees and charges'. If the government were fair dinkum they would come in here and guarantee that fees and charges will go down. Why won't the government guarantee that fees and charges will go down as a result of the market competition they argue will flower as millions of Australians choose a superannuation fund? Because they know that in the United Kingdom when so-called choice was introduced by the Thatcher Conservative government it was an utter disaster. Like Australia, millions of consumers had to choose a superannuation fund and they found it very difficult to understand the information. Certainly one point that Senator Campbell makes is correct: our disclosure documentation—albeit we think inadequate—will be greater in the Australian jurisdiction than it was in the UK system. But there will still be a significant number of Australians who will find it hard to understand the PDS documents—60 to 80 pages—and they will need to go to an adviser. 
What happens when you go to an adviser in the Australian system? You are charged an additional fee over and above that which you pay at the moment. Labor's contention is that many Australians will pay an additional fee for the advice that they will need to understand the 60- to 80-page document. And that additional fee in the Australian system is usually in the form of a commission payment. Labor has significant concerns with commission based payments and advice. Not only does it add to costs, not reduce costs—because there is an extra cost to the system that is tacked on when you pay for the advice—but commissions are a fundamental conflict of interest. Superannuation advisers are paid out of the commission. Many Australians do not know that. It will be disclosed certainly, there is no argument about that, but disclosed somewhat inadequately. 
What will be the behavioural pattern of the adviser? If the adviser is getting a commission of one per cent on a particular superannuation product and only half a per cent on another product, what are they going to recommend to the consumer? They are going to recommend the product they get the highest commission on. We know they do that at the moment to some extent. I do not suggest that all advisers behave in that way—they do not—but it is a fundamental conflict of interest for commissions to exist in this way in the superannuation system.
That is exactly what happened in the United Kingdom. Whether or not people got full disclosure documents and whether they understood the system, they were advised by commission-driven selling. They found it difficult to understand the superannuation system in the UK, as many do in Australia. They went to an adviser and the adviser said, `Come into this fund, this is a good deal for you,' set it out in writing and the consumer believed them. Of course, the adviser was getting a commission payment—an add-on cost and a fundamental conflict of interest. This is not safe.
In Australia we have a compulsory superannuation system. There are not many like it in the world. The assets of superannuation moneys are certainly considerable, they are for retirement and they are long term. There are not many compulsory financial products. It is not compulsory to have a bank account. There are not many products as complex as superannuation. It is not easy to return a superannuation product five or six years later when you suddenly discover you may have been stung on the fees and charges and commissions. You cannot return the product. You have lost your money; you have been stung. It is a unique financial product: it is for retirement. Knowing the failings of the current system and looking at the evidence overseas, Labor argue that we have to ensure very tough safeguards to have a safe choice regime.
Looking at the comments by Senator Cherry, he said, paraphrasing him, `Look, it doesn't matter; consumers will never understand the disclosure documents.' If Senator Cherry believes that it begs the question: why did they agree at all to this piece of legislation? One of the problems with fee disclosure in the government model is that it does not show the impact of fees over five, 10, 20 or 30 years. If you showed that, you would see—and this is essential for any so-called competitive market—that your fees would add up to $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 over the long-term life of a superannuation product. Labor argues that it is essential for consumers to see that. I think a lot of consumers would say: `I'm going to be paying $40,000, $50,000 or $60,000 in fees over the next 20 or 30 years. I am going to have a really hard look around to make sure that the long-term impact of the fee that I am paying is as low as I can get it.'
I notice the Democrats' Senator Murray says that this cannot be done, it is too hard and that to project forward the impact of fees is just too difficult and confuses people. It is one of the critical failings of the disclosure regime. I do not know whether Senator Murray is listening, but it can be done and it can be done very simply. IFSA, the investment funds association, have argued it cannot be done. In the United Kingdom, where they have just introduced universal projections over the long term, IFSA's counterpart body there has helped develop the compulsory projection of fee model. Yet they argue it cannot be done here. Senator Murray is just plain wrong, and he should have looked around a little harder, particularly at the United Kingdom, with respect to long-term projections of the impact of fees. It can be done simply. It can be done safely. 
I have made some comments about the lack of financial literacy levels and that you do need a finance degree to understand superannuation. The government's own chair appointed to their financial literacy task force, Mr Clitheroe, in reference to this super choice legislation and the regulations, made the point that a substantial proportion of Australians cannot swim between the flags on the beach of superannuation. They cannot even find the beach. This is the environment in which the government are proposing to deregulate superannuation. It needs to be done safely. We also know from the ANZ financial literacy results that, on average, even though the population has a reasonable mathematical skill, applying those skills to the comprehension of financial statements presents some challenges and that the understanding of basic investment fundamentals is very poor. Yet here today in this bill the Liberals and the Democrats are saying: `Go and make these decisions. We know that financial literacy levels are low, but you are going to have to make these decisions.' Hence my argument that many people will do nothing or they will seek the services of an adviser and pay extra in fees and charges. They will pay more, not less. Sure, you can attempt to educate consumers. But, seriously, between now and 1 July next year when this legislation commences are we going to comprehensively make nine million adult Australians in superannuation funds financially literate so that they can understand the 60- to 80-page documents? I suggest that we have got a very big job ahead of us giving everyone in Australia a financial planning degree between now and 1 July next year. It just will not happen.
I have mentioned the exit fees. The Labor Party in a specific amendment will be proposing to ban outright exit fees. They are barriers that should not exist. We believe that commissions should not be permitted in respect of the compulsory nine per cent superannuation guarantee. We think there is a very strong argument they should not be permitted for compulsory superannuation. If the argument from the government is that fees and charges will come down, let us have comprehensive reporting of all the data on fees and charges and commissions so that we can actually see whether the fees and charges come down for every Australian who has got superannuation. I do not believe that claim, but that is what the government is holding up—that all the fees and charges will come down. The financial planners are saying: `We will reduce all our fees and charges. Trust us.' IFSA have made a commitment on behalf of their constituent organisations that, with competition: `All our fees and charges will come down.' The banks have also said it—a rather incredible claim. Let us have every fund in this country report the level of fees, charges and commissions for reporting. With respect to the requirement of reporting of fees, I move my second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion add “but the Senate is of the opinion that a reporting system should be established by the regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), requiring:
	(a)	that all superannuation funds report to APRA:
	(i)	all fees, charges and expenses charged in relation to each individual account paid on super-annuation guarantee contributions, 
	(ii)	all commissions charged in relation to each individual account paid on superannuation guarantee contri-butions,
	(iii)	all fees, charges and expenses charged in relation to each individual account paid on non-superannuation guarantee contri-butions, and
	(iv)	all commissions charged in relation to each individual account paid on all non-superannuation guarantee contributions;
	(b)	that APRA report on a quarterly basis on the APRA website:
	(i)	the total level of superannuation guarantee contributions,
	(ii)	the total level of non-superannuation guarantee contributions, and
	(iii)	the average level of fees and charges per $500 of superannuation guarantee contributions for each individual provider; and
	(c)	that APRA establish a register by provider name, of all superannuation products managed by that provider with a record of all fees, charges, expenses and commissions charged in relation to each product.”
(Time expired) ",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2004-06-22,"—The Democrats will be supporting the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2003 to establish superannuation choice of funds. It has been a very long journey. I should acknowledge the presence of Senator Kemp in the chamber today. From my previous life as an adviser to Senator Lyn Allison, I know Senator Kemp and Senator Allison had innumerable meetings to try to get this legislation forward. Before I go into the details of the bill I will recap some of that history because I think it is very significant. This legislation first came into the parliament in, I think, 1997 and at that stage the Democrats took a position of saying the choice model would need to be extensively amended for it to be acceptable to us. It was reintroduced into parliament in 1999, at which stage there were extensive discussions between Senator Kemp and Senator Allison. Those discussions were incorporated into the bill which was introduced into the parliament in 2002. It is worth pointing out some of the agreements which were made at that stage. However, since then, there has been a further Senate inquiry. Senator Coonan brought forward amendments which were incorporated into the bill as a result of discussions with employers last year, and there have been further amendments moved by the government as a result of discussions with the Democrats over the last couple of weeks.
—That is not quite the full history.
—It is a very long history and it goes back much further, Senator Kemp—I accept that—but I thought going back eight years was far enough. Over the course of those very long and detailed discussions a whole range of concerns which the Democrats have had with the original choice of funds model have been largely allayed. I think a lot of the concerns which Senator Sherry spoke about, which we have shared at various times over the course of the last eight years, have been largely put to bed. I think at this stage, rather than saying this is an unsafe piece of legislation, we can say with a reasonable level of confidence that we have made it as safe as it can be to trust Australians with their own savings. That is really what it comes down to: at what point do you trust Australians with their own savings?
The point is you trust Australians with their own savings when you ensure they have the tools to actually make informed decisions and you ensure that their employers or their unions are appropriately regulated not to be able to improperly influence those decisions. You trust Australians to make their own decisions when you ensure that the regulatory scheme is as solid as you can make it. You make sure that the employee has complete control over what happens to their funds, rather than being influenced in any way by improper or irresponsible advertising. 
I note that Senator Sherry, in his contribution, referred to the experience of the UK. It would be foolish of Australia not to actually learn from the experience of the UK. One of the interesting things about the UK experience which will not be replicated here is the fact that their pensions and superannuation industry has largely evolved from the life insurance industry. One of the key incentives in that particular program for encouraging the various life agents to encourage people to shift around was that they continually got new commissions for people shifting from fund to fund. One of the key things with which they were encouraging people to shift from fund to fund was in fact long-term projections about what their investments would be in those funds. It is rather ironic, given the criticisms we have heard from Senator Sherry and from others in respect of the fee disclosure regime last week, that one of the concerns which was constantly raised was this issue of projections.
What we are trying to ensure here is that we pick up a scheme which actually works for all workers—and workers are in different situations and circumstances. I believe that workers who are in an award based industry fund are probably better off staying in that fund in most cases, although not all. I certainly remember that, when I was researching superannuation in Queensland, the hairdressers award fund in my state had delivered negative returns for each of the previous 10 years that I had reported on. I think the hairdressers in Queensland would have been much better off out of that award fund. Similarly, for many years the transport workers fund in Queensland delivered negative returns, and those workers would have been better off out of that fund. That is replicated by the recent advice from Super Ratings Researcher last week which showed that, by and large, the not-for-profit funds are delivering better products than the for-profit funds. But they have got to be held accountable for that and they are held accountable by ensuring that, where they are not delivering, workers can move out. I think that is very important. That would have ensured that those hairdressers or transport workers in Queensland who were not getting a good deal out of their fund had a place to move to.
When you look at the way that our work force has developed, you see that about 40 per cent of workers are under certified agreements—and, by and large, a certified agreement determines where their superannuation will go. Under the amendments which the Democrats negotiated with the government, a choice by a workplace through a certified agreement is recognised as a valid choice, and that is recognised by legislation, so essentially a collective choice of fund by a workplace recognised by a certified agreement will in fact pick up those 40 per cent of workers who have already chosen what fund they want to go into through their certified agreement. About 20 per cent of workers in Australia are currently covered by a mixture of federal and state awards. Under this legislation, those employees under federal awards will now have the right to choose where their superannuation goes. If they fail to choose where their superannuation is to go, it will default to stay in the award fund. I emphasise that in 2000 the Democrats insisted on that as a key requirement. The government's original ideological proposal to remove superannuation clauses from awards has been trenchantly opposed by the Democrats over the last eight years. 
The third category of workers is the 40 per cent of workers who are award free. At the moment we do not hear much from the Labor Party about this particular group of workers because, being a union based party, the Labor Party constantly forgets about the 80 per cent of workers who are not in unions.
—You do! At the moment and at law the placement of the superannuation of the 40 per cent of workers who are award free is determined by the employer, and that is the actual key issue that we need to deal with. In this legislation we are giving those workers, for the first time, the right to choose their superannuation fund. I think that is a very positive development.
In terms of the other changes which actually try to ensure that this is a safe piece of legislation, as I indicated before, for award based workers the award will be the default fund. That is a very important concession that we won. It also ensures, in the amendments which the government is moving, that a default fund must have a mandated level of minimum insurance cover. This issue has arisen time and time again in the Senate committee hearings. We are trying to ensure that there is a reasonable level of insurance cover for workers, particularly in terms of default funds and particularly as people shift around funds. The Democrats strongly support that. Those amendments are being moved by the government and we thank the government for doing that.
It should also be noted that, in the model that we are developing here today, before employees make a choice, they will be given a standard choice form which will provide them with a clear explanation of what choice is about, what they should look for and where they get further information. It is vitally important in terms of this whole community education program that, as we go through this, we provide as many warnings as we can to consumers about how to avoid the pitfalls which have been problems in other states. The standard choice form, the establishment of a superannuation consumer information centre, the $40 million of education and the simple fee disclosure requirement are all tools which ensure that workers can make an informed choice that actually benefits their retirement savings. The Democrats recognise we have to provide as much protection and assistance to consumers as we possibly can in all of this, but at the end of the day it is still up to the consumer to actually follow that through. The standard choice form, which we insisted on, is a very important part of that education process. 
In addition to that, under the amendments which we are moving today, there will be an absolute prohibition on employers and unions signing up workers to a particular fund. In our view, this is very important because we do not want to have a situation where employers or unions are accepting kickbacks for shifting workers into one fund or another. It is important that as much as possible the choice be left to the employee to make, not to their employer or, in very rare circumstances, their union. I should also note that, under the financial services regulations, anybody other than a registered financial planner giving advice to an employee on superannuation matters is already prohibited. I hope that will be reinforced to both unions and employers as a result of the education campaign. I think those amendments are particularly important.
The amendments will also deal with the issue of monitoring fees and charges raised by Senator Sherry. This is a very important issue and I think it is essential that, in the development of the choice model over the next five years, there is quite detailed reporting and monitoring of fees and charges against the ASIC template. We need to know whether the government's claims that the market can control fees and charges are valid or whether the ALP's claims that fees and charges will go through the roof are valid. The only way to test and validate those claims is to monitor the fees and charges themselves. The government has agreed to do that, and that was announced by the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, yesterday. Legislative amendments to achieve that will be introduced in a subsequent piece of legislation. It is not in this particular piece of legislation because there is the matter of sorting out which is the best regulator to do it, but I accept the government's assurance that that legislation will be brought forward to ensure that that monitoring does in fact occur before 1 July next year. I think it is very important. 
There are two other issues on which we sought agreement from the government, as a result of getting the choice bill up to this stage in the Senate. The first was that of the simple fee disclosure, which was resolved between Senator Murray and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Mr Ross Cameron, last week. That is something which, from going back through my notes, we first put to the government back in 1997. Getting that simple fee disclosure model up has been a very long time coming. How simple is simple is something which there has been a huge argument about and something which I think there will continue to be an argument about. The Democrats adopt the view that simple should be simple and that simple should be as simple as it simply can be. We know from all of the consumer comprehension testing that the more numbers you put on a piece of paper, the more riders you put on it and the more assumptions you put on it the less consumers will understand it, which is why we have gone for the simplest model to give people the information to compare.
I cannot see how adding onto a simple fee disclosure a five-year projection, a 10-year projection and a 30-year projection, plus a first-year projection and a second-year projection, fits within that definition of `simple'. I think it is an oxymoron to suggest that you can have four different scenarios for what `simple' actually means. You lose the notion of `simple' in doing that. That is why, at the end of the day, having looked at the various models and at all the information, the Democrats came to the view that it was best to show a first-year and a second-year cost of a superannuation fund, to give in bold a warning on the simple fee disclosure statement saying that consumers should be aware of the impact of fees over the longer term and to give the tools to ensure consumers can calculate that—referring back to the ASIC web site and to the fees calculators on other web sites as well. That would ensure that consumers would have the tools to follow those issues through. At the end of the day, you can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it drink. You can warn consumers, you can put in place as much disclosure as possible to tweak their interest, but ultimately a consumer has to follow through themselves. That is one thing that we know, at the end of the day, we are letting go a bit in this place.
Superannuation under the previous Labor government was a very paternalistic business. It was the unions and the government telling workers what was best for them—and by and large industry funds have delivered a good product for workers—but at the end of the day I think the sophistication of the Australian work force has moved on just a little bit, and we have to recognise that. The measures we are putting in place today are part of a logical evolution for the Australian work force in giving them a bit more choice about what happens to their superannuation, a bit more control over what happens to their superannuation and, hopefully, a bit more interest in what happens to their superannuation. Trying to get more accountability for the delivery of funds back to members is what this is all about. That is an important development. 
The other thing I note this will do is give employees the right to put their funds in ethical investment. Senator Sherry makes great play out of the fact that 80-odd per cent of funds are now providing investment choice. I looked at the investment choice offered by my fund, and there is usually a fairly simple and arcane choice between low risk, medium risk and high risk. There is not investment choice for me to not have my funds invested in a way which is not ethical. This model will give workers the chance to say: `I don't like the approach of my superannuation fund at all. I want to put my money into an ethical fund.' That is a particular benefit. I note the statement put out yesterday by George Pooley of Australian Ethical Investment. People with long memories would remember that he was involved with the old Insurance and Superannuation Commission. It is worth quoting the statement in the time I have available. Mr Pooley said:
Prior to the historic change announced today, though Australians were forced to save, they had no guarantee they would have any say as to how their superannuation monies would be invested. Those old arrangements could be summed up as follows—you must pool your savings with fellow workers who might have entirely different savings needs and ethical concerns. You must entrust your super savings to persons required by law to act in a manner satisfactory to the Australian Government. If they act in a manner contrary to your personal, financial or ethical interests, you could do nothing.
Until this announcement, though Australians were free to vote for the party of their choice at the ballot box, they had no similar right in regard to investment of their superannuation monies.
Australian Ethical Investment welcomes this change, which will enfranchise millions of Australians with respect to investment choice of fund. With the passage of this Bill, those Australians will be able to express their ethical concerns with their superannuation monies, as well as with their vote.
That statement from Australian Ethical Investment highlights the fact that, in moving to a choice of funds regime, we also say to superannuation funds right across the board that ethical investment is now out there as a significant market factor and a market determinant. I think that should be welcomed by those people who want to see the growth in that very vibrant part of the funds management industry.
In winding up, I note for the record that the amendments the government is bringing forward today also include for the first time the recognition in Australian superannuation law of interdependent relationships. This, again, has been a long-term Democrats campaign, going right back to Senator Sid Spindler in 1995, and I am very pleased to finally see it recognised at law. The interdependent relationships definitions—and I will speak to them in the committee stage—are drawn fairly broadly from New South Wales relationships law and recognition with respect to property. They will ensure that the legal problem of not providing choice to same-sex couples as to where their death benefits go is finally resolved. At the moment the law allows complete choice on death benefits—that is, tax-free choice on death benefits—for superannuation to pass to a person's spouse or to their dependants, and the definition of spouse includes a de facto heterosexual spouse. The Democrats have argued for a long time that that is a piece of social engineering that is too narrow. It is outrageous that the tax office was determining who could and could not get a person's superannuation under the threat of a 15 to 30 per cent tax impost. 
We have argued this case long and hard in this place—I should acknowledge the contribution of my colleague Senator Greig in that regard—and I am pleased that the government has finally accepted a proposal to ensure that interdependent relationships will be recognised. The term `interdependent relationships' will not be one which many people are familiar with, but it is a term which has been recognised in migration law for many years in allowing recognition of same-sex couples.
As I have said, the wording that we have used is drawn from the New South Wales relationships in property law, so it is well recognised also in state law. It ensures that a de facto heterosexual or same-sex couple will be treated on the same basis for the purposes of superannuation and the taxation of superannuation death benefits. That is an enormous achievement in terms of not just human rights but also economic rights, something which I am personally very proud of and which we have worked very hard to get.
I should thank Senator Coonan for the work that she has done to get this amendment to this point. I should note that it does not go far enough, as often reforms do not. You do negotiate; it is not full recognition on the same basis as a married spouse, but that is a matter that we will deal with when we deal with the Marriage Act later this week. I should also note that this reform needs to be extended into other areas of law and we will discuss that in the committee stage. But it is an important reform that will mean that, when this bill gets royal assent, the 15 to 30 per cent tax impost imposed on same-sex couples will be removed and access to death benefits and the choice as to who will get the death benefit from a superannuation fund will be on the same basis as heterosexual couples. That is something that the Democrats are very pleased that we have finally achieved with this bill.
In closing, I thank a number of people. I thank Senator Lyn Allison for the long, hard work she has done on the choice legislation bill on behalf of the Democrats from 1997 through to 2001. I should also acknowledge the work of Senator Coonan and Senator Kemp, who is still in the chamber, in terms of the significant changes they have made to the model over the course of the last seven years. I should also acknowledge the work of our various Democrat advisers—Mr Ley is sitting behind me—who have worked very hard to get the fee disclosure stuff to a point satisfactory to us and the people who have been advising us. I commend this bill to the Senate. It is a very significant advance for workers on a social and economic basis and it shows what can be done when the Senate holds its line and works constructively with the government of the day.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2004-06-22,"—If I had not noticed where Senator Cherry was sitting I might have thought he was actually speaking on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2003 as a government senator and as a member of the Liberal Party. It is interesting—I understand that the Democrats are concerned about the forthcoming election and their lack of electoral support and are desperately trying to find their political relevance in this place by acceding to a whole range of things where previously they have held the line—but really it is quite pathetic for Senator Cherry to come in here and engage in the same sort of union-bashing rhetoric that we hear from the other side of the chamber.
I am sure there are many people in this country, both unionists and non-unionists, who would think none too kindly of the attitude that Senator Cherry has taken. He criticised the ALP, again really sounding more like a government senator, saying we always forget non-unionists when it comes to superannuation. Senator Cherry, perhaps needs reminding who it was that first introduced compulsory superannuation into this country, allowing superannuation to be accessed by working people in this country for the very first time—a policy which enabled working Australians and their families to actually contribute to their retirement savings. Who was it that introduced that? It was a Labor government. It was the Labor Party which actually ensured that superannuation was not only the preserve of high-wealth and high-income earners— 
—Madam Acting Deputy President, is the minister going to shout at me for the entirety of my speech?
 (Senator Knowles)—Order!
—Senator Cherry says I am talking—and I cannot use the word because it was a swear word—but I remind him that, prior to Labor's initiatives in the area of superannuation, superannuation was the preserve in this country of high-wealth individuals—primarily. It was a Labor government that first ensured that superannuation was available to working people and their families. So for the Democrats to come in here and assert that the Labor Party does not care about non-unionists, when it comes to this important area of superannuation, is frankly ridiculous.
Before I go on to the choice of fund issue, I point out that industry funds, which I think Senator Cherry referred to as union funds and which the government regularly refers to as union funds, are, by and large, run by equal numbers of employer and employee representatives. They are not dominated by one side of the industrial divide; they are run cooperatively. It is simply indicative of the government's political agenda, which is now apparently also the Democrats' political agenda, that they are referred to only as union funds.
I turn now to the bill before us and the agreement that the Democrats have now made with the government to pass this legislation. Choice can equal exploitation unless proper safeguards are in place. I think that is well understood in this chamber. It is why, previously, the choice legislation put forward by this government has been voted against by the majority of the chamber. What is needed to ensure that choice is not an equivalent to exploitation is a strong consumer protection regime and a regulatory framework that prevents or minimises exploitation. This legislation fails those tests.
Surely, in the area of superannuation, the primary public policy objectives we have are to ensure the maximisation of the retirement savings of Australians. Surely, that is the primary issue. Unfortunately, the government and the Democrats appear to have lost focus on that primary objective and what we see in the legislation before us is a triumph of ideology over reality. I think the question most Australians are entitled to ask is: why would the government put in place a regime that could lead to a lessening rather than a maximising of people's retirement incomes? Why has the government proceeded down this path? Is it because they think this will really increase retirement savings in this country? Is it because they really think that this will lead to maximisation of people's savings and incomes on retirement? 
No, the government's agenda on this has always been clear: they have always wanted to pander to a certain end of the superannuation industry—to the retail fund end—and they have always wanted to reduce the membership of industry funds. It has been a political agenda from start to finish, not a policy agenda aimed at trying to increase and enhance the retirement savings of Australians. 
I would like to deal with a number of furphies which appear to be both explicit and implicit in some of the contributions of Senator Cherry and also the government's statements on these issues. Firstly, there seems to be an argument, particularly from the other side of the chamber, that this choice of funds is a good thing because it will lead to people getting better returns on their investment. As I understand it, the argument is that people will be able to invest in funds which provide better returns than the industry fund they are in.
There is almost no evidence that that is the case. In fact in the published data over the last four years comparing the returns of funds in different sectors of the industry there appears to be almost no advantage to be gained by going into a retail fund or master trust. Rather, what you do see is an incredible imbalance when it comes to fees and charges. For many of the funds that the government say people should go into there is no increased benefit in terms of increased return, but there is a negative in terms of higher fees and charges. So the argument that this somehow improves people's ability to maximise their savings, on the evidence we have today, is entirely unsupported. The reality is that most industry funds have had comparable or even better returns than many of the other funds in the market at substantially lower cost.
Secondly, the government's position is that fees will go down. As I understand it, their position is that this regime will exert downward pressure on fees. This is simply not borne out by the evidence. In the unregulated sector, particularly the retail sector in this area, we already have higher fees and charges than we do in the industry fund sector. If we look at experiences overseas—and Senator Sherry mentioned the United Kingdom after the Thatcher reforms, where there was a deregulation of this sector—we see that this led to a massive increase in fees and charges. Of course the problem with fees and charges is not just people paying fees and charges this year; the problem is the effect that has long-term effect on their retirement savings. This is something that many Australians do not yet understand—that is, what a one per cent, two per cent or three per cent annual ongoing fee or commission will cost them in terms of their final payout when they retire.
Another area the government have failed to regulate, an area that ought to have been regulated if they were serious about a safe choice regime, is exit fees. These are fees charged when a member seeks to take their money out of one fund and put it into another. The superannuation Senate select committee report last year—or perhaps it was the year before—looked at the portability regulations. There was one submission to the committee which listed an example of excessive exit fees. These range from nine per cent to 93 per cent of the balance in the account. What is the public policy objective in allowing those sorts of exit fees to be retained? There is none. The public policy objective ought to be to ban such exit fees. If the government were really serious about choice and really serious about allowing people to move between funds then they would regulate those fees which act as an effective barrier to portability—that is, exit fees. But the regime in the legislation that the government are putting forward contains no such regulation. The position of the Labor Party, as articulated by the shadow minister in his speech, is that we would ban such exit fees. 
I now want to look more broadly at the whole issue of fees, charges and commissions. I hope those of us in this chamber know that an annual ongoing fee or a percentage based fee can have an extraordinary effect on the income that you receive at retirement. A one or two per cent annual fee can reduce your final retirement income by between 22 and 40 per cent. A five per cent annual fee can reduce it by a huge 60 per cent. One would have thought that, if we were serious about enhancing the savings of Australians and if we were serious about ensuring that they are not exploited by the financial sector, we would do something about regulating these fees to ensure that Australians are not potentially exposed to being ripped off to that sort of extent—a 60 per cent reduction in their final retirement income savings.
I turn now to the issue of financial literacy. Senator Cherry argues that we are going to educate consumers. The unfortunate reality—and we would all probably like it to be different—is that Australians are not particularly good at understanding a lot of information about financial decisions in this area. We have referred to the ANZ survey which found that 56 per cent of people with superannuation—that is, a majority—did not have a good understanding of the fees and charges associated with their investment. Also, 40 per cent of people who had invested in managed funds did not have a good understanding of the fees and charges associated with their investment. The Australian Consumers Association, which gave evidence to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, made the following statement:
We know in Australia, from ASFA-commissioned Ageing Agendas research and from the ANZ financial literacy survey, that consumers struggle to understand fees and commissions on many investment and superannuation products. When ACA and ASIC conducted the financial planning survey, even our panel of experts found it difficult in many cases to try and unravel the fee and cost structures of the plans and investments they were presented with as part of their assessment process.
So the consumer body is telling us that even their experts who were assessing the appropriateness of some of the financial plans presented to them found it difficult to understand fees and charges. The available literature shows that the majority of Australians do not understand this. Yet somehow the Democrats and the government say, `We'll spend a bit of money on literacy and then they'll be able to understand it.' This is tied in with the Democrats' position that the fee disclosure model they have agreed with the government is sufficient. As Senator Cherry himself conceded, it does not look at long-term projections. It does not say to the mums and dads of Australia, `If you go into this fund—which has a one, two or three per cent annual fee on it over the rest of the life of your involvement with it—this is the effect on your payout.' That is not information consumers will have before them. We already know—from some of the statistics I have spoken about and other surveys—that most of them will not understand that anyway, but we are allowing them to be ripped off by some unscrupulous sectors of the market.
Finally and in closing, I want to make some reference to the interdependency amendments that the Democrats have got up. I note that Senator Cherry spoke about this having been around in the immigration area. It certainly has. Again, it is something that was introduced by a Labor government, so I am glad to see the Democrats are yet again building on some of Labor's reforms. The issue of interdependency is an important one and this amendment is an advance but, just because you get one aspect of the bill extracted as your price for doing a deal which could potentially leave many more Australians out of pocket and in a worse financial position, does not mean you should support the legislation. In many ways I think it is too high a price to pay for a victory in one area to allow this piece of legislation to proceed. ",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2004-06-22,"—I rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2003 today because, like Senator Wong, I was a member of the former Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. This issue has been around for a substantial period of time. More importantly, the deal that has been done between the Democrats and the government today allows people who are typically called snake oil salesmen to get their fingers into the pie of superannuation, which they desired to do back in the eighties, when superannuation was not the flavour of the day with the government or the Democrats. At that time, of course, government members, when they were in opposition, bitterly opposed the introduction of superannuation for a broader group of people out there in the work force who for a long time had been denied any access to a reasonable expectation not of a comfortable retirement but of a retirement where they could live with any dignity at all.
Senator Wong covered the issue of literacy and I am going to come back to that because that really goes to the heart and the nub of the problem that many people will be facing out there in the community when they are faced with the issue of choice. But they will be under great pressure from those people who are euphemistically called snake oil salesmen to tumble into products which promise a lot but at the end of the day deliver nothing but despair to people in their retirement. That is not what superannuation is about. Superannuation is about giving people some sort of certainty and dignity in retirement. If the government were genuine about doing something for people—and we are talking about low-income people—then it would have cut the contribution tax rather than cut the superannuation guarantee surcharge to high-income earners in this country. That would have been a positive step for low-income earners. We are talking about the funds that are held in many superannuation funds and currently in many industry funds by low-income earners. It is their one chance to have some sort of dignity in retirement, and that should be protected at all costs.
In casting my mind back, it is interesting to note that some of the points that I have made on this issue have been made for a substantial period of time. Nothing that the Democrats or the government have done here in coming to an arrangement on this issue has changed the substance of the debate. The substance of the debate has not changed at all. If there is to be choice there has to be informed choice, and that has been conceded pretty much across the industry, from my recollection, in the inquiries that have taken place. I want to refer briefly to the Hansard of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation hearing of Thursday, 19 February, held in Sydney. A witness before us, Mr Rankin, who at that stage was the Executive Director of the Institute of Actuaries, said:
... if choice is not properly exercised, there will be no net benefit to the individuals trying to accumulate savings for their retirement, and no ... benefit to the nation.
This is about a net benefit to the individual in their retirement and a net benefit to the nation. If there is poor choice operating then there will be no net benefit to this nation or to individuals at all. He went on to say: 
If choice is poorly exercised, individuals and the nation will both be the losers. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that, without the capacity to make informed choices—that is, without addressing this asymmetry of information problem—people are likely to make poor choices.
It is not that they will not make choices; they will make poor choices, and making poor choices will affect their hope and aspirations to retire with some reasonable dignity. He went on to say:
They will make choices which are either too conservative for their personal circumstances or too risky for their personal circumstances.
So if the government and the Democrats are serious they need to be serious about the problems that confront people in terms of choice. At the same hearing in Sydney—and it was a very useful hearing indeed—Mr Lockery of Towers Perrin gave evidence to the committee. It is interesting to note what he had to say. Talking about the so-called benefits of choice, he spoke about `greater competition leading to improved investment returns and lower administrative costs'. He said:
Indeed, some members of smaller funds may achieve these benefits. On the other hand, we submit that such economic benefits will not be achieved for the vast majority of employees in large employer based or industry funds. Instead, in aggregate such employees are likely to suffer a net economic loss as a result of greater individual choice of superannuation fund.
So, contrary to what the government and the Democrats are trying to do, the introduction of choice is not necessarily the panacea that it is being painted to be—not at all. There is no doubt that, where choice has been available to people, it has not necessarily been accessed very greatly at all—but I will not spend a great deal of time on that.
Superannuation is a retirement benefit and it is a benefit, as I said, that was hard fought for and won, particularly by the trade union movement back in the eighties, which, with the cooperation of the then Hawke government, saw the introduction of superannuation on a more universal basis. I well remember when superannuation was being introduced back in the eighties because at that time I was the secretary of a branch of a major trade union, the SDA, in Queensland. The fighting that went on to get an industry fund up on that occasion—and we ended up with four funds for people to select from in the state of Queensland—was absolutely incredible. People came out of the woodwork to get every dodgy fund that they could recognised by the industrial commission on that occasion. The commission, to their credit, excluded a large number of funds that sought recognition under the award system and left one major industry fund and, at that stage, four minor funds. The commission understood that at the end of the day the superannuation benefit was for the retirement of low-paid workers—it was for their benefit and no-one else's benefit.
The argument that was not really waged in those days but that went to the essence of what the debate was about was that people wanted to get their hands on the huge amounts of money they knew would become available when superannuation became universal in the work force. That is what the people out there who had less than good intentions, as far as I am concerned, wanted. They eyed off the money and determined that there was a real pot of gold waiting for them to get their sticky fingers into. They were excluded. This now looms as their second opportunity to get a share of the pie that they missed out on such a long time ago.
As far as I am concerned there is an overriding moral obligation for those entrusted with the money of those people paying into superannuation funds to try to maximise their return. That is not always possible. However, choice is not or should not be about lining the pockets of some individuals or corporate entities by the use of high management charges, management fees, exit fees and the like. When it comes to the choice model, I have real doubts that those people who are confronted with the necessity of making a choice will be able to make, or will be allowed to make, an informed choice or a real choice, particularly if there is some prodding and pushing because the employer might be getting an advantage out of them being in one fund or another. People say that those things do not happen, but in the real world they do. 
Choice should be about making an informed choice. However, as my colleague Senator Wong alluded to, many people do not have the literacy skills to make such an informed choice. I recall that, when we were doing the inquiry into the choice of fund legislation back in 1998 and earlier, it came out that there was an ABS survey about aspects of literacy. It was on assessed skill levels in Australia in 1996. One could say that this might be a little bit out of date. It may well be, but it is not going to be so much out of date as to be totally useless in this debate. The survey ranked literacy on a basis of levels 1 to 5. There were 2.6 million people who were found to be at level 1 at that stage, which meant that they had very poor literacy skills. Forty-seven per cent of the population surveyed were at levels 1 and 2—that is, they had some or considerable difficulty using many of the printed materials encountered in daily life. That is the problem. These people do not have the skills necessary to make the informed choices. As Senator Wong alluded to, there are those who cannot even make a choice in the proper sense at all because they do not have the skills that are required or are necessary to deal with complex forms. These are people who are deemed to be quite literate people in the first instance.
In an article by Robyn Hartley titled `The social costs of inadequate literacy', a report to an international literacy year symposium in 1989, the author talks about the social costs of the lack of literacy skills. In her article she says:
Even highly literate people have trouble understanding some documents and forms. Those with inadequate literacy skills have no chance of understanding them. Documents which are based on legislation often tend to be particularly obscure.
In the same article, she goes on to say:
However, much still remains to be done. Re-design of forms may well help the majority of people, but those who cannot read will still be unable to cope without assistance.
So we have a real challenge in the choice format that is being brought forward to us because it advocates substantial reading material that people will need to understand such that they supposedly can make a choice. But it is a fact of life that people do not have the skills, capacity and ability to understand the material in the first instance so that they can make an informed choice. Hence they run the risk of putting one of their greatest assets—their superannuation—at the mercy of those people who would like to plunder it for their own financial purposes. This is completely untenable as far as I am concerned and shows just what a shabby deal the Democrats and the government have entered into.
—You don't believe that, Senator Hogg.
—I certain do, Senator Abetz, and I am glad you are here. I do not know whether literacy is one of your greatest skills, but for a large percentage of the Australian population you will find it is not a skill that they have. They have a great deal of difficulty coping with the forms and with the paraphernalia that these companies are able to piece together and present, supposedly as something that is an unbiased and unprejudiced view of the world. Of course, that is the very least that many of these documents contain.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2004-06-22,"—My question is to Senator Hill, the Minister representing the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the minister to Lieutenant Colonel Muggleton's final situation report from Baghdad, dated 17 February 2004, when he informed his chain of command in the Defence organisation of his concerns regarding the United States's treatment of Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison. Does the minister support the concerns raised by Lieutenant Colonel Muggleton and has the Australian government made any formal representations to the United States government about the abuse of prisoners in Iraq to underline those concerns? In particular, has the government impressed upon the US the need for the current investigations into abuses to be comprehensive and thorough? If so, can the minister explain what representations were made and when?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2004-06-22,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I note the word the minister has carefully used that he will `refresh' his memory. Will the minister also undertake to make inquiries of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to determine whether any representations have been made? Does the government propose to make representations to the US government on this matter? Will the minister at least initiate inquiries about the whereabouts and welfare of the 120 Iraqis Australian forces assisted in capturing, to ensure that they have been treated consistent with the Geneva conventions?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-06-22,"—My recollection of what Lieutenant Colonel Muggleton said did not relate to abuses of prisoners in Abu Ghraib. I will refresh my memory but I think that that is the case. In relation to abuses, it is true that they came to the attention of US authorities in January this year as a result of internal information, basically with a military police person bringing forward this information. Investigation was immediately commenced. Shortly thereafter, certain personnel were suspended, an investigation was completed—I should have said that, when they commenced this process, they announced it publicly—and prosecutions have followed. In other words, proper process has promptly taken place after the allegations were brought to the attention of the appropriate authorities. It is therefore the position of the Australian government that the US is handling this matter appropriately and, as I said yesterday, that it certainly does not need lectures from us on the matter.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,answer
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-06-22,"—I think it is about time the Australian Labor Party gave a bit of credit to the United States of America. The United States of America has taken on the greatest load in this task in helping the Iraqis establish their new country and to give them a chance of democracy, a chance of freedom and a chance of a better life, and it has suffered significantly as a result of taking on that responsibility. Over 800 of its military personnel have died and many, many hundreds more have been seriously injured. It is a significant sacrifice to help contribute to a more stable and secure world, and it is something that ought to be recognised by all of us with some appreciation. From a Labor Party that will simply come in here carping about what it sees as inadequate management of a prison system in the environment that existed in Iraq last year, where those prisons were subjected to continual attack, where there were too many prisoners, where there were insufficient facilities, it is an absolute disgrace— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,answer

The truth is that the human consequences that flow from the abuse of alcohol are far greater than the human consequences that flow from obesity ...
Is the Minister aware that alcohol consumption is second only to tobacco as a preventable cause of drug related morbidity and mortality? Is the minister aware that the total cost of abusing legal and illegal drugs was $34.4 billion and that alcohol contributed 22 per cent of this cost? As it is Drug Action Week, can the minister tell the Senate what the government is doing to reduce health, economic and social harms caused by alcohol and drugs?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Health Policy</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2004-06-22,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-06-22,"—I thank Senator Harradine for asking such an important question when there has been a significant focus on one issue over recent days—that is, childhood obesity. There have been some fairly bizarre proposals as to how you might address that. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition, who has suggested that we ban the advertising of food on television, has not addressed the issue of how you define a pie, an apple pie, a cream bun or some of the other fast foods. He has not suggested yet how to do that. I have a responsibility for this when it comes to road safety because he has not addressed how you might blindfold children as you drive past a McDonald's sign or whether we have golden arches that fall down as young children are driven past. That, of course, highlights the absurdity of Mr Latham's new-found interest in public health issues.
But, of course, Senator Harradine is not Mr Latham. He has a serious and long-term interest in these public health issues. The Commonwealth is providing significant funding to the states through the public health outcomes funding agreements, just to mention one of the ways in which the Commonwealth seeks to address the issue of alcohol misuse. Senator Harradine, if I recall correctly, referred to tobacco and alcohol misuse. The Commonwealth through the public health outcomes funding agreements, which are being finalised at the moment, is providing record funding to all the states to invest in campaigns in relation to the reduction of harm and informing people of the risks of alcohol abuse. There will be a community good in that people will be well aware of the risks and those who are subject to those risks will have available to them public health facilities and the funding that is required to ensure that the risks that alcohol poses to the community are minimised.
The Commonwealth has made it quite clear through working with the industry that the way that the industry goes about marketing its products will be given close focus. I understand that the alcohol industry has worked very assiduously over recent months in particular to look at the issue of, for example, prepackaged and premixed drinks. I know that Trish Worth, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, has worked very hard on this issue and that the alcohol industry have responded in a way that brings credit to them in ensuring that those premixed drinks are marketed in a way that do not make them available to younger people in the community. The public health outcomes funding agreements, which are being finalised at the moment, are the significant way in which the Commonwealth directs funding towards that very important issue.

As I have said, the industry itself in response to concerns raised by people such as Trish Worth have put an enormous effort into programs to ensure that underage drinkers and young drinkers get high-quality information about alcohol. I understand that the distilled liquors association is actually investing in excess of $1 million in special programs designed for young drinkers, who are quite often at risk because they lack the experience of older people about the effects of alcohol. In my own area of responsibility, road safety, young people mixing alcohol and the driving of vehicles is of specific concern to the government.

Does the minister agree with the views expressed by Mark Peters, the Sports Commission's CEO, when he claimed to the Senate estimates committee the delays in hearing the French case were the fault of the Court of Arbitration for Sport and, in particular, his statement:
The recent delay is because CAS has not been able to hold its hearing, and that is what we have been waiting for.
Is the minister now aware that the court has written to the chair of the estimates committee strongly refuting that it is to blame for the delay of some 175 days from notification by the Australian Sports Commission of the discoveries to the hearing of the matter?

I ask again: didn't the Sports Commission take 14 weeks to progress from the initial notification of the discoveries at Del Monte to filing the application with the court? Given the minister has confirmed the Sports Commission filed an application with the court that clearly indicated that they were not seeking an urgent hearing into this matter, isn't that evidence of a deliberate attempt to delay? Under those circumstances, what action will the minister take to require Mr Peters to correct his evidence before the estimates committee, or will the court need to raise this as a matter of privilege?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Sport: Drug Testing</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2004-06-22,"—I am delighted that Senator Lundy has been given the right to ask a question on sport. Senator Lundy has been frozen out on a number of issues. Senator Lundy, I am very pleased that you have been given the nod. I also make the point that Senator Lundy would recall—
—Mr President, I wonder if Senator Conroy could be requested to contain himself.
—Senator, I remind you to ignore the interjections and address your remarks through the chair. Senator Conroy, come to order.
—It is always important that these matters be resolved as quickly, as expeditiously, as possible; no-one would argue with that. Clearly a debate has occurred between the Australian Sports Commission and CAS. The Australian Sports Commission has a particular view about the delay of the case and CAS has a different view.
—What is your view?
—Obviously, we would have preferred that the case was heard more quickly. Obviously, we would have preferred that it was dealt with in a more expedient fashion. I am informed that the consistent instruction from the ASC and Cycling Australia to their lawyers was to handle the case as expeditiously as possible. My understanding is that a number of issues arose. The two major issues that took some time to process were the two-week period when the matter was referred to Lausanne by CAS for jurisdictional approval and a further two-week period when the parties were not able to agree on an arbitrator. So I have received an assurance, Senator Lundy, that the ASC did not at any time attempt to delay the process. Similarly, with regard to the allegations that the ASC lawyers did not mark the matter as requiring urgent attention when lodging papers on 10 March 2004, I am assured that this did not represent a delay. This debate will continue but the basic principle of all people involved here is that delays are not acceptable; that would be my view. I do not think, in light of what has now happened, that we should go back over this in great detail, to be quite frank, but I would be very concerned to make sure that any lessons that could be learnt from this are learnt and that the procedures of both the ASC and CAS are such that these types of delays do not occur in the future.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Sport: Drug Testing</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer

Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Question: When did Australian officials in Washington or Canberra first become aware of Red Cross concerns about the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay?
Answer: October 2003.
Question: Who raised these concerns—the Red Cross or representatives of the detained Australians?
Answers: A spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) raised those concerns publicly.
Question: What was the nature of those concerns?
Answer: The ICRC spokesperson was quoted in the press as saying that detainees had suffered a `worrying deterioration' in their `psychological health'. He said the ICRC was concerned `about the impact the seemingly open-ended detention is having on the internees'.
Question: Could the Minister make available to the Senate copies of those reports?
Answer: The Government has never had access to ICRC reports on Guantanamo Bay. In a meeting with the Australian Ambassador in Geneva on 26 May 2004, the ICRC President confirmed the Government's understanding that such reports have been passed to the US in confidence and could not be provided to Australia by the ICRC.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2004-06-22,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Patterson) to questions without notice asked by Senators Forshaw, Collins and Webber today relating to family assistance.
It is very sad that we have now come to the question of the competence in which some of these payments are being delivered. In question times earlier in the last fortnight we have highlighted the nature of these payments and how they are pretty much a crude election bribe by the government rather than a serious attempt to remedy the problems with the family tax system and the debts that it has been generating for families. Now we have the circumstances where Centrelink are making these payments to families who are not eligible and families who, indeed, do not need these funds.
The minister's response today was to simply say that she had made inquiries of Centrelink and that if this was occurring it was fraud. Unfortunately, some of the examples that have come to the opposition are clearly not fraud. There are problems with how Centrelink is administering these payments, and the minister failed to address these issues very seriously. She continues to get up and prattle on about how this gives her another opportunity to outline how the government is bribing Australian families to just cop their riddled family tax debt system for another three years rather than addressing the issues that have been raised.
I say it is sad that the competence of Centrelink comes into question in this way because we all know that Centrelink has been set the task of delivering election bribes on very short notice. We know that they are having difficulties meeting this task. In fact, the minister herself has used it as an excuse for why the department has not been able to respond to questions asked in estimates about the adjustments to the indexation formula that went through with the legislation for these payments. The department set their own deadline; the minister misrepresented the Hansard when she indicated that it was only some tentative time frame. It is quite clear in Hansard that the department indicated that within the week we would have answers about how the indexation formula was meant to be applied. We are still waiting for those answers. More than two weeks later, we are still waiting for those answers. 
—We're still waiting for your policy.
—The minister gets up here and says, as has the senator just now, `But we're waiting for your policy.' The unfortunate fact of life here is that this government will not even produce forward estimates now. No forward estimates are provided in this budget. So much for this charter of budget honesty. The government is withholding information because we are now far more confident that they are trying to claw back payments. They are trying to claw back these family payments that they claim to be delivering now as a wonderful gift to Australian families. Australian families have every reason to be incredibly cynical about this government.
Let us have a look at their record. In the year 2000, pensioners were subjected to the claw back of their pension increases. Their compensation for the increased costs of the GST was clawed back. It was a nasty and cynical ploy then and it remains so with respect to these payments today. But if we look at the last election in relation to the family payments debts, the $1,000 waiver was put into place. But it only lasted in an election year. There was no flexibility; no measure of dealing with these issues year after year until now.
The government have modified their approach this time. Families do not get a $1,000 waiver; they get $600 in advance. But the problem with the advertising program about this is that it does not warn families that they have this $600 in advance. It does not warn them that they have delayed their debt notices until September but, in September, those debt notices will arrive. They will have another $600 to help them to ameliorate those but, if the standard debt of $900 continues, which is the average debt for families, there will not be much left of these wonderful payments that Senator Patterson talks about. She has sought to avoid answering serious questions about the information that this government will not provide so that people can be accountable for their policies. There have been no forward estimates and no answers about how you diddled the indexation formula, yet you have the audacity to get up here and say, `But where are your policies?' It is outrageous.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Taxation: Family Payments</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,speech
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2004-06-22,"—We might well ask: where are your policies? You have spent nearly 8½ years in opposition. This hopeless shadow minister, who is about to trot out of this chamber, has not been able to deliver a policy after eight years in opposition. Off she wanders into the wilderness again. Here we are debating something that we debated last week, and will no doubt debate again before parliament rises for the winter recess. The fact remains that this opposition have been in the opposition chairs for eight long years—and it has not been long enough, let me tell you—and they still have not released a policy.
Today, by way of interjection, Senator Collins screeched, `Two weeks!' Well, let us see whether it is two weeks. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Latham, said to us long before the budget, `Wait until the budget because we don't know what the books look like. After budget week we will release our policies.' That was five weeks ago and there are still no policies. So let us see whether Senator Collins is right when she screeches, `Two weeks!' I cannot believe that for eight years this opposition have been so bereft of policy that they cannot even come up with a family policy.
Last night on the 7.30 Report Mr Latham could not defend their inability to come up with a family policy. He said that it was still being done—still being thought about and still being contemplated, after eight years in opposition. That is in vast contrast to this government, which has provided around two million families—with 3½ million children—with a benefit. By the end of today, about two million families will have received an average payment of $1,200 in their bank accounts. And what happens? The mob on the other side grizzle about it. That is all they can do: complain about it. Why? Firstly, because they did not think of it; and, secondly, they would never be able to afford it because they would never be able to run an economy whereby it was in a strong enough position to return a dividend to Australian families. 
Let us take, for example, an eligible family with four children. They will receive $2,400. And all the opposition can do is say, `There's a problem with it and you shouldn't be getting it.' Why didn't they ever deliver such a policy in 13 years of government? In eight years of opposition they could not do it. This bonus is completely tax free and it is thanks to a strong economy. If this economy had continued the way it was going under Labor, with $96 billion of debt and growing—instead of it being reduced by this government by $70 billion and decreasing—then nothing would have happened for families. They would not have gotten any return whatsoever. This budget is about giving families choices and opportunities. All we hear from this carping opposition is criticism after criticism after criticism.
The new family assistance measures will provide an additional $19.2 billion over five years, and yet the opposition criticise them. It is almost breathtaking how this mob criticise everything while offering nothing as an alternative. One would have thought that, when they have had eight years to contemplate their navels and sulk about being in opposition, by now—X number of weeks or months out from an election—they would have presented an alternative. But, no, even Mr Latham last night continued to say, `We're thinking about it.' I have to say that this is the largest package of assistance ever offered by an Australian government. That makes it even more amazing that the opposition can only sit there and criticise.
If they think that it is inherently wrong for families to get $1,200 then let them come out and say so. If they think they have a better alternative, let us hear it. But let us hear it today. Do not put it off again so that families still do not know what the policy is. After all, it is already five weeks late, seven years late or six years late. Let us hear what your alternative is today. Do not just come in here and criticise in the way that you have for weeks, because it is getting a little bit tiresome and tedious for the Australian people.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2004-06-22,"—Let me remind Senator Knowles and other senators that it was the Hawke Labor government that introduced the system of family allowance and family allowance supplements. When it introduced those payments, the Hawke Labor government gave a massive boost to Australian families. So when Senator Knowles stands up and alleges that nothing was done about family payments, family allowances and so on during the term of the Labor government she is totally wrong. We actually created the system which has since been replaced by the family tax benefits A and B.
Senator Knowles asks, `Where are your policies?' Let me tell you about the policies of this government. What they have done for the last seven years and eight or nine months is rip billions of dollars off the Australian taxpayer. They are the highest taxing government in the history of this country. They have ripped billions out of health, education and so on. Then, a few months before an election, they bring down a budget where they seek to give some of that money back—and they seek to do it in a very rushed manner. This week Australian families who are entitled to receive family tax benefit A are having payments of $600 per eligible child credited to their bank accounts. However, in their mad rush to get this payment into the bank accounts of families so that they can then call an election, hoping to ride in on the back of this, they have actually stuffed it up. Anyone who attended the estimates hearings would have heard the department itself acknowledge that it was going to have massive problems coping with the demand placed upon it administratively to get that money out so quickly. 
—They've done it.
—They have done it, Senator Johnston says. Let me tell you what they have done. I will read to you from an email that I received just yesterday. I can assure you, Senator Johnston, there are many more of these situations. The email is addressed to me. It says:
Hi Michael. Thought I should just let you know about a situation which has just come to my attention which may be of interest to you and Mark Latham. My bank account was suddenly increased by $1,200 on Friday, not $600 as I had been expecting. As I only have one child under 18—both others are nearly 22 and 20 respectively and have full-time taxpaying jobs—I am sure that a government stuff-up has paid me double my entitlement.
She names the bank. She checked this with the bank when she noticed the additional amount credited to her account. She says:
The bank told me I was the second person that day who was overpaid. How many more mistakes have been made? Will they be demanding the money back when they realise their errors? How many people have not been paid their full entitlements?
That was drawn to my attention yesterday. We now know that there are many more situations where the payments being made to families are incorrect. When I asked Senator Patterson a specific question today about this issue—not about whether they should get the $600 but about what the government is going to do in situations where it has actually paid more into the accounts of families than they are legitimately entitled to—what was her response? She stood there and accused Australian families in that situation of committing a fraud, of not telling Centrelink of changes in their circumstances. In the situation that has been drawn to my attention—and we have got others—there has been no change in the circumstances of these families at all.
—You're not being honest and you know it.
—It is true, because it has been made very clear that any family that was entitled as at the day of the budget to family tax benefit A would get $600 per child. We now have situations where families are being paid more. What we want to know is: why has the situation been allowed to occur where, instead of just getting the $600 so-called bonus, families have had a further debt created for them? That is the question that Senator Patterson refused to answer. You cannot answer that question by trying to shift the blame onto those families, as if it is somehow their fault or their mistake. It is not their fault; it is not their mistake. The minister should get onto her department and get it fixed.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2004-06-22,"—My question is this: what on earth are the opposition on about when the Australian government are so successful that we can deliver a family tax benefit of $600 and maintain a budget surplus? This is the fundamental question that the opposition simply want to choke upon. We have done the job of providing for the people of this nation so well—we can provide them with a family tax benefit like they have never had before and maintain a surplus—that the opposition are absolutely jaundiced, because they could never do it as a result of their blatant and obvious mismanagement. That is the problem the opposition suffer. Here are families with dependent children being paid a reward and being assisted, and all the opposition can do is say what a terrible, shocking thing it is. 
The psychology of the Labor Party is that, when an overpayment is made, when a miscalculation of income is made, when someone gets a payment to which they are not entitled, they should blame someone else. That is the psychology behind the Labor Party's move here. They cannot come to terms with the fact that good economic management has delivered a dividend. Senator Collins called it a bribe. People who need assistance who have dependent children can benefit from a payment that will assist with all manner of things: schooling, transport, schoolbooks, clothing—you think about it. This is a bribe according to the Australian Labor Party. I say this is a reward to the Australian people for electing a very good government. It is as simple as that, and the opposition are simply choking on the fact.
The More Help for Families measures will provide an additional $19.2 billion in assistance over the coming five years. This is the largest package of assistance ever put in place by an Australian government. Let me say that again: this is the largest package for families with dependent children ever put in place by an Australian government. What a good government it is. How did we do it? We did it through good, sound, strong economic management in the face of huge adversity: the Asian downturn, the US and European downturns and the SARS virus. You name it—we confronted it and beat it. This is the More Help for Families package. Of course, the opposition do not understand what families need. The opposition have no concept of what benefits this will deliver to families. We are helping families with the cost of raising children. What could be wrong with that? We are improving rewards for work for most families and helping them balance their work and family responsibilities. This package builds on the significant reforms to family assistance undertaken by the Howard government in the new tax system, inaugurated in the year 2000, and the Family Tax Initiative, announced way back in 1996 by this very good government.
Around two million eligible families will receive a one-off payment of $600 per child for the family tax benefit part A and for other eligible children before 30 June 2004. As Senator Forshaw has already indicated, Centrelink are delivering on that promise. As I stand here today, the government has been true to its word. The money is going into the bank accounts as I stand here now. What a good cause and what a good payment it is. Eligibility for the new one-off $600 per child payment will be linked to: receipt of the family tax benefit part A on budget night for Family Assistance Office instalment customers; a confirmed entitlement to family tax benefit A on budget night in respect of the 2002-03 income year for lump sum claimants; and receipt by parents and nominees of dependent youth allowance for 16- to 17-year-old children, as mentioned on budget night. From 1 July 2004, there will also be an ongoing family tax benefit part A supplement— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Taxation: Family Payments</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2004-06-22,"—The only problem with what Senator Johnston was talking about is that it does not seem to be adequately linked to families that were in receipt of family tax benefit part A on budget night. As far as I am aware, there are no families with 22-year-old children that are eligible to receive family tax benefit part A, never mind the one-off $600 bonus that the government unveiled in its budget. So we need to get this straight. This is a massive systems failure. It is yet another systems failure on top of the fact that the system currently traps thousands of Australian families into debt in other ways. The other thing we need to understand very clearly is that, unlike what those opposite would have people believe, the Labor Party does support hardworking Australian families. The Labor Party supports returning to those hardworking Australian families the money that this government has clawed back from them over the last eight years. 
As I was saying, the fiasco of the implementation of the budget night one-off bonus, soon to be followed up by another one, highlights the current system and the problems within it. The current system actually penalises those who can least afford it. It penalises those families at the bottom end of the system who have the greatest difficulty in estimating their income. They are already penalised. To then receive extra payments they are not necessarily entitled to in units of $600 forces those families into massive debt. Australian families, especially hardworking, low-income Australian families, deserve a lot better from this government. As it is implemented, the current family tax benefit system is ill-conceived. Through no fault of their own, families, particularly those with 22-year-old children or those who have received $600 for children they do not actually have, find themselves as debtors to the Commonwealth.
This is a system where 30 per cent of recipients end up making incorrect estimates of their income. Surely that does not mean that 30 per cent of recipients are fraudulent, as the minister would have us believe, or incompetent, as other members of the government would have us believe; it means that the system is too complex and that it traps these families in debt. Let us take, for example, a family that gets its income estimate wrong by $1,800 per annum. That is $34 per week. That is not a rort; it could just be that the income earner in that family forgot about the extra one or two hours of overtime they work every now and then. That family will then end up with a debt of $1,400 to the Commonwealth. Let us hope that they do not get any of those extra $600 one-off bonuses that the government seems to be popping into people's bank accounts, whether they are eligible or not.
So what does this government do? Its response to the fiasco of the family tax benefit payment system is to blow millions of dollars on advertising. I suppose that is actually useful for the families that are suddenly discovering they are getting this payment when they are not eligible for it, so they will actually understand why their bank accounts are going up by units of $600 when they were not expecting any payment at all or were expecting a lower payment. But we need to ask ourselves: what else could that money have been spent on? It could have been spent on fixing the system that administers the family payments. It could have been spent on providing increased support for those hardworking, low-income families. It could have been spent on repairing the damage caused by the decline in bulk-billing, for instance. But, instead, this government blows millions of dollars on advertising, gives tax cuts to the big end of town and, through its own ineptness, is going to force more families into debt.
It is ironic that this government is championing the fact that it is cracking down on debt for Centrelink customers. They are having a debt crackdown, apparently. Yet, at the same time, this government is forcing a whole raft of new families to become debtors to the Commonwealth—families who probably never before in their lives had problems with the family tax benefit system but who through no fault of their own are being paid in units of $600 for children who are 20, 22 or who knows how old, for children who do not exist or for three children when in fact they have two.

That the Senate take note of the document.
In view of the pressure of the business of the Senate, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard my tabling speech.

The statement read as follows—
As Senators will know, the IPU which was established in 1889, was the first permanent forum for political multilateral negotiations. The IPU now is the international organisation of the Parliaments of sovereign states. Its assemblies foster dialogue and parliamentary diplomacy among legislators. 140 countries are members of the IPU and over 120 countries send delegations to the IPU assemblies.
The IPU has six core areas of activity and these are:
	The promotion of representative democracy;
	International peace and security;
	Sustainable development;
	Education, science and culture;
	Human rights and humanitarian law; and
	Women in politics
The IPU addresses these and other issues primarily through its three standing committees. These committees debate issues of international significance, appoint drafting committees that sit for many hours formulating draft resolutions which are in turn considered and adopted by the plenary session of the IPU. 
The Australian delegation always makes a strong contribution to the work of the IPU committees—this is perhaps not surprising given our considerable experience with committees in this parliament. It is interesting to note that over the last three years, the IPU has referred about fourteen matters to drafting committees and Australia has been elected to eight of them and has chaired three. I don't think many countries could match this level of participation. 
In Mexico City, delegates attended and participated in the work of the three committees. Additionally, Ms Maria Vamvakinou, the Member for Calwell, did outstanding work when she was elected to the drafting committee on an emergency agenda item on the situation in Israel and Palestine that was added to the IPU's agenda.
It should also be noted that Senator Ferris was elected to the co-ordinating committee of women parliamentarians and that I was elected as a Vice President of the IPU's Second Committee which covers Sustainable Development, Finance and Trade. My work on the newly constituted Board of the Inter-Parliamentary Foundation for Democracy also continued.
Following the IPU, the delegation participated in the ANZAC day ceremony at the Australian Embassy in Mexico City. The delegation laid a wreath at that ceremony, as did the New Zealand IPU delegation and Mr Sciacca, a member of our delegation and a former Minister for Veterans' Affairs gave a very appropriate and moving address to the 150 or so people who attended the ceremony.
My special thanks goes to the Australian Ambassador in Mexico, Graeme Wilson, his wife, Lisa Mantell and his staff, especially Peter Rennert and Chris Munn. The hospitality they offered was welcome; the assistance they provided was highly professional.
Similarly the assistance of Neil Bessell, Secretary to the Delegation and newly-appointed Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Adviser to the delegation, Doug Foskett, was invaluable.
My thanks also to my wife, Sally, who ensured that the regular strategy meetings of the delegation were well catered.
—In addition to that, may I also indicate that as part of this Inter-Parliamentary Union conference there was a very challenging panel discussion held on the commercial sexual exploitation of children, which the Australian delegation attended as part of the IPU conference. Two of our delegates in the delegation of four, the member for Calwell and Senator Ferris, have previously circulated to our parliamentary colleagues papers arising from this particular panel. I also seek leave, on behalf of the delegation, to table the papers that relate to that panel and also a handbook for parliamentarians entitled Child Protection, which has been produced jointly by the Inter-Parliamentary Union and UNICEF.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2004-06-22,"—Prior to question time I was speaking on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2003 about the issue of literacy and the difficulties that many people will face when it comes to choice of funds, given that they do not have the required literacy and numeracy skills to be able to read the type of key feature statements that will be presented to them. In many instances they will be forced by some very slick operators into making quite unwise choices about the thing that is most important to them—their retirement benefit, which will give them dignity in retirement. None of what I have heard the government or the Democrats say in coming to an agreement on this bill has overcome that major difficulty. One of the major difficulties that face this bill is the fact that many people do not know how to cope with the information that they will be bombarded with in seeking to move from the fund that they are in to another fund. Whilst choice might seem all well and good in theory, the practical reality for some people will be that they will have a great deal of difficulty in dealing with it. 
One would say that there is an option for them to do nothing. That is quite true, but in some instances they will be presented with a very slick salesperson who will do their utmost to sway them out of the fund that they are in into an inferior product where there could well be higher charges, and the person will be none the wiser. It may take them some substantial period of time to discover the error of their ways. However, though, that may well be too late in some instances because they may be close to retirement and the accrual that they could otherwise have earned out of a sound fund will have dissipated in their case. There are real concerns also that a number of slick salespersons will hop into this area and avail themselves of the opportunity to take down people who are most vulnerable. Until the government really had addressed that issue, they should not have proceeded with this legislation. Whilst it was always going to suit those who are skilled in the area of investment, those who do not have the skills are going to be the people who suffer the most.
I am sure that my colleague Senator Sherry will deal with this at length when it gets into the committee stage. Undoubtedly, it is not a good deal for a number of people in the Australian work force where their funds have been fairly well protected up to date. They will now be exposed to the prospect that their superannuation could be dissipated by dodgy funds and dodgy investment practices to boot.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-06-22,"—The Australian Greens will not be supporting the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2003 for the reasons that have been outlined very clearly by previous speakers. We would have been happier to get from the government better consumer protection in such things as the cost of getting into new funds, the return when the person making the payments is in the funds and the cost of an exit fee, if they are unhappy. All of these things should be easily quantifiable to the consumer.
The Greens will be supporting many of the amendments that Labor brings forward, but we recognise the weight of numbers as the government and the Democrats will be able to get the bill safely through. The Greens were very happy to look at choice and consumer safeguards. However, the Democrats have been able to negotiate with the government to come to an arrangement they think is satisfactory. We do not believe that that is the case. A lot of people without great riches may well get their savings purloined by organisations which have multimillion dollar budgets, for example, simply to advertise their wares in the retail sector—funds which ought to have been going back to the consumer in their retirement.
These things worry us a great deal. We are in favour of choice but we believe consumers cannot exercise that choice unless it is presented simply. We believe it is up to government to find the prescription that makes it easy for consumers to know what is best for them in the jungle of competing concerns in this huge and very lucrative business. We also believe that, for instance when it comes to ethical investment, consumers should be guided and know that they are being safely guided by the information they get. There should be a choice for people to not invest in funds that are wood chipping Tasmania's forests, that are mining for uranium in Kakadu or that are involved in the live animal export trade or in genetically modified crops, for example. Those things are very important, and they are going to become increasingly important. However, we foresee that this legislation will be back in this parliament in a few years time with some pretty sad stories to go with it—and they will have been unnecessary. 
It is up to the parliament to protect the consumer, and one of the best ways of protecting the consumer is to ensure that information is simple and trustworthy. That is not spelt out in this legislation; therefore it is unsatisfactory. We can understand why the Australian Consumers Association believes that better legislation should have been forthcoming. When it comes to ending the discrimination against same-sex couples or people living in another form of arrangement of dependency, we are totally in favour of that part of the legislation and we will be supporting the amendments to the legislation that will bring that into being.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-06-22,"—It gives me great pleasure to sum up on behalf of the government on this very important, indeed, landmark Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2003 that provides for choice of superannuation. The government have been committed to the idea that workers should be able to decide where their superannuation goes since, as I understand it, the mid-1990s. Choice of fund was an election commitment of the government in 1996. We believe that it is an unassailable proposition and indeed a fundamental democratic right that people should have a say in how their own money is managed. This is a right that has been denied to employees for far too long, with seriously adverse consequences for workers. But choice is about more than workers' rights; it is also about good retirement incomes policy. It is about creating a competitive environment that ensures superannuation providers are working as hard as possible for the retirement incomes of all Australians.
Choice is sound policy and this is a good bill. In summary, it gives people the basic right to control their own superannuation. It will encourage employees to take a greater interest in their retirement savings. It will promote competition and place downward pressure on fees and charges. It minimises the costs on employers. It comes into effect after the introduction of a robust, comprehensive and world-class consumer protection regime. It will come into effect after the introduction of a new fee comparison model that will assist people to shop around. It is vitally important that employees are involved in decisions that affect their super. Choice of fund not only will empower workers to make decisions but it will also allow them to have a better connection with their superannuation savings. Lack of choice cements the current set and forget mentality and the general apathy that many Australians have towards their retirement savings and goals.
One of the biggest winners from choice will be part-time and casual workers and those working multiple jobs. Many of these people are low-income workers in Labor heartlands who seem to have been forgotten by the Labor Party. Choice will allow those working multiple jobs to consolidate their super into one account and avoid paying multiple account fees, which can devastate and completely eat away retirement savings. Choice is expected to lead to a genuine increase in retirement incomes for such people. I lost count a long time ago of the number of letters I have received from workers locked into underperforming or expensive funds, pleading for the right to be able to change funds. Many workers are provided with a choice but, for those who are not, it can result in a grave disadvantage because they are shut into a one size fits all model and they are really, in many ways, shut out from the process of saving for their own retirement. It is no coincidence that there are currently $7 billion and 4.6 million accounts on the Australian tax office's lost members register. There is a serious disconnect between workers and their money. 
The choice of fund initiative will be supported by a substantial education campaign. The government committed long ago to $14 million for the ATO to run such a campaign. Contrary to the dire warnings from naysayers, the campaign will be responsible. Subject to the views of an independent advisory committee, the campaign will encourage employees to take an interest in what is being offered, as different options, of course, suit different people. It will make it clear that there is no need to change funds and that a person's best option may be to stay where they are. That would be the choice. I will be moving amendments to the legislation later in the debate. These amendments will broaden the range of people eligible to receive superannuation death benefits and will provide greater certainty to people in interdependent relationships. The amendments will specify that employers must pay superannuation contributions to a fund that offers life insurance if employees do not exercise choice. The amendments will also prohibit superannuation funds from providing kickbacks or benefits to an employer or union on the basis that one or more of their employees are members of the super fund.
I do warmly welcome and commend the Democrats' support of choice, and I particularly thank Senator Cherry for his efforts. I am sure that the Democrats recognise that this bill is, overall, good for Australian workers. I think it is disappointing that, despite many years of debate about this matter, Labor's position on choice does not seem to have moved very much. Let me start with Labor's first major furphy, that choice is unsafe, and just look at the facts. I think the facts are pretty straightforward. Choice has been operating successfully in Western Australia since 1998. ASFA estimates that 32 per cent of Australians already have choice; this equates to millions of Australians who already have choice. So where is the evidence of unsafe practices? I do not think Labor has produced one iota of evidence. There is a fundamental contradiction to the arguments of the Labor Party that choice is unsafe, when so many people can already choose and the sky has certainly not fallen in.
Despite this fearmongering, I firmly believe that overseas experiences in the United Kingdom and Chile will not be repeated in Australia. The reason I believe this is that we have been mindful of those very unhappy practices and events and have done something to prevent them. First, Australia has a robust and comprehensive consumer protection regime that is world's best practice; second, Australia has an experienced and active consumer protection regulator in ASIC; third, super funds are heavily regulated under the SI(S) Act; and, finally, millions of Australians, as I have said, already have choice and there is no evidence of this type of behaviour.
It is difficult to understand how Labor can continue to oppose a fundamental right and a policy that will substantially boost retirement incomes on such flimsy, lightweight and unsubstantiated evidence. If you extend the unsafe argument, Labor would deny Australians the right to choose their bank account or home loan or indeed health cover. Labor clearly think Australians are either too uninformed, too stupid or too inexperienced to be trusted to make decisions for themselves. They would rather employers make these decisions for us. Australians should never accept such policy in respect of their banking or home loan and they certainly should not accept it in relation to their superannuation. 
Labor speaks of risk and Labor speakers have spoken of risk in the second reading debate, but what about the countervailing risks? No-one has said a word about the risk of leaving employees in underperforming funds or funds that simply do not suit their particular needs. What about the risk that superannuation funds will become complacent if members cannot leave? What about the risk to retirement incomes of forcing people to maintain multiple accounts? I think that Labor's approach to this ignores these risks. I think there is a worrying authoritarian streak creeping into the Labor Party's approach to policy not only in respect of superannuation but even in respect of kids doing homework. Labor wish to deny Australians the basic right of self-determination. They oppose good policy on the basis of flawed logic and unsubstantiated arguments.
Labor has talked about complexity. Those in the Labor Party would know a great deal about complexity because what Labor has said about superannuation policy appears to be littered in red tape, regulation, complexity and prescription. The choice bill is relatively straightforward. Affected employers give their employees a standard choice form produced by the ATO. If employees want to make a choice, they provide the relevant details to their employer. This is really not rocket science.
Another furphy is that choice is an attack on industry funds. I do not see any evidence of that; in fact, it is quite the opposite. I refer to the evidence given by industry fund Cbus to the Senate committee in 2002. Cbus acknowledged that choice in Western Australia had led to an increase in their own membership. I also note comments by REST Chief Executive, Neil Cochrane, in March this year that super choice would result in more people moving to industry funds. In a more competitive market, industry funds may well be the winners. Again I think the Labor Party has used both flimsy and unsubstantiated arguments that simply do not amount to real evidence.
We do know of course that on the odd occasion when the guard is let down even those opposite have occasionally supported choice. I actually came across a comment by Senator Conroy to the Senate on 24 March this year, when he said:
The choice of a superannuation fund is one of the most important investment decisions that any Australian will make.
I wholeheartedly endorse that comment. Senator Conroy acknowledges the importance of choosing a super fund, and I would hope that he would stand up to his caucus and support the government's legislation and allow Australian workers to take what he recognises as a very important decision.
There has been a lot of talk about disclosure. The government recently announced a single fee-comparison model. It contains a single figure that consumers can use to compare funds. What is the Labor Party's alternative to this? It appears to be complex projections over a number of years that would add pages to disclosure documentation and be likely to confuse and mislead rather than being simple. Sixty to 80 pages is overwhelming, but about four different projections would add even more detail. You do not need a projection to identify the cheapest fund; you only need a simple fee-comparison table. It is one-page long and it is simple, as Senator Cherry said. That is what was aimed for and that is what we ended up with.
The irony of Labor's position is that they claim to favour disclosure and want people to know the fees they pay, but they will not let consumers do anything about it. We do need to tell Australians about the fees they pay. Some Australians, unfortunately, are in high-cost funds. We need to take every step to highlight this point. Australians should be equipped with the ability to do something about this and to understand it. It is a recipe for maximum frustration to have choice but no ability to understand what you are choosing between. 
Exit fees have been put up as a barrier to choice, but once again it is a bit of a straw man. Exit fees are not the barrier to choice. The only barrier to choice is, indeed, opposition in this place. Labor wants to ban entry and exit fees. For some time industry has advised that high exit fee products are no longer marketed on current superannuation products. It is true that high exit fee products were prevalent during Labor's watch in the 1980s and 1990s and those people who suffer high exit fees on old life insurance products not only deserve some sympathy but can thank previous Labor inaction for the fact that that is what they face.
—They had been around for 40 years.
—You did nothing about it, Senator Sherry. Banning exit fees will do nothing to lower overall fees. You do not have to be very perceptive to realise that, if you ban one kind of fee, funds will simply raise another fee to compensate. The approach to fees is akin to locking the window to keep the burglars out while leaving the back door open. Focusing on fees indicates a focus on the symptoms rather than the problem. The problem is a lack of competition and a superannuation environment that in some respects exhibits monopolistic characteristics, but high fees are a symptom—a symptom of inadequate competition. Those who suggest that if you regulate exit fees you fix the problem are really just looking at a symptom. The only effective way to reduce total fees is competition. The evidence is everywhere, and Labor knew this back in the 1980s and 1990s. For example, Labor introduced choice in the telecommunications markets. The result? Dramatically lower call costs. 
I also refer to some comments on this issue by the now Labor leader, Mr Latham, who appears to acknowledge the great benefits of competition. I think it is worth recording Mr Latham's comments on this. He said:
I have always believed in competition as the best way of motivating companies to upgrade their products, skill their workforce, move forward—you know, competition is the discipline, the driving force, to get productivity, and that is the essence of growth.
There aren't too many lessons around the world if you wind back competition and go to monopoly that you end up with a growing economy.
Yet despite these comments, Labor, at least in the Senate, opposes procompetitive policies in the Australian superannuation sector in favour of what has been clearly demonstrated to be ineffective regulation and red tape. I think it demonstrates the hypocrisy of Labor's position on choice that has been sustained at least since 1996.
Australians want choice. Australians deserve choice. The evidence against choice is flimsy and does not stack up to even half-baked scrutiny. The opposition to the government's position on choice is based on scaremongering and mistruths and a blatant disregard for the retirement aspirations and outcomes of ordinary Australians and Australian workers. The opposition to choice is completely out of touch with the needs and desires of ordinary Australians. I believe that the Labor Party is out of step on this one. I am very pleased that the Democrats not only have seen the light but have worked very hard and diligently with the government to get to a position where we now offer a much improved bill and one that will meet the needs of Australians to be able to exercise choice. The legislation gives employees the basic right to be able to choose where their retirement savings are invested. It will improve the efficiency of the superannuation system and increase individuals' connections with their retirement savings. I commend this important bill to the Senate. 
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Sherry's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-06-22,"—I think I was just finishing my speech on these amendments yesterday. I note that Senator Murray is not here yet, so we may need to keep talking before we put this to a vote.
—I am sure you will not find that difficult, Senator Conroy.
—I appreciate your kind remarks, Mr Temporary Chairman. The issue we were talking about was multi chairs. I see my stalkers are with us again tonight! It is good to see that the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants are with us in the gallery. To be fair, they have followed this debate very closely the whole way. It is good to see them coming along to watch the completion of it. What Labor is seeking to do with regard to the issue of multi chairs is not to ban any director from holding two positions. It is saying that, if they want to hold two chairs, the directors of the second company of which they are seeking to become the chair should have a chance to participate. If the shareholders choose to vote to have two chairs of top 500 companies then they are entitled to make that decision. So this is not attempting to regulate the number of chairs; it is attempting to say that shareholders should be empowered. I see that our colleague Senator Murray has joined us, so I will happily defer to the vote.
—There are a few things that I forgot to mention in my contribution. I am happy to continue. I think it is important, particularly as Mr Reilly is in the gallery, that I should discuss his golf swing and handicap, which are, frankly, an embarrassment. He is a complete bandit. I know that Senator Murray is very keen on the issue of shareholder participation, so I am hoping that my speech can convince him that empowering shareholders is a good thing. I appear to have convinced him.

These amendments implement Labor's policy to increase shareholder activism in Australia. In Labor's view institutions put pressure on companies which far outweighs the pressure of individual shareholders. That is why Labor's amendments require institutional investors to disclose how they vote in relation to the listed companies in which they invest. With most Australians having an exposure to the share market via their superannuation, the importance of shareholder activism in corporate governance becomes clear.
Labor takes the view that the exercise of ownership rights by all shareholders, including institutional investors, should be facilitated by government and supported by the regulatory framework. The United States have taken the lead on this issue. In the US the Department of Labor is the relevant authority under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, in relation to US private sector pension plans. The department takes the view that the vote is an asset of the plan, which needs to be managed by those plans with the same care and diligence as other plan assets. A policy statement from the department states that voting rights attached to equity investments should be exercised on issues `that may affect the value of the plan's investment'.
Recently the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, adopted rule amendments that require mutual funds to disclose their proxy voting policies and the actual proxy votes cast. This rule comes into effect on 31 August this year. I reiterate that the original decision to introduce mandatory voting for private sector pension plans was a Ronald Reagan Republican initiative. This is not some left-wing conspiracy. Ronald Reagan Republican policy introduced the compulsion to vote your shares for pension plans. It is quite extraordinary that Australia, some 10 or 15 years later, is still having this debate. I hope that the government will accept that this amendment is important and worth while. I hope that the government are willing, along with the Democrats, to support this.
The SEC in the last 12 months has introduced this disclosure rule. Let us make it clear again: the SEC has introduced this while George Bush Jr is the President. Again, a Republican administration has introduced this. Therefore, it is extraordinary that Australia continues to lag behind. But this is the opportunity to grasp the nettle. This is the opportunity for the Australian parliament to adopt the world's best practice that is in the US. This is a government that is very keen on world's best practice. It wants world's best practice in every other sector. Why are we not picking up world's best practice in the corporate governance initiatives out of the US? They are groundbreaking. They have led to a substantial shift in participation in the US. 
As I said, this rule that the SEC have just introduced comes into effect on 31 August this year. According to an article by Stephen Davis in London's Financial Timesnewspaper, `the US rule means that the secrecy in relation to how the US institutions vote will stop on 31 August 2004'. That is how he describes it. Conflicts of interest which flourished uncontrolled will be put under the spotlight. Why will conflicts be exposed? According to the Financial Timesarticle, if funds know that voting records will be exposed to investors, the funds will be scrupulous in voting in the clients' interests rather than to further commercial objectives. The voluntary statement of principles which is used in the UK has been criticised on the grounds that, because it is not part of the law, it is impossible to overcome the web of conflicts of interest in the industry. Similar considerations apply in Australia. The question is: will the Howard government support Labor to stop the secrecy and overcome the web of conflicts of interest which exists in Australia? This is another big test.
We have seen some pretty bad public policy in recent times. We have seen IFSA winning hand over fist wherever it wants. This government has allowed IFSA to make the running.
—Certainly Richard Gilbert deserves his money from IFSA.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Mr Gilbert.
—Sorry, Mr Gilbert deserves his money from IFSA because he is doing a great job. He knows he can phone Senator Campbell and have breakfast with him at the Hyatt on the quiet. You have been spotted there; I spotted you there. He knows he can quietly call Senator Campbell, even though he is the minister for roads and not much else. Even though he has not got any responsibility—
—I'm also the minister for local government and territories. That's an insult to Norfolk Islanders, and the Temporary Chairman would agree.
—I agree and would feel quite disturbed if something were said against that fine band of people.
—We know how this operation works. It is not even his portfolio. He has run roughshod a couple of times over poor Parliamentary Secretary Cameron. Parliamentary Secretary Cameron has made a number of deals. He has met with members of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. Senator Murray is aware of this. Parliamentary Secretary Cameron has been pulled aside by Senator Campbell, who is still trying to run the portfolio even though he has no legal responsibility for it.
We know what goes on. We know that IFSA have had a number of wins, and here is another test today. Will this government do IFSA's bidding? Even though I have described IFSA's desire to not reveal how much they charge their customers—disclosing the total cost of fees to their customers is like a wooden stake to a vampire—I promise you that this one IFSA are determined to defeat. IFSA have scoured the world for arguments to defeat this. Unfortunately, the rest of the world is coming our way. I say to IFSA: you may win, you may have the government in your pocket again, but you will not win this one in the long run. Shareholders want these powers; shareholders want this information. You may have a win today—I hope not; I hope the government accepts this—but ultimately parliament will catch up with you, and the shareholders and the people whose money you are managing will catch up with you— 
—Are you saying they will catch up with me, Senator Conroy?
—Catch up with you.
—What do you mean by `catch up with you'?
—Policy wise it will catch up with IFSA.
—You said `you'. I thought you meant me.
—No, `you' as in IFSA.
—Perhaps you should refer your remarks to me.
—I am sure you can now admonish me for not addressing the chair. In fact I was referring to IFSA when I said `you'.
—I am glad you cleared that up, Senator.
—Thank you for drawing that to my attention, Mr Temporary Chairman. This is a test: will the government back powerful institutional investors and their lobby groups and continue to allow institutional investors to act behind closed doors without the disinfectant that full disclosure provides? Exposing conflicts of interest is only one of the advantages of the requirement to disclose voting records. The second advantage of requiring institutional investors to disclose their voting records—and this is according to the Financial Times, one of the premier economic journals in the world—is `it would expose those funds that slavishly endorse every corporate management position'. And this is a key issue for the Australian market.
I am not aware of any single board resolution which was defeated during the last AGM season. A couple of resolutions were withdrawn, it is fair to say. A number of people deserve a lot of credit. Even though I am giving IFSA a hard time, members of IFSA deserve credit for their participation in rolling Rupert Murdoch and in rolling Gerry Harvey. But in general, other than those two instances, every single resolution put up by a board to the shareholders was passed. If that is not 100 per cent tick-a-box, I do not know what is. So when the argument comes that some of these amendments will lead to simply ticking a box or getting bad outcomes, I have to say that 100 per cent of resolutions passed. That sounds to me pretty much like a tick-a-box approach to what goes on by fund managers. It is happening right now. Do we seriously believe that every resolution put up by management in the last AGM season in Australia was acceptable?
Whilst an open dialogue between a fund manager and a company prior to an AGM may produce outcomes and avoid the need for public disagreement, there are instances where Australian investors have simply failed to act. The best example of institutional apathy occurred at the Boral AGM in October this year, where institutional investors voted in favour of a board resolution that removed the right of 100 shareholders to put a resolution for debate at the AGM where the resolution relates to the company constitution. What a massive blow to shareholder democracy. And what happened? Every institution lined up and voted for it. Notwithstanding that the policies they enunciated did not support that position, every one of them voted for it. So they had one stated policy on corporate governance and supporting shareholder democracy but, when the rubber hit the road—when it came to a test of whether they were voting, firstly, in an informed way and, secondly, whether they were going to vote in support of shareholders' interests—no, they backed the board. 
This outcome highlights the tick-a-box mentality that currently exists. The largest fund managers in Australia voted in favour of a resolution that eroded shareholders' rights, because that is what the board asked them to do. Culturally, many institutional investors have a tick-a-box mentality: if management are in favour of the resolution, it must be okay. The third advantage of disclosing voting records—again, according to the Financial Times; another left wing conspiracy on our hands, Senator Murray—is that the requirement to disclose voting records will provide `an X-ray picture of how funds behave as owners.'
Labor also want to give Australian shareholders an X-ray picture of how funds behave. We believe that the market should know how institutional investors vote. This X-ray will also assist socially responsible investors who will be able to see whether a fund takes into account issues such as the environment or labour standards. Why should institutional investors, which control billions of dollars of other people's money, be allowed to operate in secret? Australia is being left behind.
It is not just the United States that has decided to shine the spotlight on the activities of institutional investors. Last month the Canadian securities administrators announced that nearly identical laws to the US rules are to apply from next year. According to the Financial Times the UK is considering similar proposals. The OECD principles of corporate governance, which were released earlier this year, call for disclosure of how institutional investors exercise their ownership rights. The OECD report states:
For institutions acting in a fiduciary capacity, such as pension funds, collective investment schemes and some activities of insurance companies, the right to vote can be considered part of the value of the investment being undertaken on behalf of their clients. Failure to exercise the ownership rights could result in a loss to the investor who should therefore be made aware of the policy to be followed by the institutional investors.
Accordingly, Labor believes that fund managers in Australia should disclose their voting records and voting policies.
This is a global issue, and the Howard government is fighting against the global tide. This is the second time that the Howard government has had the opportunity to pass legislation that would require the disclosure of voting records by fund managers. Let us not forget that the first time Labor introduced amendments was in March 2003. Since then we have consulted extensively with industry and we have released revised amendments. Today is the second time that Labor has attempted to bring Australia into line with international best practice in relation to proxy voting by institutional investors. I will sit down at this point as I am sure Senator Murray would also like to contribute. I have a number of other points I would like to make before I conclude, but I will pass over to Senator Ian Campbell.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-06-22,"—I will put the case of the government in relation to this raft of amendments. Firstly, this government have not sought to replicate world's best practice in this area at all. In fact, we have sought to look at the Australian situation, look at the challenges we face as a nation, look at our capital markets and look at the unique circumstances of our investment community, with its very high number of retail investors. We have a significant institutional investment community for a country our size. You have to give credit where it is due to Mr Keating for introducing compulsory superannuation when he was Treasurer. That has ensured that we have had significant funds moving into institutions—or pension funds, as they are called in the US—so we have very high levels of private investment in the markets. 
There are significant differences between our marketplace and the marketplace in the City of London, for example, which Senator Conroy seems to have become a recent convert to. There is a very big difference with the US market, where there are individual corporations laws and business laws spread across the 50 states; the Securities and Investments Commission, based in Washington; and a whole range of different regulatory regimes spread throughout the states. I think the biggest registry is actually in Delaware, for reasons that were probably bad reasons 20 years ago but are generally good reasons now. They also have the different stock exchanges. You have an entirely different situation to that which you have in Australia.
We have not sought to say there is world's best practice. There are different situations in Europe, in Asia, in the US and in Great Britain. What we have sought to do—and we have been quite successful, if you look at the way the Australian market has performed, particularly over the last decade—is something a little bit bolder than have world's best practice: we have sought to define world's best practice. We have done that in Australia in many areas. One of those areas is the Financial Services Reform Act, which has led the world in terms of financial services regulation, with the sort of information that is available to investors and that is required to be given to potential investors by advisers. In many areas we have in fact achieved the goal that I set for us: to define world's best practice.
In this area we are assisted by one of the world's best stock exchanges: the Australian Stock Exchange. We are supported by a range of institutions—which I claim have grown up because of this government's very active approach to getting it right and doing a lot of policy work in this area—such as the Securities and Derivatives Industry Association, which has grown up over recent years since the demutualisation of the Stock Exchange; IFSA, which Senator Conroy was referring to in semiderogatory terms, because I know he has a lot of respect for a lot of the work it does; the Australian Shareholders Association, to their great credit; and a range of other organisations that have really developed solid participation by their memberships and engaged in what is, I think, generally a very well-informed debate about corporate governance and corporate regulatory issues that we have here in Australia.
Most other jurisdictions would in fact be very jealous of what we have achieved in institutional voting in Australia. I am informed that the voting levels for members of IFSA have hit 92 per cent over the last year or so. Senator Conroy is saying that we need to bring in a raft of new law that of course will create a cost and a compliance burden. I think Senator Conroy's badly thought out amendments relating to reporting requirements will of course add cost to the institutions. Who will bear the costs of those institutions? It will in fact be the investors—the mums and dads—the people who rely on their superannuation investment. They will have diminished returns because of this onerous new raft of regulation that Senator Conroy wants to impose on an industry that has an unrivalled record throughout the markets of world capitals—a 92 per cent voting record of all company resolutions, a significant achievement by Australian institutional investors. 
What astounds me, particularly bringing forward the amendment this week, is that we have the Australian Labor Party saying, `Let's force institutions to disclose how they vote, disclose their voting policies, disclose their voting record,' when their new star recruit for the Labor frontbench steadfastly refuses to say how he voted. Senator Abetz in this very chamber only a few days ago asked: `Could you please do a freedom of information request and I'll ensure that the AEC gives you all your voting records?' We have the next person to get promoted to the Labor frontbench in Peter Garrett absolutely refusing to say how he votes, refusing to let the Australian people look at his records, refusing to let the shareholders and the Australian Labor Party and their paid up subsidiaries in the trade union movement know. Yet Senator Conroy has the gall—I think he is probably embarrassed—to come in here and say, `Let's make it law for every institution in Australia to show their voting records and their voting policies and how they vote.' Yet Peter Garrett, their new frontbencher, has been promised a senior position in a Latham government—he could in fact be financial services minister, and that would be very embarrassing for Labor. I think Senator Conroy shows enormous gall and probably embarrassment at having to impose on everyone else in Australia a policy that Peter Garrett—their new star recruit and future Labor minister—will not abide by himself.
If Mr Garrett wants to abide by Labor policy, which he says he will do, and chuck out a decade worth of baggage—stop logging, stop industry, close it down, oppose the United States alliance, oppose defence policy—I suggest that he now comply with Labor policy on compulsory voting, comply with Labor policy on disclosure of your voting record and voting policy and come clean today. Senator Conroy will join with me and ask Mr Garrett to comply with Labor policy, as clearly enunciated in these regulations. And I can only take Labor seriously on these amendments if Senator Conroy will join me in asking for that. 
Obviously these amendments are well intentioned. The government has always said that institutional investors should be voting where it is in the interests of their members to do so. In fact, that is exactly what the US seeks to do. Senator Conroy comes in here and says, `It's law that you have to vote in the US.' Of course it is not. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act sets out the fiduciary responsibilities and, effectively, says that pension plan officials have to weigh up whether voting or not voting is to the benefit of the members of their fund, and that is quite appropriate. That is exactly what institutional investors in Australia have to do. It certainly does not specifically mandate voting. 
What Senator Conroy will not tell you is that all of these wonderful rules, passed under the administration of that wonderful United States President, were the very rules that applied at the time of the Enron collapse, the WorldCom collapse and all of the other major collapses. That is one of the reasons we are here tonight. All of those rules that applied—and Senator Conroy was giving credit to the Reagan Republicans for their measures—were in fact sound measures, because they did not force people to vote. Senator Conroy is taking the Reagan Republican initiative and saying, `Here is a responsibility for you as a fiduciary.' He is making it quite clear that you have to weigh up `Do you vote or don't you vote? Does voting impose a higher cost on your investors or your plan members than not voting' and make a sensible decision. That is what the Australian government says. 
Senator Conroy says that he aligns himself with the wonderful initiative of the Reagan Republicans, but he does something that Ronald Reagan would never have done nor one of his Republicans. He knows that you need to weigh these things up. You do not need grandma in Canberra saying, `You have to do this to be good.' You do not need nanny saying, `Nanny knows best or Canberra knows best,' to do this. The proof of the pudding is in the eating: the members of the Australian institutions have achieved such significant results in terms of their own voting record. Of course, that will be monitored closely. This is certainly an area that does not need the heavy hand of a centralist `Nanny knows best' Labor initiative in the Senate to force people to do this, which will have the clear effect of just adding cost and diminishing returns to the investors who rely on their superannuation investments.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-06-22,"—I rise to respond to that diatribe. I have a number of points to make. Senator Ian Campbell, you mentioned the Shareholders Association. I want to follow that up first. I am authorised to stand before you today and indicate on behalf of the Australian Shareholders Association and Stuart Wilson, their CEO, that they strongly support this measure. Senator Campbell, I hope Mr Gilbert and IFSA paid for breakfast if those are the best lines they could give you after scouring the world. You have had Treasury scouring the world; we know that they have been hunting around in Paris looking for arguments against this. We know that you have been looking around for some decent arguments to oppose this amendment. We know that IFSA have scoured the world—and that was the best they could slip you on a piece of paper? I hope they paid for breakfast, because that was rubbish.
Just to get the record absolutely straight I will give you the name and phone number of the official in the US administration that introduced the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and you can have a chat to him. His name is Bob Monks. He is a great bloke. He is a Reagan Republican and proud of it. You may ask, `Why would he bother talking to a Labor senator from Australia?' Well, I will give you his phone number and an introduction to him, and you can have a conversation about how this law works and how he intended it to work. He will tell you in no uncertain terms that this, combined with the SEC rules, mandates it. They have to vote. He will give it to you in black and white. The Ronald Reagan Republican appointee to run the Department of Labor, in charge of this area, will tell you exactly what this has done and how it is done. I do not want to put it on the public record but I will give you his phone number. Feel free to give him a ring. He will give you a run-down on this legislation in the US so that we can perhaps get some education going for you.
IFSA's claim that 92 per cent of their members vote at AGMs beggars belief. It is a debate I have had with Mr Gilbert and IFSA for some time, and I am sure they are embarrassed that you have dragged this hoary old effort up again. Corporate Governance International do a survey every year—as I think you are aware, Senator Ian Campbell. As we all know, Groundhog Day is approaching again on 28 June. Senator Murray, I have the exact date, as you always like to correct me. Back in 1998 we stood here and had a debate about participation of shareholders. Back then the voting record of institutions was 37 per cent. We introduced a range of measures and hoped that they would be enough. We hoped that, after six years at least, we would see a substantial increase in the level of voting by institutions in this country. After six years of practice we have reached the staggering level of 44 per cent. That is an increase of one per cent a year. By the time you and I have both left parliament, Senator Murray, we might reach the US level, the UK level and probably the Canadian level, given that they are introducing some of these measures as well. By the time we have collectively left parliament—even you, Senator Campbell, may have passed on—we may begin to approach that level if the one per cent increment continues. That is not good enough for Australian shareholders. 
Senator Ian Campbell, the unique thing about your argument and your argument on behalf of IFSA is that they are trying to have it both ways. They tell you, `There's no need for this because they are already voting.' Then they tell you that there is going to be a massive cost if you make them vote. What I do not understand is where the extra cost is coming from if they are already voting. They cannot have it both ways. If they have already got the systems in place and they are voting 92 per cent of the time, on what basis will they be charging fees if they are mandated to vote 100 per cent of the time? It is important to note that this is not what our amendments propose. Senator Campbell, I know it is not your portfolio area anymore but it is important that you understand that we are only asking people to vote on material matters.
—You haven't defined that, though.
—I think `material' in the judicial system and how it is understood is fairly well defined. I am not seeking to redefine a very commonly understood definition of `material' matters. The furphies that IFSA have come up with are pretty big. As I said, I hope they paid for breakfast. Just so you understand, in our view material resolutions would include matters such as remuneration and election of directors to the board. We have not created a definitive list. Instead we propose that the list be included in regulations to allow flexibility—the very thing you call for consistently—and consultation.
—So you will define it.
—It is not an exclusive list, Senator Campbell. By requiring disclosure of voting records in relation to a list of material resolutions in the regulations we are ensuring that a tick-a-box approach is not created.
—If you do define it, it's tick a box.
—No. Many pieces of legislation, Senator Campbell—I know you are not in charge of many pieces of legislation in your portfolio and so you do not get to do this very often—give guidance. They list a number of items and say, `This list is not exhaustive.'
—You've said you're going to have a regulation, so you're going to have a fuzzy regulation.
—You have introduced many pieces of what you are now calling fuzzy legislation, Senator Campbell. I am going to try to progress the debate. As Manager of Government Business in the Senate you normally encourage people to be brief. I can only presume, given your loquaciousness tonight, that you do not have as full a program as you have been telling us on this side of the chamber for some time you do. You are quite happy to spend a lot of time debating this issue, but I am conscious of a responsibility. I am confident that my colleagues would prefer it if we were to move it along, so I will conclude. 
The importance of these amendments should not be underestimated. Whilst Australia lags further behind international best practice on proxy voting by institutional investors, Labor—and I am hoping again tonight—with the help of the Democrats, is leading the debate in Australia. The amendments which I moved today will have the most profound impact on the corporate governance movement in Australia. We have an opportunity today to make Australia a leader in the field of corporate governance. If the Howard government votes against Labor's amendments, we can chalk up another win for IFSA, the vested interests and the faceless institutional investors who operate in their own private world. 
To the corporate governance movement around the world I give you this piece of advice: do not be surprised if the Howard government votes against greater transparency in relation to the voting activities of institutional investors. When push comes to shove, this government always backs the big end of town, and today I fear it will be no different. To vote in favour of a policy which is opposed by IFSA and the largest institutional investors in this country takes courage, Senator Campbell—a characteristic which is in short supply in the Howard government.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-22,"—This matter, despite the length of time we have dedicated to it this evening, was covered quite extensively on the first day of debate, from memory. I think that illustrates its importance. It is a very important issue because it is about the most fundamental aspect of corporate democracy, which is the registration of the thoughtful views of shareholders. I suspect most shareholders around the world today invest their shares through institutions. 
In my view—as I have put it previously—those institutions have a fiduciary duty to the beneficial owners of shares to exercise their vote. The substance of our view is not an aspect of contention. Neither the opposition nor the government takes the view that shareholders and institutions that have a fiduciary duty toward the beneficial owner of the shares, which they act for and manage, should not vote. But the question is: `Are they voting?' That is the fundamental issue that Senator Conroy is raising. Attached to that fundamental issue of whether they are voting is whether they are voting thoughtfully and in the interests of their clients as opposed to commercial advantage or responding to some inducement, which may be hidden. That is why Senator Conroy uses words like `disinfectant' to indicate an opposition to secrecy which can allow either thoughtlessness or corrupt voting. It is corrupt to vote for inducements or for considerations other than your clients' interests.
Where are the Democrats with these amendments? I return to the earlier debate. We said that, firstly, we are supporters of compulsory voting, because we believe it is the duty of institutions that act for or manage shares on behalf of share owners to exercise a vote; and, secondly, we are great supporters of corporate democracy. However, we recognise that there are transitional issues. The issues are: how well equipped are institutions with the systems and the people to move into full disclosure as well as full voting—because disclosure is different from voting? It is one thing to vote your shares; it is another thing to set up the web sites, to record those votes and to disclose them in that way. 
Our view was that you have to contest at this stage a basic proposition: do you require votes for the most important aspects of corporate resolutions, or do you require votes for all resolutions? The proposition put by Labor today is that some institutions—I might say a very substantial and large part of the market—should vote for all resolutions. The proposition we put the other day was that all institutions with a fiduciary duty should vote for three main areas: the election of directors, any issue to do with company constitutions and any issue to do with directors' remuneration. 
I had a look at the article referred to by Senator Conroy. It is headed: `United States reform will spark industry revolution' by Stephen Davis, 20 June 2004. It is quite interesting that one of the things quoted as exhibiting one of the most important areas where a vote will count is towards the end of the article. It says: 
N-PX—
which is the name for this system—
will expose those funds that slavishly endorse every corporate management position. Then there are the internet's financial chat rooms. Watch them blaze with comments such as `Why on earth did my blankety blank fund vote for Disney Chief Executive Officer, Michael Eisner?'
That illustrates my point that the election of directors is without doubt one of the most—in my view the most—important issues on which they should be exercising a vote and telling their shareholders how they voted and, if necessary, why they voted that way. Shareholders have an intense interest in the directors because it is the directors who represent the shareholders and who are responsible for the assets and the health of the company. I think that reinforces both my point and the points made by Senator Conroy. 
The other point, in brief response to the debate I have heard between the minister and the shadow minister, is that earlier in that article it says: 
That secrecy ends August 31, 2004—
four days before the election, folks—
when mutuals representing some 20 per cent of United States equity will have to file new N-PX forms showing how they voted all holdings at home and abroad in the previous year.
There is an important point there. They say `voting all holdings at home and abroad'. So, those funds that they name—like Fidelity, Vanguard, Templeton, TIAA-CREF and others—will be telling Australian shareholders how they have voted in our Stock Exchange and in our company resolutions, but our own funds will not. That is the sort of situation that will beg for catch-up.
The last thing I would say is that the government has a position and it is the minister's job to defend that position. However, I have seen previous circumstances—without reflecting at all on the minister's or anybody else's vote—where the minister, or any other minister, has strongly defended the government's position, the Senate has then put through a vote and later on the government has accepted that. So the fact that Senator Ian Campbell, the minister, may feel strongly about this in the debate and express himself very forcefully does not mean to my mind that the government would or should automatically reject the amendments. I say to the government: you have a basic choice. You can refuse my concept on behalf of the Democrats or Senator Conroy's concept on behalf of Labor or leave all as is, and if you do that I think catch-up will occur—I think Senator Conroy is right: the world will come to us even if we do not go to it—or you can accept one of our propositions or you can introduce your own compulsory voting program with transitional arrangements. Any of those would be an advance on a situation where we rely on votes which are apparently made on a unanimous basis—I have not done the research that Senator Conroy has done—almost always, it seems. One hundred per cent always vote with companies, they are never recorded and reasons are never given. Those things do not strike me as a proper exercise of fiduciary duty.
What we know in this chamber is that this bill has to come back. There are other amendments to it. I propose that this is another amendment that the government will have to review in the lower house. They will have to make a decision as to how they react to it and whether they support it, but the basic proposition is very sound. The basic proposition is that this set of amendments from Senator Conroy reinforces and increases shareholder participation and shareholder democracy. They encourage thoughtful voting and I hope they will display on the record the way and the reasons for the votes that are exercised. I think the consequence of that is good for shareholders. I am not at all surprised that Senator Conroy quotes the Australian Shareholders Association, because this is exactly the sort of issue about which they are concerned—that companies do feel the full force of shareholder opinion. Accordingly, with those fairly lengthy remarks—but I thought it was an important issue—I record that the Democrats will support Senator Conroy's amendments. 
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-06-22,"—I am very reliably informed that I have to move an amendment to my amendment. It has been circulated on sheet 4280. I move:
R(58)	Schedule 8, page 230 (after line 22), after item 15, insert:
15A At the end of section 300
Add:
	(16)	Where the listing rules of a listed market operator require the disclosure of substantial share-holding information in the annual report, the list of substantial shareholders in the annual report must include the name of a person which is disclosed to the listed company or responsible entity under section 672A or 672C and is kept in the register in accordance with 672DA.
I propose an amendment to Labor's original amendment to ensure consistency with the new register requirements in proposed section 672DA. Labor welcomes the government's decision to adopt Labor policy and reinstate a register for the disclosure of beneficial ownership. Labor's guide to the CLERP 9 amendments, which was released on 30 May this year, indicated that Labor would move an amendment to disclose beneficial ownership. I have two amendments to the government's provisions on the beneficial ownership register, which I will discuss when we debate the government amendments.
In the meantime, I will discuss Labor's amendment in relation to annual reports. In addition to disclosure of beneficial owners in a register, we believe that disclosure of the top 20 shareholders in the annual report should also be improved. Currently companies listed on the ASX are required to disclose in the annual report the names of their 20 largest shareholders. Many institutional shareholders hold their securities through nominee or custodial companies. This means that the disclosure of the largest shareholders in the annual report often results in the disclosure of nominee companies. Now that the government has agreed to require a register of beneficial owners, it seems only fair that such information on the 20 largest shareholders should also be disclosed in the annual report. Accordingly, Labor's amendment says that, where a company has information disclosed to it under the tracing provisions with respect to the real beneficial owners and this information is included in the new beneficial ownership register, the names of the beneficial owners should also be disclosed in the annual report in relation to the top 20 shareholders.
 (Senator Watson)—The question is that the opposition amendments be agreed to. ",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-06-22,"—I was going to explain why it is just a waste of time. This amendment is just a waste of time, because it has already been achieved.
—I put the question.
—Does Senator Murray want me to explain my reply?
—What I am hearing here is the minister reflecting on the vote of the chamber.
—I was seeking the call. I wanted to know if you would like me to explain why we are opposed to it.
—I certainly would, Minister. I had not realised you were going to speak. I thought you had indicated that you would not speak.
—It might be a good idea if all the participants addressed their comments through the chair.
—I was trying to do that, but you were looking the other way. I was seeking the call as you called for the vote because we believe the ALP amendment would not achieve any improvement in transparency and would, in a perverse way, reduce transparency by adding volumes to annual reports, which many, including the Australian Shareholders Association, would argue are already so voluminous that many shareholders do not bother to read them. Many companies in Australia have enormous trouble getting annual reports into standard available letterboxes. That is why I have been pushing very hard to ensure that annual reports are easily available electronically.
The trigger for disclosure of substantial shareholdings is unrelated to the information to be disclosed regarding beneficial ownership. The register for beneficial ownership is required to be kept regardless of the shareholding. Government amendments already deal with the disclosure of information provided to a company regarding the beneficial ownership of shares and therefore the information which this amendment requires to be disclosed in the annual report is already easily ascertainable. This amendment would therefore be unlikely to improve transparency and the only result would be voluminous information being included in the annual report. We can see no rationale for the amendment. If there is a rationale it is quite unclear. The trigger, as I have said, for the substantial shareholding is entirely unrelated to the information to be disclosed.
The amendments that have been moved by Senator Conroy seek to amend section 300 of the act, which requires that, where the listing rules require disclosure of substantial shareholding information in the annual report, the list of substantial shareholders must also include the name of the beneficial owners of the shares, which are included in the register of beneficial ownership in accordance with section 672DA. We say it is creating a significant new paperwork burden that does not assist the marketplace to understand the nature of the shareholding. You are basically increasing the amount of paper that exists. I would argue that one of the great problems we have in Australia is that it is hard, particularly for private investors, to understand many of these documents. All we are effectively doing here is saying, `Let us record in yet another place information that is already required to be recorded under proposed and existing law.' We think it is a waste of time and effort which could in a perverse way reduce the quality of information available to the marketplace.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-22,"—Unless Senator Conroy has a riposte to that, that seems a persuasive argument and I am glad it was made. The intent of the amendment, to achieve greater disclosure, is a good one but after a quick think about the minister's response and the reading of this it would seem to me that if you already have beneficial owners being exposed then going beyond that to what you are suggesting might result in getting a company that owns a company that owns a company—you see what I mean—and you end up with large diagrams and attachments to an annual report. This sort of approach would be better exhibited in another form if it was necessary. I am uncertain about the technical consequence; I do not disagree with the intent. ",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-06-22,"—I am bemused, frankly, by the minister's interpretation. Currently, the 20 names of the 20 biggest shareholders are listed. We are saying that where in the beneficial ownership roll, which is separate, there is now one name—there are not diagrams; the beneficial owner by definition is the true economic owner of the asset—we are seeking to take that name and simply insert it where there is one name currently in the annual report, which would be, perhaps, a holding company. All we are seeking to do is take a name that has already been revealed to the company on one roll and have it replace a name that is possibly not the beneficial owner or is just a holding company in the top 20. So there will only be 20 names. I am bemused by the minister's interpretation that there will somehow be something other than that. You have to now reveal beneficial ownership under the law. There will be a roll of beneficial owners. We are simply saying, `Take that name if you have it and put it in the annual report.' Unless something perverse is happening on the roll of beneficial owners, all we are doing is taking the top 20 and inserting them into the annual report. Perhaps Senator Campbell might want to explain further and we might get greater clarity.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-06-22,—It needs to have greater clarity because there is a genuine misunderstanding over the top 20 shareholders and the substantial shareholders. They can sometimes be similar but they are not always. Substantial shareholders are any entity that holds more than five per cent. If you then use the provisions which expose the beneficial owners of that five per cent then you can potentially be talking about hundreds and hundreds of beneficial owners. That is the reality. Because there is a lack of clarity—our people have been working assiduously trying to figure out the genesis of this—I would be happy to see the amendment negatived obviously and for our troops to brief Senator Murray while the bill is doing the walk across the hall and back. We think that Senator Conroy does not understand the amount of extra paperwork this will create. There seems to be a confusion between substantial shareholders and the top 20.

This is not one we will insist on, so I do not see any point in my agreeing to an amendment about which I am still uncertain as to how it will work out.

"Conroy, Senator Stephen",ALP,2004-06-22,"—I would just like to clarify this. I appreciate that the minister has managed to create a cloud in your mind, Senator Murray. Perhaps if I read it out it will become clear. This is in reference to the listing rules, which are quite clear. It says: 
Where the listing rules of a listed market operator require the disclosure of substantial shareholding information in the annual report—
where that is a requirement—
the list of substantial shareholders in the annual report must include the name of a person which is disclosed to the listed company or responsible entity under section 672A or 672C and is kept in the register in accordance with 672DA.
If you read this in conjunction with the listing rules, which are quite specific about what is to be revealed, it is perfectly clear. I appreciate that if you just had this and there was nothing else possibly involved in this, you may come up with the construction that the minister has come up with, but you need to understand that it says `where the listing rules' and you have to read it in conjunction with the listing rules. I appreciate the point you are making, Senator Murray, and I appreciate that perhaps Senator Ian Campbell has been able to cloud the debate somewhat, but it is really quite simple and straightforward. I do not accept the interpretation or construction that the minister is making.

—Mr Temporary Chairman, on a point of order: I ask that Senator Ian Campbell withdraws those comments. I think they are entirely unparliamentary and reflecting on Senator Murray's adviser like that is unacceptable. You are sitting there being advised by Treasury officials and no-one is being critical of them when we disagree. No-one is passing any reflection on the Treasury officials when they give you information that we do not agree with. To sit there and say that it is a disgrace that an unelected person is making decisions in the chamber is unacceptable. I ask you to withdraw it.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I am quite sure the minister did not mean it, even if he said it, because he would never expect me to say the same about the advisers in the box who so frequently have to advise ministers who do not know anything about the bills before them because they are there as duty ministers. We never complain about that, because it is quite right that you should take expert advice when it is available.

11A After section 179
Insert:
179A Procedures for merit selection of Government appointments
	(1)	The Minister must by writing determine a code of practice, for selecting a person to be appointed to a position under this Act by the Commonwealth or a Minister, that sets out general principles on which the selections are to be made, including but not limited to: 
	(a)	merit; and
	(b)	independent scrutiny of appoint-ments; and
	(c)	probity; and
	(d)	openness and transparency.
	(2)	After determining a code of practice under subsection (1), the Minister must publish the code in the Gazette.
	(3)	Not later than every fifth anniversary after a code of practice has been determined, the Minister must review the code.
	(4)	In reviewing a code of practice, the Minister must invite the public to comment on the code.
	(5)	A code of practice determined under subsection (1) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
Here we have a situation where the minister and the shadow minister can be in furious agreement. This will be the 24th time on which an amendment of this sort has been put.
—I know you are keeping a book on this.
—I am keeping a book on it. This will be the 24th time that this amendment has been put to one bill or another. The amendment is an astonishing one. It states:
The Minister must by writing determine a code of practice, for selecting a person to be appointed to a position under this Act ... including but not limited to:
(a)	merit; and
(b)	independent scrutiny of appointments; and
(c)	probity; and
(d)	openness and transparency.
It is an astonishing concept that appointments should be by merit! I remind those in the chamber who have not heard these remarks before that the amendments are drawn from Lord Nolan's commission of inquiry in Britain. I always regard Britain as a semi-democracy because it does not have a Senate. In Britain Lord Nolan was asked to have a look at the whole business of patronage and he came up with a set of recommendations and—Glory be!—the government and the parliament of Great Britain accepted them. So this is now standard practice. This standard practice in Britain seeks to prohibit patronage and favouritism. I was absolutely delighted to discover that in our own Australian Federal Police Act 1979 there is a prohibition on patronage and favouritism. It reads as follows:
The Commissioner, or delegate of the Commissioner, in exercising powers under this Act in relation to the engagement of AFP employees or otherwise in relation to AFP employees, must do so without patronage or favouritism.
If anyone wanted to amend my amendment and put that in instead, I would be delighted, but it is about time that the procedures for merit selection of government appointments were introduced and became standard practice and that patronage was diminished—by whichever government and whichever political party. And it is about time that our citizens were assured that nobody could ever be appointed without going through a merit process. Of course I do not mean to reflect on some absolutely magnificent appointments by the previous Labor government over time in all fields, and by this government over time. But there have been some real doozeys which definitely stink of patronage and favouritism. With those remarks, and in the expectation of this going down for the 24th time, I recommend the amendment to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech

He beavers away, he is always consistent, he always makes his argument and he always does it in such good humour—as he has done when putting this argument. As tempting as it is—drawing on Peter Reith, Michael Baume and Jim Short, all former politicians; all cronies of the government—to take up this opportunity, I am afraid I am once again going to have to decline on behalf of the opposition.

The opposition's amendments relate to analysts. I have already discussed these amendments during the second reading debate. I do not want to go into detail again, given the time. However, I would like to make the comment that the ASX also recently indicated it was concerned about analyst independence. Karen Hamilton, the head of the market integrity division of the ASX, is quoted in the Financial Review as saying:
There is concern that the recommendations of many brokers and analysts seem biased, driven not by an assessment of the investment opportunity but by the lure of commissions or the lucrative riches of the investment banking side of the business ...
This is a damning comment by the head of the market integrity division at the ASX. Ms Hamilton's comments reinforce the concerns which ASIC raised in their report into analyst independence in August 2003. ASIC's 2003 report said:
We did observe some systemic weaknesses in the ability of entities to adequately identify, manage and disclose conflicts of interest.
Labor's amendments will ensure that analysts fully disclose the remuneration and other benefits which might reasonably be expected to be capable of influencing the analyst in preparing the research report. Another amendment based on disclosure is our amendment which requires listed companies to establish a policy concerning trading in its own company's securities. This is not a radical proposal. The ASX's corporate government guidelines already recommend that companies have such a policy. In our view, it should be a requirement in law. 
ASIC's recommendations to Treasury on the original CLERP 9 policy paper state that disclosure is not sufficient in all cases. ASIC recommended that, at a fundamental level, the act needs to prohibit certain activities of analysts where conflicts cannot be effectively managed and that disclosure of such conflicts is not sufficient to mitigate consumer or market integrity risk. ASIC went on to recommend that the following activities be prohibited in the act: trading by an analyst or researcher in products that are the subject of a current research report within a set period and trading by an analyst or its individual researchers against a recommendation or opinion contained in a current research report. The CLERP 9 bill has failed to heed ASIC's recommendations. Instead, the bill inserts a requirement that says licensees are to manage their conflicts. This will be accompanied by an ASIC policy statement. The Howard government has taken a self-regulatory approach yet again, the very approach which ASIC found has failed. In their 2003 report, ASIC found that investment banks had ignored industry guidelines. To quote the report:
... industry guidelines developed by the Securities and Derivatives Industry Association ... and the Securities Industry of Australia ... have not been adopted as closely as intended and that there is still significant room for conflicts of interest to occur and to remain unmanaged.
In light of the failure of this self-regulatory approach, Labor's amendments prohibit trading by an analyst in a manner that is inconsistent with a recommendation or opinion contained in a current research report within the prescribed period. This will prohibit trading in securities which are the subject of a current research report within a prescribed period. This will require quiet periods by restricting the publication of any reports for a prescribed period after the analyst firm has acted in an IPO for the company that is the subject of a report. In addition, we require companies to disclose information provided during briefings to analysts.
The Australian Shareholders Association advised the committee that they endorsed Labor's proposal to require the disclosure of information provided during analyst briefings. If the government persist with their self-regulatory approach, Australian investors will suffer. When both ASIC and the head of the ASX market integrity division raise concerns about analysts, it is clear that problems in industry exist. Labor's amendments will address many of these concerns.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-06-22,"—Senator Conroy suggests that the ASX market integrity chief supports the approach of the Labor Party proposed here. In fact, if you read what Karen Hamilton said last week in the Financial Review article and if you have heard what she has said to forums I have convened discussing this very issue, you would know that she absolutely and solidly supports the new regulatory approach. It is not a self-regulatory approach; it is absolutely wrong to say that. To call a clear black-letter requirement—a new requirement that not only should firms manage conflicts of interest but put in place arrangements to manage them, and then for the regulator to put in through the policy statement a requirement to show how you do that—self-regulatory, is absolutely absurd. It is a whole new legal requirement. It is absolutely clear and it is backed up by new licensing requirements under the Financial Services Reform Act, which effectively means people who do not do this lose their licence. It is a very strict regulation; it is a very strict law. 
Senator Conroy said earlier the government have not had the guts to take on the top end of town. We are the government who stood up to the trustee industry and brought in the managed investments legislation. Who wimped out on that? The Australian Labor Party. We are the government who brought in the Financial Services Reform Act, which required the heaviest new regulation of financial services in Australian history and hundreds of millions of dollars of new investment by people in financial services, which we have copped enormous flak for out there in the community. That would have been something that Labor probably would have done in their 14th year in power! They absolutely wimped out on financial services and corporate issues for most of their 13 dismal years in power. 
We brought in financial services reforms. We brought in the managed investments legislation. We brought in new competition to banking. We have done all the hard yards on this stuff. We are the ones who have created infringement penalties through CLERP 9 and have copped all that. We have brought in whole new regulation for analysts, after years of work. All Labor have to do is say: `Gee whiz, this government are actually doing all the hard stuff. What will we do to differentiate the product?'
ASIC reject what Labor are trying to move tonight. Ian Johnson and the crew at ASIC who did the research into analyst independence and analysts in Australia, following the Wall Street collapses, found that the marketplace in Australia was much better regulated than Wall Street and that there were none of the systemic abuses that occurred in Wall Street—quite the opposite to what Senator Conroy says. ASIC support this model. That is why they have done the policy statement. ASIC think that this way of doing it is more likely to get a result than having a tick-a-box approach which has proved to be a failure wherever else it has been tried.
The approach that we have taken puts a lot more responsibility where you need it. It ensures that ASIC have the clear legislative power they need to take action where there are conflicts of interest and it gives them the regulatory backing, the legislative backing, for their policies, which are far more comprehensive than this grab bag of ideas that the Labor Party have passed off as a policy.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-06-22,"—In response to that tirade, let me quote from an editorial of another journal of left-wing conspiracies—the Financial Review.
Stockbrokers did not go out of their way to dispel their image as the wide boys of the public company securities market, Karen Hamilton, the Australian Stock Exchange's chief integrity officer, said last month. Ms Hamilton told the conference of the Securities & Derivatives Industry Association—
one which I actually spoke at with her—
—Name them.
—Pardon?
—Let us just see how Andrew is voting and get on with it. We do not need all of this.
—It goes on:
... they had reacted initially with resentment and hostility to invitations to address issues of ethics, integrity and analyst independence. In doing so, they had missed their chance to lead the debate rather than follow sullenly behind, she scolded.
The brokers' “attitude problem” may have been confirmed unwittingly by the responses of industry leaders to Ms Hamilton's charges. “We can't speak for everybody but the majority of people try to do the right thing,” David Horsfield, chief executive of the SDIA, lamely told this newspaper. Peter Mason, chairman of JP Morgan Australia, said: “Houses of repute have been well alert to this. You don't need someone to write it all down in a book to tell you that's the way you should behave.” 
But in a bull market, even houses of repute forget how to behave. This dismissive stance contrasts sharply with the way other financial market professionals—directors, auditors, lawyers and fund managers—responded to the challenge of restoring public confidence in the securities markets after the wave of company collapses ...
It goes on to say:
Even so, they—referring to the brokers—must accept they are operating in a retail as well as a professional market, one that mums and dads are encouraged to enter by government privatisation policies, and their observance of these rules hasn't been strict to date. Asic found last August that the self-regulatory code—
this is how the Financial Review describes your regime—
left plenty of room for conflicts of interest to go unchecked ...
The editorial goes on to say:
But for all Ms Hamilton's tough talk, the ASX is still happy for brokers to manage their own conflicts.
So do not stand up here and try to pretend that you are delivering anything other than your traditional self-regulation for this industry. You have caved into the vested interest once again. You are not introducing a new tough code. The only way we are going to deal with this is for you to support Labor's amendments.
Question agreed to. ",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-06-22,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments (61) and (62) on sheet 4216:
(61)	Schedule 11, page 242 (after line 14), after item 3, insert:
3A After subsection 136(3)
Insert:
	(3A)	Any further requirement specified in the constitution must not be inconsistent with this Act.
	(3B)	If a company has an existing further requirement in the constitution which is inconsistent with this Act, it is void.
	(3C)	Subsections (3A) and (3B) are subject to the exceptions in the regulations.
(62)	Schedule 1, page 23 (after line 13), after item 39, insert:
39A After subsection 249N(1A)
Insert:
	(1AB)	A further requirement in subsection 136(3) must not modify the application of subsection (1) or (1A).
	(1AC)	If a company constitution contains a further requirement which modifies the application of subsection (1) or (1A), this further requirement is void.
	(1AD)	Subsections (1AB) and (1AC) are subject to the exceptions in the regulations.
I call these amendments the Boral amendments. Amendment (61) relates to section 136(3). This amendment says that any further requirement specified in a company's constitution must not be inconsistent with the Corporations Act. This provision is subject to the exceptions in the regulations. Amendment (62) relates to section 249N. This amendment is very specific. The effect of this amendment is to make section 249N take precedence over section 136(3). This means that any further requirement which tries to modify the 100-member rule in section 249N is void. This amendment is also subject to the exceptions in the regulations. 
These amendments have arisen because Australia's institutional investors turned a blind eye as shareholders' rights were directly attacked by Boral at their AGM in October last year. Despite warnings from the Australian Shareholders Association, Corporate Governance International and the Australian Council of Super Investors, institutions overwhelmingly supported a Boral resolution which erodes shareholder democracy. Now that the resolution has been passed, Boral shareholders will need to have five per cent of the capital—about $160 million worth of Boral shares—in order to propose a resolution that amends the company's constitution. In my view, this is a direct attack on shareholders' rights and runs counter to the spirit of the Corporations Act 2001. Section 249N of the Corporations Act states that 100 shareholders who are entitled to vote at the meeting `may give a company notice of a resolution that they propose to move at a general meeting'. 
Boral has effectively denied each Boral shareholder the right to join with 99 other shareholders and propose a resolution on the company's constitution for debate at the general meeting. These amendments ensure that Boral does not set a precedent for other companies to circumvent the spirit of the Corporations Act. Let us make this clear: what Boral did last year was a disgrace. Boral and its management should be ashamed of themselves. It has attacked its own shareholders. It has turned its back on its own shareholders simply because it did not like some of the issues that were to be debated on the floor of an annual general meeting. It is not good enough. It deserves to be repudiated by the chamber and it deserves to be dealt with and supported by the government.
In conclusion—and the good news, Senator Campbell, is this is my final contribution for the evening unless you decide this needs to be responded to—if the government votes against Labor's amendments, they are voting against enhanced accountability in relation to audit; enhanced disclosure in relation to executive remuneration; enhanced disclosure in relation to analyst independence; enhanced accountability of analysts; increased accountability of directors; better transparency in relation to the Financial Reporting Council; and better disclosure in relation to proxy voting by fund managers and trustees of super funds. If the government chooses to vote against our reforms which empower shareholders, they will be voting against reforms which will increase shareholder activism in Australia. The Howard government is fighting against a global tide in relation to disclosure of proxy votes by institutional investors. Anyone who owns shares, anyone with superannuation and anyone who has been outraged by obscene salary packages will welcome Labor's amendments to the CLERP 9 bill.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-06-22,"—Before we conclude, I would like to thank Senator Murray and his office for all their contributions and suggestions as part of what has been a lengthy debate over a number of years. I am sure, ultimately, we will be back, Senator Murray, doing some more corporate law reform. I think Senator Ian Campbell has promised us CLERP 10, and I know everyone in the country is looking forward to that. I would also like to thank the Treasury officials who I know have worked extensively on this and I know that Senator Murray, despite our sometimes heated exchanges, is interested in good public policy. With the indulgence of the chamber, I would like to thank my own office and adviser who have worked long and hard on this. I believe they deserve some recognition for all the work that has gone into this.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-06-22,"—The Extension of Charitable Purpose Bill 2004 represents part of the government's limited reform in response to the inquiry into the definition of charities. The inquiry represented an ideal opportunity for fundamental reform to the charities sector providing greater transparency and certainty. However, the Liberal government has squibbed it on tackling any fundamental reform. It all became too hard for a government that has run out of steam and run out of touch—and, hopefully, will be run out of government.
—Who wrote this crap?
—My colleague Mr Cox assisted in writing this speech, with a little embellishment from me. The draft charities definition bill included the codification of the common law definition of a charity. This would have provided greater certainty to the charities sector, but the complete mishandling of the release of the draft legislation created—justifiably—widespread fear and confusion. The draft legislation was, rightly or wrongly, interpreted as limiting the ability of charities to participate in public policy debates. The confusion and fear created reflect the lack of trust the charities sector has in the Howard-Costello Liberal government.
The report of the inquiry into the definition of charities and related organisations recommended that the common law definition of a charity be codified. Under common law, to be a charity an organisation must satisfy that two elements exist. They must show that they exist for the public benefit and are within the spirit and intention of the preamble to the Statute of Elizabeth. Let me emphasise that the Statute of Elizabeth is an English statute more than 400 years old—obviously, it is older than Australia itself. While the government now argues that the common law provides greater certainty to the charities sector, this is a fallacy. There are many impediments to relying on common law. 
First, charities must understand and be on top of almost 400 years of case law to determine whether changes in their activities will affect their charitable status. This creates widespread uncertainty. Charities do not want to have to employ lawyers to get advice on the preamble to the 400-year-old Statute of Elizabeth. The ATO can simply issue a new ruling or tighten its interpretation of the law, and a charity can find itself in uncertain and unknown territory. Codifying the definition of a charity would have provided charities with greater certainty.
Secondly, judges cannot be in control of cases which come before them. Unlike parliament, they cannot respond to the changing needs of the charities sector. While this bill goes some way towards responding to the changing community perception of what a charity is, it does so in an ad hoc manner. Despite recommendations from its own Board of Taxation on clarifying the draft definition of charity bill, the government simply gave up on these important reforms. We are left with minor extensions to what constitutes a charitable purpose in this bill. This is yet another example of a tired government that has simply lost the drive to take on even the minor battles required to implement change.
The bill extends the scope of charitable purpose to include the provision of community not-for-profit child care; self-help organisations; and enclosed religious orders. Subject to meeting other common law tests, they would then enjoy charitable status and various tax concessions, including fringe benefits tax, GST and income tax concessions. The provision of not-for-profit child-care services is currently not considered a charitable purpose. Given the inadequate funding and support provided by the Howard-Costello Liberal government to this sector, the fact that they are providing charitable status should be viewed a little cynically. Most importantly, the bill completely ignores the important role performed by playgroups in the development of children.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-06-22,"—Before I commence my contribution I seek leave to speak for in excess of 10 minutes if required.
Leave granted.
—I thank the Senate. I rise tonight to pay tribute to Tasmania's former Premier Jim Bacon. I do so on behalf of all my colleagues, but most particularly my Tasmanian colleagues, Senator O'Brien, Senator Sherry, Senator Mackay and Senator Denman. Such is the affection in which Jim Bacon was held by his comrades in the Tasmanian branch of the ALP that they are too distressed by his passing to speak tonight.
Jim died early Sunday morning after a terrible battle against the cancer which forced him to stand down in March from what he described as the job of his life. Faced with the most harrowing of circumstances, Jim displayed the most admirable of qualities: dignity, determination, courage and optimism. The shocking news of Jim's inoperable cancer propelled Tasmanian state politics to national prominence. For many Australians, probably their first real encounter with Jim Bacon was the grace and dignity he displayed in announcing his illness and resignation. He won national admiration for his determination to fight as hard as he could and to make the most of whatever time he had left. 
His decision to use his own tragic circumstances to warn others of the dangers of smoking I think was moving to us all. A smoker for more than 30 years, Jim had no hesitation in saying that he accepted full responsibility for his illness. He called himself an idiot for smoking and urged others to quit or not take up the—and I quote Jim—`stupid, stupid habit'. But his frankness, his dignity, his courage and above all his optimism were no surprise to the people of his beloved adopted home, Tasmania, nor to his comrades in the labour movement.
Jim Bacon was extraordinarily popular in Tasmania, in no small part because of his compassion for his fellow citizens and his determination to do all he could to offer them opportunities to live full lives in a civil and civilised society. Jim had a fundamental understanding that public prosperity was crucial to giving Tasmanians economic and personal security. He knew from his own experience that private prosperity was but fragile protection against changing circumstances. His own middle-class, comfortable childhood was swept away by his father's early death when Jim was only 12. From then on, his mother would struggle to bring up five children on a war widows pension and what she could earn from night nursing. 
Jim was able to continue his education at Scotch College due to a bursary. A Commonwealth scholarship made it possible for him to go to Monash University when he finished school. At Monash he found the radical left highly appealing to his sense of outrage at the established order. Jim was a prominent militant at Monash University during the days of the Vietnam moratorium. His Maoist revolutionary philosophy served him better on the barricades than in the classroom. 
Labouring work on building sites followed, where he found the politics of the Builders Labourers Federation a natural fit. He rose rapidly through the ranks, a loyal lieutenant to Norm Gallagher from 1973 to 1979. Some might now say that loyalty was misplaced. But loyalty was always Jim Bacon's keystone. In 1980 he went to Tasmania as BLF State Secretary, a job that changed his life. Quite simply, he fell in love with the state that he came to describe as a unique `archipelago in the Southern Ocean'.
In nine years as the Tasmanian State Secretary, Jim came to moderate the radical expression of his ideas, although not his passionate commitment to social justice and equality. His pragmatism was always in means and methods rather than in principles. In 1989 Jim was unanimously elected Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council. In that year as well he joined the executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, where he served until 1995.
In 1996 Jim was elected to the House of Assembly in the Hobart seat of Denison. Less than a year later he took over from Michael Field as Labor leader in a smooth and bloodless transition. Jim had been marked as a future leader from his election. Eighteen months later he led the Tasmanian Labor Party to a resounding victory. In July 2002 he won the first back-to-back outright majority Labor government since Doug Lowe more than 20 years earlier. His personal popularity was such that he polled a record 21,391 votes in Denison. In fact, whenever you talk about any of Jim's elections—to parliament, to positions in the party or in the labour movement—the words to use are `overwhelming', `unanimous' or `uncontested' because people just knew that Jim was the man for the job, whatever that job might be. 
But the premiership of Tasmania was the job of his life. It is not an exaggeration to say he turned Tasmania around. He brought optimism back to Tasmania, because his own optimism was so contagious and so relentless. He was sometimes known as `Good News Jim' because of it. And who could ever forget Jim Bacon at the news conference at which he announced he had inoperable lung cancer, pausing and then saying: `The good news is ...'. `Good News Jim' brought good times back to Tasmania. I would like to quote Jim's State of the State address to the Tasmanian parliament last September. During the five years of Labor's majority reign, Jim said: 
... Tasmania has become a different place. There is now a sense of excitement and optimism in the community.
In no small part, that was founded on the restoration of the state's economy. Maoist revolutionary or not, Jim could make the hard decisions when it came to balancing budgets. But he knew that revitalising his beloved adopted state would take more than budget bottom lines. He knew that he had to make Tasmania a place where people wanted to live. And he knew that the key to that transformation was openness and inclusiveness, a vibrant and welcoming public culture. Jim Bacon led the way in Tasmanian mainstream politics to removing longstanding discrimination against gay and lesbian Tasmanians, taking Tasmania from the most backward state in Australia to the most progressive. His government passed antidiscrimination legislation that has been described as among the most progressive not only in Australia but also throughout the world.
He will always be remembered for his dedicated and passionate campaigning for social justice for Tasmania's Indigenous community and for the bridges he built between government and those communities. In fact, you could say that he built bridges wherever he went. One of the most enduring memories that the people of Tasmania will carry of him is the regular forums he held in the small towns and suburbs of Tasmania. Government for Jim Bacon was something done with citizens, not to them. He introduced consultative reforms as Premier like Tasmania Together, a community consultative process that sets a series of goals and benchmarks for government as well as formal partnerships with councils, the university and other institutions.
From student politics to the union movement to the Premier's office, Jim Bacon proved that there is no weakness in wearing your heart on your sleeve. One of the ways that Jim wore his heart on his sleeve was in his very public love and devotion to the woman he called `my darling Honey'. Jim's wife, Honey, has been a constant support to him throughout their marriage and I know most particularly in the last, terribly difficult months of his life. They have always been a close couple, but also a close political partnership. I can honestly say that I do not think I have seen a closer partnership in politics. When Honey said on Sunday that Jim had loved his job leading Tasmania as much as he loved her, all those who knew them understood she was speaking of the greatest possible measure of devotion.
Our thoughts and our deepest sympathy are with Honey, with Jim's sons Scott and Mark, and his stepson, Shane; with his mother, Joan, and sisters Jenny, Mary and Wendy. The tragedy of Jim's early death will be felt most keenly by his family, but his loss is felt by us all—across Tasmania, the labour movement and the Labor Party. There are very few people who can truly be said to be irreplaceable, and our friend and comrade Jim Bacon was one of those few. Tonight we mourn his loss.
