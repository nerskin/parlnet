"Fischer, Tim, MP",NP,2001-09-27,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian Official Observer Delegation to the 2001 Constituent Assembly Election in East Timor, 28 August to 1 September 2001 and seek leave to make a statement in connection with the report.
Leave granted.
—It is a privilege, in making my last speech to this parliament, that I do so on an occasion of work orientation, rather than on anything sentimental. I am very happy about that. This afternoon, I should make way for other colleagues retiring, as I have had the opportunity elsewhere and previously, including at the dispatch box, to say thankyou to my electors, to my wife, Judy Fischer, to Bill Bott and to many others. I stand by those words of appreciation.
Today, however, I focus on this report on the second election held in East Timor, two years to the day after the popular consultation, when the East Timorese people chose, by 78 per cent to 22 per cent, to elect to become independent of Indonesia. Two years on, much has been achieved. I have made a total of four visits there: a week in 1999, for a bit of the mayhem following that particular ballot, twice more, and then last August to September for the second ballot. It is great to see the progress: the security that has been reinstated, the buildings which have been repaired, the refugees that have returned— sadly, not all—and such necessary steps as the Timor Gap treaty negotiations concluded between Australia and East Timor. There is more work to be done with regard to sovereign risk aspects in respect of the East Timor administration. The delegation met with Jose Ramos Horta and others, and raised those issues, as well monitoring the ballot. There seems to be a quiet determination to get that issue sorted, particularly the taxation aspect, and to work it through, and to step back from certain statements that were released upon the completion of those negotiations.
With regard to the ballot, I led the delegation and we met with many. I am pleased that I am joined by colleagues who were in the delegation. It was the same as last time with the exception of Mr Laurie Brereton, who was replaced by Mr Kevin Rudd, and also included Senator Marise Payne, Senator Vicki Bourne, very professional officers of DFAT on both occasions, NGOs, Mr Adam Roach and others. We went to eight very impressive polling places around the Bacau area. The poll was extremely well conducted with computerised electoral rolls. The process within the polling place was absolutely impeccable. In all that we saw, there was absolute integrity attaching to the elections in East Timor, which led to the declaration of a result: 88 members elected to the new Constituent Assembly. I note that 55 of those seats were won by the Fretilin, with a mixture of other parties and independents holding the balance.
The report I table today on behalf of the delegation makes a number of recommendations which I will not go through other than to highlight the fact that there will be the need for more confidence building on the education side, especially with regard to elections and other assistance, and a connection between this parliament and East Timor. With regard to the East Timor effort, I particularly salute the work of the Navy, Army and Air Force—people such as Peter Cosgrove and Ken Brownrigg—the Australian Electoral Commission and all those involved on that side of things, the CIVPOL, UNTAET and all involved in their heroic work over the recent years, James Batley and the diplomatic team which have stood the test of time at post in Dili, East Timor, and the non-government NGO movement and people such as Father Frank Brennan and others. They can walk tall. East Timor and the East Timorese people can walk tall with regard to the progress they have made in their nation building. Above all else, I make the point that Australia collectively, the Australian government under the leadership of Prime Minister John Howard, and all those directly involved can be very proud of the work carried out on the ground in East Timor. 
As for its future, I am more upbeat than many, having made a study on a range of fronts of the economic capacity of this small nation. Why am I upbeat? It is because there is a place in the world architecture for countries such as Mauritius, Bhutan, Singapore and, of course, East Timor. East Timor does have oil and gas capability, now negotiated between Australia and East Timor, which will generate millions of dollars of revenue—US dollars at that. It does have organic agriculture, including organic tea and coffee capacity, which is exciting, and, in my role as chairman of the Crawford fund on international agricultural research, it is just terrific to see the progress that is being made in getting organic tea and coffee production expansion, rice industry expansion and fisheries expansion. I see quite a good future for East Timor feeding itself and moving back into a limited export role.
Finally, I make the point that East Timor will need to build good relations with Indonesia particularly as part of its future equation, with Australia and with all its neighbours. We were encouraged at the end of monitoring the poll in the purposefulness of the leaders we had met in East Timor and their far-sighted approach, notwithstanding the unacceptable mayhem, that they should take the step of expanding their trade and other links between East Timor and Indonesia, and between East Timor and Australia.
I thank Minister Alexander Downer, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and all involved for the privilege of leading the delegation to East Timor. As I conclude 31 years in state and federal parliaments, the most exciting week of all my activities associated with being a member of parliament representing my electors one way or the other was undeniably the time spent monitoring the popular consultation in East Timor on 30 August 1999. I look forward to returning, hopefully with my family. I will help establish the tourist industry by taking my family to be good tourists in East Timor. It is a beautiful country deserving of a great future. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Australian Official Observer Delegation to the 2001 Constituent Assembly Election in East Timor, 28 August to 1 September 2001</title>",Delegation Reports,9,1
"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2001-09-27,"—by leave—I rise to support the report of the Australian Official Observer Delegation to the 2001 Constituent Assembly Election in East Timor which has just been delivered by the member for Farrer, who was the head of delegation in which I participated in East Timor for the purpose of that country's first democratic election. The member for Farrer led our delegation with distinction, and he has served this parliament with distinction throughout his parliamentary career. We on our side commend him as he goes into the future.
East Timor is a fragile democracy, with 400 years of Portuguese colonial rule, 25 years of Indonesian military occupation and now, for the first time, a democratic ballot. It was a privilege for those of us who were there to participate in this first democratic act on the part of the peoples of East Timor. The success of the conduct of that election was due in part to the Independent Electoral Commission, supported in large measure through AusAID, but, more particularly, through the agency of AusAID, the Australian Electoral Commission. Very little is known in this country of the role played by the Australian Electoral Commission in the conduct of democratic ballots around the world. They have done it in Cambodia, they have done it most recently in Indonesia and they have now done it in East Timor, and there are many other places around the world where this has occurred.
This has given an enormous fillip to Australia's international diplomatic standing over the course of the last decade. I believe it is important that, as we approach the next decade, we see this as part and parcel of Australia's future diplomatic engagement with the rest of the world. We, in this country, have a proud reputation as a robust democracy and as a democracy that runs fair elections. That is a rare reputation to have in the world, and it is through AusAID and the Australian Electoral Commission that we can take that assistance to emerging democracies around the world and do this nation's international standing enormous good. In particular, I commend the personal contribution of Mr Michael Maley of the AEC, who was based in Dili for a long period of time and was, in my judgment, the centre pin for ensuring that the professionalism of the IEC worked in the case of that ballot. 
The second ingredient of the success of this ballot was the role played by CIVPOL and by AUSBATT. Without security, you could not have conducted an effective democratic election. I commend in particular in the sector in East Timor in which we were, Bobonaro, the AFP officer Neil Royle, who was in charge of the CIVPOL district, and the current commander of AUSBATT, Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Segelman. The sheer professionalism of these representatives of Australia in the field left many of us in complete admiration for the work that they do in the difficult circumstances under which they do it. It is little known in this parliament how dangerous the border regions between East Timor and West Timor still are, yet these individuals—particularly at a difficult time when a ballot was about to be held—did not flinch from their responsibilities, conducted those responsibilities with great professionalism and ensured security in the minds of the East Timorese people in the conduct of the ballot.
The event of East Timor's independence causes us to reflect momentarily on the overall importance of foreign policy to this nation's future. Rarely in our history has international policy, foreign policy and security policy been so much to the fore of this nation's consciousness. Stability and security in East Timor are critical for our strategic environment. Stability and security in the Indonesian Republic are critical for our strategic environment. Stability in South Asia, Central Asia and in the Middle East is now seen as critical to our future security as well. Robust and uncompromising border security is also critical to Australia's national security. Effective Australian diplomatic engagement in the countries of this region is equally critical to our future security, and an effective and professional Australian Defence Force— augmented, we hope, in the future by an Australian Coast Guard—is equally integral to Australia's future security. In all these things, let all of us in this country have a continued abhorrence for any manifestation of the politics of race.
In conclusion on East Timor, what we see is a future challenge for all of us and for future governments of Australia to ensure that the politics of this new democracy remain stable, to ensure that its economy develops effectively through long-term capacity building, to ensure that the refugees are returned from the west to the east and are not forgotten, to ensure that the relationship with Indonesia—to which the member for Farrer has just referred—is restored and to ensure that we have to our north a stable and effective country. Long beyond when it ceases to be newsworthy in Australia, ceases to feature on the television news and ceases to feature in the page one news stories of our national newspapers, as a mark of a decent society in this country it is important that we remain engaged with a country whose development needs are great and whose security is integral to our own security future as well.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>Australian Official Observer Delegation to the 2001 Constituent Assembly Election in East Timor, 28 August to 1 September 2001</title>",Delegation Reports,9,1
"Kemp, Dr David, MP",LP,2001-09-27,"—I move:
That the requested amendment be not made.
This amendment is a request to the House of Representatives to provide for an additional $30 million under the appropriation in section 111 of the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000. I can advise from the outset that the government will not agree to the request from the Senate and will propose to advise the Senate accordingly.
The government has already delivered this $30 million to government schools through funding provided in the 2001-02 budget. The coalition provided an extra $238 million for government schools in this year's budget— including $143 million over four years through funding identified by the enrolment benchmark adjustment and applied to develop students' scientific, mathematical and technological skills; $28.8 million for literacy and numeracy over 2001-02 and 2002-03; $23.8 million over five years to support online curriculum; $32.7 million over four years to assist people moving from school to further education by maintaining the Jobs Pathway program at its current high level; $6.7 million over four years to the Enterprise and Career Education Foundation for extra work placement coordinators in remote areas of Central and Northern Australia; and $2.5 million to pilot career and transition advisers.
Of the specific schools initiatives in this year's budget, 87 per cent of the funding is directed to the 69 per cent of students in the government sector, demonstrating the commitment of the government to government schools. On a proportionate basis, this is $50 million more than government schools could expect on the basis of their enrolments and $20 million more than is being requested by the opposition in this request. The government seeks to improve outcomes for all students by strengthening both government and non-government schools. To put this in context, it should be noted that this government's spending on government schools is at the highest level ever. Total funding for government schools in 2002 is $2.2 billion from the Commonwealth, some $669 million more than Labor provided in its last year of office and an increase of 43 per cent. In the four years to 2004, total funding directly to government schools in tied grants from the Commonwealth will be around $9 billion. Without speedy passage of this bill, new schools will be denied their entitlements, which defeats the purpose of the grants in assisting new schools with their recurrent costs in their formative years.
Next Monday will be 1 October and the 54 new non-government schools with an entitlement for an establishment grant will not be paid unless the Labor Party passes this legislation. The Nyikina Mangala community school in the Kalgoorlie electorate will not receive $4,500 owed to it and, while that might seem a small sum of money, that is a very significant sum of money to that very poor school community. The Lumen Christi Catholic College in the Eden-Monaro electorate will not receive its $17,750. The Bentleigh Chabad Jewish Day School in the Hotham electorate will not receive $6,000. The Living Faith Lutheran Primary School in the Dickson electorate will not receive $23,792. This is a disgraceful action on a part of the Labor Party. It is a precursor of the new schools policy that would be introduced by a Beazley government, if such a government were ever elected. It is a sign of things to come from the Labor Party, that it intends to drag money out of needy schools in the non-government sector in order to fund its so far uncosted and wild promises. The cynicism and hypocrisy involved in the Labor Party's actions in this is almost beyond belief. The government therefore urges that the House reject the Senate's requested amendment.",REPS,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,10,1
"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,2001-09-27,"—This entire debate is about one simple question: should we treat all Australian students the same? Should we ensure that all Australian students are entitled to support and funding assistance from the federal government on a fair and equal basis? The Labor Party, with the cooperation of the Democrats and the Greens, have moved this amendment in the Senate because we believe that the government should not be providing this increase in funding for establishment grants for non-government schools unless the government is prepared to provide a balancing increase in funding for students at government schools. All we are asking for is an extra $30 million for the 70 per cent of Australian students at public schools across the country. It is a request for $30 million extra for students at government schools at a time when the government has blown about $40 million in government advertising in the months of August and September. All we are saying is that the many students at the 7,000 government schools across the country deserve a fair go. 
Why is there a problem at the moment? There is a problem today because the man sitting at this table, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, has made a series of blunders. Last year he made a mistake when he massively underestimated how many new non-government schools there would be and how much this establishment grant program would cost. When his department told him in October that there was a massive underfunding of this program, he sat on his hands and did nothing, despite the fact that we spent weeks in both chambers of this parliament debating what should happen to the states grants bill.
He continued to sit on his hands throughout the months of January, February, March, April and May, and it was not until June that the minister, having been told last October that there was a problem, came into this House and moved the corrective legislation. He then sought to score political points by wrapping up the extra establishment grant funding with some higher education funding, and it was not until he was forced in the Senate to split those two measures that we were able to ensure that those other measures were able to pass.
This minister could have fixed the problem from last October. Every day since June, the minister has known that, if he wants the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001 passed, he has to do one thing and one thing alone: provide a balancing increase in funding for government schools. This minister has not done this because he has an ideological obsession with taking money away from government schools at every opportunity. Today we had the laughable example of the minister trying to argue that the government has given at least an extra $30 million to government schools because they abolished the enrolment benchmark adjustment. So this is a government and a minister that take money away from government schools and then say, `That is a fair way to treat government schools, that we give them extra money by giving them back money we have already stolen from them.' The minister claims that that should in some way balance an extra funding increase for students at non-government schools.
For 30 years the Labor Party has been a strong defender of funding to non-government schools on a needs basis. Our view has not been that we should in some way deny non-government schools access to fair funding. Despite the false, misleading and deceiving claims by this minister on many occasions, the Labor Party supports funding to needy non-government schools. We support funding to non-government schools on a need basis.
We oppose the $1 million a year average increases to the 58 wealthiest non-government schools in Australia—those category 1 schools like the Kings School and Geelong Grammar which are this minister's highest priority. Our highest priority is the needy schools throughout Australia, whether they are in the government or the non-government sector. Through the education priority zone program, we are going to ensure that extra Commonwealth government funds go to those needy schools, whether they are Catholic, Christian or public schools. They are the schools that should be the highest priority, not the Kings School and Geelong Grammar; not the schools that you are trying to shovel massive increases to over coming years. It is for those reasons that not only do we intend to press this amendment today but, if the parliament comes back in later weeks, we will time and time again hold this minister responsible for providing a decent level of funding to government schools. He claims that government schools have had an increase, but they would know if they had had a 43 per cent increase. They know that all this minister has given them is basically the inflation indexation. (Time expired)
Motion (by Dr Kemp) agreed to:

"Sciacca, Con, MP",ALP,2001-09-27,"— The Migration Legislation Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 2001 is one that has been around now for some years. In fact, it was brought before the parliament before the last parliamentary term ended. For some time the opposition have been against the provisions of the bill on the basis that we do not believe the bill will pass the test of a challenge to the High Court. Accordingly, I move: 
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:
(1)	expresses its concern that amendments passed by the Senate that have attempted to exclude the original jurisdiction of the High Court in migration matters may be found to be unconstitutional or ineffectual;
(2)	observes that the Government is yet to table its legal advice which confirms the constitutionality or efficacy of these measures;
(3)	expresses its concern that the amendments may actually increase the number of migration decisions challenged in the High Court which will further delay the processing of migration cases and result in a further drain on our legal system;
(4)	expresses its concern that the Government has not addressed the issue of vexatious or unwarranted proceedings being commenced as a tactical delay to the implementation of migration decisions;
(5)	notes that the Opposition provided to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs an alternative proposal to provide a fair but speedy form of judicial review in the form of a `one stop shop' at the Federal Magistrates level; and
(6)	expresses its disappointment that the Government has not provided a more constructive response to that proposal”.
The opposition, in the spirit of bipartisanship that was offered with respect to all these migration bills that have recently been before the Senate and the House, have agreed that we will allow this bill to pass. We do so, though, without in any sense or form being of the view that this is the answer to the problem. There is no question that the current system is failing because of the lengthy delays that occur in determining migration and refugee issues. I make this point: whilst the government have wanted the public to think that these appeals are only there for refugee appeals, for asylum seekers, the reality is that what the government are doing with this bill is effectively abolishing any rights of appeal to the court in all migration decisions. It is true that a significant number of these appeals have nothing whatsoever to do with refugees. A lot of these appeals are by people appealing normal migration decisions from the Migration Review Tribunal, not from the Refugee Review Tribunal. I guess that when people realise this they may not think this is as good a response as they had thought it was.
The reality is that currently determinations in migration and refugee matters are made by a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. An application may then be made for review of that decision to the Migration Review Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal, as the case may be. Unsuccessful applicants then have two avenues of further appeal. The first avenue is to the Federal Court under a restricted range of grounds specified in part 8 of the Migration Act. An appeal from the decision of the Federal Court can then be lodged with the full court of the Federal Court. An application for special leave to appeal to the High Court can also be made. The second avenue is directly to the High Court under section 75(v) of the Constitution—known as the original jurisdiction of the High Court. In practice, applicants usually choose one of these avenues but not both.
The Migration Act currently prohibits the High Court remitting migration and refugee matters to any other court for review. This means that the judges of the High Court must themselves sit in judgment on matters involving applications for refugee status. This is placing enormous pressure on High Court judges, who now spend considerable time hearing these low-level migration matters rather than attending to the proper business of the court as the nation's highest court of appeal—namely, constitutional issues, the application of the general criminal law and the ever burgeoning complexity of commerce related legislation. This is what concerns the opposition.
We have said to the government, as we have done on every piece of migration legislation that has come before this House in the last 2½ years, that we will pass this legislation because the minister and the government say that they need every one of these migration matters to send appropriate messages to people smugglers. We in the Labor Party have continually said we are as one with the government when it comes to trying to stop the people smugglers. But the fact is that we are in opposition and we are supposed to point out difficulties to the government when we perceive that there are difficulties. With this particular piece of legislation, we have said continually that we believe that if this goes to the High Court and it is challenged, as it almost certainly will be, the High Court may well knock it out on the basis that we are interfering with their original jurisdiction under the Constitution. We have made that clear to the minister; we still believe that to be the case. 
I know that the minister in particular likes to make it look to the public that we are in fact in opposition to a lot of these matters. The reality is that, after today, we have passed every piece of domestic legislation to do with the people-smuggling. The only one we did not pass was the original border protection legislation, which no self-respecting political party anywhere in the Western world would have passed. We said there were problems with it, we told the government what those problems were, they brought it back and we have passed it. That means that we have, in effect, a 100 per cent record of straight-out bipartisanship on these issues. That does not mean to say that we believe that everything they have done is correct. But, as I said, we have made this decision that we will support them, and we have supported them.
With respect to this bill, we had what we believed to be an appropriate solution. We had a set of amendments that we gave to the minister and asked for comments on. The amendments were not accepted. It is appropriate for me, on behalf of the federal opposition, to put on the record what our solution was. At the moment, as I have said, there is substantial legal opinion that it would be unconstitutional to attempt to exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court in migration matters. That is because there is an explicit guarantee in the Constitution that the High Court has authority to hear applications for judicial review. It is highly unlikely that the High Court would accept that its original jurisdiction to hear migration matters could be excluded by way of legislation.
In August 2001 the Howard government introduced legislation which confers jurisdiction on the Federal Magistrates Court to hear appeals under the Migration Act. This legislation will give the Federal Magistrates Court concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Court to hear migration appeals; that is, both the Federal Magistrates Court and the Federal Court have the authority to accept and deal with appeals from the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal. Applicants who have had their appeals rejected by the tribunal will be entitled to choose whether to appeal to the Federal Court, as per the current rules, or to the Federal Magistrates Court. However, applicants who choose the Federal Magistrates Court to hear their case will automatically be entitled to a further appeal to the Federal Court. Despite the government's stated claim that it is seeking to simplify appeal mechanisms, this may paradoxically create more opportunities for unsuccessful applicants to delay the resolution of their cases by introducing yet another layer of appeal. The amendments were put together not only by my colleague the member for Denison, who is one of my predecessors in this job and who knows this issue backwards, but also by my colleague the member for Barton, the shadow Attorney-General and me. The three of us are lawyers of great experience.
—Eminent!
—I am not eminent in constitutional law, but certainly my colleague the member for Denison is a well-known constitutional expert. We brought forward the amendments without trying to throw the baby out with the bath water. As I have said, we accept that the government was not prepared to do it. I must put on record what that plan was, because it should be known by the public of Australia that we believed that we had a resolution to what we considered to be a problem. If our plan had been implemented, it would not have been challenged before the High Court, would have kept some sort of judicial review, but would have had a number of provisions to stop vexatious appeals. 
Labor's amendments would have provided for fair and expeditious review of applications while discouraging the bringing of applications which had no merit. Labor's amendments would have retained judicial review, but they would have allowed applicants only a single opportunity for judicial review in the Federal Magistrates Court. There would have been no right of appeal from a decision of a federal magistrate. It would have been expected that most applicants would choose to lodge an appeal from a decision of the tribunal directly with the Federal Magistrates Court. The Federal Magistrates Court would then have applied the existing rules in part 8 of the Migration Act to determine the outcome of an appeal. The amendments would also have given the Federal Magistrates Court jurisdiction to hear matters which currently can be heard only by the High Court, because the High Court is prohibited from remitting those matters to other courts. Some applicants may have elected to seek a review of a decision of the Migration Review Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal in the original jurisdiction of the High Court, as is presently the case. However, our amendments would have allowed the High Court to send those cases directly to the Federal Magistrates Court for decision. It was envisaged that the High Court would refer all but the most exceptional cases to the Federal Magistrates Court so that either way the matter would have been heard in the Federal Magistrates Court and dealt with fairly and quickly.
One of the major parts of the amendments that we put to the minister was to try to discourage appeals with no reasonable prospect of success. There is absolutely no doubt that there are lawyers and migration agents around this country who, knowing full well that people have no chance whatsoever of being successful in court, simply advise them to appeal so that they can prolong their stay in Australia. Only a minor percentage of cases that are appealed are overturned—in other words, are accepted. Recognising that few appeals against decisions of the tribunals are successful, our amendments would have introduced new rules designed to discourage lawyers and migration agents from encouraging applicants to make appeals which had no reasonable prospect of success. The rules would have allowed a court to impose a personal costs order of up to $5,000 on an adviser who encouraged a person to make an appeal which had no reasonable prospect of success. Bodies corporate would have been liable to fines of up to $10,000. This measure was designed to discourage advisers—and advisers are defined as people who do this for profit; we are not talking about community legal centres or volunteers—from urging or encouraging people to take up appeals that, while without foundation, will result in considerable further delay and expense and create unreasonable expectations of their remaining in Australia.
When these matters have been discussed in the House, I have said ad infinitum, `Minister, we will not agree to this, but we will agree to sit down and have an open mind on solutions, because we recognise the problem.' I have said that publicly and I have said it many times in the House. We have ended up with exactly the same bill that for five years the government have been trying to pass. We gave them what we believed to be not only a reasonable solution but one which would probably have withstood challenges to the High Court. We unfortunately believe that this bill will not withstand challenges to the High Court, but, in a spirit of bipartisanship, the opposition has passed every piece of legislation relating to efforts to try to deter people smugglers that has come before the House in this parliamentary term. 
The minister has been out there trying to say something different. In question time every day he tries to continue to put the wedge in, but there is no wedge here, Minister. I back what my colleague the member for Denison said only a couple of days ago when we were discussing the Border Protection Bill: you and your Prime Minister might feel smug today, you might feel as if you have got your way, and you have, but in five or 10 years, when history looks upon what you did on this issue in this parliament, we will see what people think of you then. There is no question why you have introduced these bills at this time. There is no question why you were hairy-chested about the Tampa and everything else, although it was during your watch that these people have been coming in ad infinitum. You took certain actions because you knew that would be popular, and it has worked your way electorally. Let us see what happens in five or 10 years. Let us see how you go down in history. 
 (Mr Nehl)—Is the amendment seconded?",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (JUDICIAL REVIEW) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,2001-09-27,"—I second the amendment and, with the consent of the government, I propose to speak immediately.
 (Mr Nehl)— Proceed.
—In the Senate committee which examined the proposed legislation some time ago, the Administrative Review Council stated:
In the Commonwealth context, it is therefore of fundamental constitutional importance that a decision made or action taken in the exercise of authority, whatever its source, is susceptible of review by the courts, if the decision maker or action taker is an officer of the Commonwealth or a person acting for or on behalf of the Commonwealth or Commonwealth authority and if the decision or action affects a right, privilege, duty, obligation or legitimate expectation of a person.
The Migration Legislation Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 1998 [2001] seeks to trample those protections that are fundamental to our constitutional environment. The opposition does not believe that these changes will survive the scrutiny of the High Court of Australia. The government itself recognises that that is a possibility. We believe that there were better and more effective ways to achieve the same objective of the government, that is, a simple, speedy and effective system but without removing the opportunity of independent scrutiny of executive action.
It is not true that executive action is always wise, always correct and never wrong. Earlier today, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs mentioned the case of Miah. The case of Miah is a very good case to go to in terms of the difference between what is the substantive justice of a case and the kind of procedural restraints that this government wishes to put in place. Mr Miah's circumstances were extraordinary. He grew up in a secular household in Bangladesh. His father was killed by Islamic extremists. During his school days, he continued in the same philosophy as his father and sought to express those secular views in a society which was deeply polarised and where Islamic extremism was growing. He suffered as a result of that and was subjected to assaults. He fled his village and went to Dhaka, thinking he would remove himself from those attacks. When he went to Dhaka, the place where he was working was subjected to a grenade attack. Not unnaturally, his employer politely asked him to leave and explained that he could not provide the protection that he needed. Mr Miah then went to Singapore, where he lived for a couple of years. He did not seek refugee status because he wanted to return home. He did return home with his new bride, a Hindu. He went back to his village and he and his wife were subjected to attacks and given 101 strokes of the cane because they were Hindu and secular rather than committed to the fundamentalist Islamic code. That man then fled and sought refugee status.
After a series of appalling delays, including misjudgments by the minister by refusing to accept that the matter had been improperly considered, his case was finally acceded to only after judicial review by the High Court of Australia. I want to take the House briefly to some of the passages in the decision of Her Honour Mary Gaudron. At paragraph 82 of her decision, she says:
His fear, if he returned to Bangladesh, was not merely that he would be the subject of further acts of persecution at the hands of Jamat-I-Islam but that they would kill him. His claims as to the violence and threats to which he was subjected and as to his fears that he would be killed were never evaluated. As already pointed out, the delegate proceeded simply on the basis that Mr Miah `may have experienced harassment from Muslim fundamentalists.' 
His claim in all those circumstances was never properly evaluated. At paragraph 98, her honour makes this point:
In the present case, the delegate did not simply reject the claims by Mr Miah. Indeed, he barely considered them. 
So it is possible that administrative decision makers make wrong decisions. It is entirely possible that ministers make wrong decisions. When this matter came to the minister for an exercise of his discretion as to whether or not, in all those horrifying circumstances, the minister might exercise some discretion, he refused it. We had a wrong process in the tribunal; a minister insensitive to the realities and the need to assess this case on a proper basis; and a determination now to remove the opportunity for independent scrutiny of administrative actions.
We have a better proposal. Labor have a proposal that will simplify these matters, streamline them and avoid repetitive judicial review. We have proposals which will ensure that advisers who put up frivolous and vexatious cases carry the costs in relation to it. We need not take the course this bill provides for to solve the problem it addresses. 
I conclude by saying that the bill states:
A privative clause decision:
(a)	is final and conclusive;
(b)	must not be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed or called into question in any court; and
(c)	is not subject to prohibition, mandamus, injunction, declaration or certiorari in any court on any account.
Of course that will not stand, and the minister knows that. The degree to which it will not stand is uncertain because the High Court has original jurisdiction under the Constitution of Australia, which states:
In all matters in which a writ of mandamus or prohibition or an injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth, the High Court shall have original jurisdiction.
This jurisdiction cannot be removed. So, whatever this act means in practice and however it is interpreted, or whether it is directly overridden as unconstitutional and suspended in its operation in its entirety, the law will not be as this act proposes—and the government knows that. So we ask: why not follow a course which would have been constitutionally sound, available and not had these flaws?
The last point I make is that, if we open ourselves to a system where we say that the acts of the executive are immune from reviewability on the basis of their lawfulness— in other words, that capricious and unlawful acts of the executive are not subject to the scrutiny of an independent court—then why not apply the same system to the taxation laws? Why not apply them to other areas of administrative decision making in Australia? Why not do it in a way which removes entirely the citizens' rights, which are fundamental, to have an independent chapter III constitutional court review those matters? The reason why this government has not adopted a process which is in conformity with the constitutional framework is beyond me.
Motion (by Mr Brough) put:
That the question be now put.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (JUDICIAL REVIEW) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,2001-09-27,"—I move:
That the bill be now read a second time.
This bill follows through on the government's recent announcement of a $1,000 tolerance for families with a family tax benefit or child-care benefit overpayment because of incorrectly estimated income or shared care in 2000-01.
The bill adapts an existing provision in the family assistance law so that the government's decision can be put into effect through a disallowable instrument. The instrument will be made and tabled as soon as possible after the bill is enacted.
The new family assistance system put more than $2 billion extra into the pockets of Australian families. It meant, for the first time ever, that top-ups will be paid to families who have been paid less than their actual entitlement because they overestimated their income during the year.
The government's information campaign to tell families about the new system has been very effective, with some 800,000 families updating their income estimates during the year. However, the first year was one of transition, and some families clearly needed extra help in adjusting to the new arrangements. While many families have got their income estimates right, there are families whose circumstances mean that it is difficult for them to estimate their income accurately. This special $1,000 tolerance will be available to those who have underestimated their income and have an overpayment as a result.
The $1,000 tolerance will also be available where a separated parent has incorrectly estimated their share of their child's care. If a family has both a family tax benefit overpayment and a child-care benefit overpayment, the $1,000 tolerance will apply to each overpayment.
Any family who still has an excess payment after the $1,000 tolerance may have it recovered by adjusting their future payments. Of course, many families who overestimated their income will reap one of the main benefits of the new system when they are paid their family tax benefit or child-care benefit top-ups with their tax refund or in a direct payment. 
Now that families have had time to adjust to the first year of the new system with the benefit of this lenient approach, the Family Assistance Office is working closely with them to help them with their income and shared care estimates for 2001-02. I present the explanatory memorandum to the House.",REPS,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE ESTIMATE TOLERANCE (TRANSITION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2001-09-27,"—As foreshadowed in the Senate second reading debate on the Family Assistance Estimate Tolerance (Transition) Bill 2001, the Australian Labor Party will support this bill, although I do intend to make some general remarks about the government's deceit in handling this matter and the utter contempt that it has shown consistently towards Australian families over the last five years. Firstly, however, I wish to outline some details concerning the bill. This bill is technical in nature, amending provisions in the Family Assistance Administration Act that deal with the waiver of debts. The amendments in this bill are relatively straightforward. They will allow a disallowable instrument to be tabled that will give effect to the government's announcement to waive the first $1,000 of debts attributable to families and arise from the introduction of the new family tax benefit and child-care benefit payment systems in July of last year.
Though the disallowable instrument is yet to be tabled, we understand that only debts attributable to parental and dependent child income estimation, as well as shared care, will be included in the $1,000 waiver. The waiver will be a one-off, applying only to overpayments in the 2000-01 financial year. The government's estimate is that around 400,000 families will be affected by the waiver. With some interesting accounting, the government says that some $220 million in revenue from debt recovery will be forgone. Only time will tell whether this is the extent of the problem.
What we do know, however, is that this is a problem of the government's own creation. Once again we have a bill introduced to fix up the mess that the government has made of the family and community services portfolio, in particular under this minister's stewardship. Yesterday the shadow minister's office once again attempted to obtain figures from the minister's office about the progress of the reconciliation process. We asked some pretty fundamental questions. We asked how many families have thus far had reconciliations, how many have debts and what the size of those debts are. But, of course, we received no answers to those questions. This is a government that does not believe in reconciliation of any sort, whether it be of the political variety or whether it be of the financial version. Nothing has been forthcoming, and as such we can only assume that this government has something to hide. However, I think that is probably unfair because, given this minister's record, he probably just does not know. Putting aside the government's non-cooperation, this bill and the waiver that it will ultimately provide for is a cocktail of bungling, deceit and now cheap political expediency. The government, of course, would not think twice about releasing figures if those figures showed that the family debt problems were not as bad as expected. We can only assume, therefore, that they are much worse. 
This is a government that has no idea about family policy. This is a government that knows only about family policy failures. I am not surprised that the government is embarrassed by this performance and that it intends to guillotine the debate on this bill. The government does not want members from this side of the parliament, who genuinely represent their electorates, coming into this House and outlining exactly how this government has bungled this situation and how it has had a devastating financial impact on Australian families. After repeated denials of any problems with the family tax benefit and child-care benefit system introduced as part of the GST package, we now have yet another massive backflip from the government; another massive backflip to add to the backflips on petrol and the four changes to the GST on caravan parks—and it still does not have it right! There has been backflip after backflip by this government which have all had an economic impact on the budget, the result of which we will see only during the election campaign.  
The government says that this is a transitional measure to help families in the first year of its operation. However, we know that the government opposed this happening. When the shadow minister for family and community services raised the problems that the government's position was having on Australian families, we were told once again that we were wrong. We were told that this was just the Labor Party running a scare campaign. The government is pretty consistent about that. It says that we are running a scare campaign, then down the track it accepts what we are saying and introduces legislation to fix the problem that it created, which we told the government about before it even created the original legislation. 
The truth is that the $1,000 debt waiver has nothing to do with the government's genuine concern for families, and everything to do with the government's concern for its own family—those people who sit on that side of the House temporarily who, indeed, are having their last day sitting on that side of the House. This is a cheap exercise in saving their own political skins. As I said, the government says that this is a transitional measure to help families in the first year of its operation. It is a transitional measure all right—a measure to see the coalition through the election due to be called in just a matter of days. The government's legislation is very interesting, as are the changes that we have seen on Ansett. The government is prepared to help Ansett just until the election campaign is over. And here we see that the government is prepared to help Australian families just until the election is over. That is why this legislation applies for only one year. The government does not care about families and the way that the new payment system has put them into debt; it just cares about how those families will vote in the election. 
Minister Vanstone and her predecessor are about as competent in formulating policies for families as Minister Bishop is at looking after frail, older Australians. To demonstrate the scope of the problem, I might briefly recap how the current system works. As with most social benefits, assistance is determined by income, with lesser benefits made to those with greater means. The new payment system introduced by the government as part of the GST relies on calculating family benefits based on an estimate of income in the corresponding financial year. This requires families to estimate their income over a year in advance. Around March of each year, families are asked to estimate their future income for the forthcoming financial year. Under the new system, at the end of the tax year, the payments made on the basis of the estimate and any updates are reconciled with actual income over the course of that year. If actual income exceeds the estimated income a debt for any overpayment is raised.
This sounds relatively simple but it is hideously complex for families. And the Department of Family and Community Services agree; they recognise serious shortcomings with this tax assessment based regime. But this is a new problem. Under the previous system, family and child-care payments were based on the previous year's taxable income—the base tax year—and there was no reconciliation that could give rise to a debt. A small number of families could elect to provide a current year estimate, but the family payment system allowed a 10 per cent buffer between the estimated and the actual income upon reconciliation.
This buffer, which has been abolished under the new zero tolerance system, something that characterises this government when it comes to any issues of compassion towards the most vulnerable people in our community, gave some leeway for families when their income fluctuated. With no buffer in the coalition's zero tolerance family policy, far more families are drawn into the debt trap. Disturbingly, lower income families are those at most risk; those who must claim their payments fortnightly rather than annually. This group is also more likely to have fluctuating income due to part-time work or the need to do overtime, thus exceeding their estimated income. Also at risk are single income families where the parent at home wants to do a bit of part-time work in order to get by. These families can get a triple-decker debt from each of family tax benefit A, family tax benefit B and the child-care benefit. Indeed, we have done a few figures that show that such a family can accumulate a $1,000 debt with just $1,500 in extra total income. 
Under the coalition, families are punished for working harder. But the government knew that this was going to occur because we warned them. This disaster in the making goes right back to the introduction of the initial GST legislation. In June 1999 shadow minister Wayne Swan made the following remarks in relation to family income estimate debts during the second reading debate of the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Bill 1999. He said:
Provisions in this bill can make things only worse as all families applying for assistance will be required in the future to estimate their income and not to go on their past taxable income. Currently, many families elect to base their assessment on previous tax returns. For many, this is the safe option. Surely, as a result of these changes, more families will unwittingly incur debts ...
There you have it: in June 1999 the member for Lilley once again showed what a visionary he is in family and community policy, compared with the vacuous emptiness that we see opposite here today. Subsequently, scores of press releases have been issued by the Australian Labor Party highlighting this issue and other flaws in the family tax benefit and child-care benefit system. The government denied all. As far as it was concerned there was no problem. It decided to deceive Australian families. Senator Newman, the previous minister, stated in a press release on 5 April 2000:
Australian families should not be scared by Labor fear campaigner Wayne Swan in his attempt to claim that increased debts will be raised by Centrelink under the New Tax System.
I call upon the minister to address this issue in his closing remarks, because it is very clear there that, on the record on 5 April 2000, Senator Newman was saying, `No problem.' She obviously did not learn the old adage: when you are in a hole stop digging. The minister kept digging, and she went on to say:
Of the 2.1 million families to receive FTB Part A, around 1.75 million will not have their rate affected by an under or over-estimate of income. Of the remaining 350,000, few are expected to incur a debt because of the improved system.
Really? Is that right, Minister? Why, then, is there a need for this legislation if there were not going to be any problems created? The current minister also peddled that line by denying strenuously that there were any problems. In a press released dated 18 April 2001, since stripped from Senator Vanstone's web site, she asserted:
The suggestion that many low income families might face overpayments of $1000 or $2000 is ridiculous.
...			...			...
Low income families have been the big winners under the new scheme. Mr Swan's comments to the contrary are self-serving in the extreme and serve no purpose but to scare low income families away from a scheme that can greatly assist them.
Who looks ridiculous now, Minister? It is this government that once again looks ridiculous. At the last sittings before the winter recess, a leaked document came into our hands. It showed that the government had been secretly making preparations to claw back family payments from up to half a million families after they had lodged their tax returns this year. I seek leave to now table the document.
Leave granted.
—It is devastating. Families were to have the money stripped from their tax refunds without warning. Any residual amounts would result in bills being sent for the outstanding amount. Contingency plans to deal with the so-called debts were detailed. The measures being pursued included the formation of a `National command and control group'. This government likes the military. Next came `Saturday morning office openings' and `flying squads'. There was also to be a `boost in call-centre staff above the levels during the introduction of the GST'. There were to be `delays to tax return processing to moderate the impact on Centrelink', `instructions to avoid “normal work”' and `the cancellation of staff leave'. 
These extraordinary revelations pointed to the size of the problem. But Minister Vanstone continued to play down the crisis and argued that any overpayments be repaid. On 27 June this year she told the Senate:
The people who understand about getting no more than you are entitled to are the families who are in need. I do not think that they are going to be unhappy, if they have been overpaid, to pay it back into the till.
She went on:
... if a family understates its income and as a consequence has received higher benefits that it would otherwise have been entitled to, it will have to pay that money back.
Just three days later, on 1 July—not coincidentally, just two weeks before the Aston by-election—the Prime Minister spilled the beans and did yet another backflip. The government, through the measure that we are debating today, would waive debts of up to $1,000 for some 400,000 families who would otherwise have had debts this year. Right up to the last minute there were denials by the government that this was needed. Then, as the issue was exposed by the opposition, a fortnight before the Aston by-election the government caved in with its short-term, tricky political fix. Also we are having this debate on the last day of sitting before a federal election. If every year were an election year, perhaps we would see this generosity every year. But this legislation, of course, applies only during the election year. Like a number of the bills that we are debating, the Family Assistance Estimate Tolerance (Transition) Bill 2001 perhaps should be changed to read Family Assistance Estimate Tolerance—forget about `Transition'— Election Year Bill. The $300 payment to pensioners and all the changes that we have seen have all been designed around jobs, but unfortunately the only jobs that this government cares about are the jobs of the members of the coalition. This is such a cynical exercise.
The government had said on the record that the Labor Party's position on this was `scaremongering' and `ridiculous', yet we have been proven right and they have been proven wrong. Perhaps this is an opportunity for the Minister for Community Services to find some humility somewhere—deep down, it is there somewhere. They are all born to rule—generations of them have represented Richmond, which is about to end. Maybe he will find some humility and will say, `I was wrong. Wayne Swan was right and I was wrong.' Perhaps that could happen—this is an opportunity—and it would probably go down well. Member for Richmond, I will give you a tip: it will probably go down well in your electorate for a bit of humility to be found—
 (Mrs De-Anne Kelly)—All remarks are to be addressed through the chair.
—because it is certainly needed. I can certainly understand why the government would not want hundreds of thousands of families to be hit with massive debts in the course of an election campaign, especially since many families would not have expected the massive debts. I had a constituent in my office the other day, with a letter from the government asking him to pay some money back: 1c. How much did it cost the government to deliver that letter? But it does not matter to this government, because this government is about punishing, and it will go back to punishing as soon as the election is over. Many families simply did not expect to get this massive debt. The government's waiver provides for up to $2,000 to be waived per family: $1,000 for family tax benefit and $1,000 for child-care benefit. In this, we start to understand why the new system is a failure. No person in their right mind would believe that 400,000 families could deliberately accumulate debts of up to $2,000, nor would the government be prepared to waive debts of this size if it were convinced that the families actually received payments to which they were not entitled. 
The fact is that this massive backflip from the government is confirmation that the family payment system is generating erroneous debts for families. The system is flawed and it is flawed because it raises retrospective family payment and child-care benefit debts for periods of the year when families were actually entitled to the benefits. The government is still having difficulty in coming to terms with this. Indeed, its only advice to families—to keep Centrelink updated on income changes—is flawed, because debts may still accumulate. Families who have complied with all their obligations to advise of changes in income can still get debts. The system is simply not responsive to fluctuations in income. The estimate system and the annual income reconciliation, as they currently work, are bad policy. The new family payment system is unable to recalculate payments properly to ensure that there is no net debt at the end of the year. The government's announcement for a one-off debt waiver does not fix the systematic problems that will saddle average families with debts next year and the year after.
The coalition is sitting on a family payment system that is a debt trap, and it is refusing to do anything about it. Why does the coalition want to place ordinary struggling families deeper into debt? The government has not articulated any strategy to fix this problem, nor is there likely to be one. The government knows full well that the whole idea of the new system was to save money and to pay less GST compensation to families than was originally promised, and we know about the infamous clawback system that applied earlier this year. Let me explain why. By moving to a current year income estimate, the government has effectively forced all families to declare higher incomes, which in turn reduce family payments—a concerted, deliberate strategy by the government to reduce its liability in family payments—which it pays to struggling families out there.
Wages growth means that the new system has, as a starting point, family incomes at around four per cent higher than those that would have been used under the old system. If the income guidelines of the old system remained, a family which had payment based on an income of $45,000 would have a new income of around $46,800 under the new system. The difference—some $1,800—reduces their family payment by at least $540 per year and up to $1,080 per year, or even more if child care is used. It appears that this significant differential was not taken into account with the government's new tax system cameos. The fudge was used by the coalition to claim higher family benefit increases under its ANTS cameos—very sneaky, very tricky, very mean. Indeed, this is confirmed by the logic of the government's argument about why the waiver will not cost the budget surplus. The government estimates that $220 million in debt recovery will be forgone, but it says that there is no underlying cost because it overestimated outlays in the last financial year. It is so bad that the Minister for Finance and Administration has had to come in here to give instructions to the Minister for Community Services about the damage he is creating to the budgetary position. That is how bad this government is, and that is how incompetent this minister is on financial matters.
The figure is even greater than this, because there will be those who have debts in excess of the $1,000 waiver. The government overstated the GST compensation in the new payment system by more than $220 million. This is 10 per cent of the total GST compensation claimed by the government. It would follow that families have been short-changed by 10 per cent; in other words, the government has caught itself out paying families 10 per cent less than they were promised as compensation for the GST. It is little wonder that many families are telling us that they are under greater financial pressure with the GST.
Families know that tax cuts and the claimed family payment compensation were eaten up by price hikes under the GST. Polls consistently show that very few Australians feel they are better off under the GST. AC Nielsen reported in the Age on 14 February 2001 that only 10 per cent believed they were better off. Newspoll reported in the Australian on 31 May 2001 that only 10 per cent believed they were better off. Quadrant reported in the Herald Sun on 18 June 2001 that only nine per cent believed they were better off. The opposition has also exposed examples of families that have been left worse off under the new tax system. 
The operation of the new income test for family tax benefit part B has left couple families with a parent leaving or entering the work force, before or after caring for children, demonstrably worse off. The loss of the basic partnered parenting payment has not been offset by tax cuts or other family payment compensation. Despite denying problems with the new income test the government introduced a one-off compensation measure for families affected—but it was one-off only for last financial year. But, to add insult to injury, some families missed out on this. Parents who swapped parenting roles during the year were not eligible.
Labor has also drawn attention to the plight of large families on low incomes. These families were dudded. The abolition of the variable income-free area, the pitiful increase in the large family supplement, and the failure to benefit from the relaxed taper and income tax cuts combined to squeeze these families against the big price increases they faced under the GST. The government's response to these serious issues is similar to the debt problems exposed by the opposition: deny all. We say that the government is doing a great disservice to families by not acknowledging, least of all rectifying, these serious shortcomings.
To conclude, it is obvious that the government's administration of FTB and child-care benefit has been an unmitigated disaster. Worse than that, it has been a vehicle for the government to shortchange families on their GST compensation. Just like pensioners, they have been deceived. We intend reminding families of the government's conduct in the ensuing election campaign. We have a coalition government that is prepared to lie to families; we have a coalition government that is prepared to shortchange families; and we have a coalition government that is prepared to engage in political expediency to see it through an election. But we have a coalition government that is not prepared to fix the core problems with its family payment system that will hit families with debts next year and the year after.
Here is an election promise that the coalition will not be advertising: if the coalition is re-elected, it is guaranteed that families will be hit with massive end-of-year tax debts; tax returns will be stripped without warning and bills will be sent out. This is perhaps the only promise the coalition could be expected to deliver on if it is re-elected.
In contrast, Labor leader Kim Beazley has given a commitment to fix the problem of unfair debts for families. Only one party in this country understands families and is prepared to support them—the Australian Labor Party. It is no wonder that this government are preparing to gag this debate. They say it is so that the member for Macarthur and the member for Richmond can give their valedictories, but it is all because they do not want a debate on this issue. (Time expired)
Motion (by Mr Anthony) agreed to:
That the question be now put.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.
 (Mrs De-Anne Kelly)—Is it the wish of the House to proceed to the third reading forthwith?
Opposition members—No!
—I move that this bill be now read a third time.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order: you asked if it was the wish of the House, and it clearly was not the wish of all members of the House. There was clear dissent from that proposition, so I do not think that is the appropriate process for you to be pursuing at this stage. With some cooperation, we can get this bill through pretty quickly, but if you try to ram it through it will take longer. If you give the member for Calare and the member for Oxley a few minutes each, I think we will get the bill through quickly and with agreement. I suspect that, if we go to a consideration in detail stage and you give them a chance to speak for five minutes each at that stage, that will be an amicable arrangement on which we can proceed.
—The minister has moved that the bill be read a third time. The question is that the bill be now read a third time. Those of that opinion say aye; to the contrary no. I think the ayes have it. 
—No, no. Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order: I think the motion was put quite improperly. How is it that we got to the circumstance that that motion was moved when there was not agreement by the House to move to the third reading forthwith? The minister can move the third reading motion only when we have gone through the consideration in detail stage—which we never did and about which there was never agreement. We could have a lengthy discussion about this. I understand you are in a difficult position, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am not trying to make it harder for you, but I am trying to protect the rights of members to speak briefly on this matter.
—As agreed.
—I do not want to take more time; I just want to give those two colleagues the chance to speak briefly. You cannot move the third reading without a consideration in detail stage, without the consent of the House. You asked if it was the wish of the House to move to the third reading forthwith, and members distinctly said that, no, it was not. There was no leave to proceed in that manner; therefore the motion that you purported to move was not ever properly before us. I do not want to be in the position of dissenting from your ruling but, if you want to take a bit of time, we can do it. The proper process is that we move to the consideration in detail stage, in which case we will be quick. If we do not move to the consideration in detail stage, we will be slow. That is the choice before the House. If you want to move in accordance with the timetable, do it cooperatively and you will get cooperation; do it without cooperation, and there will be a blue. I will move dissent from your ruling if we do not get some movement on this matter.
—We can proceed with the third reading debate, if that is acceptable to members.
—It is not acceptable. That is the point. I understand that it is open to the House to give leave to proceed to the third reading forthwith, but we have not and we will not. We will happily cooperate in an expeditious dealing of the consideration in detail stage. I cannot guarantee for how long the member for Calare will speak, but I accept that if he gets a go and the member for Oxley gets a go—
—The member for Fraser can resume his seat.
—On what basis?
—On the basis that I will consider the point of order that you have made.",REPS,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE ESTIMATE TOLERANCE (TRANSITION) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2001-09-27,"—These are now the central issues in Australian politics: security abroad and security at home—security abroad in the context of a totally changed international environment that occurred as a result of the devastating, horrific set of events in New York and Washington a couple of weeks ago, and security at home in the sense that many Australian families are now feeling pressure. They are under financial pressure, partly as a result of the goods and services tax, partly as a result of pressure on them through the industrial relations system and partly as a result of a worsening job market. And there is pressure, further, particularly for the majority of parents who are sending their kids to either needy private schools or public schools, with regard to the education system and their sense of security and confidence that their children are getting access to the education they need, that they will get access, affordably, to university and that they will get access to a decent opportunity if they choose to go to a TAFE or other training centre. When it comes to health, there is a real fear that the public hospital system of this nation is being undermined and that aged care is not available and is unaffordable. These are the key issues of security in our nation today.
In the area of security abroad, we seek bipartisanship. We offered this government support when they revealed to this place that they have had correspondence with the United States stating that, under the ANZUS Treaty, it was considered that an attack had taken place upon a metropolitan part of the United States. We now seek from the government—as we did in question time here today—clarity on their response to the international situation, generally, that has developed; their estimates of the problems that we confront; clarity in their response to the domestic measures they intend to pursue; and clarity in their response to their preparedness to unite with the rest of the world in dealing with things such as the global terrorist counter measures that have been put in place through individual agreements that the United Nations has established and which have been signed up to by the United States and the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister undertook to give specific consideration to those matters over the course of the next few days. 
As a contribution to that national preparedness, we suggest that the Prime Minister urgently consider bringing forward further reforms required in our nation's antiterrorist capabilities. Reforms would be in areas such as making our airports and aeroplanes safer; boosting our defence intelligence and SAS counter-terrorist capabilities; building on the white paper; strengthening antiterrorist law enforcement, including through comprehensive domestic legislation; protecting our vital installations such as power and water supplies; better immigration security checking; protecting against cyber terrorism; cracking down on the financing of terrorism, particularly through international agreements; and cracking down on links between the global terrorist network and organised criminal activities, especially drug smuggling. These are now the key issues of defence in this nation.
We agree with the basic thrust of the defence white paper that the previous minister put forward in this place—he has been one of a revolving door of defence ministers of this Liberal government. Why did we agree with the defence white paper? Because it abandoned the fatuous positions being arrived at by the Prime Minister in the first few years that he was in office—which created so much trouble for us in our diplomatic relationships in this region—and came back to the same fundamentals of defence policy that were put in place by his Labor predecessors, the more long-serving Labor defence ministers, namely me and Senator Ray.
The white paper is not a tract that requires no revision at any point of time. It is not Holy Writ; it is guidance. If, at some point in time, you find that the circumstances have changed, you ought not to be afraid or worried about revisiting it. We suggest a couple of areas in which it might be revisited. Firstly in the area of upgrading is that component of identified threat to Australia which deals with the issues of international terrorism. That will mean, without question, a re-weighting in defence expenditure over the next few years towards counter-terrorist operatives such as those in SAS or the commando regiments, and it will mean a re-weighting towards intelligence collection. It may well be that in doing that some other items of equipment may have to drop back in priority. It ought to be of no embarrassment or concern to a government should they have to do that. You focus on the main threat and you deal with the main threat. In the circumstances we now confront, there is no doubt where that major threat is coming from.
We suggest a further revision as well. We suggest that, in the circumstances in which we now find ourselves confronting—more and more incursions into Australian territorial waters, be it for the purposes of illegal migration, be it for the purposes of the illicit movement of drugs or be it for the purposes of confrontation with our quarantine requirements or whatever—we are, without question, facing a different border protection environment than that of 1983 when I last wrote a report on the issue of a coastguard. Seventeen years have passed. A different world and a different set of concerns for border protection now confront us. We are now required to walk away from the idea of coastwatch to the idea of coastguard. Coastwatch might have been an appropriate measure when the threats to our borders were of a lesser concern. We have moved from the coastwatch phase to something more akin to that of the United States, which deals with these problems with a proper constabulary— a coastguard. 
In erecting straw men in this place, the outgoing, retiring Minister for Defence suggested that this would in some way diminish the Navy or be a threat to it. Anyone who knows anything about contemporary defence recruitment knows—and it was even mentioned, or alluded to, by his junior when he was talking about recent successes in defence recruitment—that the shift in the age balance in our population is making it extremely difficult to recruit long-term members of the defence forces. This is not a phenomenon applicable only to Australia; it is right through the Western world. It is being addressed in most countries by more and more emphasis on reserves. That is the case in the United States. That is one of the answers here too.
There are other answers as well. When a function crosses the line from a defence function to a policing function, you put in place appropriate measures that relieve pressure on your defence forces. Far from the Navy not being engaged in this and junior officers in the Navy not getting command experience, our plan specifically entails the proposition that officers, in particular, get an opportunity to be seconded from the Navy to the Coast Guard for a brief period of time to get that command experience and to get that experience with seagoing operations. There is no particular problem with this. After a tour of duty on the contemporary patrol boats of the Royal Australian Navy, they could move on to other vessels—there is nothing unusual about that—and they could do the same through the Coast Guard. It would give a more complete recruitment opportunity to a coastguard type function to be able to go to a broader community and not oblige the Navy to provide the staffing for all those ships which are secondary to the Navy's purposes.
We are beginning to find that, rightly, a demand is coming upon us at an international level for a commitment to put ships into the Persian Gulf to support the naval effort there. The pressures are now too great on the Royal Australian Navy to sustain the current level of operations in border protection and, of course, it is a ludicrous use of high value ships such as our frigates. What we need here is a multiplicity of vessels that can be kept on patrol 52 weeks a year on an affordable basis, neither diminishing their effort nor diminishing the effort of the Navy when called upon to perform substantial naval tasks such those we are now seeing in the Persian Gulf.
That is security abroad and, as a former Minister for Defence of this country, I have absolute confidence that the Labor Party, should we secure election, will be able to handle the circumstances in which we now find ourselves. They are extraordinary circumstances, but issues of allied collaboration are very familiar to me, and the basic documents and processes that go to that were negotiated in part by me in the mid-1980s after the New Zealanders pulled out of ANZUS and we had to put in place a different set of protocols by which we related to the United States.
That is security abroad, but what about security at home? Security at home starts with a job. Jobs growth in this country depends on growth generally. Our political opponents inherited an economy that the Prime Minister said was better than good in parts; a growth economy. It had been growing for four years after we had confronted the consequences of a world-wide recession in the early 1990s at a rate of over four per cent per annum. You will notice how frequently the government refer to six-year figures as opposed to four-year figures and to six-year figures as opposed to 13-year figures when it comes to the issue of jobs growth. That is the only way they can fake a set of figures that gives them any defensible position on jobs growth since they have been in office. But suffice it to say the basic economic decisions that produced the economy they inherited—the floating of the dollar, the opening up of our economy and making it more competitive—were decisions taken by their predecessors. No big decisions concerning economic management, apart from a bit of budget wreckage, were taken by this government upon assuming office until the implementation of the GST.
I have to concede this: when the government put in place the GST, they got full ownership of the Australian economy. They walked away from any position that resembled life prior to their coming into office. And what did we see? Growth cut to one-third of what it was. We were not the best performing nation, as the Treasurer boasted in question time; we were 24th out of 30 in the OECD, courtesy of that decision. That decision has savaged full-time jobs growth in this country. It was never very good under this government, I might say, but what health there was in full-time jobs growth—which is the basis of security in many Australian families—absolutely disappeared and went into negative territory once the Liberals got full ownership of this economy by implementing the goods and services tax. Now we have to work our way back from that to give people a sense of security. 
When the Labor Party talk about roll-back we are talking about these things, things that make it simpler for small business. The government think this system is perfection for small business. Small business is struggling with it and going broke—hence the bankruptcy figures. We would make it simpler for small business and relieve the pressure on ordinary Australian families by removing the GST from some items that are in common use or that they might confront at a time in their lives when they are feeling most insecure and when their expenses are considerable—like our decision recently to remove the GST from funerals. That is what we mean by roll-back, and we will be taking that to the public in the election campaign as part of addressing the problems of security at home.
And then we come to the present situation in health. There is a funding shortfall for public hospitals of over $615 million. Five hundred thousand low income and elderly people who need dental care have been denied it as a result of decisions taken by this government. Ten thousand cancer patients who need radiotherapy treatment cannot get it. The government have failed to deliver 15,600 phantom age care beds, denying elderly patients the care they deserve, and they have failed to address the three million drop in bulk-billed GP services. That is why people feel insecure when it comes to dealing with this government's health care system.
Finally, I come to the education system. The only increased expenditure that public schools have received since this government have been in office has been as a result of what I put in place when I was the education minister of this country. I put in place a basic multiplier that supported public schools. The government detracted from it immediately upon coming into office and then restored it. But that was just a basic grant. It was meant to be more than that. Instead, they have favoured category 1 schools, the wealthy schools, against the public schools. It is no wonder that ordinary Australians feel a vast sense of insecurity about the education system. We will address that; we will fix those problems. (Time expired)

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2001-09-27,"—Noticing his presence in the press gallery today, I thought possibly that Bob Ellis had written the Leader of the Opposition's speech. But I have listened to it and it was so bad that he must have written it himself. It is really a pity that someone who was a minister of the Crown for 13 years should have spoken so poorly in what may well be his valedictory speech in this parliament. It was a very poor speech from the Leader of the Opposition, because what did he do? He went back to his comfort zone: to the days in the past when he was a minister in someone else's government, when he had someone else to hold his hand. That is the whole problem with the Leader of the Opposition in the dying days of his leadership. He is dwelling in the past, a past which he thinks clearly was much grander than his present and his future. The Australian people are not interested in someone living in the past. They want a leader who is looking to the future and can deal with the challenges that we face now.
What we saw today was the speech of a man who was pretending to be a leader. A real leader has real policy, and there is no real policy from the Leader of the Opposition. Really, what the Leader of the Opposition is doing today, what he has been doing indeed for 5½ years, is trying to prey on human misery. He has degenerated into an economic vulture, preying on every scrap and skerrick of bad news that he can find. He does not want to see workers of Australia out there in good jobs; he would much prefer to see workers as victims out of work. That is precisely the sort of thing which would happen if the Leader of the Opposition was, by some fluke, to translate himself into Prime Minister. 
What are the policies of the Leader of the Opposition? Here he has his one stock-standard denunciation—up hill and down dale—of the GST. That is his policy: denunciation of the GST. What is his program? His program is to take the GST off funerals. That is his program to solve the economic issues of this country: take the GST off funerals. Let us take the GST off funerals and let us see what a big difference that will make! Apart from taking the GST off funerals, his policy is to have no fewer than 43 new government bodies and to have more than 160 new government inquiries. He tried to give us an education policy in the shape of Knowledge Nation and he came up with his legendary spaghetti and meatballs diagram, which has now become a standing joke by people advertising, amongst other things, lean red meat. I tell you what: there is a lot more meat in the advertisement than there is in the Leader of the Opposition's policies.
Let us look at those glory days that the Leader of the Opposition wants to retreat to and find comfort in. Let us judge him by his deeds as a minister rather than by his words now as a failing, desperate leader. He was the worst defence minister we have ever had, he was the worst communications minister we have ever had, he was the worst finance minister we have ever had, and he was certainly the worst employment minister that we have ever had. I used to think that he was the worst opposition leader that we have ever had, certainly the worst opposition leader since Arthur Calwell, but no less an authority than the great Alan Ramsey says that he is the worst opposition leader since Doc Evatt—and this worst opposition leader since Doc Evatt now aspires to replace the best Prime Minister since Bob Menzies. The Leader of the Opposition is out of his depth. He has been promoted above his abilities. His colleagues know it, the Australian people know it and he knows it himself. 
It gives me no pleasure to have to stand at this dispatch box and perform a character analysis of the Leader of the Opposition, because no-one likes to see a man of some ability visibly failing. No-one wants to see someone who has been in this parliament for a long time so comprehensively betraying the ideals and the ambitions that he once seemed to have. Listen to Labor on Kim Beazley. Listen to Labor people talking about the would-be Prime Minister of our country. John Coombs—he is hardly a friend of the coalition—the former leader of the Maritime Union of Australia, says that Whitlam was `magnificent', Hawke was `brilliant' and Keating was `an outstanding leader'. What does he say about Kim Beazley? He thinks Beazley is the most `adequate' leader he has seen. He says of Kim Beazley:
I didn't rate him at all when he got the job.
Now he thinks he is adequate. That is John Coombs on Kim Beazley. Then there is John Della Bosca, well known as the dishevelled genius of the Labor Party—one of the great analysts and thinkers of the Labor Party. What does he think about the Leader of the Opposition? He says—and I am quoting his celebrated interview with Maxine McKew:
I have seen flashes of Kim as potentially a really good leader.
So `flashes of Kim as potentially a really good leader'. I see the member for Werriwa is in the chamber and the member for Werriwa is an extremely acute observer of the political scene—as Michelle Grattan has said, a first-rate political intellect. What did he say of the Leader of the Opposition? He said:
I can't remember the last time shadow Cabinet had a serious policy debate.
Describing shadow cabinet, the member for Werriwa said `boredom is a good description'. Boredom is a good description of this group led by the Leader of the Opposition.
It goes on. These are the Leader of the Opposition's friends, colleagues and supporters. What do they think of him? What does someone who has been described by Alan Ramsey as the most successful Labor leader of the last decade, Brisbane Lord Mayor, Jim Soorley, think about Kim Beazley? He said: 
Now to be perfectly honest, I am really disappointed. Kim Beazley in my view has failed in his job.
That is what Jim Soorley thinks. We now come to the South Australian Labor member of parliament, Ralph Clarke. What does he think about Kim Beazley?
 (Mr Nehl)— The Leader of the Opposition.
—What does he think about the Leader of the Opposition? I am quoting, Mr Deputy Speaker.
—Not then you weren't.
—I am now. He says:
My basic view of Beazley is that he has been as weak as piss.
I was quoting, Mr Deputy Speaker. That is what he said about the Leader of the Opposition. Let us look at Neal Blewett. Neal Blewett served with the Leader of the Opposition throughout the 13 years when the Leader of the Opposition was a minister in a government. What does Neal Blewett think about the Leader of the Opposition? He says:
For so outwardly aggressive a figure he is extraordinarily timid, fearful of the students over the loan proposals, fearful of the Bishops over Catholic schools, fearful now of the public servants over the proposed Austudy transfer.
We now have aspiring to lead this nation in perilous times, in very difficult times, in more challenging times than we may have seen for 50 years, a man who lives in a chronic state of fear and insecurity. The Australian people are not going to choose as their leader someone who is frightened of his own shadow. As I said, the Leader of the Opposition knows he is not up to it. I will now quote from an interview that the Leader of the Opposition gave to John Lyons of the Bulletin. He told the Bulletin:
I am a firm believer in the Italian philosopher's view, Gramsci, that the correct stance for a politician is pessimism of the intellect and optimism of the will.
What that really translates into is, `I think I might win the election, but I know I can't do a decent job as Prime Minister.' That is the Leader of the Opposition's opinion of himself. The matter of public importance is a very wide ranging topic. Given that it is so wide ranging, let me just say that in my own electorate of Warringah this government has delivered jobs, health and education. Quite apart from the $20 million, for instance, already committed to the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust, there is more than $1 million under the Natural Heritage Trust for various local environmental restoration projects. Also, $8.5 million has gone to local government for roads, and $4.5 million has gone to the local Job Network to help people find work. We have had nine different Work for the Dole projects in the electorate of Warringah to help more than 120 job seekers. We have amended the Trade Practices Act to give small business protection against unfair conduct by big business, and that will help small businesses at Warringah Mall in my electorate. One hundred and twenty Warringah businesses have been given some $13.5 million in export market development grants. This is a government which has delivered for the people of Australia. I do not say that we have not made mistakes. I do not say that everything in our nation is perfect. Of course we have made mistakes. We are only human. Of course things can be better, and they will be better when the people of Australia return the Howard government. I have been asked by the whip to conclude these remarks early to give people time to return to valedictories, and I think I can also say that there was not a lot in the Leader of the Opposition's speech to respond to.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Howard Government: Policies</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1
"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2001-09-27,"—I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in what is clearly set to be the last MPI debate for this parliament. There is a touch of irony in my making this MPI speech today on the issue of security for all Australians—that is, security abroad and security at home. As I said earlier, it is likely to be the last MPI debate, so as I sat down to prepare my speech I thought back to the first time I was asked to deliver an MPI speech back in March 1999. I remember the speech clearly and, wouldn't you know it, it was about the goods and services tax—the proposed GST, as it then was, and its anticipated negative impact on employment in Australia. The predictions and figures I cited in my speech back in 1999 painted a pretty bleak picture of the future under a GST but, as it turned out, that did not come close to the situation that this government has brought us to 2½ years down the track. 
For example, in that speech I was not able to cite the litany of corporate collapses or restructures and resulting job losses that we have seen since the GST: HIH, One.Tel, Ansett, Coles Myer, Harris Scarfe, Braybrook, Franklins, the damage done to the housing industry, the impact on the tourism industry and so on. Two and a half years after that speech and 1½ years after the introduction of the GST, we are no longer speculating on the impact; we now know exactly the results of this government's policies, the results of its indifference to ordinary Australian workers and their families and to the pressures that they are under. We know about their indifference to small business, to those most disadvantaged in our community and even to our future as a successful and innovative nation. I do not know if it is a cause of bemusement or despair that the issues we highlighted in that far-off MPI—jobs, job security, access to education and training, the cost of living and opportunities for all Australians, not just the rich—are now even more important. They assume an even greater priority for anyone who wants to leave this country, because they are the issues this government has ignored for too long. I do know that the Labor Party has never lost sight of those issues. The need for Australians to have security is fundamental to us. Why are we here if it is not to deliver security for all Australians: security in their workplaces, in their homes, for their families, when they get sick, in their retirement and in their old age?
We have heard so many times in the past few weeks that the world changed on 11 September. There can be no doubt about that, and Australia needs to be alert to the new international environment and any threats that it holds for our country as well as any obligations that it brings. Just as we have worked on the other issues that affect the security of people getting on with their lives and building their futures within Australia, the Labor Party have worked for some time now to ensure that we have the answers to guarantee our security as a nation. A key part of that strategy is the proposal for a coastguard, which took another step this week when further details of its structure and purpose were introduced into the House.
The other element essential to our national security is our ability to establish and maintain cooperative and mature relationships with our neighbours, our region and the global community. The international scene may have changed but the issues confronting the average Australian family have not. It is interesting to note that, while the international scene changed literally overnight and a prompt response was quite correctly demanded from this government, the issues undermining the security of ordinary Australians have been growing steadily throughout the Prime Minister's term, without any indication that the government has either listened or cared.
The Labor Party cares because we think that, if you govern this country, you do it to make a difference in the lives of ordinary people. You take care of the basics, like creating jobs, ensuring decent wages and conditions at work, providing health care to the whole community, taking care of our elderly and making sure that every single kid in Australia gets the best possible education. Under this government, the quality of your education and health care and your opportunities in life depend on chance, where you live and how much money your family has. This government has always left too much to chance and then scrambled to catch up when things have not worked out, or I should say when they have figured out that it might cost them votes. How can a government create an environment of security for Australian families if they are not in there working for it, if they do not have a plan that puts security at the centre of everything they do? We want to take that responsibility for people's security and we will live up to that responsibility.
You cannot have security without a job. Sadly, there are a lot more people in Australia, and in my own electorate, who can attest to that now, even more so than there were two weeks ago. Since the introduction of the GST, the number of people employed full time has fallen by 87,700. The number of unemployed people has risen by 77,500, and that is without taking account of the fuller impact of the Ansett collapse and other recent announcements. Economic forecaster Dr Peter Brain predicts that 53,000 direct jobs are threatened by the failure of Ansett, and a further 20,000 jobs in the tourist industry could follow. Those sorts of figures really make you wonder what this government is doing. There is one thing for sure: whatever the government is doing, it is not running the country for the benefit of ordinary people. 
For example, close to home in my electorate, the unemployment rate in Rockhampton at the end of March was 14.5 per cent, and that was what I was thinking about every time the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, showed up last week, shrugged his shoulders and said, `Ansett: what's that got to do with me?' Or when the Minister for Sport and Tourism calls the impact of Ansett's demise on the tourism industry `a blip'. While those two were ducking responsibility or showing that they were simply incapable of dealing with a situation that they had been well informed about for months, Labor, the staff of Ansett and their unions were begging the minister for transport to get involved—to make something happen, to make a decision that will give Ansett half a chance of getting back in the air, giving back to regional Australia the services that are so important to people living and trying to do business there. Getting Ansett back in the air will give those 17,000 workers a chance of keeping their jobs and not living under the pressure that they have had to put up with for the last two or three weeks. Labor's suggestion was to make available $200 million to give the administrator something to work with, so that he could be putting together deals, trying to attract people back to Ansett and to make something of it. The Deputy Prime Minister just kept on telling us what the government were not prepared to do. Not once did he tell us what they were prepared to do.
—Asleep on the job.
—Exactly. Asleep on the job and just not interested. The other part of the equation is the tourism industry. Yesterday the Minister for Sport and Tourism, having come back from calling the demise of Ansett `a blip' for the tourism industry— such an important industry for all of Australia, not just my own electorate—told us that her answer was a survey of the industry. While they are trying to run their business, they should take time out from the cash flow, staffing and booking problems, while watching their business go down the drain, to fill out this survey and tell us how crook it is, and then we will get back to them about what we might do. It is laughable. In the meantime, Labor was in there again, doing the government's job for it, coming up with a rescue package for the tourism industry— $32 million, a doubling of the regional tourism program, more money in the form of concessional loans to tourist businesses and also $10 million additional funding to the Australian Tourist Commission. These ministers have been sitting on their hands while important industries in Australia have been threatened and the jobs that go with those industries have been crumbling. It was Labor that came up with the suggestions of what needed to be done to try to bring it back from the brink.
The story about Ansett in my own electorate is a very sad one. Two local business people took over the Kendell contract last year. Those two people employ 12 others in their business. I am happy to say that those two people do business correctly. They have paid their employees their full entitlements, unlike what the government has allowed to happen in this country for two or three years, as the Braybrook workers in the member for Gellibrand's electorate know only too well. These workers in Rockhampton have been paid their entitlements because these people do business properly.
There is also the Stella Martin catering company that has had to put off 12 of its employees and is down to just Stella and her manager. That business has been in Rockhampton for 47 years. It has now closed its doors because of the failure of Ansett. All John Anderson could do for two weeks was shrug his shoulders and say, `What's it got to do with me?' I say to the Prime Minister and his deputy: if you want to run this country, run it. Make decisions that will actually help people. Make a positive difference to jobs and the services that improve people's lives, like health, education and aged care. If you cannot do it, or you are not interested, then pack your bags or, better yet, we will pack them for you.

"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,2001-09-27,"—Today's subject requires reflection on the capacity of the two sides of politics to help secure Australia's future externally, which I presume refers to Australia's strategic relationship with the United States, internally, which refers to jobs, health and education, and the question of boat arrivals and the integrity of Australia's migration program, which straddles both the internal and the external. The coalition's policy on our relationship with the United States is very clear; it is unambivalent. We support ANZUS, we support our principal strategic ally, the United States. We will cooperate with the United States by all available means, both in the war on terrorism and more broadly in upholding the values of democracy and freedom around the world.
I do not really dispute the fact that the Leader of the Opposition is almost entirely in agreement with those sentiments. The difficulty he faces is that he leads a party that is very significantly divided on those issues. In fact, in the lead-up to this election the shadow spokesman for foreign affairs made it clear that he would be aiming to present the electorate with a clear choice in relation to Australia's strategic relationship with the United states. This follows Labor's long-term historical ambivalence about this external relationship. In 1963, Calwell and Whitlam, leading the ALP, opposed the establishment of joint facilities with the United States at Pine Gap. In the 1980s there was raging debate within the ALP about both the continuing operations of the joint facilities and whether all US warships should be able to dock in Australian ports or only some. There continues to be speculation at the branch level of the ALP that perhaps the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States was involved in the demise of Gough Whitlam. Those on this side of the House would suggest that Gough Whitlam did not require the assistance of the Central Intelligence Agency to mastermind his own demise.
The problem for the Leader of the Opposition is that his party is attempting to straddle two quite different Labor traditions. Tony Blair is clearly standing right behind NATO and the United States, whereas Helen Clark immediately to our east has a quite different approach. Her view of Labor's strategic relationships is to run down the defence forces, to refuse American ships access to New Zealand ports, and to close the Air Force. The question for the electorate is what approach will this Labor Party adopt and, frankly, the answer is very uncertain.
When James Kelly, the Assistant Secretary of State from the US, arrived he made a beeline to Kim Beazley's office to ask a simple question. Following the outcome of Labor's caucus meeting in Hobart which said that the Pine Gap facility should not be made available to the US in the prosecution of its missile defence policy, James Kelly had a simple question for Kim Beazley, and it was this: `If Australia becomes aware through its Pine Gap facilities that an intercontinental ballistic missile has been launched against a city in the United States, will Australia give the United States that data?'
It was a pretty extraordinary question for an assistant secretary of state to be asking a leader of a political party that is meant to be one of its most solid strategic allies. Kim Beazley, realising the internal incoherence of his position—as if we are going to have data managers sitting there over that seven-minute period between the launch of an ICBM and its arrival at its target in an American city deciding which of the data we are going to give and which we are not going to give—came out and unequivocally indicated to James Kelly that Australia would provide the data. But that was in complete contradiction to the policy adopted by his caucus and by the shadow spokesman for external affairs. We hope that a Labor government will be capable of securing Australia's future but, frankly, the answer is far from clear.
In relation to boat arrivals: again, you see on this side of the House a relatively clear and unequivocal policy. We took the view that Australia's exposure to boat arrivals at both the push end—the factors driving this acceleration of arrivals—and the pull end— the sort of reception received—was out of whack, out of sync, and that the entire issue needed to be re-engineered. John Howard took a clear-cut and courageous stance, a stance which subjected him to considerable external criticism. When John Howard, the Prime Minister, leads a government he leads it in Australia's national interest. He is not looking over his shoulder at every point to seek the imprimatur or blessing of some collection of nations, many of which have the most appalling human rights records but lecture us about what our approach should be. 
This government determined to maintain one of the more generous per capita refugee migration programs anywhere in the world. The point was not whether we should continue to receive generously and warmly a proportion of the world's refugees and asylum seekers, but whether those who could simply present themselves on our shores ought to be able to push out of the queue all those who had been patiently waiting, who had applied by lawful channels and who were entitled to expect to come through the front door. They are being pushed out by this apparently unlimited exposure to boat arrivals. We took a series of measures to strengthen disincentive and discouragement among the transit states such as Indonesia—and I congratulate the ministers for immigration, for defence and for foreign affairs who went to Indonesia and constructively negotiated an arrangement with the Indonesian government that would require all arrivals to demonstrate their bona fides to ensure that Indonesia did not become a blind eye transit centre or staging point to Australia. Then we introduced the Border Protection Bill 2001 and subsequently the judicial review bills. 
I am open to the prospect that a party such as the ALP may have a view different from the government on this issue. The difficulty is that it is almost impossible to discern through the pea soup of Labor policy what they actually stand for. Firstly, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, indicated that he would stand shoulder to shoulder with the Prime Minister, that it was good policy, and that it was practical and humane. As soon as the Border Protection Bill 2001 was presented to the parliament, we found to our astonishment that it was defeated by Labor and the Democrats. We then got this commitment from the ALP that they would oppose the judicial review bill on the basis that it was unconstitutional. Subsequently, as a consequence of the laceration the ALP received at the hands of, principally, public opinion, we get this absolute volte-face, this backflip, where Kim Beazley would have the electorate believe that you cannot put a cigarette paper between him and the coalition on the issue of the protection of Australia's borders.
At the same time, if you listen to the other voices coming through you get a different view. The member for Grayndler, a parliamentary secretary in the ALP, this week at Labor's caucus made a point of indicating that he thought Labor's support for these measures would go down in the history of the party as one of the great shames and embarrassments of the Australian Labor Party. We had Senator Jim McKiernan in the other place saying:
... I give notice that I shall do whatever I possibly can to get this changed ... when Labor win office at the forthcoming election.
Senator Chris Schact, as shadow minister, said:
... it will not work in a number of ways.
The Leader of the Opposition is wanting to hold out this view out of one side of his mouth while all of these disparate voices essentially—
—The member for Reid is a powerful figure in the Left. He ought to get to this rabble of the Left which has been the weeping sore of the ALP since the Second World War. They are not part of a team. There is no coherent position.
Can I turn to the bread-and-butter domestic issues of health, education and jobs. Starting with jobs: as the minister for employment pointed out during question time, when I was elected as the member for Parramatta in 1996, unemployment was over 12 per cent. Today unemployment in Parramatta is under three per cent. In relation to education, under this government we have seen a 43 per cent increase in funding simply for public schools, since we were elected in 1996. It has been quarantined from any cuts. It has increased every year. It is a record of sustained commitment. In the area of health, we have seen our minister for health receive the highest international award for his work in diabetes. We have seen the rapid escalation in the rates of immunisation among children. We have had increased rates of bulk-billing. Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a choice going into this election. One side of Australian politics has a clear, coherent, sustained policy position. The other side is a rabble. I leave the choice to the wisdom of the Australian people.

"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2001-09-27,"— The opposition advised the government that we would be speaking briefly on this, and I will abide by that agreement. There has been concern about the nature and detail of these proposals and the processes by which they have been finalised. It was the opposition's view at one stage—as communicated to the government, because we did not want to create a problem in here on these matters, because the reconciliation issue is one on which the less controversy there is in the parliament the better—that we might approach the government about withdrawing this proposition. We were concerned, and we knew others were concerned, about the controversy surrounding this matter and the process of consultation. We still have concerns, though we have had briefings from the minister, the National Capital Authority and the consultant on this project, and I thank the government for making that consultation available. But we remain extremely concerned about what we and others see as the lack of adequate consultation in this final process, particularly in two regards: that the consultation has been less than adequate with Reconciliation Australia, the principal body that will in many ways be associated with this structure, and with other indigenous Australians.
I hope that there is an opportunity for more consultation before the final form and content of the slivers are embodied in the structure. I appreciate the skill and intent of the artist involved in the development of it and do not want in any way to interfere with the artistic integrity of her work. The consultation process has been substantially abbreviated; there is only a three-week time frame for consultation. We want it to be a nonpartisan issue, and we want that to apply to what is incorporated in the so-called slivers—not one of English's more wonderful words. The pictures and the writing will be of great significance to people for a long time because they depict things that are fundamental to our history. In particular, I am concerned about the content of what is called the separation sliver, but what I call and what Australians will come to call that which deals with the stolen generations. It is a very sensitive issue to all Australians, particularly to those directly affected. At this stage, I am not convinced that what is proposed to be incorporated adequately addresses this issue either sufficiently specifically or sufficiently comprehensively. Given the sensitivity of all the issues involved, to the indigenous community in particular, but not only to them, we believe that further consultation is required. 
Because of the time constraint, there is only one other point I wish to make, because we want to facilitate the valedictories and the timetable of the House. It is important to reiterate that as it proceeds Reconciliation Place must not be seen as an interference with the legitimate rights of the people at the Aboriginal tent embassy. There remains an apprehension that that may at some stage be the case. The government has given assurances that that is not its intention, and I welcome that. I certainly make it clear that that will not be the intention of a future Labor government, but there is that apprehension and it is important that we put on the record in the House that that is not the case. We will not oppose the motion. We do not persist with our previous suggestion that this should be withdrawn so that there can be more consultation, because it is desirable that the project proceed, but I hope that there can be more consultation. I know that there is some room for more consultation. I hope that it is more comprehensive and that people take full advantage of that opportunity.",REPS,<title>PARLIAMENTARY ZONE</title>,<title>Approval of Proposal</title>,Parliamentary Zone,30,1
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2001-09-27,"—I wish briefly to support the shadow minister's remarks. Reconciliation is a complex, sensitive issue. Perhaps more so than with any other issue, the process itself is part of the reconciling between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. The allowance of only a three-week consultation process is unfortunate. Quite clearly, there has not been adequate consultation or involvement of indigenous Australians. Given that Reconciliation Place will last forever, I hope, we need to get it right. I do not quite understand why the government felt the need to rush through this process and not to consult more broadly. I wish to place on record my disappointment that that has not occurred. I call on governments of whatever persuasion in future to ensure that there is adequate consultation with indigenous Australians about issues that are very dear to their hearts.

"Martin, Stephen, MP",ALP,2001-09-27,"—I rise today to ask the question: why is it that the Howard government continues to kick Wollongong in the guts? I raise this in reference to the latest decision being taken by the Australian Taxation Office to slash some 40 jobs from its work force in Wollongong. I met recently with a number of workers within the tax office, all dedicated individuals and civil servants who have given a lifetime of commitment to their organisation. They have told me that 40 jobs are being lost from Wollongong—about 17 per cent of the total staff—whereas the national average is only seven per cent, given the government's decision to axe something like 1,300 staff nationally from the Australian Taxation Office.
They asked the question: is this a first step to actually getting rid of the tax office in Wollongong completely? I have to say that I ask that question myself. It was the Keating government which took the decision to build the office there. I remember being absolutely and intimately involved in the decision for getting that building. This latest decision is going to force 30 staff either to relocate to Hurstville—and that is totally unpalatable—or take voluntary redundancy. This, as I understand it, is a clear contravention of the agency agreement that the ATO has signed with its staff and will put totally unjustifiable pressures, both financial and personal, on everyone concerned.
The loss of 40 jobs in Wollongong at this time of economic uncertainty is going to have a significant negative impact on the local economy. Of those 40 jobs, 38 staff are working in the personal tax business line, and their number is going to be reduced to four. The other 34 members have been offered a limited number of redundancy packages. I wrote to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, on 18 September asking him to contact the tax office and put an immediate stop on this decision to eliminate 40 jobs from the tax office in Wollongong. I am doing so because at this time, with the continuing complexities and uncertainties associated with the implementation of the Howard government's GST, I would have thought more people would have been needed there.
The tax office workers say to me that the number of complaints and consultations coming into the personal business and personal tax area is increasing. Why then is the tax office making the decision that it wants to cut down the number of people in Wollongong? This comes hard on the heels of the Howard government's shutting down, over the last five years, the immigration office and Medicare offices and turning its back on Wollongong. I have to say to the people in the tax office that we will do what we can to ensure those jobs are retained. It is up to Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, to go to the tax office and say, `Stop this ridiculous closure; stop this ridiculous elimination of jobs.'

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2001-09-27,"—I move:
That the bill be now read a second time.
The Interactive Gambling Bill 2001 was passed by the parliament on 28 June this year. With this act, the government took decisive action to address the further spread of problem gambling. The act responds to serious community concern about the potential for online technologies to exacerbate problem gambling.
Under the act it is now an offence to:
·	provide an interactive gambling service to customers in Australia;
·	provide an Australian based interactive gambling service to customers in designated countries; and
·	publish or broadcast an interactive gambling advertisement in Australia.
The advertising ban is a key element in minimising the accessibility of harmful forms of interactive gambling. The ban is comprehensive in its scope and includes a prohibition on the promotion of `words that are closely associated with an interactive gambling service (whether also closely associated with other kinds of services or products)'. This provision is designed to prohibit the surreptitious marketing of interactive gambling services via, for example, the promotion of clothing or accessories bearing the service's brand.
However, it has come to the attention of the government that the `close association' provision could unintentionally prohibit the advertising of land based casinos in cases where those advertisements might be closely associated with an interactive gambling service.
For example, an Australian licensed land based casino might develop and provide an interactive gambling service wholly to customers outside Australia who are not in designated countries. Such a service would not be in contravention of the main offence provisions of the act. However, if the land based casino gives a name to its online service that is similar to the name for its land based licensed service, there is a risk that over time advertisements for the land based product will be `closely associated' with the interactive gambling service that it provides legally outside Australia. The advertising prohibition in part 7A of the act, as originally introduced, did not intend to prohibit the advertising of land based casinos as outlined in this example. 
While the government is concerned about the growth and accessibility of offline gambling, this has always been a matter for the states and territories to address. For this reason, the advertising ban needs to be amended to allow this unintended consequence to be rectified.
The Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2001 provides for a regulation making power in relation to the advertising ban. Using this power, regulations may be made to exempt advertisements of a specified kind from the definition of `interactive gambling service advertisement'. These regulations will be disallowable by parliament.
The government will use the Ministerial Council On Gambling to continue to pressure states and territories to combat the socially harmful effects of land based gambling services. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.",REPS,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,51,1
"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2001-09-27,"—The Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2001 amends the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 to allow regulations to be made under the act to provide that certain advertisements are not interactive gambling service amendments and therefore are not prohibited under part 7A of the act. The government's policy in introducing the amendment is to allow the exemption from the ban of interactive gambling advertisements, advertisements that, while primarily advertising a non-interactive gambling service, may also by association advertise a lawful interactive gambling service—for example, a service provided from within Australia to people outside Australia. This would occur where a particular trade name for a non-interactive gambling service was synonymous with a lawful interactive gambling service.
While unobjectionable in itself, this bill only serves to further highlight the unworkability and hypocrisy of the government's approach to interactive gambling. Contrary to the repeated assertions by the government, this is not a debate about who in this chamber cares more about the problems posed or caused by gambling. 
Others have spoken during debate on the Interactive Gambling Act 2001 and in debate on the Internet Gambling Moratorium Act 2001 on the problems that gambling causes to individuals, their families and friends, and the wider Australian community. I do not intend to repeat those concerns that I am sure are shared by everyone in this chamber. The real issue is whether the approach undertaken by the government will be the most effective in addressing the social ill we all wish to address. The opposition regrets that it is not. 
The problems caused by gambling, and how to deal with them where that gambling is provided over the Internet, have been discussed extensively in recent times at the Commonwealth level. The Productivity Commission, for example, considered the issue in its report on gambling. The National Office for the Information Economy has twice considered the issue, and Senate committees have considered it on three separate occasions. The result of all that deliberation is that the overwhelming weight of expert evidence is that the government's approach—imposing an alleged ban—is not the most effective means of tackling this problem. 
The government has repeatedly and disingenuously claimed that the opposition will put a casino in every Australian lounge room. Yet the practical effect of the government's act has only been to ensure that the lounge room casino is foreign owned and operated, with possible links to organised crime and with potentially no appropriate protections for problem gamblers or consumers. The government's legislation is, as I have described, hypocritical and unworkable, and this amendment shows itself, as I said in the second reading debate on the act itself, to be a dog's breakfast. Amendments to the act, such as the one we are considering today, only serve to reinforce that conclusion.  
This bill is not opposed, but that does not alter the fundamental problems with the government's approach to this vexed issue of public policy. It proves that there are no easy lines to draw on the online world and that the simplistic approach adopted by the government fails to reflect that. By contrast, the opposition has consistently proposed a comprehensive, effective and strong regulatory approach to interactive gambling, an approach we have spelt out in detail both in our second reading amendments to this bill in the Senate and during debate on the act.
I urge the government to reconsider its approach, even at this late stage, and to support a response to interactive gambling that is widely recognised as being a better response to the social ills caused by gambling, whatever its form. Consistent with those remarks, I would like to formally move a second reading amendment which has been circulated in my name. I move:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House;
	(a)		condemns the Government for its unworkable, hypocritical and inconsistent approach to interactive gambling which will not reduce the social harm arising from interactive gambling and;
	(b)	calls on the Government to show national leadership on this issue by putting in place a comprehensive, effective and strong regulatory regime in co-operation with the States and Territories and the international community as proposed by Labor”.
As indicated earlier, we do not oppose this bill in the Senate. In the other place earlier this week we allowed this bill to be passed in a non-controversial fashion, to ease and facilitate the government's legislative program. In that place we also put on the record our second reading amendment, and, whilst you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would remember more than most that on some occasions in this place I have caused divisions to occur, I would not be proposing on this occasion to cause that to be effected either here or in the other place.

"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,2001-09-27,"—I rise in support of the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2001. The amendments to this bill are to ensure that the advertising ban would only apply to interactive gambling services that are banned by the bill. We do not want to catch out legitimate gaming operators who may market online services offshore in markets where that service is not prohibited.
It came to the government's attention that the act may have inadvertently prohibited the advertising of land based casinos which also provide interactive gambling services to overseas customers, so that if an Australian based casino used its name for its legitimate interactive gambling services then there would be a chance that the name would become `closely associated' with the interactive gambling service. This would then prevent the casino from using the name in advertising its land based services.
The ALP might argue that it is inconsistent for the government to amend the legislation to facilitate casino operation when its general policy is to encourage a reduction in gambling levels in the community. This ignores the minister's commitment in the Senate that the advertising prohibition would only extend to those interactive gambling services made illegal by the act. Those opposite profess compassion for the Australian people, but we on the conservative side are the ones who have taken action to protect Australian families. While the Leader of the Opposition wants to put a poker machine in every lounge room, a move that would rip more families apart, the National Party want to make families stronger and keep them together. National Party policy on the family is fundamental. We want to see that the family as a unit in society is nurtured and made to thrive. Our policy says specifically that government policy should preserve and promote the family. The Nationals in government would deliver on this, and indeed we have. 
By contrast, a quick look at the Labor Party web site shows that they have no family policy. But you do not have to go online to realise that it is obvious that their opposition is to the Interactive Gambling Act. They are soft on Internet gambling just as they are soft on drugs, soft on crime and—depending on which way the wind blows—soft on illegal immigrants. Their opposition does not just go against the moral values of middle Australia; it goes against expert recommendations, economic sense and the findings on gambling addiction. The National Office of the Information Economy commissioned economic modelling that suggested the banning of online gambling may have modest or small economic benefits for Australia in terms of restricting access to harmful activity and may have aggregate benefits for the states and territories in their taxation revenues. It found the growth of interactive gambling had the potential for negative social consequences in Australia because of the increased accessibility to gambling services. Indeed, this is what the original act was all about.
The Productivity Commission report on gambling revealed some staggering and sobering facts. Over 80 per cent of Australians gambled last year, spending $11 billion, with 40 per cent gambling regularly. Gambling is a big and rapidly growing business in Australia, with industries currently accounting for an estimated 1.5 per cent of GDP and employing over 100,000 people in more than 7,000 businesses throughout the country. However, the net gains in jobs and economic activity are small when account is taken of the impact on other industries of the diversion of consumer spending to gambling. Around 130,000 Australians, about one per cent of the population, are estimated to have a severe problem with their gambling. A further 160,000 adults have moderate problems which may require some form of treatment.
These two groups together warrant policy concern. When we take them together, we have 290,000 problem gamblers—2.1 per cent of the population. Problem gamblers comprise 15 per cent of the regular non-lottery gamblers and account for $3.5 billion in expenditure annually—about one-third of the gambling industry's market. You can see that about 15 per cent of the regular gamblers send off about 33 per cent of the $11 billion expended on gambling. They lose on average about $12,000 a year compared with only $650 for non-regular gamblers. Perhaps the most damning finding in terms of the opposition to this bill is that the prevalence of problem gambling is related to the degree of accessibility to gambling, particularly gaming machines. That is the point I want to stress in this address. Despite these black-and-white findings, the Beazley bandits want the one-arm bandits in every lounge room. What impact do you think it will have on families?
It is interesting to note from the Productivity Commission's findings that the Labor Party is out of step with the wider community. Seventy per cent of Australians surveyed believed that gambling did more harm than good and 92 per cent said they did not want to see any expansion of gambling activities. According to a recent survey by AustraliaSCAN, 75 per cent of Australians believe gambling on the Internet is not acceptable.
The Labor Party says it is too hard to regulate the Internet. I say that is a defeatist attitude and shows a lack of understanding of the media. We have banned advertising on gaming services across all media to limit access to the Australian market. There is already a precedent in the tobacco industry with the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act of 1992—
—which I think your party actually introduced in 1992—would that not be right, Member for the Northern Territory?

—Order! I would like to advise the member for the Northern Territory that when the chair is talking he should be silent. Member for Hinkler, you will ignore the interjections coming from the other side and also you will not ascribe support or non-support for any previous bill to the occupant of the chair. You will address your remarks through the chair.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was making an analogy between the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act introduced by the ALP in 1992 as a precedent for this act that we are introducing. It is surprising, then, that the opposition should be opposing it.
Offshore or Australian operators that provide online gaming services to customers in Australia are liable for an offence of providing a prohibited interactive gaming service. While members opposite may be prepared to put this one in the too-hard basket, my National Party colleagues—and, no doubt, my coalition colleagues—and I say that nothing is too hard when it comes to protecting families. In passing this legislation we will help protect the young, computer literate generation from new and immediate forms of gambling recognised by experts as dangerously addictive. We will also help prevent a situation where people can lose the shirts off their backs within a few minutes of sitting down in front of a home computer.
I feel very strongly about this. I will tell you why. Of recent times I have seen the demise of a lot of clubs, a demise which has come about by an overreliance on poker machines. We had a lot of good clubs on the New South Wales and Queensland coasts, where as you know there is quite a holiday atmosphere and where people—the member for Robertson is a typical example—do like to have good clubs to enjoy social interaction, to attend sporting events, to have a drink with their mates, to play indoor and outdoor sports. They have gymnasiums. All sorts of good things come with clubs, but when you overlay it with the poker machines—and I am not saying that people should not gamble; I am just saying when you let this become the overriding aspect of the club—the minute those poker machines get into trouble the whole club collapses. We have seen a whole variety of these on the New South Wales and Queensland coasts in the last couple of years. To see these beautiful clubs close because of this overreliance on poker machines is a dreadful thing.
Let me take you on from that to the damage that does to a community in terms of social interactivity. If we were to have allowed interactive gambling on the computer, can't you just imagine some lonely soul at night with a stubbie in one hand and the mouse or the keyboard in the other, with some special facility, which no doubt would be devised very quickly, where you shove your credit card in; can't you just see him shove the credit card in, ring up $50 or $100 worth of credit, stubbie in one hand—and away he goes, all night. You could send off hundreds of dollars like that. At least when you go to a club there is the discipline: you have to go to the counter; you have to pick up your coins; you have to put them through the machine; you have to physically go through the process of doing it. I say that Internet gambling would further exacerbate the problem. 
Already we have, as I pointed out earlier, more than our fair share of problem gambling in Australia. I am no moralist about this: if people want to gamble on horses, or dogs, or gallops, if they want to have a flutter on the poker machines, if they want to get scratchies from the newsagent, I make no judgments. But I do not think governments should be in the business of accelerating this sort of thing. It is obvious that an overreliance on poker machines has damaged a lot of families. Also, those clubs that have become overreliant on them, when they cannot support the activities of the club by any means other than poker machines, promptly fall over, and there is a great loss of social interaction in the communities that they serve. 
I feel very passionate about this: if we were to have allowed interactive gambling on computers in homes, we would have had a whole plethora of new problems, not least of which would have been young, computer-literate people having a dabble. Even if there were security PIN numbers, not all parents are so focused in that regard. The kids find out what dad's PIN number is, get on the machine and away they go. Worse still, imagine how many people, who at least have to make the effort to have some social interaction and go to a club, would not even go to a club. 
I feel that the government has done a very good job on this matter. To some extent, I feel sad for the Northern Territory. I had a very heated debate in the party room with Senator Grant Tambling on this issue. I think his treatment by the Northern Territory CLP was regrettable. He did fight bravely for the Northern Territory on this issue, in both party rooms. He was quite focused. I know that, firstly, because I am the National Party Whip—I have seen him in action—and, secondly, because I debated against him. Having said that, with all the respect I have for him, and knowing the difficulties that this may cause for the Northern Territory, I believe the government has gone down the right track in the national interest. This amendment is a sensible one because it rectifies an unintended consequence for the existing gambling industry. For that reason, I support the bill.",REPS,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,51,1
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2001-09-27,"—I am pleased to contribute to this debate on the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2001, although I must say I was quite amazed by the bizarre contribution by the previous speaker, the member for Hinkler, and I will address that in some detail shortly. Initially, I want to comment on the latter part of his speech in which he spoke about the contribution of Grant Tambling. I have no idea what went on in the party room of the National Party or in the joint party room, but he was right—this was one part of his speech which was correct—in saying that the CLP unjustly dealt with Grant Tambling. I think, frankly, that it is a matter of some concern to all of us that we have a political party in the Northern Territory—thankfully, it is no longer the government of the Northern Territory—which threatened one of its members that, if he did not vote the way it wanted him to vote in the federal parliament, it would withdraw his preselection.
That is not only wrong, but I suspect there is a very good chance that it represents a breach of privilege, because no-one has the right to tell a person how they are to cast a vote on the floor of the chamber. They may, at some subsequent time, say to a person, `In the past you failed to vote in the way we wanted you to vote, therefore when you're up for preselection next time you're not getting our support.' But that is not what occurred. He was a preselected candidate and the CLP, as a result of the government's failure to support its view, deliberately overturned his preselection in a subsequent act. That is not only unfair; it is wrong.
—He did defend the Northern Territory.
—He may have defended the Northern Territory; I do not think he defended it very well. It demonstrates the absolute lack of influence that the Northern Territory CLP government had here in Canberra, despite the fact that the Federal President of the Liberal Party of Australia is none other than Shane Stone, a Northern Territory resident, a former Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and a member of the CLP. I know that he has now disowned the CLP. I understand, by the way, that at the moment he is involved in trying to overturn the preselection of the preselected CLP candidate for the House of Representatives seat of Solomon. But nothing surprises me in the Northern Territory when it comes to the CLP. 
I say to the member for Hinkler: I find it rather bizarre that you indicated that you are not making any moral judgment when it comes to people who are involved in gambling—that is exactly what you are doing. It is okay for people to go and play the one-armed bandits in any club or pub in Australia where they exist; it is okay for people to go to a casino on land and play roulette, two-up or any one of a number of games in gaming rooms; he says he makes no judgment about that. But somehow or other, people who might be playing on the Internet are clearly a different quality of person, because they deserve condemnation. Others do not; habitual punters who might have a severe problem with betting are not a problem for him. Those people who go to the track and lose their family income are not a problem for him.
—That is not what the member said.
—That is what he said. He said, `I don't worry about people having a flutter.' Those are not his words; they are mine. But they are an apt description of what he said. Somehow or other, people who sit at home and have access to the Internet are different. Well, the hypocrisy knows no bounds. It is worth contemplating what this all means, Mr Deputy Speaker. I refer to the Bills Digest because the summation contained there is a very good one. In terms of the reason for the amendment, it states:
In moving the amendments to the Interactive Gambling Bill on 28 June 2001, the Minister (Senator the Hon. Richard Alston) stated that `The advertising ban would only apply to interactive gambling services that are banned by the bill'. However, it has since come to the Government's attention that the Act may inadvertently prohibit the advertising of land-based casinos which also provide interactive gambling services to overseas customers. Section 61BA(1)(e) defines an interactive gambling advertisement as any writing, visual image or audible message that promotes `any words that are closely associated with an interactive gambling service'. If a land based casino uses its name for its legitimate interactive gambling services, then there is a chance that the name will become `closely associated' with the interactive gambling service. This would then prevent the casino from using the name in advertising its land-based services.
Understand what this means: if I am a casino operator and I have an interactive gambling service which goes to countries which are not nominated in this bill, that is fine; that is okay. But if Australians want to gamble on that service, that is not okay. What sort of moral duplicity is this? We are making a judgment that it is fine for people in some other country to gamble on these sites, provided they are not one of the nominated countries, but it is not fine for Australians to gamble on these sites. Conversely, there is absolutely nothing that can be done by this government or any other to prevent Australians, wherever they might live, who have got access to the Internet, from gambling on the Internet. 
I am happy to take the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration, who has just delivered the second reading speech, and any other member of the National Party and the Liberal Party, down to my office so that we can play a few games on the Internet. Let us call up some gaming sites around the world. You do not have the ability to prohibit it. Yet, instead of accepting the integrity of standards that can be applied in Australia, there is the lunacy of saying to this one small segment of the gambling industry, `What you do is immoral; it is improper. We're concerned about the state of the nation.'
I tell you it is very clear that members of the National Party and the Liberal Party do not go to workers areas around Australia. They do not go to the clubs and casinos that I go to. They do not see those people playing the one-armed bandits that I see. What response do they have? They say, `That is a state responsibility. We wash our hands of that. That is not an issue for us; that happens to be a matter for the states and territories.' The contribution made by the member for Hinkler was bizarre and so is the proposition that has been put forward by the government in relation to Internet gambling. It is not a sensible approach. The Bills Digest says: 
Of course, any casino which wished to avoid this possibility could simply use a different name for its interactive gambling services. However, this would deny a reputable casino the opportunity of capitalising on its good name with regard to its interactive services. This could be a considerable drawback, as a reputation for reliability is essential for a successful Internet gambling operation.
It might be argued that it is inconsistent for the Government to amend its legislation to facilitate casino operations—
which is what it is doing—
when its general policy is to encourage a reduction in gambling levels in the community.
That strikes me as a bit hypocritical. It is hypocritical and, I think, it smacks of the political opportunism which it exhibits. I have already referred to Senator Tambling. Senator Tambling has been dumped by the CLP for not crossing the floor in parliament on this issue. 
What we also should understand about this industry is that Australian operators make up less than four per cent of the world interactive gambling market. Ninety per cent or thereabouts of Australian interactive revenues come from international sources. Online gambling is approximately one per cent of Australian gambling—only one per cent. So here we have the opportunity for an industry to develop which could be properly regulated to ensure the security of both the punters and the institutions—the casinos or the other gaming houses or betting institutions. With that proper regulation it could address the issue of credit in a way which cannot be done on a racecourse.
The member for Hinkler referred to people using their credit cards at home, slotting them into a machine. I do not gamble myself, but I go to these places and I see people lining up by the funny money machines. You see people line up with their cards—they are using credit cards or making cash withdrawals through EFTPOS—and go back in and lose money on poker machines or other games. What does the government propose to do about that? Is it suggested that the state and territory governments say that these instant opportunities for credit should not exist at gambling institutions? I am sure it is not.
The main issue here is online gambling. Online gambling is the most important issue in Australian gambling. Australia has around one-fifth of the world's poker machines, and of course this is where the real problem is. The introduction of this legislation has created the global perception that interactive sites in Australia are illegal. This has cost the economy and will continue to cost the economy.
I should point out in case people are in any doubt that the Isle of Man off the coast of England has set up a regulatory environment for interactive gambling. Three international companies have been granted licences to set up shop and trade on the Isle of Man. What does this mean? One of the companies is MGM Mirage. MGM owns the Darwin Casino. Because it could not get an interactive gaming licence in Australia, it has chosen to get an interactive gaming licence to operate in a properly regulated environment on the Isle of Man. What does the government say about this?
If I go down to my computer and key `MGM Mirage' into one of the search engines, what is to stop me? Absolutely nothing. Yet we have the hypocrisy of the government saying that it is not prepared to set up properly and appropriately regulated Internet gaming sites in Australia so that we can control the industry. We can be concerned about the punters, but we now have them presumably playing on the Isle of Man site and on any number of unregulated sites around the world. We know that there are estimated to be more than 1,400 Internet gaming sites in existence being operated by 250 companies around the world. For some reason or other, we are saying to Australian businesses who have been responsible that they cannot participate in this business, even though the government has within its hands the ability to set up a properly regulated environment for that to happen. In the past, it was possible to forecast that we could have developed an industry which was responsible, properly regulated, informed and accountable. It would have meant increasing employment, business opportunities and technological development and would have given us the possibility of taxation revenues and the ability to regulate in ways which we saw as appropriate. 
I am advised that current gradable revenues from Internet gaming are about $1.5 billion—I presume that is $US1.5 billion. It is estimated that they will reach $US10 billion by the year 2005. If properly licensed, regulated and taxed, cash based Internet gaming has the potential to become a multimillion dollar opportunity for the gaming industry world wide. That is true. You cannot deny that. What we need to do as a responsible community is say that we accept the reality that this is going on and not hide our faces to this reality. We should come up with a set of proposals that allows us to participate in that process so that we can appropriately govern and regulate what happens within Australia. Not only is it silly to deny ourselves this possibility but it smacks of identifying one group of people only who are involved in gambling and saying to them, `We don't trust you to gamble.' Yet, as the member for Hinkler said, every other form of gambling in Australia gets carte blanche. Therein lies the absolute hypocrisy.
I point to two companies that operate out of Alice Springs. Lasseters Casino, which is a regulated Internet gaming site and was the first major Internet gaming site to operate in Australia, does very good business. Its clients are overseas. The other company I want to refer to is Centrebet. It is Australia's oldest interactive gambling operator and is involved in sports wagering. It was founded in 1996 and employs 40 full-time and 40 part-time staff. It contributes over $7 million to the local economy and in 2000 was rated by the Overseas Trading Magazine as one of Australia's top 50 important exporters. We know Centrebet's activities are okay. You and I can ring Centrebet today. In fact, I saw in this morning's Australian reference to Centrebet's odds on the forthcoming election. If the parliamentary secretary opposite wants to put up a wager, he can ring Gerard Daffy at Centrebet and say, `I want to put a couple of dollars on the Labor Party or the Liberal Party.'
—It would not be on the Labor Party.
—A lot of people have; let me be clear about it. They are holding at the moment approximately $300,000. That is fine; that is absolutely terrific. But if you go down the road to Lasseters and say, `I'm going to be living at Halls Creek for the next seven months. Can I gamble off your site?' they have to say no. What is the logic? Where is the logic? There is no logic in this legislation. I mentioned before that I thought the contribution of the member for Hinkler was bizarre. Not only was it bizarre; it was contradictory, because he was prepared to support people gambling on every other activity they possibly could in Australia but not support people being allowed to participate in interactive gambling from their homes.
I know that gambling is a problem and it must be addressed. But if the government think prohibition is the way to address it then I think they will ultimately come to the same conclusion as those people who were trying to prohibit alcohol consumption in the United States in the 1920s. They will realise that they have failed and not only have they failed but they have missed an opportunity. They have missed an opportunity to properly regulate, properly govern and properly administer an industry which has the potential to earn a great deal of money for Australia and provide many job and business opportunities. I am pleased to support the amendments put forward by the shadow minister on behalf of the Labor Party. ",REPS,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,51,1
"Theophanous, Dr Andrew, MP",IND,2001-09-27,"—It is not often that I disagree with my colleague, the member for the Northern Territory but, unlike the member for Hinkler, I am concerned about all forms of gambling in Australia and I am concerned about what has been happening with the massive expansion of gambling in this country.
The member for the Northern Territory says, `If we've got all of that, why don't we have a bit more?' I believe that what we have got to do is put a stop to new forms of gambling arising and start to reverse the trends in relation to the most insidious forms that have appeared in this country. I am talking here about the poker machine phenomenon, which has been a total disaster. When I say it has been a total disaster I do not mean simply in terms of the way people have lost so much money on the poker machines. I mean the social consequences of those losses.
—We have a huge proportion of the world's machines in this country.
—Yes, we do, as the parliamentary secretary says. When this bill went through the House this was one of the rare occasions that I actually supported a bill from the government. Mr Andren, the other Independent, and I did so on the basis that we believe that this is a whole new area of gambling that is going to have disastrous consequences if it is allowed to spread. I do not say, as some do, `This is the only area of gambling which we need to tackle.' No. We also need to tackle the other areas. I will come back to that in a minute. 
It seems to me that in what the member for the Northern Territory put forward there were two basic arguments. One was: if you have got every other type of gambling, why don't you have this one? The answer to that is clear. If you open up this new type of gambling, you can stay in your own home, turn on the Internet and, if you are really mad, gamble away in the same night maybe all of your money. People are already doing enough of this in the casinos and with poker machines which have appeared in so many clubs and hotels throughout this country, especially in the state of Victoria.
We used to have a situation in Sydney—and in New South Wales—where poker machines were only available to nonprofit organisations. What then happened in Victoria? To their utter disgrace, the previous Labor government introduced poker machines into profitable organisations—hotels, clubs and any other organisation able to make a buck. They appeared everywhere.
—They wanted that revenue.
—The parliamentary secretary says they wanted the revenue. But the fact of the matter is that what happened was a disgrace. The whole social culture of Victoria has been changed because of this phenomenon, even the pubs. Pubs used to be a place where you went and had a drink and mixed with your mates. You go to a pub now in Victoria, and what do you see? You see people not talking to each other at all. They are all in front of these damn machines and losing thousands of dollars.
Even the state government recently admitted how many millions and millions were lost by Victorians. But do they do anything about it? They say, `We might have to introduce a few regulatory things here and there to stop the number of times you do it.' But the point is: the phenomenon has occurred. It has happened and it has changed the culture even in hotels now. You go to a hotel and people do not mix; they do not socialise. They just play these damn machines and they lose all their money. Whether it is the wife or the husband, what happens when they do not have any money to supply the basic goods and services for the children? I know about this because in my electorate we have the Salvation Army and the care centre who continually run out of food for children. Why? It is because these people lose so much money in this gambling phenomenon. 
Of course, you cannot ban gambling altogether. Nobody is saying that. But the more opportunities you make available, the worse it gets. There is absolutely no doubt about that. This is what happened in Victoria with the poker machines. Now it is very difficult to reverse such a phenomenon. The hotels that got the poker machines became very rich and had plenty of customers. The occasional old traditional pub that did not get them went to the wall. We have a situation now where the hotel industry has become totally dependent on these poker machines and the whole culture has been changed.
Imagine what would happen if Internet gambling were to become totally available in the way in which it has been suggested. We would have the potential to bring the problem into every home. It is an outrage to suggest that there is no social issue here. I agree with the member for the Northern Territory that there could be some money in this. Since when did the Labor Party support matters only because there is money in it? I do not know where they got this idea that we should not proceed to ban Internet gambling. Of course we should ban it. Not only that, we should work for the reversal of what has already happened.
I do not often agree with the Prime Minister—everybody knows that—but I agree with him on this point: the gambling disease has become a curse in this country. It has got to the point where it is affecting the social fabric in a very serious way. It is all right for middle-class and upper-class people to have their flutters at the casino. Even if they lose $1,000 or $2,000 it does not matter so much. But the poor people without big incomes who have easy forms of gambling available to them in this way include sad cases where pensioners get their pensions and go off to the poker machines and waste all their money.
If interactive gambling were to proceed, not only would we have the groups that go to clubs and hotels and gamble away all their money; we would also have young people who are accustomed to the use of the Internet suddenly discovering that this was a way forward. And what would happen? Young people would be afflicted by this disease. Not only would we have the older people, the pensioners and so on, who now go to these hotels—some of them go every day and waste all their money—but also, younger people who are used to working with the Internet would get involved.
We have to understand that society needs some goals other than gambling. Sport is an important Australian phenomenon. We should encourage that. We have so many cultural activities. There are so many activities conducted by different organisations in our society—which, by the way, need support from people. Many of these are not being supported because of the time being spent by individuals on the gambling disease. I refer to activities like volunteer work, which Australians are good at. We could have more people volunteering to do good works were it not for the fact that there is so much time and effort being totally wasted because of this gambling disease. We are told that, because it is there and because it is going to become more readily available at an international level, we must have it here in Australia.
If this bill represents only a start in coming to grips with the gambling disease, let it be a start. Let it be an important start. Let us draw a line; let us say that we, as parliamentarians, care about this phenomenon and that we want to stop it. I am not referring to ordinary recreational gambling; I am referring to the excesses and the situation where people are absolutely ruining their lives. 
The member for the Northern Territory said that there are all of these responsible organisations that control gambling; therefore they could easily control Internet gambling. How responsible are these organisations? Isn't this the same set of organisations that is constantly promoting gambling? Isn't this the same set of organisations that has promoted the dreadful growth in the number of poker machines to such an enormous degree? When poker machines came in, they said, `We're going to be very responsible.' They now actively try to do everything they can to get people to invest more and more money in these gambling activities.  
I do not consider them to be responsible in any social sense. Maybe they are responsible in the sense that they do not resort to criminal activities, but that is not the same as their being responsible and saying, `This particular individual is going beyond the bounds and is destroying himself and his family.' They do not do that. There are no controls in that way. We then have to say that at least in a social milieu some people might see this person—it does not happen often but it does occasionally—and perhaps give him a hand or advice. If Internet gambling is available in the person's own home, with nobody knowing about it, that person could, in the space of a day or two or a week, totally lose their assets—not only their income but their assets. The number of people who have lost everything through gambling is frightening.
I bring up this point: we do not publicise the statistics, but suicide as a result of gambling is a serious problem. People do come to that desperation point. The thing about gambling is, as the great Dostoevski said in his novels, the way in which it gets to you. You think, `The next round, I am going to win, and then I am going to win the round after that, and the one after that.'
The parliament secretary wanted me to finish within 10 minutes, and I have gone over time. But I want to say that I oppose the introduction of interactive gambling into Australia, and I believe this bill is a good move. I think we should also work together with the states. Whoever wins the federal election should bring together the state governments and tackle directly the problem of the excessive gambling with poker machines in clubs and hotels which has got to such a point that it is undermining and destroying the social fabric of this country.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2001-09-27,"—Initially, I would like to say to the member for Calwell that I was not seeking to restrict him to 10 minutes; I was just interested to know how long he was going to speak in the Main Committee. I do understand that there is a division imminent in the main chamber and so I will endeavour to complete the summing up prior to that occurring, but I could be interrupted.
I listened very carefully to the comments made by the honourable member for Calwell. It is pretty clear that he does not have a lot in common with the Australian Labor Party any more, and one can understand why, after 21 years, he has taken that important step and has become an Independent by walking away from the Australian Labor Party. I am hopeful that, in the election, the Australian people will once again walk away from the Australian Labor Party because of their flip-flopping all over the place and not having any positive policies to improve this wonderful country.
I thank all the honourable members on both sides who have contributed to this debate on the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2001. The government is concerned about the potential for new technologies to increase the accessibility of gambling services and therefore to exacerbate problem gambling in the Australian community. The Interactive Gambling Act represents a strong response by the government to the use of new interactive communications technologies to spread gambling into Australian homes. 
The ban on the advertising of interactive gambling is an important element of this tough approach. However, it has never been the intention of the act to restrict offline or land based gambling or the advertising of such services. While the government remains very concerned about the socially harmful effects of poker machines and casinos—and the member for Calwell outlined the problems of poker machines—the responsibility rests squarely with the states and territories which have allowed them to proliferate. The new exemption power provided for in this amendment will allow the government to rectify any unintentional effect that the advertising ban may have on land based gambling services. In the Ministerial Council on Gambling, the Commonwealth government will continue to pursue measures to protect the Australian community from both online and offline gambling.  
The shadow minister moved a second reading amendment. The government does not accept that second reading amendment. We do not support regulation as an alternative to a ban. The regulatory approach in effect provides a stimulus to the growth of this form of gambling. Efforts by states and territories to reach agreement on new national standards have not succeeded, despite the announcement by the Prime Minister—
A division having been called in the House of Representatives—
Sitting suspended from 10.59 a.m. to 11.10 a.m.
—As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted by the Australian Labor Party, who called for a division in the other place, despite the Prime Minister's announcement of the Commonwealth's concerns in December 1999 efforts by the states and territories to reach agreement on new national standards have not succeeded. There is no reason to think that states and territories can restrict the growth of new forms of gambling any more than they have been able to do with poker machines. Australia has a quite frightening percentage of the world's poker machines in operation.
During the debate, certain matters were raised by the honourable member for the Northern Territory. In effect, it has been asked in the debate: how will the interactive gambling legislation deter the provision of interactive gambling services to Australians from offshore locations? The member for the Northern Territory referred in particular to a casino operating with an Isle of Man licence. A number of measures have been put in place by the legislation. This is a difficult area but the extension of the offence to foreign providers, which will deter them from signing up Australian customers in much the same way as the US Wire Wager Act, is one way. A ban on the advertising of interactive gambling services in Australia is another. There are regulations in development which will deal with the unenforceability of agreements, such as money transfers relating to illegal interactive gambling. There is a system under which Internet service providers will be able to respond to complaints about foreign gambling services on the Internet by providing their customers with filtering options. There is also a designated country clause which will allow complementary legislation in other countries to be recognised under the Australian act. These measures will also deter the take-up of interactive gambling by Australians.
We reject the amendment moved by the honourable member for Perth and we ask the chamber to support the Interactive Gambling Amendment Bill 2001.

That the bill be now read a second time. 
The purpose of the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 is to make consequential amendments to certain offence provisions in portfolio legislation to reflect the application of the Criminal Code Act 1995. The code contains a standard approach to the formulation of criminal offences. When it commences on 15 December 2001, the code will alter the way in which the criminal offence provisions are interpreted, including offences contained in Family and Community Services portfolio legislation. The amendments made by this bill harmonise relevant offences with the code while also ensuring that the relevant offences continue to have the same meaning in operation as they do at present. This bill is one of a series designed to apply the code on a portfolio by portfolio basis.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2001-09-27,"—I want to take this opportunity to put on the record a few comments for the Australian Labor Party about the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001, even though we have agreed to support it in the House of Representatives and the Senate. This bill amends a number of Family and Community Services portfolio statutes to ensure that they are in accord with chapter 2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. I understand that this is occurring across portfolios with the intention of ensuring that all Commonwealth criminal offences have standard formulation of the elements of intention, fault, burden of proof and penalty. The approach the government is taking to the application of chapter 2 of the Criminal Code is appropriate and has already been supported by Labor in respect of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 and other like bills in other portfolios. In respect of that bill, I note that the shadow minister for justice said that there might be difficulties with some of the drafting but that the detailed problems would only become apparent as the amendments are applied across portfolios. It is neither possible nor efficient to attempt to double-check each and every offence in each and every portfolio from the position of opposition.
While the Labor Party are giving support to the government's legislation, we will monitor the application of the amendments and we will move to address any anomalies or problems which arise. In fact, Labor has been made aware of several issues by the Welfare Rights Network, an organisation we have a great deal of respect for and one that has advised the parliament previously of potential anomalies and has got it right. The Welfare Rights Network is concerned that this bill will make a material difference to the lives of some income support recipients. I would like to put some of those concerns on the record. The major forms of amendment provided for by this bill are: the application of strict liability or absolute liability to individual offences or specified physical elements of offences; the removal of defences that appear in certain provisions, instead placing reliance on the code's general defences; and the deletion of references to certain provisions of the Crimes Act, replacing these with references to the equivalent code provisions. 
The main implications for social security recipients seem to be as follows. Firstly, regarding the issue of strict liability, the code clarifies the traditional distinction between the actus reus—the physical act now referred to as the `physical element'—and the mens rea—what the defendant thought or intended, now referred to as the `fault element'. Where strict liability applies to an offence, the prosecution does not have to prove fault on behalf of the defendant. The prosecution need only prove that the physical element of the offence or actus reus did occur, and the intention behind the action is irrelevant to determining whether the offence has taken place. The bill introduces several subclauses specifying that offences be now offences of strict liability. However, there is the defence of mistake of fact under section 9.2 of the code. Section 9.2 provides that a person is not criminally responsible for an offence of this nature if, at the time of the conduct constituting the physical element, the person considered whether or not fact existed and is under a mistaken but reasonable belief about those facts and, had those facts existed, the conduct would not have constituted an offence. According to subsection 13.3(2) of the code, the person wishing to deny criminal responsibility bears an evidential burden in relation to showing a mistake of fact. 
The second issue I wish to raise is the treatment of intention. The physical elements provided for by the code are the conduct, the circumstance in which it occurs and the result of the conduct. For every physical element there is a corresponding fault element. The code does not prevent an offence from specifying an alternative fault element, but the code indicates that a default element will apply in the absence of a specified fault element. The code establishes four default fault elements: intention, knowledge, recklessness and negligence. It provides that for conduct, the default element is intention; for circumstantial result, the default fault element is recklessness. The bill substitutes clauses that had referred to a person as `knowingly' or `recklessly' with simply `recklessly'. For example, section 1061ZZBW is concerned with refusal or failure to comply with notices. Currently, the provision applies the fault elements of intention—or intentionally—and recklessness—or recklessly—in relation to the proscribed physical element of conduct, namely, the refusal or failure to comply. The explanatory memorandum states:
Following application of the Code, the fault elements of ... recklessness will be restricted to physical elements of circumstance or result, and intention will be the sole fault element that can be applied to a physical element of conduct: see Division 5 of Part 2.2 of the Code. ... This Item recreates the offence so that intention is the only fault element in relation to the physical element of conduct. ...The Item also reconstructs the offence so that the fault element of recklessness applies in relation to the physical element of circumstances ...
—namely the requirement to comply. In the view of the Welfare Rights Network, all that this effectively achieves is the reduction of the level of intention where recklessness is all that is necessary for the finding of an offence.
The third issue I wish to raise is the shift of burden of proof. The bill may also shift the burden of proof in regard to the defences `reasonable excuse' and `to the extent that the person is capable of complying'. The bill removes the phrases `without reasonable excuse' and `to the extent to which the person is capable of complying' from a number of clauses. This shifts the ability to take into account such factors, and their treatment as specific defences. For example—and I have referred to this section before—section 1061ZZBW is concerned with refusal or failure to comply with notices. The bill removes the defences of `to the extent that the person is capable complying with the notice' and `without reasonable excuse', and they are recreated in new sections.
The member for Moreton, who is speaking next, might like to refer to these sections of the bill, sections 1061ZZBW(2) and (3). I would be interested in the view of the member for Moreton on how those sections will affect welfare recipients and whether he agrees with the Welfare Rights Network that this creates a potential problem. The rationale for this amendment is to prevent any future interpretation that `without reasonable excuse' is an element of the offence, which would have to be disproved in the negative by the prosecution. I know the member for Werriwa is going to talk about this clause when he addresses this bill later on in the debate.
The explanatory memorandum claims:
The amendment puts it beyond doubt that having a reasonable excuse is a defence to the offence. Pursuant to subsection 13.3(3) of the Code, a defendant who wishes to rely on such defences bears an evidential burden in relation to the defence. 
Effectively, then, the change formally shifts the burden of proof for such matters from the prosecution to the defence.
We are going to keep a close eye on these matters, which is why the Australian Labor Party, the member for Werriwa and I have closely examined this bill and gone through it in such detail. We believe that you have to keep your eye on this shifty government, particularly when it comes to areas of welfare, because we know what its view is—if it can slip something in that will punish people, then it will be for it. A future Labor government will have, by the end of the year, a large task in making fair many aspects of social security legislation that have been skewed against the disadvantaged during the time of this government. This government is a government that believes in punishing the poor and the vulnerable in our community. Whilst I believe that, in this instance, there is no intent other than to achieve consistency across legislation, I want to say very clearly that we will look at the impact of this legislation and we will move to reform it if the concerns raised by the Welfare Rights Network have a real and negative impact on the lives of income support recipients.",REPS,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,52,1
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2001-09-27,"—I am pleased to contribute to this discussion and wish to place on record my congratulations to the member for Grayndler for his detailed assessment of aspects of the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001. My only fear is that after having been on the outer of the Labor Party for so long he may be succumbing to some illness. I suspect he has been a bit cold out there all these years, but I wish him well and hope that his health returns soon.
This piece of legislation before us is part of an ongoing package of measures that the government has had to introduce to try to bring some consistency when dealing with the application of the Criminal Code across all portfolios. In particular, this bill will, in fact, apply amendments across a range of acts, including A New Tax System (Bonus for Older Australians) Act, the family assistance act, Child Support Assessment Act, Child Support (Registration Collection) Act, Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Act, Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act, Disability Services Act, Farm Household Support Act, First Home Owners Act, Home Deposit Assistance Act, Home Savings Grant Act 1964 and 1976, Social Security Act 1991, Social Security Administration Act 1999 and the Social Welfare Commission (Repeal) Act 1976. Whilst this particular matter may seem consequential of changes to the way the Criminal Code operates, it nevertheless does involve a great deal of considered repeal and amendment to a variety of acts.
I am a bit like the member for Grayndler—I am not sure what the member for Werriwa will say—in this way because I always share some concern about the consequence of public policy, which may impact in an unintended way on some in our community. I can assure the House that my role as a member of parliament is always to look for exceptions to the rule and to deal with them. It is very important that rights are always balanced by a sense of responsibility, which the government has attempted to do in this area of community services legislation. We accept that a great range of Australians are on low incomes and are, for whatever circumstance, in a position where they are not able to fully support themselves. We want to ensure that they do rightly gain access to assistance. It is a fundamental principle of fair go. The availability of this particular assistance means that equality of opportunity, the opportunity to get to the starting line of life, is of course assured for all Australians. The so-called social safety net is something that I fundamentally believe is an important and great mark as far as a decent society is concerned.
At the same time it is important that those who do claim falsely are not getting in the way of those who really need it. The responsibility factor of anybody who claims access to social benefits is to ensure that they are keeping the agencies which dole that money out fully across their circumstances. If their circumstances change, they should report those changes and ensure that they are getting the correct share, not their excess share, of assistance that they are entitled to. Why? There are a couple of reasons. One reason is that the sense of a fair go means that those who need it most should get it and those who do not need it most can wait or perhaps should not get it. Those who have the capacity to do something for themselves should go on and do it and make a contribution to the overall good of society to ensure that those who do not have the capacity to do something for themselves are well looked after by society. 
It is important that, when we deal with anomalies, we understand that anomalies only stand out because the great bulk of people are doing the right thing. The proper laws, the proper application of them and the proper understanding of all individual citizens involved in the various systems are enforced. I would like to place in the context of this debate the congratulations I offer to the compliance and control section of Centrelink. The government has not changed any laws as far as bringing in new draconian measures, as those opposite often try to suggest; all we have done is enforce longstanding principles and arrangements that were in so many ways legislated by those opposite when they were last in power. We have simply enforced longstanding accepted practices that, for lack of will from ministerial level down under the previous Labor government, allowed too many people to claim too much, too often, at the overall cost to the community and to the detriment of those who legitimately claim.
Those who are on welfare services are often looked down upon by others; they have been looked down upon in the past. We often hear terms used in our community about welfare recipients. But in the last couple of years the legitimate receivers of welfare have been able to hold their heads high and say, `Look, compliance, control, tough measures—they are there. They are enforcing the longstanding principles. I get what I get because I am entitled to it.' A great sense of dignity is now being restored to those who need that dignity because, for whatever reason, they are not able to look after themselves. They get the dignity knowing that the system now enforces their right to gain access to benefits by ensuring that those who do not have the right are not getting the benefits.
It is interesting to note that Minister Anthony, who has been doing a fine job in this portfolio area, recently announced that at this time last year there was an increase in reviews into welfare fraud resulting from public tip-offs—an increase of 32 per cent in Queensland alone, between 1 July and 31 December 2000. The most recent Centrelink half-year compliance report shows that as a direct result of tip-offs from Queenslanders, $2.8 million in debts was realised. That is a massive amount.
A division having been called in the House of Representatives—
Sitting suspended from 11.32 a.m. to 11.42 a.m.
—Queenslanders have realised that those who are entitled to get access to benefits should of course be assured of that entitlement. Those who do get access to benefits are now more understanding that they have a responsibility to make sure that they get what they should get and no more, because the money should be released to go to those who are more needy. In that regard, $2.8 million worth of debts was located for the second half of last year. It is a saving of almost $153,000 per week but, more particularly, it is the opportunity to redirect money to those who need it more. It is beholden upon a responsible government to ensure that assistance in the form of any social welfare is directed to the most needy first of all.
Across the country the figure was far greater. Nationally the tip-offs increased by 58 per cent. Centrelink conducted 36,423 tip-off reviews resulting in 8,211 payment cancellations or reductions and debts of $16.1 million being raised. I know that every one of those dollars and every one of those figures and statistics underlie and point to one particular person or a family. In a lot of cases, this is a difficulty for those families involved. I know that the government has worked to try and alleviate some of those problems for some of those families. At the same time, the pressure will be maintained to continue to implement longstanding rules and regulations in regard to entitlements. The message must be clearly understood—and it is being more clearly understood. The application of the Criminal Code across this particular area to bring this department and the important work they do into line with other departments is a welcome reform. I commend this bill to the House. ",REPS,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,52,1
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2001-09-27,"—The Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 amends a number of statutes within the Family and Community Services portfolio. In fact, it amends so many laws within that portfolio area that it provides members with an opportunity to talk about welfare reform more generally. This opportunity has been taken by the two previous speakers, the member for Grayndler and the member for Moreton. I wish to add my thoughts on this important area of welfare reform. I wish to place two ideas on the agenda of the parliament. I wish to add to the debate about how we can alleviate poverty and disadvantage in our nation; and how we can produce a more equal, caring and just society.
This government has claimed to have embarked on welfare reform. I believe that it has done no such thing. The government has done nothing more substantial than fiddle around with the transfer payment system. It has adjusted at the margin the way in which material resources are paid to Australians on welfare, and it has done this in response to so-called expert committees.
I believe they have missed the all-important social dimension of poverty. Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, I know that, in your electorate in Tasmania and in your own personal work, this is something on which you have placed a great priority. It is a concern that I share. I believe we need to treat poverty as a social issue, not just as an economic question. That is why I am a great supporter of what I call human scale welfare. Human scale welfare, which gets the relationships right between people in their communities, is the first and essential foundation stone for alleviating poverty.
In the past, as a parliament, we have treated welfare as an economic issue. We have made payments to people to improve their material standard of living, but through this process we have lost sight of the social dimension of poverty. We need to face the reality that long periods of unemployment and economic disadvantage alter people's behaviour, especially when the problems pass from one generation to the next. I see this in my own electorate. The curse of intergenerational unemployment is very corrosive when it comes to the quality of our society, the bonds between people, the strength of our communities.
In particular, young people lose sight of the role models for a successful life. They lose sight of the difference between right and wrong; they lose sight of the social norms and values of community life. At the end of this corrosive process, the social problem, the breakdown in families and communities, is actually worse than the economic problem that commenced the process. So these problems start with the economic dimension—people falling out of the work force, people falling into material poverty—but then, after long periods of that experience, the social dimension, the social problems, are so vast that they are indeed greater than the economic issues themselves.
This is the curse of social poverty. I believe that social poverty is as big an issue in our nation as economic poverty. Social poverty is reflected in record rates of loneliness and isolation, a record number of Australians living by themselves, living without family and community support. It is also reflected in the escalation of street crime, youth gangs and enormous public concern about the fabric of our society. 
There are some depressing stories that we need to face up to. I have always believed that in welfare reform you need to take an evidence based approach. Understand the evidence: don't worry so much about dogma, ideology and textbook theories; look at the evidence and work out practical solutions to these social and economic problems. 
Intergenerational poverty is corrosive of self-esteem and ambition. Probably my saddest experience as a member of parliament was to talk to a school principal in a public housing estate in my electorate about the school's careers day. The principal told me stories of how some of the young people, when they are asked what they are going to do after they leave school, say, `We'll do what our dads and grand-dads have done before us—we'll go on the dole.' This is the way in which long-term poverty erodes social ambition, self-esteem and confidence. It erodes the sorts of values and norms that we in this place would take for granted.
I had another reminder of the extent of this problem. Just recently, I have been talking to Father Chris Riley's Youth Off the Streets program. On Monday I had the opportunity to look at their wonderful retreat school at Canyonleigh in the Southern Highlands. They undertake great work there for troubled adolescents—trying to bring young people back into the mainstream of society and to put their personal and drug related problems behind them. Recently, Youth Off the Streets had a segment on the A Current Affair program on TV. It was a wonderful example of how they help troubled adolescents. I am told that in the week that followed that TV program they had 300 calls from parents around Australia, saying, `Can you take my child off my hands? Can you do the same sort of thing for my child?' I think that is a terrible situation in our society—that parents are willing to say, `Take my child off me.' Their circumstances are so desperate, the problems are so severe, that they are looking, out of desperation, for any sort of help to overcome the difficulties within their own homes.
In the public housing estates in my electorate—areas with 40 per cent unemployment and welfare dependency rates of 80 per cent—people do not necessarily say they want more deregulation and market forces; they do not necessarily say they want more government spending or a bigger public sector. Their first priority is the social dimension. The social problems have become so important that people are saying, `Normalise our neighbourhood, rebuild our communities.'
The first priority is not necessarily what we hear in this parliament. We have a debate with one side talking about economic deregulation and the other side talking about the size of government. The public wants to talk about the size of society, the bonds between people and the good relationships of a strong and growing community. People in public housing estates in my electorate talk about the need to normalise the neighbourhood, to live in a normal community where people work together instead of against each other. We need to get the relationships right between people, to deliver welfare services on a human scale. Getting the human and social dimension right is the first step towards the alleviation of poverty. 
The great contradiction is that we have built the post-war welfare state around large, impersonal bureaucracies. These government bureaucracies are good at some things—they are good at dispensing entitlements to people—but they are not so good at other things. Large, impersonal bureaucracies do not have any capacity for building relationships of trust and confidence between people. We have built a public sector that is not necessarily good at the human scale of welfare reform.  
I think it is simply a matter of commonsense. Despite all the programs and all the money that is spent by this parliament in welfare services, the reality is that people are not likely to make best use of those services and entitlements without social capital, without the self-esteem and trust of a normal neighbourhood. Unless we are building stronger communities, it is very unlikely that people will make good use of the services that are provided by government.
In fact, in my electorate I cannot find any evidence of government bureaucracies solving poverty. I cannot find evidence of government bureaucracies addressing the social dimension of disadvantage. I cannot see ways in which the public sector is actually breaking the poverty cycle. Of course we need material support. People need income support from government to put food on the table and to keep a roof over their heads but, as a parliament, we need to recognise that that is not a sufficient form of support for breaking poverty. We need to recognise the need to address the social dimension of poverty.
I would like to suggest three ways in which this can be done. The first is to back the work of social entrepreneurs. These are special people who combine the best of social and business practice. They are very good at local community work, building stronger networks of community support and social cooperation, but they are also good at taking risks. They are not willing to sit back and think that government will do it all; they are not willing to sit back and underestimate the need for entrepreneurial flair and spirit; they are not willing to sit back and just complain or demand more government resources. They actually want to use their own initiative, take a risk and inject some entrepreneurial spirit and flair into these disadvantaged communities. That is why we call them `social entrepreneurs': they are good at social work, but they are also entrepreneurial in their outlook. They support social justice, but they think like business people. It is an example of boundary crossing by people who combine the best of the social and business sectors. 
One of them is Brian Murnane, a wonderful man in my electorate, who has undertaken superb work in the public housing estate of Claymore. When I first became the member for Werriwa in 1994, I wondered how we could ever get progress in Claymore. It was a tough suburb. It was a suburb that was regarded as one of the worst in New South Wales. There was one street, Proctor Way, that had 60 police incidents a month: that is two a day. We are talking about a really tough suburb with severe social problems. 
In 1995, there were some terrible fires in two of the town houses. Six people passed away in those fires. The New South Wales Department of Housing needed to face up to this tragic reality. They decided to move out of Claymore, and they looked to expressions of interest from someone who wanted to come in and provide the housing management and community support. The person who put his hand up was Brian Murnane from the Argyle Community Housing program, a division of the St Vincent de Paul Society. Brian Murnane took a very important first step: he moved into Proctor Way, Claymore. He moved his office into a town house next to where the two burnt-down town houses had been. So he was not going to be part of a remote, impersonal bureaucracy like the New South Wales department, locked away in some head office tens of kilometres away. He actually became a local; he became part of the community. 
I think this is a great lesson. We hear so much about government funded community work but the workers do not come from the community. It is a real paradox—almost an absurdity— that we talk about community workers but they do not actually come from the community itself. Brian Murnane overcame that problem by becoming a local. He then sent a notice around to invite people to come to a morning tea and talk about ways in which Claymore could be improved—dealing with the crime problem and dealing with the lack of community spirit and cooperation. Nobody turned up. He put out the notice for the morning tea and nobody turned up. But, as a social entrepreneur, he was not going to be deterred. He decided to rent a barbecue and start cooking sausages and onions in the middle of the street—almost taunting people to come out of their homes and talk to him about the things that could be done. 
This is social capital formed from the smell of sausages and onions in Proctor Way, Claymore. People who were not used to talking to each other and helping each other were peering out through their curtains. Kids were saying to their parents, `Mum, there's a madman in the street cooking sausages and onions,' but people did come out of their homes for the first time to talk to each other. They talked to Brian Murnane. He said to them, `What can we do here? What is your first priority for improving this area?' The people said, `We want to clean up this street and get rid of all the garbage and rubbish.' They organised a clean-up day and got a vast amount of rubbish out of Proctor Way. This was such a significant act: it was the first time that people worked together for a common community purpose.
From this steady commencement of the habit of helping each other, things began to grow. They formed a Neighbourhood Watch scheme. They formed a wonderful community garden where they grew fresh vegetables—good for the budget and good for the family diet. They established a low interest loan scheme, whereby people could purchase household items. It was a real community financing scheme. They established employment and training schemes. Brian Murnane now wants to take over the local half-derelict shopping centre as an opportunity for business cooperatives, for local training programs and for connecting local people to the real economy. He is wanting social venture capital to achieve this purpose.
Social entrepreneurship in Claymore has been a slow, methodical process. I have whizzed through the things that have happened but, over five or six years, this has been long, slow, methodical work—rebuilding the connections between people and overcoming the social dimension of poverty. Now the neighbourhood has been normalised. Claymore is a normal neighbourhood where people work together instead of against each other. Through this process of social and community building it is possible to set the foundations for economic success. People now have the habits of cooperation; they now have the confidence and self-esteem by which they can reconnect and re-enter the real economy. 
This is the process that we need to foster. As a parliament, we need to make social venture capital available to social entrepreneurs. One of the best developments in our country is the emergence of a Social Entrepreneurs Network. It is something that has been formed to bring social entrepreneurs together so that they can share experience and share their success across the nation. I am very supportive of that network. I am very supportive of new ways in which the parliament can fund its work. We need social venture capital to support these special people who get results in communities. We also need to refashion the role of government. Government needs to act as a junior partner to people like Brian Murnane—not the senior dominating partner, with bureaucrats walking into suburbs like Claymore, as they did for many years, thinking that they know best. Government needs to act as a junior partner to social entrepreneurs.
We also need to establish a national mentoring program. The biggest issue in my electorate is the trouble with boys—boys dropping out of school, boys getting on the streets, boys forming into gangs and boys engaging in negative behaviour in our community. Unfortunately, it is possible for boys to grow up in my electorate and go through life without male role models. We see this in the growth of single parent families; we see it in the absence of male teachers in our primary schools; and we see it in the loss of the apprenticeship scheme. Apprenticeships were not only about work force entry; they were actually about social mentoring, where boys could find out and learn what it meant to grow up and be a man in the work force. The loss of the apprenticeship scheme has added to this problem. 
We need to mobilise mentors from the business, sport and community sectors. Any successful Australian has a responsibility to put back in to our community. Just do not pull your success out of our society; put something back in by acting as a mentor to a boy who does not necessarily have the right guidance and role models in life. There is a great opportunity here to reconnect younger Australians with older Australians. We know that we are an ageing society. We need to mobilise the vast and growing army of retired Australians to act as mentors for adolescents who lack role models and moral guidance. We need a role for government to act as the bridge from older to younger Australians. We need a role for government to call on successful business, sporting and community people to act as mentors in our society.
The third step is service devolution. We cannot build a stronger community unless people have things to do in common. We often hear community demands for better services. My attitude is that people should not be campaigning for better services; they should be running them. People should not be calling on government for better services; they should be stepping up and running these services at a community level. When I talk about the public sector, I prefer to talk about community schools, health mutuals, social cooperatives and community banks. There is a public sector beyond the role of government that lies in the cooperation of people in local communities. It is not possible to create social capital unless people have things to do in common.
This is an argument over big or small-scale government. It is not the polarised debate that we often hear in this parliament, where one side supports small-scale government and the other side supports big government. I am talking about human scale welfare and human scale government that recognises our first challenge is the social dimension of poverty. In effect, we need to put the `social' back into `social justice'. We need to get the relationships right between people to tackle the social dimensions of disadvantage. With the fall of the Berlin Wall the world witnessed the end of state socialism. I prefer to talk about civic socialism: building a better society at a local level through the sorts of reforms that I have mentioned in this speech.
I had another idea I wanted to talk about but I think time will get away from me. It is asset based welfare reform to provide incentives for disadvantaged people to save and accumulate assets. It is one of the great paradoxes in the welfare debate. The reality is that poor people cannot leave poverty behind on a permanent basis unless they can save and accumulate assets, but all we ever get from the welfare system is income support for disadvantaged people. We never get access to asset accumulation. There was an example recently with the news that millionaires are cashing in on the first home ownership scheme. I think it is immoral for people buying $2 million homes to be receiving a government grant. It is an example of how we have made asset support and accumulation available to the middle class but we have not provided that same opportunity to the underclass, the low income people. There are many pilot schemes and great demonstration projects in the United States which demonstrate that poor people can save and accumulate assets if they receive the right incentives and support from government.
It is a great shame that in this nation we have not embarked on asset based welfare. As I mentioned at the beginning, all this government have done is fiddle at the margins of the transfer payment system. They have fiddled at the margins of material support for people, without doing two critical things. They have not addressed the social dimension of poverty and they have not made asset based programs available to the poorest Australians. The government have much to learn in the area of welfare reform. Hopefully we will see great improvements with a change of government at the next election. ",REPS,<title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,52,1
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2001-09-27,"—in reply—In speaking to the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 I would like to thank all the honourable members who have taken their time to contribute to this debate. I would like to just raise some of the issues that were commented on by the member for Grayndler with regards to amendments made by the bill. One of the issues concerned the treatment of intention.
Section 1061ZZBW was mentioned as an example. However, the comment did not reflect the full understanding of what the amendment seeks to achieve. The existing provision requires that the prosecution should show either knowledge or recklessness in relation to failing to comply with the notice. After the amendments, recklessness will not be sufficient grounds for prosecution under this section. After the amendment's intention there will be the requisite fault element in relation to the making of the statement. If anything this represents a tightening of the requirements for a successful prosecution.
The second issue raised by the honourable member related to the removal of certain defences from section 1061ZZBW. However, the amendments simply provide for the same defences to be inserted as discrete paragraphs of the offence provision. The defences are not removed. It has always been the case that a person seeking to rely on a defence has the onus of establishing that defence. These amendments do not alter that approach.
The member for Moreton highlighted the positive actions by this government to return the integrity to our social welfare system. He recognised that there was now a greater level of respect afforded to those that are actually in genuine need of welfare support.
 The member for Werriwa raised some very interesting views and serious concerns on the issue of social poverty and how it differs very much from economic poverty. He recognised the wonderful contribution and value to the community of people that he called the `social entrepreneurs'. He gave an excellent example from Claymore, a suburb in his electorate. He also raised another issue that I am particularly interested in: the need for a youth mentoring scheme. He quite rightly highlighted the desperate need within the community for young boys to have male role models. Because of the way in which our society is going, there is a need for adult males within the community to offer a contribution. I will be seeking to talk to the honourable member later on. We actually have a pilot program specifically on this—it is happening now—and I am fortunate to have had it in my electorate. It has been operating for over a year very successfully, and I will be giving him details so that he can further his interest in this matter. Hopefully it is something that we can eventually get up as a national scheme.
An important component of the bill is to provide clarity about the application of strict liability to some offence creating provisions. Under the Criminal Code, strict liability must be identified for an offence; otherwise the prosecution will be required to prove fault in relation to each element of the offence. The bill also ensures that the strict liability nature of some provisions is not lost in the transition to application of the Criminal Code's general purposes. If relevant offences are not adjusted in this manner, many may become more difficult for the prosecution to prove, thereby reducing the protection which is intended by the parliament to be provided.
This bill will similarly improve the efficient and fair prosecution of offences by clarifying physical elements of defences and amending inappropriate fault elements. This measure has the potential to save many hours of court time otherwise spent in complicated and sometimes inconsistent interpretations of offence creating provisions. The Criminal Code is a significant step in the reform of our system of justice. It is important that it be implemented in a way that is considered and that pays careful regard to the way the Commonwealth offence provisions are to work in practice. This bill is an important step in that progress.

"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2001-09-27,"—I move:
That the bill be now read a second time.
The purpose of the Industry, Science and Resources Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 is to amend certain offence provisions in legislation within the Industry, Science and Resources portfolio to reflect the application of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (the Criminal Code) to all criminal offences in Commonwealth laws.
The amendments are intended to ensure that when chapter 2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (the code) is applied from 15 December 2001 to all Commonwealth criminal offences, those provisions will continue to operate in the same manner as they operated previously. If legislation containing offence provisions were not amended to have regard to the code, the code, upon coming into operation, may alter the interpretation of existing offence provisions.
The Criminal Code is set out in schedule 2 to the Criminal Code Act 1995. It contains the general principles of criminal responsibility that will apply to all Commonwealth criminal offences when the Criminal Code Act comes into force, on and after 15 December 2001.
Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code codifies the general principles of criminal law and adopts the common law approach of subjective fault based principles. It adopts the traditional distinction of dividing offences into their physical elements (the actus reus) and fault elements (mens rea). The general rule is that for each physical element of an offence it is necessary to prove that the defendant had the relevant fault element. The prosecution must prove every physical and fault element of an offence. The physical elements are `conduct', `result of conduct' and `circumstances of conduct' and the fault elements specified in the Criminal Code are `intention', `knowledge', `recklessness' and `negligence'.
The `default fault elements', which the Criminal Code provides, will apply where a fault element is not specified and where the offence (or an element of the offence) is not specified to be a strict or absolute liability offence. The default fault elements set out in the Criminal Code are `intention for a physical element of conduct' and `recklessness for a physical element of circumstances or result'.
Fault elements will not be applied where an offence is specified to be one of strict liability. This bill specifies where an offence is one of strict liability. This is necessary to ensure that offences currently interpreted as strict liability continue to be interpreted as such after the Criminal Code is applied. In addition the bill amends certain offence provisions to remove the defence and restate it is a separate subsection. This is to ensure that the defences are not interpreted as an element of the offence.
The amendments fall into the following broad categories: 
·	specifying that an offence is one of strict liability (with an express statement on the face of the offence that is an offence of strict liability, referring to section 6.1 of the Criminal Code);
·	restructuring offence provisions which include an inappropriate fault element for conduct;
·	restructuring offence provisions which include an inappropriate fault element for circumstance;
·	restructuring offence provisions where part of the conduct element of the offence includes breach of a condition;
·	restructuring offence provisions to proscribe the actions of a person whose conduct causes damage, injury, destruction or obliteration of prescribed property;
·	restructuring criminal offence provisions containing a defence, by putting the defence provisions in separate subsections, in order to avoid a defence being mistakenly interpreted to be part of the elements of the offence;
·	specifying whether a defence places a legal or evidential burden on a defendant;
·	restructuring an offence to resolve an internal conflict between the offence and the complicity provision of the Criminal Code;
·	restructuring ancillary offence provisions so as to apply the relevant ancillary provisions of the Criminal Code;
·	extension of meaning of `engaging in conduct' to include omissions;
·	restructuring offence provisions so as not to require knowledge of law;
·	specifying in provisions which establish criminal responsibility for corporations whether or not part 2.5 of the Criminal Code (dealing with corporate criminal responsibility) is applicable.
This bill ensures that the current criminal offences will operate in the same manner as they currently operate, following the application of the Criminal Code.

"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,2001-09-27,"—The opposition is pleased to indicate its support for the general thrust of the legislation which the parliamentary secretary has so comprehensively explained this morning. It is of course consistent with the wide range of acts which the House has been considering in recent weeks covering the implementation of the Criminal Code from 1995 and the way in which that will apply to existing offences from December this year. Of course, it is, as the parliamentary secretary has said, necessary to bring up to date the various existing pieces of legislation within the Industry, Science and Resources portfolios to ensure that the appropriate legal standards are brought to bear from 15 December, when the changes take principal effect.
As with other similar items of legislation associated with these measures, the opposition have indicated support for this bill. We do so again this morning. In light of the fact that the parliamentary secretary has so adequately and comprehensively explained these diverse legal provisions, it would be unnecessary and inappropriate for me to take the time of the committee by further elaborating on and duplicating that explanation. I will simply indicate our general support for these measures and look forward to their speedy passage through the parliament.",REPS,"<title>INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND RESOURCES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,53,1
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2001-09-27,"—in reply—Summing up the second reading debate on the Industry, Science and Resources Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001, I would like to thank the member for Bonython for his excellent example of cooperation and his learned response. I certainly greatly appreciate his contribution and bipartisan support. The Industry, Science and Resources Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 advances the government's program to harmonise offence creating and relating provisions in Commonwealth legislation with the Criminal Code. This bill is similar to other Criminal Code harmonisation bills introduced by other ministers. The Criminal Code will codify the most serious offences against Commonwealth law and establish a cohesive set of general principles of conduct responsibility. 
The harmonisation with the Criminal Code by creating a related offence in Industry, Science and Resources portfolio legislation, while technical in nature, is an important step in the government's program of legislative reform, which will achieve greater consistency in the application of Commonwealth criminal law. I thank honourable members and senators for their support. It is great to see that we have had the opportunity of getting this legislation through without any difficulty. I know there are a lot of other bills that need to come through. The issues are quite complex—

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2001-09-27,"—It gives me great pleasure to be able to make a few remarks about the report Local voices: inquiry into regional radio. Radio is a very important information medium, particularly in regional and remote Australia. It is cheaper to produce and broadcast radio programs than television programs. A radio is also far cheaper and more portable than a TV set. There are far more radio licences than TV stations, and they are located in local communities, so they are in the best position to provide news and information about local communities to local communities. Local radio is, and should be, the `local voice', as it is the title of this report.
We have seen in the last few years that this is changing, however, and not necessarily for the better. New technology has been a double-edged sword for regional Australia. There has been an increased use of networked, prerecorded, automated and syndicated programming. In some instances, this has led to increased hours of operation by local stations, but it has also led to the loss of that local voice. As I said, it is a double-edged sword.
This has been a very extensive inquiry. We received some 290 submissions, heard from 169 witnesses and held 18 public hearings throughout regional Australia. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff of the committee who, as always, have done a marvellous job in keeping the inquiry on track. I would also like to thank the chairman and the deputy chairman of the committee. They provided a really good unity ticket, which I think was of great benefit to the committee. 
The report makes some 20 recommendations across a broad spectrum of issues, but I would like to concentrate my remarks on just a few of them. The first I would like to comment on is recommendation No. 7, which states:
The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts should prepare amendments to the Broadcasting Service Act 1992 to require all non-metropolitan commercial, community and narrowcast radio services to identify the originating source of programming when giving their call signs.
This recommendation is born out of these changes that I speak of, namely, increased networking and syndication of programs. People have a right to know that the program they are listening to is not local but a network program from a major centre or another station. One witness told the committee about how a program got the weather completely wrong. The weather was fine where the announcer was broadcasting from, but it was raining in the area where this witness was listening. Whilst we cannot stop networking programs—nor would we wish to—we do believe that they should be labelled correctly.
Recommendation 14 deals with emergency service announcements. This is a vital recommendation dealing with fundamental safety issues. If ever there was an absolute necessity for local radio to be precise, it is during storms, bushfires and floods or any other emergency situation. If a station is carrying a networking program from somewhere hundreds of miles away, local state emergency service personnel must have the ability to cut across the program to put out their alert and warn locals. Without this ability the safety of hundreds of lives could be compromised. Emergency service personnel need to know who to contact, and the staff of local broadcasting stations need to know which contacts are state emergency services. I am sure we would all agree that this is a necessary recommendation that the government should act upon as quickly as possible.
I would like to briefly comment about recommendation 6, which concerns training of community broadcasters. The recommendation calls for government expenditure in a dollar for dollar scenario to provide accredited training for community broadcasters. This is an important recommendation. There is a cap of $5,000 per station. That would be more than adequate to provide the type of training envisaged by the committee. It is important that it is accredited training. Long gone are the days that the words `I have been doing it for years' would suffice when it comes to trainers. Courses need to be accredited and run professionally. The qualifications gained from attending the courses must be transportable. Providing accredited training to regional and rural radio broadcasters will allow them to gain employment elsewhere in the industry should they so desire. Government initiatives are important in order to kick-start and sustain such a program.
The focus of this report is on local communities. Each community has a different character and radio is a great way to reflect and protect that character. While economics has determined an increase in the number of networking programs on regional radio, we must not allow this to dominate the local voice. More than ever in this shrinking world, where we can tap into so much information from around the globe, the local voice is very important. 
I will just comment on one of the very important issues that the committee addressed, the question of localism. In the report, reference is made in 3.1 to the fact that it became apparent early in the inquiry that one of the issues of most concern was the impact of changes in the broadcasting environment on the nature of local radio. Most of the discussion concerning this centred on the degree to which radio services in regional areas are providing a genuine local radio service. A challenge for the committee has been to define what it is that makes regional radio service local. I take issue with some of the submissions to the inquiry, particularly from the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters and also from the DMG group relating to their different definition of localism. The Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters said, in part: 
Localism ... should not be measured according to how much content is produced by a local announcer or how much is produced in a local radio station.
The DMG group also said:
Localism does not mean the live broadcasting of programs around the clock from a local studio. Localism is not the same as physical presence.
I disagree with those two statements. I do really believe that is what localism is about. It is about a local broadcaster actually broadcasting from a local studio. If you have an announcer in a local studio you can be assured that you are getting the correct weather broadcast. In the event of an emergency broadcast, you have an announcer who is familiar with the local landscape.
I would like to conclude by saying that local communities should not be forced to lose their voice because of local economic factors. The local voice is important, and radio is the best means of ensuring that it is heard. Local businesses should have the opportunity to advertise on local radio. Many small rural businesses could not afford to advertise on a network syndicated program, nor would their businesses benefit all that much by doing so. 
Local radio with local announcers helps to build local communities, and it should be supported by the government. A way to help this happen is to implement the recommendations of this report. I urge the minister to examine the recommendations contained in this report and to bear in mind the extremely exhaustive processes that the committee went through to arrive at its conclusions and recommendations. I commend the report to the committee. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Corcoran, Ann, MP",ALP,2001-09-27,"—I guess we are all expecting that this will be the last day of parliament, and I think this is a good opportunity for me to talk about and reflect on the things that I have learnt in my first 12 months as member for Isaacs. In doing so, I think that what is happening in Isaacs is actually typical of what is happening around Australia, that this government has let down the people of Isaacs very badly. 
First of all, it introduced the GST—the never ever GST, the GST that would leave no-one worse off, the GST that would cut red tape for small businesses. Having done that, it then ignored our health needs. It ignored our right to a decent education; it ignored our right to decent care for our elderly people. As I move around Isaacs, I hear over and over again about how the GST is hurting people. People tell me that their household expenses have gone up way beyond any compensation that they received 12 months ago. Pensioners tell me how they feel insulted by the nonexistent $1,000 that they were supposed to get. That was last year; this year some of them have received $300, but it is only an insult.
Families tell me they are facing increased bills and they are not amused that they fork out every single day for this new GST. In Isaacs, some businesses have closed up shop because of the GST. Others are worried that they will soon have to close because of the financial effects of GST and the load of paperwork it has brought with it. The small businesses in Isaacs are not alone. Australia now has a massive number of small businesses going bankrupt, far more than before the GST was introduced. Forecasts suggest that this trend will continue. It is no consolation to these small operators that the big businesses are also experiencing these problems.  
People in Isaacs are also worried about getting good care if they need to go into hospital or if they need to find aged care accommodation for their parents. There is a big shortage of aged care beds in Isaacs, and it is not getting any better. This shortage impacts on people in acute hospitals. Aged people in need of aged care often end up in an acute hospital while they wait for a bed. That forces queues for elective surgery. But it gets worse: a number of people who work in aged care facilities have contacted me over the last 12 months to say how difficult it is for them to work in an industry that forces them to deliver unprofessional care and in which they are forced to watch residents suffering as a result. This problem stems from underfunding. The lack of funding puts pressure on nursing homes to cut costs, which means cutting the wages bill. The lack of staff means that the staff who are left are forced to rush from resident to resident, delivering the basics but not able to stop and deliver the human touch. If the evidence I hear is not enough, it was backed up this week by a leaked report from the Department of Health and Aged Care that showed that an additional $300 million a year is needed to ensure proper care for our frail elderly. 
The other thing I keep hearing about is education. One of two things happens at this point: parents and teachers at government schools talk about lack of funds for their students and children; those associated with category 1 schools start the conversation a different way but it becomes very interesting. People with children in one of the category 1 schools in Isaacs talked to me about why they chose an independent school for their child. They said that when they went shopping for a good school for their child they came to the conclusion that the independent school had better physical facilities and a wider range of experiences to offer than did their local government school. These parents, understandably, chose the school that would offer their child the best they could afford. That is interesting—if some children are able to go to a school with better facilities why can't all children? Why shouldn't every child have access to excellent education facilities and experiences, regardless of their parents' financial circumstances? It is very clear to me that, as a community, we cannot increase taxpayers' support for the schools which are already relatively better off before we ensure that all students have access to decent and excellent education facilities. It is clear to me that the people in Isaacs are concerned about the basics of life: a good education for their children, a reliable health system and financial security, which means jobs and an equitable tax system.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Isaacs Electorate</title>,Adjournment,56,1
