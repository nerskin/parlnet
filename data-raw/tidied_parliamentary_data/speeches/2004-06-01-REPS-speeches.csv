"Mr ABBOTT,MP",LP,2004-06-01,"—Mr Speaker, I wish to add to an answer.
—The minister may proceed.
—Yesterday I answered a question about pneumococcal. The Leader of the Opposition has been claiming that 50 babies die of pneumococcal every year—a claim repeated in a letter which arrives today in thousands of households around Australia. This claim is a lie. Figures from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System show that there were five children under five who died of pneumococcal in 2001, nine in 2002 and 10 in 2003—nothing like the 50. I table the letter. ",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Health: Pneumococcal Vaccine</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1

"Howard, John, MP",LP,2004-06-01,"—by leave—I am pleased today to table the report of the Consultative Group on Constitutional Change entitled Resolving deadlocks: the public response. 
Following the release of the government's discussion paper on the deadlocks mechanism in October last year, I announced the formation of a consultative group chaired by the Hon. Neil Brown QC, a former minister in the Fraser government, and also including the Hon. Professor Michael Lavarch, a former Attorney-General in the Keating government, and Professor Jack Richardson, a former Commonwealth Ombudsman.
The consultative group conducted a national public consultation process focused on the two proposals canvassed in the discussion paper: 
	the first of which would allow the Governor-General to convene a joint sitting of both houses when a bill has been twice rejected by the Senate;
	the second of which would allow a joint sitting after an ordinary general election, to consider a bill rejected twice before the election and then once again after the election. 
These proposals did not represent an attack on the Senate. 
They were not an attempt to extend the power of the executive or an attack on minor parties.
Since Federation, the way to resolve deadlocks has been through the existing section 57:
	only six double dissolutions have occurred since Federation;
	of these, on only one occasion, namely in 1974, was a joint sitting called to consider deadlocked legislation.  
It is my view, and that of many, that the requirements of section 57 impede good government today. 
The Senate plays a very important role as a house of review; however, the government is formed in the House of Representatives. 
An elected government, regardless of its political persuasion, should be able to implement the policies on which it was elected in the interests of all Australians.
The introduction of proportional representation in the Senate, combined with the move in 1983 to six senators being elected from each state at a half Senate election rather than five, has made it almost impossible for any government to obtain a majority in the Senate in its own right. 
A party now needs 57.16 per cent of the vote in a state at a half Senate election to win a majority of seats in that state. By way of interpolation, I point out that the highest recorded two party preferred vote in any state in the House of Representatives since Federation was in Queensland in 1996. Yet on that occasion, despite that overwhelming expression of support for the coalition, it failed to win 57.16 per cent of the two party preferred vote in the Senate.
This means that opposition and minor parties have the power to persistently veto important government policies. 
One example of this obstruction is on the government's proposals to change the unfair dismissal laws. 
This is important government legislation. It has been opposed by the Labor Party on 40 occasions—that is, in both houses of parliament, despite being a key element of government policy endorsed by the electorate at the last two federal elections. 
The government does not consider that it is in the national interest that the Senate should be capable of persistent obstruction of such important measures. 
In recent experience, it can be difficult to engage public interest in matters of constitutional reform, but the consultative group heard from people at public meetings in every capital city and looked at the 293 submissions received by my department from interested members of the public late last year. 
I understand that the discussion at the public meetings, attended by only around 240 people in total, was robust and the issues wide ranging. 
While the views expressed at the meetings were not necessarily reflective of the views of the broader electorate, the process was still worthwhile.
I am disappointed that, while the then Leader of the Opposition welcomed the release of a discussion paper and said that Labor welcomed constitutional reform, there was no submission in response to the discussion paper from the Australian Labor Party—none whatsoever. 
Nevertheless—and this is important—some state and territory governments did lodge formal submissions in which they supported constitutional reform of various types. 
I also welcome in particular the public comments of the New South Wales Premier, Mr Carr, and the Queensland Premier, Mr Beattie, who have supported the right of a lower house to prevail over an upper house, although it should be interpolated that in the case of Queensland they have devised a unique way of ensuring that that prevalence occurs.
The consultative group also had the benefit of reviewing submissions from the Democrats, the Greens, One Nation and Senator Brian Harradine.  
Each of these submissions provided valuable insight to the consultative group and the government. 
In its report, the consultative group has made a number of observations about public attitudes in relation to legislative deadlocks. 
I have previously stated that the government would consider holding a referendum in conjunction with the next federal election if the period of public consultation revealed a reasonable prospect of community support for a change. 
History shows, and our own experience testifies, that constitutional change is difficult in Australia, with only eight out of 44 referenda being passed since Federation, so I have always emphasised the importance of bipartisan support.
The consultative group concluded that there is not `any substantial measure of support for either of the two options presented in the discussion paper'.
As a result, the government is not proposing a referendum on this issue at the next election. However, the consultative group also concluded that `the discussion paper and the consultation processes have provided a starting point for engaging the wider community on constitutional questions' and recommended `a wider programme of consultation with the community, and more attention given to educating the public about the Australian Constitution and how it operates in practice'.
So that is what I propose. 
In the past, the government has supported programs of education on constitutional issues. 
In the lead-up to the Centenary of Federation in 2001, the Constitutional Centenary Foundation was funded to encourage and promote public discussion, understanding and review of the Australian constitutional system. 
Further, through the Discovering Democracy program the government has made a significant investment in resources for schools to teach children about the Constitution and our system of government. 
This public consultation process on section 57 has itself made an important contribution to public debate regarding constitutional issues.
In light of the consultative group's comments about a continuing program of education and consultation, I have had an initial discussion with the Leader of the Opposition about how this matter might be moved forward. 
He indicated that the opposition would not favour constitutional reform in this area unless the Senate's power to block supply was reduced or substantially circumscribed or removed altogether. This is not the government's position.
The government will approach future discussion on this issue from the starting point of a disposition to support option 2, which would allow a joint sitting after an ordinary general election, to consider a bill rejected twice before the election and then once again after the election. This is a sensible response to the problems addressed by the consultative group.
In closing, I wish to thank the members of the group for their work on this critical issue of constitutional reform. 
Each of them brought to the role a great deal of experience in constitutional law and knowledge of the workings of government. 
They have each contributed a great deal of time, energy and commitment to the task of consulting on these issues. 
I am personally grateful for the work that they have done and for the advice they have provided to me and the government on these important matters.  
I commend the consultative group's report to the House and to all Australians. I not only table the report but a copy of my statement. I apologise in advance to the House because by reason of time and my other commitments I will not be able to extend the normal courtesy to the Leader of the Opposition of being present to hear his reply, which I seek to do. I will read it with interest. I present the following statement:
Resolving Deadlocks: The Public Response—Ministerial Statement, 1 June 2004.

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2004-06-01,"—The Prime Minister's statement to the House today is a disappointing end to a disappointing process. His efforts to promote Senate reform did not meet so much with opposition around the country but rather with silence or, as the report puts it, `widespread indifference'. Eight forums were held around the country. All up, fewer than 250 people attended Australia wide. I thank them for their participation but wish that many more Australians had attended and participated.
The reason for this indifference was quite simple. The Prime Minister did not ask the people what constitutional improvements they wanted; he told them—virtually demanded—the changes that he was seeking. He failed to heed the lesson of the republic referendum: that the Australian people themselves must control the process. This was not a genuine bottom-up reform process. It was an attempt by the Prime Minister to claim that he has been the victim of Senate obstruction. It was an excuse for having no third-term agenda. It was a political exercise rather than an exercise in public policy and change.
If this process has served a purpose, it is to prove that real constitutional reform in Australia has to come from the people themselves, not from politicians and their advisers. This is the true republican ideal: a broad and rich democracy in which the people themselves participate in the reform process. I believe strongly that real constitutional change lies in giving power away and empowering the Australian people. If the Prime Minister wants to know what the Australian people really think about the changes that need to be made here in Canberra and the changes that need to be made to our Constitution, he does not need a process like the one he has just spoken about. He should be holding community forums, engaging with the people face to face at old town hall style meetings around the nation.
Labor believe strongly in constitutional reform. We are the only party—and this is proven in Australian political history—that consistently argue for the modernisation and further democratisation of our Constitution. The Prime Minister has claimed that Labor made no formal submission to the consultative group, but he failed to mention that we tabled a comprehensive discussion paper in this parliament on resolving deadlocks. As parliamentarians we make our contribution in this place first and foremost. Our views are well known, and I thank the members for Hotham and Barton for their preparation and presentation of Labor's comprehensive discussion paper on constitutional change. 
I believe that no reform of the Senate will succeed unless it balances the Senate's powers with greater democratic accountability for the parliament and the executive as a whole. For this reason, Labor offered to consider the second model that was included in the original discussion paper—the one the Prime Minister refers to as the Lavarch model. This model allows bills that have been blocked by the Senate twice to be put to a joint sitting after a normal election for the House and half the Senate and after the bills have been blocked yet again. Labor support this general principle, but we cannot support any move that takes away the democratic control of the Australian people themselves. The Australian people should have the ultimate say over contentious legislation through their vote for all members of both houses.
Labor would be prepared to consult on and consider the Prime Minister's second model, but only if it is accompanied by three other important reforms. The first is removing the power of the Senate to block supply. How can anyone say they are concerned about Senate power if they are not prepared to address the ultimate power of the Senate, its greatest power of obstruction: the Senate's power to block a budget and to bring down a democratically elected government, a government with a mandate in the House of Representatives? The second reform is introducing fixed four-year terms or some variation—for example, that which used to apply in the Victorian state parliament where terms are four years but an election cannot be held within three years unless the government loses its majority in the lower house. The third reform is maximum four-year terms for the Senate. The Australian people will never agree to eight-year terms for the Senate. It is simply too long a period for accountability or political mandates to have any meaning. In this system every election in effect becomes a double dissolution election, giving ultimate say over blocked legislation to the Australian people. This is the most democratic way of deciding what happens when the two houses are deadlocked.
These are issues for the future, for a time when this parliament has regained the trust and re-earned the respect of the Australian people. It will be a long and difficult process. I am disappointed that, while the Prime Minister mentioned in his speech the need for more civics education, he has brought forward no new initiative or new proposal in this particular area.
But it is not just about education campaigns. I want the Australian people to be more thoroughly involved in driving future constitutional reform, including the biggest change of all: how we become an Australian republic with our own head of state—an Australian president who is one of us. Labor's attempt and our approach to constitutional reform will be different to this failed attempt from the Howard government. Our guiding principle will be involving the Australian people themselves, not committees of politicians and so-called eminent persons or even conventions sitting down in Old Parliament House for a week or so—involving the Australian people first and foremost. They must be the ones who determine how we are governed.
Constitutional reform is still possible in Australia, but it must be determined by the people. It must come from giving power away, from handing the process over to all Australians. If in doubt, I say, `Let's have more direct votes, more plebiscites, more democracy.' That is what a Labor government will do after the next federal election to help to establish an Australian republic.
Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned. ",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Resolving Deadlocks: The Public Response</title>,Ministerial Statements,6,1
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2004-06-01,"—Today in parliament we had an extraordinary admission from the Minister for Education, Science and Training that he cannot get his sums right from one week to the next. He made the extraordinary claim that, because fewer students were affected than he previously thought, the amount of HECS debt that students were going to have to pay had gone up. Can you figure that out? I cannot figure it out. There is no way I can understand a word he had to say. 
—Rain Man got the figures wrong.
—Funnily enough, he did get the figures wrong. He got them very wrong—just from last week to this week. We know the education minister has a shocking habit of fiddling the facts, but I have to say that this latest effort was really quite extraordinary. Last week, the minister tabled a document containing a lot of new figures that supposedly showed how much this government intended to gouge out of students and their families. According to the minister's figures, students and their families would be paying what I thought was a pretty big number; they would be paying $377 million extra because of this government's fee hikes. The minister nods his head. That was the figure last week. Already 18 universities around Australia have said that they intend to increase their HECS fees, so we know that students from next year are going to be taking on massive amounts of additional debt—if the Howard government is re-elected. Let us just put it in round figures for people who are listening. If this minister is still the minister for education, next year a student will have to pay $20,000 for a basic three-year science degree.
The minister's figures from last week outline what students will pay as a result of these fee hikes—fee hikes that are of course a direct result of this minister's decision to allow universities to put their fees up. The tabled document goes through each of the universities in different states. He said that students in New South Wales would be paying an extra $90 million, and students in Queensland would be paying over $100 million more. But these were the figures we had last week. The minister actually tabled these figures in the parliament just six days ago.
If you thought the minister's figures from last week were bad—that $377 million extra would be taken out of the pockets of students and their families—we have a completely different figure today, six days later, of $662 million. Imagine if the minister stayed on as education minister for too much longer! Goodness knows how much extra this government would be forcing students to pay for the degrees they get to continue their education.
The government knows that families are not very impressed with these massive increases in HECS fees that are going to leave students with these very high levels of debt. In an attempt to cover this up, the government tried to launch yet another meaningless attack on Labor policy. But this minister, as we know, never lets the facts get in the way of a good story. He knows—and I am very pleased that he kept telling the parliament this today—that Labor has a terrific higher education policy, called Aim Higher, which is worth $2.34 billion. The Howard government's package has additional public spending of $1.7 billion, so that means Labor would actually invest over $600 million more into our universities than the Howard government. To hide this very basic truth, the minister made yet another crude attempt to compare apples with oranges, if you do not mind me using that phrase today. Somebody needs to explain to the minister that comparing four years of HECS hikes under this government with three years of increased public investment under Labor does not work.  
Nor does it wash when the minister tries to muddy up a few other individual line items, as he attempted to do last week. I must say that nobody in the media took his claims seriously, because they were patently untrue. As everyone on this side of the parliament would be very well aware, Labor are actually opposed to real interest rates on student loans. There is only one political party in this country that actually wants to charge real interest rates on student loans, and that of course is the political party that the minister is in, the Liberal Party. Labor are opposed to charging real interest rates on student loans, and we know that it will cost $15 million to oppose that. So we have a line in our policy which says that it will cost $15 million. The minister tried to pretend that this single line item in Labor's costings somehow represented our HECS compensation fund. 
This was another thing that, frankly, he just dreamt up. He must have dreamt it up at the same time he dreamt up the figures that said that student fees would go up by only $377 million, when this week surprisingly he has said they will go up by over $600 million. How much do you think it will be next week? Who knows how much it will be next week but one thing is for sure: nobody will believe anything this minister says. He uses one figure one week and another figure another week. If the minister wants to find out what Labor is going to spend on universities, he knows exactly where to go: all he has to do is read Labor's policy. He knows that the real story is all there. It demonstrates that Labor will put an additional $2.34 billion into our universities —which is considerably more public funding than this government is prepared to contribute.
It is no surprise to us that this minister has got his figures so wrong, but I must say this is quite a Herculean effort: $377 million to $600-odd million in six days—quite an extraordinary price hike. These figures have only come to light because we saw in the Courier-Mail today the figures for Queensland. The Queensland figures have gone up from $100 million last week to $180 million this week—an 80 per cent increase in six days. It is not a bad effort, even for this government. We know this government has virtually doubled average HECS repayments for students since it has been in office, but boy! An 80 per cent increase in six days really takes some beating. Queenslanders know that they will be paying another 80 per cent more because of the minister's revelations. But I was glad to see that he did come clean in question time today and admit that his number had gone from $377 million last week to $662 million this week.
—Oops!
—Oops is right. This minister is known as the numbers man. We have all called him various complimentary names.
—Rain Man!
—Rain Man, the human abacus—
—The man who makes it up as he goes along.
—That is right. We have seen it so many times. The minister just loves to let fly with beautiful sets of numbers. What we have seen is this beautiful set of numbers from last week—$377 million—magically turn into $660 million. Who knows whether today's numbers are right? I would not have a clue. But I doubt the minister would know, because we have seen this so many times from him. I have here quite a collection of them that I thought I might share with the House— 
An opposition member—Have we got time?
—I doubt I will get through them all in the time but I thought I would share a few of them. Tabling them probably would not be a good idea. Most of them are on the minister's letterhead. We have seen his extraordinary efforts when it comes to showing the increase in HECS debts that students will pay, but another one that he loves to tell is how many additional HECS places this government intends to introduce. In a press release of his on 18 February this year, he said that there would be an additional 34,000 HECS places. It says that in his press release: 34,000 additional HECS places. But what he did not say—and he has not said it on many other occasions—is that that of course includes 25,000 places that are currently underfunded by this government.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Brisbane!
—Funnily enough, it just seems to have been the case that this includes 25,000 places that are already there in universities. That is one example. Another beauty was in question time on 19 February 2004. In answer to a question that I asked him—and get this one; you finance types will like this—he said:
The Australian taxpayer is about to invest an extra $11 billion in the next 10 years in Australian higher education ...
—Correct.
—He just said `correct'; he just repeated it. Of course, it is not the Australian taxpayer. It is the Australian taxpayer plus the additional that students are going to pay. The one that was really priceless—
—Not in the forward estimates, Brendan!
—The member for Brisbane!
—It was certainly not in the forward estimates because it is students who are going to be paying a big increase—students who, according to today's figures, are now paying an additional $662 million. I love this one. This is a transcript from the minister from 24 July last year. Members might remember this beauty. We were introduced to a new term by the minister. When he gets his numbers wrong, it becomes a `misspeak'. Maybe today's figures are just a misspeak. Goodness knows what today's $662 million is going to be a misspeak of! We can only imagine.
Here is another one. We know that 18 universities now have decided to put their fees up. Last year in the middle of the debate over the higher education changes, once again in the parliament—this is on 16 September 2003—the minister said:
What that means in real terms is that the HECS charge for most courses in most universities will not change at all.
That is what he said last year when he was trying to get the legislation through the parliament. Of course, that has also been shown to be totally untrue. When we had universities starting to put their fees up, the university that had the misfortune to be the first to decide its fees was QUT. How did the minister respond to this? He did not get up and say, `It is because of legislation that I introduced and that I championed that we now have universities increasing their fees by 25 per cent.'
Opposition members interjecting—
—He did not force them—well, he sort of did force them into it because he cut their grants by $5 billion. So he sort of did force them into it. This minister said:  
... I think this is the most facile ridiculous and nonsensical argument that I have heard come from anywhere—
—We speak well of you, too, Brendan!
—The member for Brisbane is warned!
—That is exactly right. It is just extraordinary. He went on to say that it is bordering on the outrageous to suggest that any university would simply increase HECS charges just because it wants to be seen as a prestige institution. All our universities want to be seen as prestige institutions. Of course, each and every one of them has been forced into the fee hike that they are presenting to students and their families. There is only one way they will not have to pay, and that is to vote Labor at the next election.

"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,2004-06-01,"—Over the next 15 minutes I will confine myself to the facts and the substantive issues in relation to higher education. We face a future in Australia of collapsing age dependency ratios. We are not alone in that regard. In terms of funding essential social infrastructure for our country, whether it is education, health, transport or anything else, we really have four choices. Firstly, we can live in a country that sustains very high rates of economic growth for a long period of time. At the moment we are growing at around four per cent per annum. We are about twice the OECD average and we are higher than the G7, obviously. Secondly, our country could choose if it wished—and this government has no intention of doing this—to increase taxes, which would have an adverse impact on wealth creation and would make us less internationally competitive. Thirdly, governments can choose—and indeed the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made this observation herself on 11 September 2002—to cut money out of other things and, in this case, for argument's sake, put it into universities. The fourth choice that we have before us is to ask those people who do derive a benefit from the things they receive to make an appropriate contribution to that which they receive.
The only things that are going to count increasingly in universities are the international benchmarks against which higher education is being compared. The University of New South Wales, the Australian National University and the University of Sydney are competing with one another, but increasingly they are competing with the rest of the world. The employability in other countries of the next generation of children who will graduate from Australian universities will be determined entirely by the reputation enjoyed by the university that conferred that degree.
For that reason the government has embarked on a now implemented significant reform of Australian higher education. It is intended, firstly, to get a lot more money into universities over the longer term and, secondly, to change the way in which we regulate and administer Australian higher education. Over the next four years there will be $1.8 billion of public funding—fully budgeted additional funding—invested in Australian universities by this government. In addition to that, for the very first time in Australia, instead of having the government politburo centrally set the HECS charge for students, the universities themselves will be setting the HECS charge, as they are doing now, from zero to a level no more than 25 per cent above what it currently is. As part of those policies there will be 35,000 additional places funded in universities over the next four years. The 25,000 marginally funded over-enrolled places are in fact in the process of disappearing. Now, at a cost of some $547 million to the public purse, those 25,000 places will be fully funded. In other words, they are not disappearing at all. In addition to that, there will be another 10,000 places funded over the next four to five years. 
The changes in setting HECS mean that the universities face $1.8 billion over the first four years and $2.5 billion over the first five years of additional public investment under this government's policies. In addition to that, if they choose to increase HECS, all of the additional HECS that is charged will go directly to the university to support the education of students. Students do not pay back HECS until they have graduated and until they are earning, from this year, more than $35,000 a year. If they never work or if they go out of the work force they do not pay it back. It is an interest-free loan. The average Australian taxpayer will continue to pay for almost three-quarters of the cost of university education. The students will pay it back not as students, unless they choose to, but as extra tax taken out of their pay when they are working.
The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that the average HECS debt that will be faced by students graduating with a science degree will be $20,000 for a four-year degree. I point out to the House that $20,000 for a four-year science degree, if HECS has been increased by a maximum 25 per cent, represents an additional $4,000 to be paid back through the tax system over a lifetime. I can say as a medical graduate that, under these changes, the maximum possible HECS that a student would pay back through the tax system if they did a six-year medical degree would be $48,000. The taxpayer will have paid $150,000 up front, and that medical graduate will face lifetime earnings of somewhere between $5 million and $7½ million. There are many Australians, many who are represented on this side of the House and many who are represented on that side, who would say, `I wish I had those problems.'
It does not matter how much of a personal attack or derision or vilification there is of me as the minister. I made an undertaking in my public life not to return that kind of thing and to always focus on policy. The key part of this debate is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is seeking to conceal a major funding error in the Labor Party's policy. The Labor Party has said—and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has repeated it today—that its policy is costed at $2.34 billion over the first four years. It is interesting to see that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has also said on at least two occasions that those universities that have chosen to increase HECS—in other words, those that will get extra money because of increases in HECS—will be fully compensated. If there were a change of government, the Labor Party would repeal the increases in HECS of up to 25 per cent and the money the universities would lose would in fact be fully compensated to them. In other words, the universities, and therein the education of students, would not in any way be disadvantaged.
When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition went on Meet the Press on 18 April this year, she said:
Well, we've in fact put our entire higher education policy out last July. It's $2.34 billion over the next four years ... And of course we'll wind back the 25% price hike.
Then Brian Toohey, who has been around the block a few times, asked:
But is that additional money on top of compensating universities for the 25% price hike?
The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said:
It includes—
that is, the policy—
the 25% price hike compensation that's part of it.
An article in today's Queensland Courier-Mail states: 
Ms Macklin said universities would be fully compensated for losing the HECs rises through indexation and through Labor's $450 million “University of the 21st Century” fund.
Let us get this absolutely right. Today there is $662 million represented in the 18 universities that have chosen to increase HECS from five to 25 per cent above what it is currently. By the way, the reason that the figure I presented last week was $377 million is that I had asked my department to do a preliminary analysis of how much extra revenue those 18 universities that have chosen to increase HECS—eight have chosen not to increase HECS at all and 13 are yet to decide—would make. Their preliminary analysis, based on students going in next year, is $377 million over four years. What my department have subsequently done is take into account the additional 35,000 students that will be in the system. They have also taken into account the students grandfathered under the current arrangements who will obviously be washed out of the university sector over the next four years. That means that, rather than the Labor Party having to compensate those 18 universities—and perhaps more of the 13 yet to decide—for $377 million, it would need to find $662 million to fully compensate those universities, to make sure that they are in no way disadvantaged by a change of government and a change of policy.
Page 25 of the Labor Party's policy document on costings says `oppose HECS increases; real interest rate on loans'. They have budgeted $15 million, but we are looking for $662 million. The real interest rate on loans is budgeted at $4.5 million—if you had a real interest rate. In fact, there is a less than two per cent real interest rate for fee-paying loans for students who choose to pay their own way in private or public universities, but the Labor Party have also said that they intend to abolish that loan scheme altogether. So why do they need $4.5 million—or even $15 million, if you accept the Labor Party's costings? But that is another point.
If you go further down the Labor Party's costings, we are looking for $662 million. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says today in the Courier-Mail that universities would be fully compensated for losing HECS rises through two measures in its policy. The first is indexation and the second is the $450 million Universities of the 21st Century fund. The Universities of the 21st Century fund has $450 million and the quality enhancement fund, which is indexation, has $312 million. In other words, if the Labor Party is to honour what it has said it will do, it needs to find $662 million today—and that could well be a higher figure next week if one or two universities choose over the next week to increase HECS. It has to find $662 million. If you take out the $450 million and if you take out the $312 million, that means that the Labor Party now has a policy of net value to the university sector of $1.67 million.
But the Australian National University, the University of Tasmania, Charles Sturt University or Southern Cross University, which have chosen not to increase HECS, will be asking why it is that they are subsidising other universities, because under Labor's plan they will not get any compensation as they have not increased HECS. If I were Professor Ian Goulter, running Charles Sturt University, I would be saying to myself, `Why is Professor Gavin Brown at Sydney University going to get $69 million in additional money from Labor in government when at Charles Sturt University I am not going to get anything because I have decided not to increase HECS at all?' The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition, who is not really across the detail of this in any case, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in particular, have been exposed in seeking to mislead two groups in this country. The first is the universities, misleading them into believing that they will be compensated for the HECS increases they will lose under a Labor government and that that money is in fact costed and in the policy. It is not in the policy at all. The second is the Australian taxpayers, misleading them into believing that they will not have to find another $662 million and write another cheque for the university sector because the Labor Party has not adequately funded its policy. 
Under this government, universities would receive $1.8 billion in public funding over the next four years in addition to the $662 million in additional HECS—that is, $2.46 billion. But, under a Labor government, the Labor Party would be delivering $1.67 billion in core funding—assuming it is honest in saying it will compensate these universities. In addition to that, the Department of Finance and Administration, the Minister for Finance and Administration and my department have already found, firstly, a $160 million hole in Labor's costings, on the basis of a double tax agreement for foreign workers which no longer exists; and, secondly, a $218 million deficit in funding any reductions for 14 per cent of students in the sector for HECS contributions for science and maths. That brings the sum down to $1.3 billion. That means that, under this government's policies, universities will receive in the next four years alone at least $1 billion more than they would have under the policies of the Australian Labor Party—unless the Leader of the Opposition gets into government and then announces that he is going to pull another $1 billion out of the taxpayers' chequebook.
The thing that ought to be remembered and never forgotten is that every last dollar of HECS that the graduates pay in reimbursing their 25 per cent goes to the university to benefit the education of students, and the taxpayer pays for about three-quarters of it. University graduates earn on average $622,000 more than those who have not been to university. They have a rate of 92 per cent employment within four months of graduation. Their lifetime rate of unemployment is one-quarter that of a person who has not been to university. The average HECS debt currently carried is $8,500, and 90 per cent owe less than $18,000. What we are talking about here on average, if there is an increase of a maximum 25 per cent, is $4,000 paid back over a lifetime through the tax system. When I hear the Labor Party expressing concern about 300 per cent increases in compulsory up-front TAFE fees in New South Wales, compliments of the Labor cousins in the state government in New South Wales, or about 25 per cent increases in TAFE fees in Victoria, then I might take them seriously.

"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,2004-06-01,"—That was a particularly subdued performance by the minister, I might say, in stark contrast to some of the other performances we have seen from him in this chamber. I was thinking back to that memorable occasion when he embarked on a tirade, saying that all people should hop on the bus. The only bus the minister was worried about was the bus he thought would take him to the Lodge, or at least to the deputy leader's spot. The wheels certainly fell off that bus long ago. It also made me think that the next time I come here I am going to have to change the watch I wear. In Brisbane I have a watch which I take with me when I go to the beach. It tells me the tide times on the Sunshine Coast, but it also tells me the phases of the moon. I thought that, if I had that watch with me and I knew when the full moon was out, I would be able to predict the swings and gyrations of the minister when we next have him here in the chamber, taking a dorothy dix question or debating an MPI like this. 
This is a very serious issue. It is a serious issue not just for the hundreds of thousands of students who are affected by it now but for the future direction of our education system and the wealth of our nation into the future. The people we invest in through our education and training system are the investment we have in our future as a nation. We should never forget that when we have these debates and we should not, as this government is trying to, force the burden increasingly onto students and their families, invariably resulting in a system where the wealthiest are best placed to take advantage of the opportunities.
There are a few simple facts that this government cannot escape, and they are not like the rubbery figures the minister has been indulging in over the last couple of days. Student debt has more than doubled under the Howard government. It has now blown out to more than $10 billion. That is, $10 billion that ordinary Australians—most of them young people trying to get on and establish themselves with a family and a career—now owe this government. That is a massive increase in such a short period. Families are being forced to pay an increasing amount of the costs of universities. Student fee charges now make up nearly 40 per cent of university income—when Labor left office in 1996 it was 25 per cent—a figure that has dramatically shifted as this government has placed the burden on ordinary people.
If we look at how we are performing against the rest of the world, as we should and as we are urged to, we then find a fairly depressing picture. The OECD report Education at a glance 2003 shows just how badly Australia is performing when it comes to investing in our tertiary education system. Not only is Australia's public investment in our universities poor by international standards, it is actually going backwards—it is falling while other countries are in fact investing more. We stand out at the international table as one of the few countries investing less now than we did in 1995. That is not just a problem for those wishing to go to university now; we will pay for that in the decades to come.
Between 1995 and 2000 Australia's public investment in our universities declined by about 11 per cent—more than any other country in the OECD; and, I might say, the OECD had an average growth of 21 per cent. That same report shows that, if you look at the investment in tertiary education, public and private combined in Australia is just 1.6 per cent of our gross domestic product. That is, we are investing less in our tertiary education in Australia than Canada or the United States—and dramatically less than even Korea. It is even less than some of the countries included in that report that are not even in the OECD. We invest less in our universities than Chile or Jamaica. Jamaica puts more of its GDP into tertiary education than this government does. The other alarming revelation in that report is public investment in the tertiary education system compared with the private investment that goes into tertiary education. But of course private investment takes into account the HECS fees—the charges that ordinary Australians have to face to get a place at university.
If you look at public investment, the money from the government, the picture is diabolical. We invest a meagre 0.8 per cent of GDP. That is below the OECD average. That places our government's investment in tertiary education behind Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States. Every one of those countries puts more public money into universities and tertiary education than Australia does. No wonder we have a crisis; no wonder we have a $10 billion debt sitting in the names of ordinary Australians trying to establish themselves as they start a new career. 
On the other hand, the private money—that is, the bills that we put on individuals—that goes into tertiary education in Australia is now at 0.7 per cent. That is more than double the OECD average. That system ensures that those who are wealthy have the advantage. When the burden is placed on those who pay, as this government is increasingly forcing those wishing to go to university to do, those who are the wealthiest will benefit; those who come from a less wealthy background will find their opportunity is less. Nowhere is that more apparent than in my home state of Queensland—in, sadly, the universities in Brisbane and in my electorate. The Courier-Mail today reported on this. I am sure all members would have studied the Courier-Mail already. I will just refer to the paragraphs in question:
Figures released yesterday by the Federal Education Department show that in Queensland next year, the University of Queensland will net $9.2 million in HECs increases, QUT $7.9 million, Griffith University $6.1 million and the University of Southern Queensland $1.9 million.
Over four years to 2008, the total extra fees netted by the four Queensland institutions which have announced their intention to lift fees will be almost $180 million.
That is $180 million extra that students in my electorate and throughout Queensland are going to have to find because of this government's attitude, because of this minister's attitude—a minister who thought that a free or low-cost tertiary system was fine when he was a student, but now that he is a minister thinks that that is an unworkable and abhorrent system, and that somehow our country cannot afford to give our children what he received from his parents.
I happen to have a different view about the future of our country and where these things should head. I happen to think that we have an obligation to provide our kids with a better opportunity than that which my parents provided to me—and, Minister, a better opportunity than your parents provided to you. It is a pity that you do not seem to share the same goals and aspirations, and that you happily sit on top of an administration doing the opposite and making it harder for people who came from your sort of background to have the opportunities you were afforded by a Labor government.
—It's still free.
—We have a minister who not only seems to misunderstand the situation; he has lost touch with the debate altogether. When you look further at the comparison of Australia and how it measures up around the world, that same OECD report shows that Australia has the second lowest increase in the rate of enrolments at university. This is not something that we should be happy about. Even before these latest barriers were put in place, those wanting to go to university found themselves out on the street—20,000 qualified Australians miss out on going to university each year. That is an alarming waste of opportunity and talent, not just for the 20,000 but for all of us who would benefit from their skills and contribution.
You see this government's approach now reflected in the impact on universities. Between 1996 and 2002, the number of students per teaching staff has blown out by 31 per cent. At some institutions, the increase has been over 50 per cent. We all know what that means. That means fewer subject offerings. It means fewer tutorials. It means bigger classes. And, ultimately, all of that means reduced learning opportunities—and this in a country with the opportunity and wealth that we have. 
The people of Australia understand the opportunity and wealth that this country has, and they know that they have been betrayed by this government. They know that it is not possible to spend too much money on education—there is no such thing as a population too well educated or trained. That is why they have embraced Labor's package, which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to in her address a little while ago, a package which substantially increases the amount of money going to education and to tertiary education but which does it in a socially responsible way, recognising the realities of Australian social life. I look forward to this debate as the weeks unfold. I was at the QUT, Minister, when they made the decision. If you had been there, you would have had an interesting afternoon.

"Bartlett, Kerry, MP",LP,2004-06-01,"—This motion needs to be seen in the context of Labor's current approach to almost every issue. It fits the same old pattern that is more about politics than it is about policy. For Labor, it does not matter about the facts; it does not matter whether it is good policy or not; it does not matter whether it is affordable or sustainable. So long as it is popular, so long as the rhetoric fits, so long as it gets some attention, then it seems to be acceptable to Labor. That is an approach that promises the world and worries later about how to pay for it, an approach that is all too familiar for the Labor Party.
The facts are simply these: this government's higher education reform package will deliver $2.6 billion in extra funding for our universities over the next five years, including an extra 34,000 fully funded places; $6.9 billion extra over the next 10 years—that is double Labor's much trumpeted Knowledge Nation package. The second point is that the rise in HECS is nowhere near as onerous as Labor are trying to assert. It is worth pointing out that it was Labor who first introduced the HECS loan system, because they—in a moment of reality—realised that a system of so-called free university education was in fact unsustainable. They introduced the HECS system and now they rail about a marginal increase that is necessary to ensure the system's sustainability.
Overall, students will still only be paying a little over a quarter of the cost of their university education. This package means a marginal increase from 26 per cent to 28 per cent of the cost of their university education, remembering that taxpayers—the majority of whom will never have the benefit of a university education—will still be paying for 72 per cent of the cost of that university education. It is worth remembering as well that the repayment threshold for those students on the HECS loans has been raised considerably from $24,365 to $35,000 from 1 July this year and to $36,814 from next year.
Remember as well that not all universities will be raising the HECS fee. In fact, eight have already said that they will not, and another 13 have not yet committed—and I hope that the University of Western Sydney will be one that will not raise fees. Remember as well that courses such as nursing and teaching have been quarantined from any rise. The point is that Labor's feigned outrage about the HECS rise really is not supported by the facts. It is a gross exaggeration, great on rhetoric but with very little in terms of substance.
The other point that needs to be made is that these changes—these modest, marginal increases in HECS fees—are part of an overall package that will vastly improve the versatility, flexibility and competition within Australia's higher education sector. Furthermore, they have been supported by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee because they know that these changes are necessary if our universities are going to be the sorts of institutions that we want them to be. To foolishly attempt to reverse these changes, as Labor wants to do, would return the sector to uniformity, inertia and mediocrity, yet that is exactly what the Labor Party is proposing. 
Coincidentally, last week I met with two representatives of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. Those representatives said clearly to me that they support these changes. They said we cannot afford—for the tertiary education sector, for higher education—to revert to what Labor wants: to overturn these changes. The vice-chancellors themselves are saying that these changes are necessary. In fact, the benefits of the overall package of these education changes, including these HECS fees rises, were summed up in an excellent editorial in the Weekend Australian of 20 September last year that I have referred to before in this place. That editorial said:
The higher education reforms before parliament give Australia's best universities the chance they need to grow into world-class teaching and research institutions. By ending the existing funding straitjacket, which rewards all institutions at the same rate regardless of the quality of their teaching, the Howard Government's plan provides the incentive for our best universities to compete, both against each other and internationally. And academic competition will breed intellectual excellence.
The Labor Party wants to return our universities to that straitjacket which will confine them to mediocrity and uniformity. Labor wants to stand in the way of the progress which our universities need, which would help them to develop into centres of excellence in teaching and research, and which would make them truly internationally competitive.
Two other points are worth making. The first point is that if Labor were really serious about the cost of education and about addressing the financial position of our universities, we would see them doing two things. Firstly, we would see Labor publicly criticising the New South Wales government for its outrageous increase in up-front TAFE fees by 250 to 350 per cent. Those fees are not supported by any HECS system; they are up-front increases in fees that our students need to pay. Yet what have we heard from Labor on this? We have heard nothing; we have had absolute silence. Secondly, we would hear Labor saying something about the outrageous payroll tax burden that universities incur at the hands of our state governments. The New South Wales government, for instance, places an annual burden of $97 million on our universities. What do we hear from those on the other side about that $97 million cost—which is just on New South Wales universities? We hear deafening silence. We hear not a thing from them.
Last year the University of Western Sydney were slugged $9.7 million, around five per cent of their total revenue, in payroll tax to the state government. Yet what have we heard from the Labor Party? Not a thing. If Labor were serious about the financial position of our universities, we would hear them publicly decrying state Labor's up-front fee assault on our TAFE students, and we would hear them decrying the tax slug that Labor imposes on our universities through the payroll tax system.
The second point that is worth making is that we have already had some hints from federal Labor—in fact, we have had more than hints; we have had a commitment—about their intention to introduce a national payroll tax system. What is that going to mean for our universities? On top of the state payroll tax that hits our universities, there will be a further impost by way of federal Labor's national payroll tax. The point is that we really need to take what we are hearing from the other side with a grain of salt. We need to take it as cheap political rhetoric and cheap hypocrisy until we hear them publicly criticise their Labor colleagues in New South Wales for the state Labor government's assault on students in our TAFE system and on the universities in New South Wales. 
A further point that needs to be made is this. If Labor are talking about rolling back HECS charges, we need to ask: where is the money coming from? We have already heard the minister point to $662 million that our universities will receive as benefits from these HECS fees over the next four years. If Labor are going to reject this $662 million, where will the money come from? What other taxes will they raise? What new taxes will Labor introduce to make up for this almost $700 million shortfall? Will the money come from the same old never-never—the same old Labor credit card, the same old Labor magic pudding? This is yet another example of Labor's approach: promise the world, promise what appears to be popular, and worry later about how to pay for it. The fact is, Labor like to pretend that there is no bottom line; but there is one. Labor's promises need to be funded, and we have heard nothing about how they are going to fund them. This motion is more of Labor's myopia and hypocrisy. It is another of their unaffordable promises. It is another of Labor's populist efforts which can never be a substitute for costed, affordable, sustainable policies like those of this government.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Education: University Funding</title>,Matters of Public Importance,8,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2004-06-01,"—I am pleased to speak on this matter of public importance in relation to the cost of education. A number of issues have been raised today; but I would like to speak about the reinstatement of the goods and services tax on textbooks, particularly as the minister, Mr Brendan Nelson, is at the table. I just listened with great interest to the member for Macquarie, and he quite rightly condemned the New South Wales state government for imposing a payroll tax on some of the educational institutions within New South Wales. I could not agree more. I think it is an absolute disgrace that a government is actually moving to tax education. It is a burden that our students should not be asked to bear in relation to their education—and neither should families—but I think the criticism also applies to the federal government.
The federal government really does need to re-examine its position on the reimposition of the goods and services tax on textbooks for our students. The minister, to his credit, has spent quite a lot of time talking about the sorts of things that we are doing for our younger people to encourage them to extend their education. The Leader of the Opposition has also spent a lot of time talking about education as a priority for our young people, and the Prime Minister has spent a lot of time talking about our young people. In fact, education has become a major issue for the next election.
I was very distressed to hear that the government is going to go ahead with the reintroduction of the full goods and services tax on textbooks for students. For those members who are not aware, when the goods and services tax arrangements were made, a deal was done with the Democrats to exempt textbooks from the goods and services tax. This was done for a very good reason—so that the cost would not be passed on to students, thus making education a more expensive avenue. The tax would have been a disincentive for students continuing their education. I think that the same circumstances that were around at that time are around now. I do not think it is a fait accompli—I would hope that the minister and the Prime Minister will reverse this—but I am led to believe that the government is looking at reimposing a full 10 per cent goods and services tax on textbooks for students at universities, TAFEs and schools. 
Obviously that will mean an increase in the price of education. It is not an increase that can be borne by the HECS arrangements and paid at a later date when an income flow has come to those particular students. It is an up-front cost and it is a cost that should not be there. I have two children at university at the moment. I am aware of the costs of keeping children at university—particularly at country universities where they are away from home and have additional expenses for accommodation, a vehicle and all of the sorts of things that accrue to parents—but I do not believe that this scheme should be reintroduced so that our students will be disadvantaged.
I am aware that Democrats Senator Natasha Stott Despoja introduced a private members bill which has so far not had success in the Senate, but I ask the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor members in the chamber to consider their position in relation to this. This is not an issue that should be allowed to go away because there are some old feelings between the Labor Party and the Democrats and the agreement in relation to the goods and services tax arrangements. It is something that should be addressed by this parliament, and I ask the minister to consider reassessing the government's position on this. If the government is not prepared to reassess its position, I would ask the opposition to look seriously at putting in place the appropriate legislation to reverse this decision.
If we are serious about trying to encourage our young people to be educated, we should not use the vehicles of education as sources of revenue for the taxation coffers, particularly at the time we are entering now. The government, through what it says is good management—and I do not disagree with its economic credentials in relation to that—has had a massive surplus. Here we have a chance where we can pass on some advantages to our younger people in relation to a goods and services tax exemption. I call on the minister and the opposition to look very seriously at this issue. 
On a broader level, I see a number of things starting to unfold in terms of the goods and services legislation. There are two issues that I think parallel the textbook subsidy issue of goods and services taxation. For instance, the fuel sales grant scheme was brought in in 2001 to compensate country motorists for the inequitous effect of the application of the goods and services tax to regional people, because of the differences in the prices of petrol at the bowser. Two months ago the Deputy Prime Minister, the supposed champion of regional Australia in his own lifetime, announced that he would be removing the fuel sales grant scheme and, in doing so, would add two to three cents a litre to the price of fuel at the bowser for country motorists. So there is a gradual unfolding of some of the commitments that were given at the time of the goods and services taxation arrangements.
The other issue is that at that particular time, just prior to an election, there was great outrage from the building industry about the application of the GST. The industry said that a 10 per cent GST would have an enormous impact on the employment and profitability of that particular industry. The government reacted and put in place the First Home Owners Scheme, and the states came along as well. My information is that since then—I think it was 2001—there has been something like a subsidy to the building industry of around $4.3 billion. So we are going to allow that sort of thing to continue—and I am not saying that that is bad policy, although I do not think it is terribly good policy—but remove a similar benefit for our students. There is no doubt that the $4.3 billion to the building industry to encourage people to build homes has had an impact on the property boom. In fact, the Reserve Bank has been quite up-front in saying that it has had to enter the financial markets to dampen the property boom and has used interest rate policy to do so, and the rest of the population is paying for that. 
I think it is a bit hypocritical of the government to maintain the First Home Owners Scheme but remove the very critical assistance to our students of the textbook subsidy arrangements that were put in place when the goods and services tax came in. I ask the minister once again to consider the students that we are talking about. If he is serious about the sorts of things he has been talking about in this House, and if both sides of parliament are serious about our young people and making it easier for them to learn and not using them as a source of taxation revenue into the future, this subsidy, as it is called, should be reintroduced so that our kids get a fair go.

"Charles, Bob, MP",LP,2004-06-01,"—by leave—I present the executive minutes on reports Nos 390, 393, 394 and 396 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, and seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the minutes.
Leave granted.
—The first of these reports, Report No. 390, reviewed Auditor-General's reports for the first three quarters of 2001-2002. This report examined four performance audits of the Auditor-General concerning:
	the administration of taxation rulings;
	Commonwealth estate property sales;
	administration of the Federation Fund program; and
	the management of security clearances.
I might add, as an aside, that the committee has taken an ongoing interest in the management of security clearances by the Commonwealth including post budget report briefings and ongoing correspondence with the Attorney-General.
The second report, No. 393, was the review of Auditor-General's reports for the fourth quarter of 2001-2002. This report also examined four performance audits of the Auditor-General. The audits focused on:
	corporate governance in the ABC;
	research project management in CSIRO;
	the management framework for preventing unlawful entry into Australian territory; and finally
	the management of the DASFLEET sale and tied contract.
The third JCPAA report, No. 394, reviewed Australia's quarantine function. This report mainly reviewed three broad areas:
	the parameters within which Australia must operate as a member of the World Trade Organisation;
	Australia's quarantine operations at the borders and quarantine preparedness generally; and finally
	quarantine public education programs.
The fourth JCPAA report, No. 396, reviewed Auditor-General's reports for the first three quarters of 2002-2003. This report examined 10 performance audits of the Auditor-General. The subjects covered ranged from facilities management at HMAS Cerberus to client service in the Child Support Agency to physical security arrangements in Commonwealth agencies. 
The executive minutes to these four committee reports respond to a total of 32 recommendations. I am pleased to say that the vast majority of these recommendations have been accepted by the government. Only two of the committee's recommendations were rejected outright and another was superseded by events—namely, the announced abolition of ATSIC.
I note with satisfaction the high rate of support for the committee's recommendations as indicated in these executive minutes. This is especially so as the committee has not shirked from hard hitting recommendations, if warranted by the evidence. Sometimes acceptance of such recommendations has incurred a significant cost to the Commonwealth.
As a final comment, I am pleased to advise that the departments of Finance and Administration and Prime Minister and Cabinet have modified and codified the arrangements by which the executive responds to JCPAA recommendations. I hope that the new procedures will facilitate speedy responses to the committee's recommendations. The committee continues to monitor the implementation of its recommendations and, if it believes that an executive minute has lacked sufficient detail, it has not hesitated to seek further information. The tabling of executive minutes remains an important accountability mechanism both for the committee and the parliament as a whole. The committee looks forward to making future reports to parliament on the responses to more recent reports.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Accounts and Audit Committee</title>,Committees,9,1

As a final comment, I am pleased to advise that the departments of Finance and Administration and Prime Minister and Cabinet have modified and codified the arrangements by which the executive responds to JCPAA recommendations. I hope that the new procedures will facilitate speedy responses to the committee's recommendations. The committee continues to monitor the implementation of its recommendations and, if it believes that an executive minute has lacked sufficient detail, it has not hesitated to seek further information. The tabling of executive minutes remains an important accountability mechanism both for the committee and the parliament as a whole. The committee looks forward to making future reports to parliament on the responses to more recent reports.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,9,2
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2004-06-01,"—Formally, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004 gives effect to the government's decision to abolish the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. In practice it does much more: it gives effect to the Prime Minister's long-held desire to dismantle every means available to Indigenous Australians to participate in decisions about their future. It is not surprising that this bill has been introduced in this an election year. With an eye to the polls, the Prime Minister has again embraced the politics of community division in pursuit of electoral gain.
But I have to tell you and make it very clear that the Labor Party will not be complicit in this attempt to divide our nation against itself. Today the caucus of the parliamentary Labor Party has determined that we should not allow this bill to pass until all its provisions have had very careful consideration. For this reason, Labor will be moving in the Senate to refer the bill to a committee for inquiry and report.
That proposition is of significant interest to me because I chaired the last Senate committee that looked into similar matters. When I was a senator on the backbench in 198889, we conducted a major select committee inquiry into the then ATSIC legislation and into the propositions that underpinned it. One thing that was noteworthy then—and it is an interesting contrast with the circumstance we now find ourselves in—was the extent of the consultation. A massive consultation exercise was undertaken by the then minister Gerry Hand and a very comprehensive consultation was conducted by the committee. In fact, the Liberal Party and National Party members of the committee complained that the original consultation by the minister had not been sufficient. I wonder what those people, at least one of whom remains in the parliament to this day, will say about the fact that there has been absolutely no consultation about this proposition. I suspect they will say nothing. 
That committee, in its review and in its report, looked at the three key principles that underpinned the move towards ATSIC. They were the consolidation of a number of Indigenous organisations into one major body and, more importantly, the development of a representative national structure and the development of a representative regional structure. That committee concluded then, and I remain of the view today, that it was the regional councils that were the key to Indigenous representation and to ATSIC. In my view, they remain the key to any effective form of Indigenous representation and effective participation in decisions affecting the lives of Indigenous people all around Australia, particularly those in the Indigenous communities in the remoter areas of Australia and more particularly in the north of Australia.
Sending this matter to a Senate committee will ensure that Indigenous Australians at least get some chance to have what the government has denied them: have a voice in the debate about their future. This debate will be conducted, if the government has its way, exclusively within the chambers of this parliament. We want to take it out to the people and in particular we want to give Indigenous Australians the opportunity to have their say.
Amongst other things, this bill abolishes the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission as it now stands. Let me restate clearly and unambiguously that the Labor Party do support the abolition of ATSIC. We do so for the reasons outlined in the framework statement released by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for Indigenous affairs on 30 March this year. We believe that ATSIC as it is currently constituted does not have the capacity to do the things we need it do to effectively to serve the interests of Indigenous Australians. However, unlike the Prime Minister and some, but I am certain not all, members on the other side of the House, we do not hold that view with any glee. We understand that for many Indigenous Australians ATSIC represents the only form of self-determination available to them.
Indigenous Australians have not had access to power or the capacity to influence decisions that affect their lives. It is true that a growing number of talented Indigenous MPs have been elected to state parliaments, serving the Labor interest. In particular, two very fine Indigenous ministers serve in the Martin Labor government in the Northern Territory, as previously an Indigenous minister served in the Western Australian Labor government. But just one Indigenous Australian sits in this parliament. If the debate is confined to this parliament, one Indigenous Australian will have a chance to get a say. No Indigenous Australians sit in this House, and that is a source of great shame to me as a member of the Labor Party. We have never elected an Indigenous member to the federal parliament. We are doing better and better in state parliaments, and that is a source of satisfaction, although there is still a long way to go. It is a failure by the Labor Party which we need to redress, and redress quickly.
It is pointless coming in here and looking at the criticisms—including many valid criticisms—of ATSIC without acknowledging the emotional attachment many Indigenous Australians felt for and, in many cases, still feel for ATSIC. That has to be put on the record as we also acknowledge that many Indigenous Australians—sometimes the same people who felt that emotional attachment—feel let down by, in particular, the suspended chair of ATSIC and the dysfunctional behaviour of the elected representatives in recent times. In 198889, we looked to and set down the development of ATSIC as a challenge to Indigenous leadership. I think in recent years the Indigenous leadership has failed that challenge. Not all of them have failed. Many members of the current board have worked very hard both locally and nationally, seeking to put forward a decent alternative voice. But collectively they have failed that challenge. Over the years that has not always been so. Many of the elected commissioners, including some who are currently serving, have served very well, representing their local area and taking responsibility for specific areas of activity. Many of the female members have been active in raising the issue of violence in Indigenous communities, which needed to be raised. Previous chairs, Lowitja O'Donoghue and Mr Djerrkura, and many commissioners past and present have done a fine job, but we cannot walk away from the fact that many Indigenous people are entitled to, and do, feel let down by the leadership of ATSIC and, particularly, by the currently suspended ATSIC chair. 
The bill does much more than just abolish the board of ATSIC on 1 July this year and the ATSIC regional councils on 1 July next year. It goes far beyond that. Although the life of the regional councils is extended for a single year, the minister for Indigenous affairs is vested by this legislation with new powers with respect to the operations of the council, including the approval of staff engagements and the convening of meetings. Apart from a general vesting of much of the power previously vested in ATSIC in the hands of the minister for Indigenous affairs and/or her delegate, the bill makes a number of significant amendments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act. The government characterises these amendments as consequential, but they are not necessarily consequential. They are in fact consequential only to the government's radical Indigenous affairs agenda.
The bill provides for the wholesale transfer of ATSIC's assets to the Commonwealth, with implicit protection for the Indigenous estate counting for little. I know that the member for Lingiari, who will speak later in this debate, has specific concern about some of the assets held by ATSIC in his constituency in trust for local communities. Those assets are no longer going to be held if this legislation is taken at its face value, and we want the committee to pursue whether this is the case. If it is the case, those assets will no longer be held in trust for the Indigenous community, they will be the property of the Commonwealth. Many of those assets have been building and accumulating in value far beyond any original Commonwealth contribution. While those assets are currently held in trust, should this legislation be passed they will transfer to the Commonwealth, and we want to be very sure that we have examined whether there is any potential for that trust to be breached—for example, is it within the power of the Commonwealth to sell those assets, as this government has been wont to do with anything that is not nailed down? There is a shopping centre in Alice Springs that the member for Lingiari spoke to me about and many other things that we need to examine very closely. We have very serious problems here that need to be fully examined, and at the moment I am particularly concerned about the provisions of the bill as they relate to that matter.
The bill proposes significant changes to two key portfolio agencies: Indigenous Business Australia and the Indigenous Land Corporation. They are both very important. Indigenous Business Australia is being asked to assume responsibility for a new Indigenous housing fund and the administration of a successor to the ATSIC home loan program. I am not sure that Indigenous Business Australia is the right place for those funds, and I am not sure that administering those funds will enhance the activities and very successful role of Indigenous Business Australia. That is fundamentally a commercial agency, and the Indigenous housing fund and the home loan program have quite different drivers and require quite different administrative approaches. I am seriously concerned that, without some enhancement of the resources of Indigenous Business Australia to allow it to develop a second stream of administration to deal with the housing fund and the home loan program, we will see both the housing fund and Indigenous Business Australia adversely affected by this awkward marriage. 
I have previously discussed with Indigenous Business Australia the idea that they might have taken over the small business activities of ATSIC. This was long before there was consideration of its abolition. I think that was a possible proposition, but it would have needed a stream of administration kept separate from the fundamentally commercial investment role of Indigenous Business Australia. This does not seem to me to have been properly addressed in the legislation as it stands. Alongside this new function, it is proposed that once again the minister for Indigenous affairs will be given new powers: the power to issue written directions to Indigenous Business Australia.
The bill provides for the Indigenous Land Corporation to assume responsibility for money held in a regional land fund and extends its power, including granting the power to make payments to Indigenous Business Australia. That is an issue we will want to look at because the consequences for the Indigenous Land Corporation are very significant. We need to make sure that this does not impact on its capacity to undertake its fundamental task, which was developed as part of the native title package.
Among the most significant of the proposals is the expansion of the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit. Under the terms of the bill the office would have a mandate to undertake evaluation and audits of Indigenous programs across departments and agencies. Additionally, its power would extend to the investigation of individuals and organisations that have received funding under an Indigenous program, with little apparent restriction on the scope of its activities.
The question of enhanced accountability is not something about which I directly have concern, but we are looking at setting up a structure to replace ATSIC. And that is what is wrong with this bill. It talks about what it is not going to do, but it does not talk about what it is going to do. It does not talk about seizing this new opportunity to do something positive for Indigenous Australians; it does not talk about leading us to a better way of implementing principles that give Indigenous people a more effective say through a more effective agency than ATSIC. It is all about taking opportunities away, taking responsibility away and taking the chance to participate away. In this instance it misses the opportunity to give enhanced accountability to Indigenous people.
It is not that I object to what it is proposed the Office of Evaluation and Audit will do—although the committee should have a long, hard look at that. In principle, there is nothing wrong with that. But one of the things that an elected representative Indigenous body that replaces ATSIC—and under this bill there will be no such thing, but there should be—should look at is how we ensure that those agencies spending public money to serve the interests of Indigenous people and to provide services to them are accountable in a continuing way not only to the parliament and through the parliament to the Australian people but also to Indigenous people. That needs to happen so we get questions asked of those agencies by the elected Indigenous representatives about whether services have been effectively delivered, for example, in the communities that those elected people represent. Over the years, we will then build up a responsiveness of agencies to those elected Indigenous representatives through a proper process of accountability. That is one of the functions that should have been put in place by this legislation to replace ATSIC. That has not been done. 
In a little-remarked change, the government has also determined to abolish the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board. In one fell swoop, the government is sweeping away key organisations concerned with Torres Strait Islander interests on the mainland, which is in fact the place where most Torres Strait Islanders live. We will still have representative bodies in the Torres Strait, but Torres Strait Islanders on the mainland—which is where the majority of Torres Strait Islanders live—will no longer have any of those agencies that ensure that their interests are reflected in the decision-making process. Torres Strait Islanders have been very badly treated by this piece of legislation.
This is not a simple legislative proposal. The bill amends 12 acts in total. In addition to the ATSIC Act, it deals with some Indigenous-specific things, like the Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. As I will mention in a moment, it makes changes to a number of other important acts. As one example of the scope of the bill and a demonstration of the zeal with which the government has chosen to pursue the elimination of Indigenous participation in decision making, let me have a look at some of the consequences of these amendments.
There are proposed amendments to the act dealing with IATSIS—the Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies—to remove the requirement for the minister for Indigenous affairs to consult with any Torres Strait Islander organisation prior to the appointment of a Torres Strait Islander to the board of the institute. Why? Why is the government doing that? What is the point? What is the purpose? What is achieved by the change, other than taking away some effective opportunity for people to participate and express a view?
The proposed amendment to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act removes the requirement for the minister for the environment to inform any Indigenous representative organisation of a proposal received under the act and the requirement for that minister to invite comment on that proposal. That is not just a bureaucratic change; that is a change of profound significance affecting the capacity of Indigenous people to have their views reflected in decisions made under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which has been a very fundamental right. I think that is a poor action. The protection of Indigenous heritage has been poorly pursued by this government. It had opportunities to do better and failed. This is one aspect where Indigenous representatives and, through them, Indigenous people get a chance to have their views heard and reflected in a bill that is important to them, and it is being taken away. Why? What is the case for that? What is the government's rationale for that mean-spirited action?
The proposed amendment to the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 removes a requirement for a nominee of an Indigenous representative organisation to sit on the National Health and Medical Research Council. There is no group of Australians with lower health outcomes than Indigenous Australians, yet we are reducing the pressure to ensure that their views are reflected in health and medical research decisions in this country. 
I wonder why we have a proposed amendment to the Native Title Act which gives the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department the new power to determine grants to native title representative bodies. There is an inquiry being done by a joint committee of the parliament to look into the funding and responsibilities of native title representative bodies, but I will be very surprised if giving power to the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department is one of the propositions that is likely to be reflected as a result of the considerations of that committee.
This bill was tabled only last Thursday and we are seeing it rushed through for debate. This has afforded the Labor Party very little time to consider its response. It is fascinating that the government would do this after its criticism of the Labor Party in 1989 for the inadequacy of the consultation which was undertaken. At that time 50 Indigenous communities were visited, hundreds of meetings were held, both by the minister and then by the committee—and the Liberal Party thought there had not been enough consultation. But here we have a bill tabled last Thursday, with no prior consultation, and brought on for debate today. The government will be rushing it through the House and, if it had the numbers, it would rush it through the Senate as well.
There may be other important consequences beyond those which I have outlined that would arise from the passage of the legislation, but the truth of it is that none of us yet knows. The government does not know. Certainly the government backbench do not know—they have not had the opportunity to consider it—and Indigenous Australians do not know. This bill has been rushed into the House and rushed on for debate, and we as an opposition will not accede to its hasty passage.
One of the other consequences and causes of concern is the secrecy surrounding how the government is going to implement its proposed mainstreaming of Indigenous programs. That secrecy reached absurd heights last week when the government refused to reveal details of the administration of Indigenous programs by mainstream departments and agencies. On 15 April, the Prime Minister and the minister announced that the government would move to abolish ATSIC and mainstream all the programs. On 28 April, the head of the government's executive agency, Mr Wayne Gibbons, issued an internal memo to staff allocating programs beginning 1 July 2004. Two days later, on 30 April, the minister for citizenship, acting as the minister for Indigenous affairs, issued a media statement which purported to show the final allocation. 
On 11 May, the budget provided for the transfer of ATSIC and ATSIS assets and appropriations for 2005 and subsequent years to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs as a so-called interim measure pending a decision by the Prime Minister on final program allocation. But last week the shadow minister for Indigenous affairs, Senator O'Brien, sought to examine through the Senate estimates process the government's plans—an obvious thing you would always expect to happen. But, regrettably, the government's failure to make Major O'Kane available to the parliament is not the only abuse of accountability that we have witnessed during this estimates round. 
Last Thursday, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, acting under direction from its senior minister, refused to tell the parliament how any Commonwealth program will be managed after 1 July. Less than five weeks from the end of the financial year, no details were forthcoming on the future of dozens of Indigenous programs worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The Howard government refused to tell the parliament where Indigenous employment, legal services, sport, family violence, women's issues, native title, heritage and broadcasting programs would be transferred at the beginning of the financial year. We are now into the last month of this financial year—we are into June—and the government still refuses to reveal these details. Thousands of staff and hundreds of thousands of Indigenous Australians are subject to unnecessary and continuing uncertainty by the Howard government's confusion, its failure to make up its mind, or its secrecy in refusing to disclose what decisions it has made.
My colleague Senator O'Brien made the observation that, on the day the government introduced its ATSIC legislation into this House—last Thursday—it conclusively demonstrated its disregard for the principles of good governance and the requirement to account to the people it serves, particularly Indigenous Australians. I could not agree more. But not only has the government refused to explain how these programs will be managed, it has also failed to offer a rationale for mainstreaming these issues.
In every sense, the wholesale mainstreaming of Indigenous programs represents the apex of the government's failing `practical reconciliation' agenda—and that is an agenda which has failed every objective test. Late last year the Australian National University's respected Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research—one of the leading, if not the leading, Indigenous research organisations in this area—published a damning assessment of the government's performance, as part of a survey of reconciliation for the period 1991 to 2001. CAEPR found that, even using the government's own measure, there was less practical reconciliation in socioeconomic terms in 2001 than in 1996. On almost all counts, Indigenous Australia went backwards during the first five years of this government's life. Areas of improvement evident in the period 1991 to 1996 had been eroded in the period 1996 to 2001.
The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner has made a starkly similar assessment of the government's performance in Indigenous affairs. His latest Social Justice Report reveals the devastating reality. During the period in which the current Prime Minister has occupied his high office, the life expectancy of Indigenous women in this country has declined, while the gap between the life expectancy of Indigenous and non-Indigenous women has grown. While life expectancy for Indigenous men has increased marginally—to just 56.3 years, I might point out—the gap between life expectancy for Indigenous and non-Indigenous men has also grown.
In terms of that fundamental measure of social justice, the gap in life expectancy and the trend in the narrowing or otherwise of that gap, our performance is the worst in the Western world and getting worse. If you make a comparison with three countries with similar histories, experience and current economic circumstances—the United States, Canada and New Zealand—you see that our performance in that fundamental measure is far worse than that of those three. The trend in those countries is for improvement, and the trend in this country is deterioration over the last five years. That is what `practical reconciliation' has delivered to Indigenous Australians. 
In moving for an inquiry into this bill and related matters, the Labor Party hope we will get a greater understanding of the government's plans for the mainstreaming of Indigenous programs. We hope that the plans hitherto hidden from the parliament and from Indigenous Australians will be revealed. The Labor Party have been outlining an alternative approach to Indigenous affairs that is not confined by the narrow ideological view that shackles current government policy. A future Latham Labor government will give Indigenous Australians the opportunity to take responsibility for key decisions on Indigenous program development. We are committed to reaffirming and strengthening the right of Indigenous Australians to inform and shape national policy and to have elected representatives reflect their views in terms of advocacy, advice and accountability. We will work with Indigenous Australians to develop these arrangements; we will not be rushing bills into the parliament before Indigenous people have had a chance to be consulted about what is in them and what should be in them.
Labor will also work in partnership with the states and territories and the community and private sectors to better coordinate funding and services that address endemic Indigenous disadvantage. It is very important that we harness the energy, commitment and expertise in local communities—the Indigenous people and the non-Indigenous people—and apply those resources to solve local problems. That is why a Labor government will transfer responsibility for Indigenous program development and delivery to the regions with appropriate support from government. Efforts by Indigenous communities to take greater responsibility for addressing endemic problems will be central to the success of Labor's plan. That is why Labor will create new regional Indigenous bodies to make key decisions about local programs and to maintain Indigenous-specific programs.
During the development of the ATSIC bill, the government has ignored two key findings of the Commonwealth Grants Commission which are very important and should not have been ignored. The Commonwealth Grants Commission found that mainstream services do not meet the needs of Indigenous people to the same extent as they meet the needs of non-Indigenous people and that the effectiveness of those programs is significantly enhanced by Indigenous control of, or strong influence over, service delivery. More interestingly, under cover of a media statement from Liberal candidate Mr Malcolm Turnbull, the Menzies Research Centre has recommended the creation of new, invigorated governance structures and regional development for Indigenous Australians. The Menzies Research Centre has got it right and the government has got it wrong.
I conclude by saying that it is very important that we deal with this bill in a serious way and do not do that hastily. The government spent $1.4 million reviewing ATSIC and then ignored the outcome. We do not want another circumstance where the Indigenous voice is not heard and this parliament makes decisions that ignore and fail to reflect the interests of Indigenous Australians. If this government will not do it, after the next election a new Labor government will do it. Therefore, I move:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: 
(1)	notes the failure of the government's `practical reconciliation' agenda
(2)	condemns the government for:
(a)	failing to consult or negotiate with Indigenous Australians on the provisions of the bill;
(b)	failing to explain how the proposed abolition of Indigenous representative organisations and mainstreaming of Indigenous programs from 1 July 2004 will address endemic Indigenous dis-advantage;
(c)	failing to develop a new legislative and administrative model that restores the right of Indigenous Australians to be responsible for their own future; and
(3)	notes Labor's support for the abolition of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and creation of new legislative and administrative arrangements that restore responsibility and opportunity for Indigenous Australians”.

"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,2004-06-01,"—I rise to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004. I have demonstrated over a very long time a practical interest in addressing problems that are fundamental to an administration designed in Canberra, which, of course, is not a place on the Australian mainland where there are major difficulties for Indigenous people. Those difficulties get worse the further you get from Canberra and—in response to the constant repetition coming from the member for Fraser—the further you get from so-called regional centres. Regionalism is no more an answer to the problems of Aboriginal people than centralism. This is an issue that must be addressed at the local level. 
Whilst it became absolutely imperative that this government act, and mainstreaming was the only short-term solution to the circumstances that existed within ATSIC—something that was recognised by the Leader of the Opposition—I would like to support the need for further progress to keep the decisions covered in this bill as works in progress. That would ensure that Australia would be able to achieve an outcome that included the opportunity for Aboriginal people to decide, at the local level, the specific needs in their localities. It would also ensure that a process of prudential management existed that would ensure that all sectors of that particular community could benefit and not be held accountable under the law for any failings they might otherwise have if that prudential management were not there.
These are fairly simple issues. It was interesting to hear the member for Fraser bemoan the life expectancy issue, which primarily arises from Aboriginal health issues. With the Labor government we had the Aboriginal Medical Service. The point is that that system, which was implemented by Labor to deliver for Indigenous people, has failed on the fundamental tests. The member for Fraser was more than brief in addressing Labor's issues. I find that the amendment is one of those typical amendments that do not say anything about what Labor would do. It is all about condemning the government for this, that and something else; for A, B and C. In other words, the opportunity for the member for Fraser, who had 30 minutes of speaking time, to put down a workable alternative was lost. It was just criticism.
We are going to have a Senate inquiry, notwithstanding that one of the reasons this legislation is before the House is that an inquiry was conducted independent of politics—by, I might add, a couple of recognised ex-politicians—namely, the Hannaford inquiry. They have been out there talking to Indigenous people for probably a couple of years. Included on that board was retired Senator Bob Collins, a man who anyone would say is not only highly experienced but also highly committed to the Aboriginal cause in his philosophical, political and personal arrangements. Those people have reported to the parliament. We were interested, of course, in the submissions put to them. Those submissions said fundamentally that the Aboriginal people of more remote areas were fed up with the system. They were fed up with being asked to put thousands of dollars into submissions so that they could buy dialysis machines for their own communities, where kidney diseases and other things are a severe problem. They were fed up with nepotism, where that was obvious, and with being the ones who missed out. 
Worse, the member for Fraser is concerned about the thousands of staff. It has always been my view, sir, that that is the big problem. Throughout Australia moneys provided by our taxpayers have been used to employ people, many of whom, from my personal knowledge, had quite good employment at various levels throughout Australian society in general. They made the shift over and got other jobs but, in the process, did very little for those areas where alcoholism, drug abuse and petrol sniffing—substance abuse, I guess, is the term—isolation, poor hygiene and loss of hope are problems or for those who are frequently isolated in so-called communities where there is no opportunity for employment. All of those issues have not been addressed by the very people who are on the payroll.
Of course, the government had to act. In a throwaway line the Leader of the Opposition announced that he was going to do this if he was elected. Now that the government has thrown the Labor Party the challenge, they are not really sure. The best they can do is move an amendment to this legislation. Given the time available, the advice of the Hannaford committee and the reading of that report, have they come up with any form of alternative? No—they have three amendments, each starting with `failing to' or `condemns the government for'. That is great, isn't it? We have people with the lowest life expectancy in the world, as the member for Fraser said, and he gave us a few words that said nothing specific about how the Labor Party would address this issue.
I cannot speak for the entire government other than to say that I am confident that this initiative is both necessary and a work in progress. A number of people on this side of the House—quite a large number—thought that it was not a bad idea to put a submission to the Hannaford inquiry. We did so openly. When we were asked whether it could go onto the inquiry web site, we answered immediately, `Yes.' We were not frightened to be identified and attacked by a media that has about the same knowledge of the problem as most members of the Labor Party do—that is, nil.
The reality is that we argued for some years for a reversal of the process of funding for Aboriginal people—that is, what we refer to as bottom-up funding. Instead of having a large amount of money that is creamed off at every level legitimately and, unfortunately, occasionally illegitimately and dishonestly, we should have the money out there on the ground and empower local communities as to how that money might be spent. The Institute of Aboriginal Studies and Research has identified some 300-odd Aboriginal language areas. That would appear to provide an excellent base for the distribution of these funds.
There is no shortage of processes to do that. In fact, the Commonwealth many years ago set up and reorganised the legislation to empower the Commonwealth Grants Commission, in this case in conjunction with the state grants commissions—and this would not be necessary for Aboriginal people—to distribute moneys to local governments throughout Australia on a weighted per capita basis. In other words, in that precedent, if the Australian government put $2 billion into the kitty and someone like you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker—and I know that you were on an inquiry into this matter—were to add up the dollars arriving in the bank accounts of 700-odd Australian local government authorities, it would add up, to the last cent, to that amount of money shown in the budget. Nobody would get anything during the process of distribution from those allocated funds. That, in my view, should be the starting point for how we assist Aboriginal people. Of course, within those communities they would know what their problems are. I have to tell you that, unfortunately, many members of the Aboriginal elite do not know what they are. They are about as ignorant as most Australians. 
It is interesting to me that, during my term as Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, when I raised questions about the legitimacy of the so-called Aboriginal tent embassy, it did not take long for the local Ngunnawal people to agree with me. They did not think the motley crew down there—many of whom are not Indigenous—had any right to be on their land. It is quite interesting to get correspondence from well-meaning souls who talk about the rights of all Aboriginal people to camp in Canberra—it is not the view of the Ngunnawal.
If the member for Lingiari wanted to admit it, there would be many parts of his electorate where other Aboriginals were not welcome. I am not saying that critically; I am just saying that is how little understanding people have of the fundamentals of the culture of Aboriginal people. Consequently, governments in Canberra should distribute funding for their best interests. And that is not by letting every council member who has been elected to decide on this expenditure buy a white Toyota.
A very highly respected Aboriginal that I knew in Carnarvon confronted me some years ago. When I first knew him he was running his own truck. He was a businessman in town. I guess that it was not a bad idea that he was picked by the Aboriginal administration to try to teach other people how to look after vehicles. He grabbed me and said, `When are you going to stop replacing these vehicles every time someone fails to replace the oil? How can I teach them proper vehicle maintenance?' So why don't we recognise the view of an Aboriginal person on that matter?
But is that where we start? No. We start with a dialysis machine, if kidney failure is the problem in that community. Do we start with the Aboriginal medical service—which has typically put a general practitioner in a small community on the other side of the road from the established general practitioner, when the real need is for additional specialist visits that should be funded and could provide a service to all members of that small community? Might I add that anybody checking on those who visit Aboriginal medical services will find that a very large percentage of the European—if I can use that word—community attend there also, and I am not criticising that.
There is no commonsense approach to what the genuine need is, but I think it would be discovered if we empowered people at that level and sent them the money. What am I talking about? If you want to lobby in Canberra then of course you affiliate your 300-odd councils with the money. If they think the local lawyer is not good enough and they do not want to hire them, they can hire someone from the Aboriginal legal service. But the Aboriginal legal service is not guaranteed a life at the expense of someone who needs dialysis. Let the local community decide. If there is a need for public health nurses and the state government will not provide them, offer to pay for some—but, hopefully, in conjunction with a training program for Aboriginal people so that they can service their own in those important areas. All of this is achievable if you empower people at the bottom, distribute the funding on known processes and give them the assistance of a proper, localised prudential arrangement, which we have suggested. Of course it is not set in concrete that there should be a partnership with their nearest local authority to assist those people with financial and prudential management. There is nothing wrong with that, provided that it is a partnership. These are the sorts of things we want, so that the issues and problems can be addressed. 
I lived for a long time in the town of Carnarvon and I know a lot of Aboriginal people there. I still have the opportunity to talk to a couple who have scars on their chests, and they have a very different view of Aboriginal management than that which will be expressed shortly by the member for Lingiari. They are truly cultural people and have a true understanding. They are not all that wrapped in the idea of a cultural centre that is estimated to cost $4 million—and some of the building contractors tell me that you could not build it for that in Carnarvon. They think there are other issues with a more immediate need: helping individual people. And, of course, alcoholism is one of the problems.
These are the issues that are not being addressed and where the system, as created in Canberra, has failed. I support entirely the minister's decision to do something about it. Obviously, in the short term, there can be no other solution than mainstreaming and bringing it in under the normal umbrella of the Canberra bureaucracy whence the money comes. But the great opportunity missed tonight—and I am prepared to have a small bet that it will not be provided by the member for Lingiari—is for sensible solutions to be put up, not for people to stand there and say, `We criticise this. We're going to have a Senate inquiry so that we can run around and gain some political advantage from it.' We have already had an inquiry with a retired Labor senator, who is a man of some understanding. He made a report to the parliament. Why do you need another one? Why don't we get on, in this House, and make the opportunities?
—The government didn't implement it; it ignored it.
—The opportunity remains for that. The opportunity was to take the first step. The first step is to change and remove a failed organisation which has lost the confidence of the Australian people, including most of those in Indigenous localities. They do not have confidence in it. A better system is required and, in fact, I hope that the temporary situation put before the House today will not remain. I support it, as do a number of other members—those who quite openly and courageously put their name to a suggestion that was not exactly the flavour of the month at the time they put forward their thoughts. But the reality is this side of the House, at the backbench level, have suggestions for a better system that we are convinced will work. And we will work very hard to convince the minister and others that the final solution will be of this nature.
But we are not here just to criticise. As the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has advised the public, there is no suggestion in these arrangements that there will be lesser amounts of money. A number of the institutions will remain and of course there will be every attempt to ensure that more money gets to the places it is needed and that it is not lost in administrative processes that favour no-one other than people who have other opportunities to gain employment within Australia. 
From my personal observation, many of those people had those sorts of jobs—right across the spectrum. They worked as labourers on the council and the electricity authority in Carnarvon, they worked in the main roads department, some owned their own trucks on the main road and, as I mentioned, one had a trucking business back in 1958 and was doing quite well. These are people who can manage their own affairs. They need an arrangement that protects them from the pressures that can arise within families and others—there is nothing wrong with that being put as part of the process but we do not want to create another bureaucracy that gets all the money and leaves behind those suffering substance abuse, kidney disease, short life expectancy or infant mortality. We do not want to see that continue. There is no need—it is not for lack of money; there is plenty of money.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2004-06-01,"—I note the contribution from the member for O'Connor, and whilst it is a challenge to respond to each and every one of his wild assertions it is not my intention to even bother to give them the time of day. It is far more important that we analyse what has gone on here and why the Labor Party has taken the position that it has. We need to comprehend that this proposal before us tonight was built around wrong-headed ideas, false assumptions, false understanding and a direct and deliberately ideologically driven approach as to why we need change. I do not believe that what we have before us tonight can be seen as anything other than that, and I will explain in some detail why that is the case.
It is interesting to note that this legislation, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004, was introduced into the parliament on 27 May—the anniversary of the referendum in 1967 to recognise Indigenous people in this country was marked this year by this proposal by the government. It brings nothing but shame upon the Prime Minister and his government that they should have bothered to have done it on that day, apart from anything else. 
Earlier this month, the late Mr Djerrkura, who chaired ATSIC between December 1996 and December 1999, launched Mark McKenna's latest book, This Country: A Reconciled Republic?, here in Canberra. Mr Djerrkura died two weeks later at the age of just 54. But it is worth reminding ourselves of what he said at that book launch. He was referring there to this decision by the government to abolish ATSIC and not have any vision for a replacement organisation which would give Indigenous Australians representation and a voice at a national level:
It is no coincidence that John Howard announced his intention to abolish ATSIC when the organisation was at the weakest point in its 14-year history. For me, as a former chairman, but also in my capacity as an Aboriginal leader, one of the most disappointing aspects of Mr Howard's decision was the manner in which it was made and the language with which it was delivered.
In the classic imperial fashion, without negotiation, without understanding and with little empathy, the great white leader announced that Aboriginal people had, yet again been a “failure”. ATSIC would be abolished. No more paternalistic model of government could be found.
It is worth noting that at one time Mr Djerrkura might have been regarded as something of an ally of the Prime Minister. He sought to work with the Prime Minister and educate him about the needs and aspirations of Indigenous Australians—a hopeless quest if ever there was one.
When the Prime Minister announced his intention to abolish ATSIC on 15 April he said: 
Our goals in relation to indigenous affairs are to improve the outcomes and opportunities and hopes of indigenous people in areas of health, education and employment. We believe very strongly that the experiment in separate representation, elected representation, for indigenous people has been a failure. ... Programmes will be mainstreamed, but arrangements will be established to ensure that there is a major policy role for the Minister for Indigenous Affairs.
Let us just analyse for a moment what the Prime Minister said. The rationale for getting rid of ATSIC, from his point of view, was about addressing issues in regard to health, education and employment. People, particularly those people in the gallery this evening, would know that ATSIC never had responsibility for those things.
Those failures were the fault of mainstream agencies failing to deliver their services. This was the incapacity of government at a federal and state and territory level to do the job they are supposed to do on behalf of all Australian taxpayers: to provide rights to Indigenous Australians, who they should properly accept as Australian citizens. This was not a failure of ATSIC; this was a failure of government. I did not see the Prime Minister carpet the Minister for Education, Science and Training or the Minister for Health and Ageing and ask them for their resignations or carpet their agencies for their failure to address these issues of great national and international concern. Here we are seeing the government rewarding failure and blaming the victims yet again. 
The Commonwealth Grants Commission has expressed serious doubts about the capacity of these `mainstreamed' departments to meet Indigenous need. What a surprise! In its Report on Indigenous funding 2001, the commission wrote:
It is clear from all available evidence that mainstream services do not meet the needs of Indigenous people to the same extent as they meet the needs of non-Indigenous people.
Yet this advice was ignored by the government in the same way that its very own ATSIC review was ignored. The member for O'Connor made much of this review—he mentioned it at least two or three times in his contribution. The government paid $1.4 million or $1.5 million to have this review undertaken by Jackie Huggins, Bob Collins and Mr Hannaford. They consulted with Indigenous people around not all of Australia but certainly parts of Australia. They came back with a comprehensive report—at least as far as it could be comprehensive given the limited consultations they could have. And they had a series of recommendations. All of the recommendations which were in that report were ignored by the government. So let's not have any more of this rubbish that somehow or other the government is following the recommendations or even the philosophy that underpinned the recommendations in that report.
It is no wonder that Indigenous people across Australia find it difficult to trust governments and their departments with their wellbeing, given the abysmal failure of these departments and of their ministers to carry out their responsibilities to address the serious needs of Indigenous Australians wherever they might live. Last year the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research released longitudinal research to measure the impact of Indigenous policy over the 10 years from 1991 to 2001 in the areas of employment, income, housing, education and health. The paper, `Monitoring `practical' reconciliation: evidence from the reconciliation decade, 1991-2001', was revealing. It stated:
Practical reconciliation forms the rhetorical basis for much of the Indigenous policy initiatives of the current government. Despite the policy rhetoric of three Howard governments, there is no statistical evidence that their policies and programs are delivering better outcomes for Indigenous Australians, at the national level, than those of their political predecessors. This intractability is worrying in part because it is evident during a time when Australian the macro-economy is growing rapidly. 
...	...	...
A major problem for both Indigenous Australians and the nation is that other research ... suggests that the situation described using the latest 2001 ... statistics is likely to get worse, rather than better, over the next decade.
Let me describe just briefly the reality of Indigenous poverty in this country. In March this year, the Fred Hollows Foundation released an analysis of what it calls our health emergency. It said:
Overall, Australians enjoy amongst the highest standards of health and life expectancy in the world, but compared with other Australians, Indigenous people have:
	life expectancy—20 years less;
	infant mortality rate—is about twice as high;
	a median age at death of 53 years, 25 years less than for the population as a whole;
	in some regions the median age at death was 47 years.
It goes on to describe the impact on Aboriginal children:
Many Aboriginal kids are at a health disadvantage from birth. Twice as many Indigenous children are born at low birth weight than other Australian babies ... an important indicator of chronic health problems in later life, and a possible causal factor in serious illnesses such as kidney failure, diabetes and heart disease.
...	...	...
	In remote areas—
Indigenous children—
are three times as likely as non-Indigenous children to die before the age of one.
	The major cause of illness—
that leads to these deaths—
is preventable infections.
And I could go on, because these statistics are compelling, and they are a shame on all of us. Yet the government, in seeing the need, says that somehow or other ATSIC has failed. Indeed, in the second reading speech the minister said:
All too often the specialist Indigenous agency, ATSIC, provided an excuse for mainstream departments to avoid their responsibilities to Indigenous Australians.
What does that mean? What the hell does that mean? It means that these other agencies copped out and did not do their job. So what does the minister do? This is the justification, by the way, for knocking off ATSIC. Because other agencies use ATSIC as an excuse, what should we do about it? Get rid of ATSIC, of course. How absurd! How fundamentally and basically absurd.
Let me finally go to the issue of living standards for Indigenous Australians. Reporting on a Canadian study which was released in Melbourne some weeks ago, an article in the Age of 28 April said:
The quality of life of Australia's Aborigines is the second worst on the planet ...
This is not ATSIC's fault. This is not ATSIC's responsibility. There may be failings in ATSIC—of that there is no doubt. And clearly we on this side of the House saw a need to have a new body created. We took the view that we needed to do something different, but we did not do as this government has done and pre-emptively cut ATSIC's life short without any alternative program and without negotiating with Indigenous Australians over what should be in its place. Rather, this pre-emptive strike has left us with a proposal to give the minister absolute power over all areas of Indigenous affairs and a power to delegate those powers to public servants—with no Indigenous representation, no advice and no Indigenous Australians accepting responsibility. 
The Prime Minister has never had the capacity to put himself in the shoes of those who are different from him personally. Remember, all those days ago, he could not understand why people took offence to his comments that Asians were less welcome than Anglos. He cannot understand why it is wrong to incarcerate the children of asylum seekers for years, to the point where they become mentally ill and attempt suicide. It is why he was never really interested in foreign policy and why he has never been interested in Indigenous Australia. He just cannot understand; he just does not get it. He cannot understand why people should be different, and he has revealed this many times. The late Mr Djerrkura eventually saw this. In his last public speech, Mr Djerrkura reflected on his earlier failed attempts to help the Prime Minister see things from the perspective of Indigenous Australians. He said:
The Prime Minister has long refused to accept the fundamental difference of Aboriginal people in our community. He was never sympathetic to the principles on which ATSIC was based and founded. He has always rejected any suggestion of indigenous autonomy and self-determination.
Even when the Prime Minister took up my invitation to visit Arnhem Land in 1998, he seemed incapable of understanding indigenous aspirations.
...	...	...
I suppose we should not be surprised. The Prime Minister walks early and often, but he has never walked for reconciliation. Nor has he been able to bring himself, as the leader of our nation, to say sorry.
But do not think for a moment that the Prime Minister's problem is just one of perspective; do not think that his intent is innocent. He is aware of the wrong he is doing and he is aware of the base sentiments he brazenly stokes to gain political advantage. In what has perhaps been the only honest moment of his prime ministership, on election night in October 1998 he provided a tacit admission of the hurt he had caused to Indigenous Australians. After a parliamentary term which had seen the appeasement of Hanson, bucketloads of extinguishment as part of the Wik package and the grotesque denial of the stolen generations, the Prime Minister made a coded confession following that victory. He said:
... I also want to commit myself very genuinely to the cause of true reconciliation with the Aboriginal people of Australia by the centenary of Federation. We may differ ... about the best way of achieving reconciliation, but I think all Australians are united in a determination to achieve it.
He knew the immense pain he had caused, particularly to those families who were part of the stolen generations. But that commitment to reconciliation, as with many other things, never went anywhere, and it was the last time the Prime Minister ever expressed an interest in Indigenous Australia or reconciliation.
The truth is that the Prime Minister has never supported Indigenous self-determination. This is what he told the House in 1989, responding to the ministerial statement on Indigenous affairs on the introduction of ATSIC:
I think it is a very bad step for the long term unity of this country to establish the structure envisaged under the ATSIC legislation.
...	...	...
The ATSIC legislation strikes at the heart of the unity of the Australian people.
It is very clear that the Prime Minister's agenda all along has been to get rid of ATSIC. He did not agree with it to start with. He does not believe that Aboriginal people should have any right to self-determination or a voice at a national level. He does not believe that they should have a place at the table. So what did he do? When he thought the political moment was right, when he thought he could tweak some votes in some areas of Australia, he took this pre-emptive decision without providing any alternative vision for the future.  
It is clear that the Prime Minister is intent on turning back the clock. It is very clear that he is taking us back to the sad old days of assimilation. That is where this bill takes us. What it seems to ignore is the fact that self-determination is about responsibility. Of course, what he does not seem to understand is that progress without responsibility is not possible. The paternalistic approach never did work, and it never will work. Governments must work with Indigenous Australians to tackle the crisis of poverty. Governments will never get it right by acting alone. Governments will certainly not get it right if they do not give Indigenous people the responsibility for making decisions.
As far back as 1938 at the Aborigines conference in Sydney, John Patten gave a speech that could well have been given today. He said:
We refuse to be pushed into the background. We have decided to make ourselves heard ... 
We do not wish to be left behind in Australia's march to progress ... 
We are looking in vain to white people to help us by charity. We must do something ourselves to draw public attention to our plight.
At the same conference, the Aboriginal leader William Ferguson made a stirring call for recognition when he said:
Can anyone wonder why we revolt against persons who suppress our people and then accuse us of being `backward'? 
If our young girls and boys were given proper education they would be able to take their place with other Australians in the community.
...	...	...
We ask that the Government should give us some encouragement to make progress. 
It is progress we want ...
We are backward only because we have no real opportunity to make progress. We have been denied the opportunity.
These speeches were made not today, not yesterday, but 66 years ago. What changes have taken place since? How shamed we must be.
Labor has an alternative view. Last week, Patrick Dodson gave this year's National Reconciliation Week address, which he delivered in the Great Hall of this Parliament House. He called on all of us to use the opportunity provided by the abolition of ATSIC to build something better. He said:
If political leaders are prepared to enter into a dialogue with us, we now have an opportunity to realign the relationship between the indigenous Australians and governments.
We have available to us a “camp along the side of the road” where as a nation we can again develop a strategy to take us forward as mates, where formal and substantive equality could be achieved without any other citizen losing out—yet another opportunity for a resolution of our unfinished business.
We require a national indigenous voice that has its authority grounded in support from indigenous Australians.
I say, `Hear, hear' to that. Unwittingly, the government has given us an opportunity. It is an opportunity for a new way forward, an opportunity to develop a new plan; to work out new sets of relationships with Indigenous Australians; to provide new ways to make governments accountable for what they do; to give a national body a voice which has not only an advocacy role but also a role in holding governments accountable; to ensure that government agencies that this government will not make accountable actually do their job; to make state and territory governments accountable for their bad performance; and to make the ministers who sit on the other side of the chamber responsible for what they do, instead of blaming other organisations and, worst of all, blaming those people who are most innocent, those people who cannot defend themselves, those people who most need our intervention and assistance, and those people who want their Indigenous voice heard through regional Indigenous bodies and through a national Indigenous body which is properly representative and has a role at the national level. We in Labor believe that there is a vision for the future, and that vision requires that Indigenous people have a proper place at the table and a proper place to express a national voice.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2004-06-01,"—I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004, which I sincerely hope will be a new beginning on the long road back for the Aboriginal people of this country. I would like to explain in more detail why I think ATSIC needs to be abolished, why it has demonstrably failed the Indigenous people it is supposed to represent and what we need to focus on in order to generate happiness in our Indigenous communities. No-one can visit some of our more troubled remote Indigenous communities and not be touched by what they clearly do not have. They deserve the opportunity to be happy. It is as simple as that. 
I have spent some years working in western New South Wales in towns with large Aboriginal populations and pubs which were designated `blacks only'. I have worked alongside various Aboriginal shearers and shed workers. I have seen the appalling conditions in which many of them live and the despair with which they are regarded by the mainstream community because of vandalism, drunkenness and family violence. I think the feeling that the mainstream community has for them now is overwhelmingly despair. There was no official apartheid but, my God, there was an unofficial one. When you considered the amount of money being delivered to Aboriginal programs, you wondered why the average Aboriginal person had nothing. The point is this: if I went back to some of those places tomorrow, I do not think very much would have changed. Well, one thing would have: the increased use of drugs instead of alcohol and the increased use of amphetamines instead of marijuana. But you would still see the same vacant stares on the faces of the youth and the same level of disconnection with the other Australia. 
There have been some bright lights, there have been some improvements and there are still some excellent programs that deliver benefits that are obvious to all. I do not wish to downplay the very real successes we have had, but they are not enough. There is not enough money hitting the ground and it is time to do things differently, and this bill is an important part of that. The ATSIC Amendment Bill will abolish the national board of ATSIC on 1 July this year and abolish the regional councils one year later and transfer ATSIC's assets and liabilities to other mainstream agencies. The $79 million in savings that will be generated over four years will be allocated to Indigenous-specific programs. 
I represent a significant Aboriginal community in the west of my electorate centred on the town of Dareton in western New South Wales; Dareton is not far from Mildura. There are problems in this community and from time to time they seem to get worse. I received some distressing correspondence from the elders of this community some time ago, and they have continued to keep in touch with me about matters that concern them. They have outlined many serious issues, particularly serious family violence issues. They wanted me to bring these issues to the parliament. I want to quote briefly from what they told me in one of the appendices to their letters, and it demonstrates the level of disconnection in parts of the Aboriginal community in this part of my electorate. They said: 
A 13-year-old child recently gave birth to an infant. The father of this infant is 12 years old. The 13 year old mother says she had the baby so that she doesn't have to go to school and she can get the pension like her mother
A nine-year boy is often so drunk he has to be wheeled home in a shopping trolley. Recently his mother and family “celebrated” his “first doory”, which means sexual intercourse, which he had with a 30 year old woman 
Another thirty year old woman tried to have a 14 year boy, that she had been living with in a sexual relationship for the last two years, charged with rape, so that she could claim “Crimes Compensation” 
A distraught mother of five children “went into ... Family Care Domestic Violence Unit to seek assistance” because she feared she would either abuse or kill her youngest child, that she had difficulty handling. The mother states that she was turned away without assistance, because ... Family Care could assist “the child victim” but they could not assist the possible perpetrator/distraught mother. 
The Aboriginal elders of this community, who are genuine and decent, bring these matters to my attention all the time. They cause me a great deal of distress, which is nothing like the distress they must cause in the community. I must say that this group of elders is very critical of ATSIC—in part because of what they see as ATSIC's promotion of a housing estate on the edge of town as `their greatest success story'. This housing estate forces Aboriginal people to be fringe dwellers. It has no services and no street lighting. The street lighting was installed two years after the first houses were built, but it was such a poor system that kids were able to access the batteries and use them to start cars, which of course they did. The lighting system has not been repaired. I understand about 10 new houses were built in this housing estate at a cost of almost $10 million. The houses are basic. They have pull chain toilets, they have not been passed by the shire council and I do not believe they have achieved the certificate of occupancy. They do not have airconditioning.
Drunkenness is commonplace, as unfortunately are drugs. What is of particular concern is the fact that the drug and alcohol worker has been openly observed dealing drugs and attending drug parties and that a person employed as a youth worker has been involved in many incidents of family violence and lives with young Aboriginal girls and no other adult. Complaints to the police apparently got nowhere but simply went backwards and forwards between various New South Wales government departments. Another complaint I received concerns $50,000 in funding from the New South Wales Department of Ageing, Disability and Home Care which disappeared. DOCS were asked to call in the auditors. I think nearly a year later the auditors had not begun their investigation. 
Obviously, where you have drugs and alcohol and despair you have crime. This escalated to a level in Dareton recently where some members of the general law-abiding community took it upon themselves to take the law into their own hands. So strong was their feeling that the police were powerless to act. Accusations of vigilante squads and a general escalation of tension followed, which is something we do not need. I think the police in general do a magnificent job under extremely difficult circumstances.
I describe these incidents not to specifically address any of them but rather to give the general flavour of what life can be like from day to day in some of our remote Aboriginal communities—how different it is from the lives of most Australians, how long it has been like this and how totally unacceptable it is. May I say in strong defence of the area that I talk about that Dareton is a magnificent part of Australia. At the junction of the Murray and Darling rivers, it is an important part of the Sunraysia horticultural area, with expanding wine grape industries and tourism. There are serious efforts under way to address the problems. They will not go away overnight, but I do think a useful model is being followed.  
Most of the distress the community feels is directed towards New South Wales government departments for their lack of resources, support, intervention or understanding of what is going on. That is because the main providers of services to Aboriginal communities are state governments. That is why the COAG model is so important, and that model is the COAG community trials. COAG has agreed to work in a new way with selected Indigenous communities to significantly improve coordination across the Commonwealth and between Commonwealth and state jurisdictions. One of the eight trial sites is the Murdi Paaki area of New South Wales, headquartered in Burke, which takes in the western part of my electorate. The model is one of establishing community working parties. The Dareton Community Working Party have entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Wentworth Shire Council, which covers Wentworth, Dareton, Buronga, Gol Gol and Pooncarie. They have developed a social plan which addresses housing, drugs, youth and substance abuse and links directly with federal and state agencies to provide the resources to run the programs. 
One interesting feature of this plan is that the council will be the auspicing body. Money will actually come to the council. The council will be responsible for the record keeping and the audit trail. This type of model has been criticised by some who say, `There you are: you have a predominantly white council controlling what happens to the money, and Indigenous people lose control.' That is not what is happening here. What is happening is that they will simply be providing the administration of those funds and the audit trail. They will not be responsible for where the money goes. That will be decided by the local people. I think it is important that, when we look at new models for the future, we keep coming back to the local community and to the need to have a plan which encompasses everybody in the local community and which is not delivered from on high or from elsewhere.
I want to make reference to a recently released study by the Menzies Research Centre, by distinguished Australian Bob Beadman. The title of his paper is Do Indigenous youth have a dream? This study correctly identifies that one of the greatest challenges we face is to raise the living standards of Indigenous Australians, to get Aboriginal Australia out of the destructive cycle of welfare dependency, substance abuse and incarceration. I really do recommend this paper.
We all know that we have spent billions of dollars on the so-called Aboriginal problem over so many years and yet the problems remain. Well-intentioned policies have either had no result or resulted in the poison of welfare dependency. Some sections of our community, after a brief visit to the back country, a drive past an Aboriginal housing estate and a visit to a pub where only black people drink, return to civilisation full of the horrors that they have witnessed and speaking at length about human rights, individual rights, equal opportunity and the terrible damage that European settlement has done to the Aboriginal psyche. But what I say to this is that the reconciliation and human rights arguments are secondary to the simple rights of Aboriginal children to be looked after and to have some hope in their lives. In making policies, those who ignore the harm that people do to themselves, their children, their families and their communities are guilty of a serious wrong. 
As I said, Bob Beadman's paper is a good paper. It is not an exercise in hand wringing. It makes some serious and worthwhile suggestions. They include inventorying all jobs on a community-by-community basis and identifying whether they are being done by local recruits or others; making the point that we need to train local people, not just bring outsiders in and leave the insiders on welfare; related to this, constructing a scheme of mutual obligation testing for use in the bush so that jobs can be taken by local people, after training; and seriously examining the provision of food vouchers instead of cash. That comes back to one of his suggestions surrounding substance abuse. It is obviously quite a severe recommendation; to say that people do not have control over money that is rightfully theirs under whatever program is a serious thing to say. But he goes further. He says we need to awaken section 122 of the liquor act and move to place prohibition orders on habitual drunkards, ban advertising of alcohol products, restrict the availability of all those products being misused for inhalant purposes and give Customs sniffer dogs more work by putting them over the luggage consigned to Aboriginal communities. He has spent a lifetime in the Northern Territory and I respect his views on those things.
But I think one of the most important recommendations he makes is to tie the payment of family allowance to satisfactory school attendance. This is the heart of the matter. It is critical because truancy of Aboriginal kids from school is of epidemic proportions—and what hope do these kids have without an education? If, as a parent, you are in a second or third generation of welfare dependency and alcohol has more power over you than your love for your children, then you and the community in which you live are in trouble. Young children can only develop the skills and the discipline they need to escape from welfare dependency if they learn these skills. If they cannot learn them at home, they have to learn them at school. School is their great hope.
However, no measure better illustrates the separation and alienation of Aboriginal people than the various land rights acts which were supposed to provide secure landownership to a people who have had their land taken away from them, a people whose spirituality and very existence is tied up in the stewardship of their land. I think this is well recognised and well respected by most Australians. But the question is this: does giving land to Indigenous people make them better off? Does it alleviate their poverty and does it provide a better future for their children? If the land is a commercial asset, then maybe the answer is yes. If the new owners could sell off the part that is unproductive in order to develop the rest or if the owners could use the property as collateral for borrowings for stock, plant or other improvements, then maybe the answer is yes. But this is not the case. The land title is inalienable, and it is virtually without value.
Similar outcomes are seen with home ownership. I spoke to a constituent of mine, Nigel Gill, who was a community administrator CDEP manager in the Kimberley. He recalled that, when the houses in the community he managed ceased to be seen as an asset of the whole community, ATSIC, the government or someone else, and individual families actually took on ownership of their homes, the change was remarkable. They came and asked him for basic garden implements and brooms and they began to take pride in managing their homes.
If we look at the development of modern Western liberal democracies, the ability to own property has been a key turning point in all of the indicators of an improved standard of living. It would therefore seem that Aboriginal citizens living on their own land are now second-class citizens. Isn't that ridiculous? We need to work towards a system that encourages individual endeavour. We have had too much concentration on cooperative and community ownership. Bob Beadman's paper recommends that we encourage and facilitate home ownership on Aboriginal lands for Aboriginal people. 
While we have much to admire about the family links in Indigenous culture, they have a downside. This comes back to the obligations and responsibilities families have towards their children. Unfortunately we see too often family members—sometimes distant family members—drinking the welfare benefits of others, preventing that money from going towards buying food, clothes or school shoes. This paper suggests splitting the benefits so that they can be better directed to the individuals that need them—generally the mothers and the children.
I want to acknowledge the role of Aboriginal women in this country. They are often subjected to dreadful forms of family violence and their political contributions are ignored. The public face of Aboriginal politics is seen to be male; however, many of the most successful organisations are in fact run by women. 
The commissioners of ATSIC were a shambles. They failed entirely to express Aboriginal needs, aspirations or opinions or to facilitate any sort of debate about the ideas that they did put forward. They presided over a system that time and again rewarded men and overlooked visionary, competent women. They mismanaged and misused public funds and they behaved unlawfully, yet they were elected to the highest public office. They slighted the hardworking men and women in their own organisation and they have left a slur over Aboriginal advocacy that it does not deserve. As I have said—and I keep coming back to this—the best programs are at the community level. Our government's already established community working party program is an excellent approach.
I note that today Labor has executed a backflip on this bill, referring the legislation to a Senate committee, where presumably the idea is to bury it completely before the next election. This means that we keep paying the ATSIC commissioners beyond 30 June and that we ignore what Aboriginal people on the ground are telling us and have been telling us for some time. I will give an example from my own home town of Albury, where the Wandoo Aboriginal Corporation and its chairman, David Clark, have been battling with the local ATSIC regional council and others over the future of their CDEP, which is a nursery of native tree seedlings. Minister Andrews and I visited the facility during the recent Pollie Pedal, and he was pretty impressed with what he saw. I think David Clark's first words to the minister were: `Thank God you're getting rid of ATSIC.' From his perspective, ATSIC was acting against the interests of the local community, did not have a presence in the local community and did not listen to the local community.
There will always be different personalities and differences of opinion, and many are quite valid. There will always be different approaches to how you achieve results. All of these things exist in the mainstream as well as in Aboriginal politics, but as long as those involved do not break faith with the needs of young Aboriginal people then we can accept all this and manage it. I think there was an ongoing struggle for power between the regional ATSIC councils, which did have genuine local representatives on them, and the ATSIC commissioners, who were elected from within the ranks of the regional councils. Unfortunately, this seems to have led to a culture of vying for power, manipulating votes and competing for funds to come to an area. The competition for funds was not necessarily associated with the merits of the case presented. 
I would like to reassure people that, regardless of what Labor does about this bill, we will not change some of the things. But I do not think we will be able to change the burden on the Australian taxpayer of having to fund the ATSIC commissioners until the Senate committee has concluded its inquiry. This bill is a chance to say to Indigenous people, particularly women, children and families: `We will not break faith with the rights of your children to have a dream.' I want to leave the final comment to the paper that I have referred to quite extensively. I do again recommend that it be read by all people who are interested in this issue. It says:
The way out will require even more courage on the part of Governments and their policy advisers than ever before. The way out will involve requiring people to give something, like their labour in exchange for what their neighbour provides, under threat of their benefits being taken away. It is far easier to give than to take away, and we have seen where that got us. We will need to be more conscientious than ever before to have any hope of implementing such changes.
I hope I have assisted in pointing to some of the issues that simply must be turned on their heads. The time for fine tuning, and incremental adjustment, is over.
We must fix things for the kids.",REPS,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,2004-06-01,"—I believe it is appropriate that at the outset I acknowledge the traditional owners of the area where we are debating tonight, the Ngunnawal people. I also want to acknowledge the fact that a number of ATSIC commissioners and Indigenous people were in the gallery earlier this evening, listening to the debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004—people like Alison Anderson, amongst others. I think it certainly will be a better place when we have Indigenous people on the floor of this House as representatives rather than what has for 14 years proved to be an inadequate model—that is, having elected Indigenous representatives advising government. The quicker that happens in this place, the better.
I find it interesting that everyone now wants to attack ATSIC and use it as—if I could say this—a whipping boy for all the ills in the Indigenous community. I suppose the one good that will come out of the abolition of ATSIC—which will eventually occur because both sides of politics believe that it should be abolished—is that mainstream Australia will not have an alibi anymore for the Indigenous health and employment statistics that this country has had to put up with in recent times. For too long the perception has been that ATSIC has been responsible for health. It was for a short period of time, but those responsibilities were taken away from it under the Keating government.
One only has to go to the ATSIC report to find out what the responsibilities of ATSIC are. Indeed, a good paper was put out by the Parliamentary Library—nearly all papers from the Parliamentary Library are excellent—that was a background to the ATSIC changes and the ATSIC review. It was produced on 26 May 2003. Whilst it is a bit dated, I think it is still relevant. At page 11 it pointed out that ATSIC currently receives—or did receive—about $1.1 billion in funding from the Commonwealth government each year. There was a table that showed that the majority of money, usually around half of ATSIC's total budget, was spent on economic development programs, including Community Development Employment Projects, known as CDEP—which is Work for the Dole. Some 50 per cent of ATSIC's expenditure was on that. CDEP was an employment, training and community development program which began in 1977 and provided work and training opportunities for unemployed Indigenous people in community based and community managed activities. In June 2002 there were over 270 Indigenous community organisations and 34,182 Indigenous people participating in CDEP nationally. Participation in CDEP accounts for around 25 per cent of Indigenous employment. 
Too often we hear about how bad ATSIC was in certain areas but we do not hear the good news. When I was the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs from 1996 through to 2000, I got out and actually looked at some of these communities. I talked to the ATSIC board. CDEP was Work for the Dole before white fellas were put on Work for the Dole by this government. Aboriginal people were happy to do that because it was about self-esteem, amongst other things. 
That was a program which was working well, and it was independently audited. We have had a number of reports on and audits of  ATSIC. That is the one thing that has happened consistently throughout its 14 years. The last report by the government, involving three eminent people looking at ATSIC, cost $1.4 million and was ignored. A lot of that money came out of ATSIC's budget. It was the same thing in the case of a lot of investigations that were done into the legal services. Most of them passed the test. There is no doubt that, in recent times, there have been some problems on the board of ATSIC. There was some bickering and a whole range of other things. No prosecution was successful but it certainly did damage to the organisation—one cannot deny that. This government was pouring petrol on the fire, as it was in 1996 when it ripped $470 million out of the ATSIC budget that resulted in women's organisations and training programs for Indigenous youth having to be closed down because money was also quarantined.
Then we had ATSIS evolving recently from the government and its role and interaction with ATSIC and Mr Gibbons. Barrier after barrier was put up, because there was a war raging with certain individuals that the government had appointed. In the end, it was a situation that, in the eyes of the majority, could not continue. Labor have said that we support the abolition of ATSIC. The government jumped onto this really quickly. It was not long after that the Prime Minister came out with his policy, which was to get rid of it and mainstream it. That is not Labor's policy. Labor's policy has been announced and it is about replacing the organisation, because we do have to learn from the mistakes of the past. One of the things that the ATSIC board did submit to the ATSIC review which is worth quoting is in the preamble on page 2, which says:
Self-determination is both a right and a necessity—programs and policies imposed on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples rather than negotiated with them do not work. There has to be ownership of programs by Indigenous people. Indigenous people must participate in the design and delivery of all programs that impact on them for positive outcomes to be achieved.
In the time that I was Aboriginal affairs spokesperson for the Labor Party, the one thing that struck me was that the programs that succeeded were those with Aboriginal involvement and ownership. They were controlling their own destiny. When it came to housing projects within various communities, the most successful housing projects were those that had Indigenous people involved and properly trained. The point is that there has to be a place at the table for Aboriginal people.
Those people who think that health and education outcomes are going to improve without having Aboriginal role models or Aboriginal involvement are kidding themselves. Another thing that the Prime Minister did was to attack Abstudy. What did that do? It meant a dramatic reduction in the number of Indigenous people going into higher education. This has to be a partnership, Mr Deputy Speaker, and that is why the Labor Party, quite rightly, cannot tell you tonight what we are going to replace ATSIC with. We have said that ATSIC has to go, but it has to be replaced with something else. We have also added onto this the component of consultation, because you have to give Aboriginal people and others an opportunity to work this through and make a submission with regard to the way forward. 
The views of the former minister for Aboriginal affairs, Peter Howson, and the ways of the Prime Minister will not work. The Prime Minister has a view about mainstreaming and assimilation. It will not work. If you want to improve these outcomes, involve Aboriginal people—train and educate them. We are prepared to spend extra money on services for the bush and remote and regional Australia because it costs more to provide the same services. I do not apologise for us doing that because, if we want people out there in the bush and in harsh environments working things through, they need assistance—it is not the same as if you are living in Sydney or Melbourne.
In remote Australia, Indigenous Australians need additional assistance. Most of the ripping-off in communities has come from white fellas overcharging. Try and get fresh vegetables at a reasonable price in remote Australia!
Honourable member—Lawyers!
—The honourable member interjects about lawyers. I agree. We introduced a Native Title Act under the Keating government that was about non-confrontation and it was supposed to provide an opportunity to get rid of the lawyers. We had a raft of amendments imposed under this government—and it needed to be a work in progress—that has basically been a boon for the lawyers. I acknowledge that, but let us learn from the mistakes of the past, not repeat the mistakes of the past.
Alcohol is a problem in remote Australia for Indigenous people. Do not blame ATSIC. That is the big thing coming out of this, because there will be no whipping boy anymore with regard to the problems of Indigenous Australians. I believe that, at a national level, we have failed. The high point was the 90 per cent mandate that this national parliament got on 27 May 1967. We amended our Constitution, which is not easy to amend. We have a mandate as a national government to work for and protect Indigenous Australians, and that includes in some instances state and territory governments of both political persuasions.
In a new model there should be benchmarking of state and territory governments—stuff that was worked on by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. Senator Herron was the then minister. There are a lot of good reports gathering dust that do not reinvent the wheel. I believe that the big thing for us is to be big enough to set politics aside when it comes to Indigenous people and come up with solutions that work. All we say on this side is that there has to be the involvement of Indigenous Australians, and that is not a big ask.
This parliament, through the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, tackled a report on the Northern Territory Aboriginal land rights act, which became a unanimous report in 1999 under the chairmanship of the Hon. Lou Lieberman. It is worth quoting a couple of paragraphs of that report because to me they summarise the basic principles that we on both sides of the House should adopt. I do not take delight in the fact that health and literacy outcomes have not improved. I know that Minister Wooldridge, as he was then, put a lot of effort into a particular area and created a lot of improvement, and he deserves credit for that. This is what was in the chairman's report: 
The involvement of Aboriginal people in a number of project teams to consider the Committee's recommendations for amending the Act represents a new dynamic. The Committee trusts that it will give Aboriginal people greater ownership of the Act and a greater sense that they control their own destinies. Hopefully, it will also facilitate a more productive partnership between Aboriginal people, land councils, the Northern Territory Government and the mining industry.
So what this unanimous report said—and it was a House of Representatives committee with a majority of the government—was `Let's involve Aboriginal people in an act that has something to do with them.' That has not yet been done with this legislation, which was placed before the House and introduced on the 27th anniversary of the 1967 referendum—a bit of salt into the wound.
That is not the first time that this government has inappropriately introduced legislation in an insensitive manner. What was the unanimous recommendation of Mr Lieberman's House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs? Recommendation 1 was that:
The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 ... not be amended without:
	traditional Aboriginal owners in the Northern Territory first understanding the nature and purpose of any amendments and as a group giving their consent; and
	any Aboriginal communities or groups that may be affected having been consulted and given adequate opportunity to express their views.
And that is all we are saying in relation to a reference to a Senate committee. There has been consultation in the past. What is wrong with a bit of consultation? What is wrong with people who are affected by this legislation having a say over it? The lesson is that unless we involve them we are bound to fail. For all the goodwill in the world of the government towards Indigenous Australians, as they say they have—and you can look at that in the second reading speech—it will not succeed unless you take them with you. It is the same for non-Indigenous people. We should not be frightened of that. Why the indecent haste? The minister finished up with a quote. He said:
The time for defending the status quo and protecting vested interests at the expense of Indigenous Australians has passed.
I agree with that totally, but the question is: who is to blame? And what are we really arguing about? Is it a case of the one per cent that we are using as the excuse, because in the eyes of some there might be a few rogue commissioners or whatever, and damn the many? I can tell you that there were many commissioners—Alison Anderson, Rick Griffiths and a range of others; Steve Gordon has been there from the beginning—who have worked their guts out to deliver to their local community, yet they have been stained by others, and that is not fair.
ATSIC in many ways did good things. In my involvement with ATSIC I saw that first-hand. The thing that I find most offensive in this legislation—and it has nothing to do with the abolition of ATSIC—is the purported transfer of assets to the Commonwealth. There is indecent haste, it has been poorly thought through and, in my legal opinion, it is vulnerable to successful challenge. I know there are discussions in relation to that. I am not giving a definitive opinion, but there is total insensitivity in the way it is just expatriating assets, which were assets of Indigenous communities, across to the Commonwealth. To do it in that way is just not on. 
This bill in some respects actually goes a bit further than abolishing ATSIC. I think that one of the reasons that some of the provisions are there is that this has happened pretty quickly. It followed very quickly the announcement that the Labor Party supported the abolition of ATSIC. It is a bit more complex than that, which is another reason I believe a Senate inquiry is relevant. It is important to look at some of these other issues so that we make sure that we get it right.
I repeat: the party's position is very clear. We have made the decision that we support the abolition of ATSIC. So, in effect, I think the difference is that we believe there should be another body there, working in a different manner to how ATSIC currently operates. The government says, `No, we just want to mainstream everything.' There is a divide there, and I accept that. But there are other aspects there that are very important, that need to be looked at properly, so that wrongs are not done. I am not saying that they are being done intentionally; I understand exactly what the drafters of this legislation have sought to do in terms of the assets of ATSIC. I say that I have a real problem with that. So I commend the amendment that the Labor Party, through the honourable member for Fraser, has placed before the House, and say to all members present: it is too easy to just bash ATSIC.

"Causley, Ian, MP",NATS,2004-06-01,"—I rise to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004. I spent some time with the member for Banks on the Joint Statutory Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. I know his views, and I probably agree with some and disagree with others. I dare say that, coming from Sydney, he probably does not know the Aboriginal people as well as I do, and hopefully I can put some of that into the Hansard tonight. When my great-grandmother's family first settled the Clarence River, they lived beside an Aboriginal tribe in its native state. They got on very well. There was a very amicable relationship between the settlers and the Aboriginal tribe, and we still know them today. Five generations down, we still know those people and still get on very well with them.
I think that it is interesting to note that the Labor Party originally raised this issue of the abolition of ATSIC. Of course, when the government agreed, they seemed to find that they needed to back-pedal very quickly, and we now see that it is going to be sent off to a Senate inquiry. I think if you talk to the Aboriginal people, especially the grassroots Aboriginal people, they will agree that ATSIC did not work. It did not work for some very simple reasons.
The Aboriginal people are different. Their customs are very different from the European traditions that we have. The Aboriginal people are basically tribal groups, family groups—there never was an Aboriginal nation in Australia. I think, from memory, there were something like 320,000 different groups across the country when Europeans first came here. Their system was that those tribal groups were very supportive. It was a nomadic life, although on the coast where I come from it was probably quite different, because food was fairly available in those areas. But their system is that they look after themselves—they look after that family group. And one of the reasons that ATSIC failed, I think, was the fact that we were trying to impose upon them a system that we understood but which was not native to their belief. They did not believe in this overall system, and it was quite difficult for them to come to terms with that. 
I think the abolition of ATSIC has been supported in many ways, and many of the local Aboriginal people have supported it—for instance, the administrator of the Bundjalung Tribal Society in my electorate, Maria Bolt. In the Northern Star of 4 April this year, it is reported:
... Maria Bolt didn't shed any tears when Prime Minister John Howard axed the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC).
She has new respect for the veteran politician's courage in abolishing ATSIC which was set up to give Aboriginal people separate elected representation and said Mr Howard would get her vote at the next Federal election.
She went on to say that, within the grassroots, Aboriginal communities were not happy with ATSIC's performance, particularly that of the ATSIC leaders, and laid its failure squarely at the feet of the commissioners:
“They have done the worst job and have caused untold damage to Aboriginal people,” Ms Bolt said.
I talk very regularly with Aboriginal people in my electorate. I have a close affinity with them, and I certainly try to work as closely as I can with them. There is no doubt that, with all the good intentions at the time parliament set up ATSIC and tried to give the Aboriginal people a voice, it just did not work, and there are many reasons why, I believe.
Having said that, I applaud the fact that the Prime Minister has said that the programs will be funded and will continue. I heard the member for Banks talking about the CDEP program, which is a valuable program in the Aboriginal community. It is interesting, I think, that he was applauding CDEP. In many other areas the Labor Party opposed and criticised the government for Work for the Dole, yet this is a Work for the Dole program. It originated with Aboriginal people and it has been very successful, I believe, in many of the Aboriginal communities. It is important that we continue these programs.
While I understand that the government has to move to mainstream bureaucracies to deliver services in the short term, I would argue—and I will certainly argue within the government—that I think, in the long term, we have to get back to local groups. We have to empower local groups. One of the problems we had was the fact that, even though there were quite substantial sums of money being made available, that money did not get down to the grassroots people in some instances, for the reasons I gave earlier. If you were a part of a tribal group or a family group, you looked after that particular group; if you were outside that group, then you missed out—you did not get any support. I think that one of the failings of the system was that the money did not get down to every individual Aboriginal person. It was a particular problem. While I understand that in the short term there will have to be people appointed to advise the government and there will have to be mainstream delivery of services, in the long term we need to think very carefully about how we administer these services.
One of the failings of ATSIC was the fact that elections were voluntary. We do not have voluntary elections in our own community; we have compulsory elections. I think that one of the reasons it was felt that the ATSIC commissioners did not represent Aboriginal people was that not all Aboriginal people voted—very few of them did, in fact. I think that was a particular problem. In the long term, I would like to see the advisory body to the government elected by Aboriginal people, but there needs to be a compulsory election, so Aboriginal people can at least have their say as to who their representatives are. 
Let me talk about some of the problems within the Aboriginal community. Obviously we have failed in many of these areas. Aboriginal health has been raised on many occasions; it is appalling. If you look at the figures on the ages at which Aboriginal people die, there is no doubt that we have failed in this area. One of the problems that we really have to go back and address is diet—because it starts with diet. And it is not a problem only in Aboriginal communities; we are starting to hear about it in mainstream communities. Aborigines were hunters and gathers. They used to live off the land, and they ate a diverse diet of berries, fruit and meat. These days when you go and visit Aboriginal communities, you see that in many instances it is things like takeaway, potato chips, coca-cola and alcohol—which I will come back to. I think that most of the issues with Aboriginal health basically come down to diet. That really is a basic educational thing.
Successive governments have tried very hard to get Aboriginal children educated. We all know that, in this world, if you do not have an education you have very little chance, and it does not matter where you come from. It is extremely difficult to get Aboriginal children an education. We have had some success—it is improving, and there are many people within the Aboriginal community who are out there supporting education for their people. But we are still failing, and we have to make a greater effort to try to improve the situation with education. I disagree with the member for Banks on one particular point, because I believe that the future of Aboriginal people has to be with integration. We cannot have a separate culture, we cannot have a nomadic system anymore. That is fairly obvious. If you are going to get people into work, you need education. You need the support to get them into work, and that obviously means integration. Some of the areas that we fail in are fairly obvious at the present time.
I want to spend some time talking about the issue of women in Aboriginal culture. As I said, I grew up with Aboriginal people. I went to school with them, I played sport with them, I cut cane with them. I know them very well. I have had visits on several occasions from Aboriginal women, and they have explained to me the problems they have within their communities. Aboriginal women are the most abused, disadvantaged people in our country—there is absolutely no doubt about that—and our system completely fails them. If they go and seek help from the legal system then it fails them. Basically, it comes back to the fact that there has been a lot of publicity about deaths in custody; and we could have the debate about the number of people in jails—I think the rate probably is a little bit higher in the Aboriginal community than in the mainstream community. Our legal system seems to have adopted the attitude that it will not enforce the law with Aboriginal men when they are brought before the courts. So women are bashed, they are abused, they are raped: it is very commonplace in Aboriginal communities—yet we can do nothing about it. 
I have to say that the women in those communities are completely frustrated with the system that is leaving them to their own devices. They have no protection from the society, and it is an absolute problem. I have spoken to different ministers. I recall going to Minister Herron and I was told clearly by his adviser, who was an Aboriginal woman, that this problem was not in just my area; it was a problem across Australia.
We need to do something about that. We need to support these women. There is no point in white people going in there and telling Aboriginal people what to do. We have to work closely with those communities. We need to get Aboriginal men to understand that this situation cannot be tolerated. It is not acceptable that this behaviour continues. I dare say that that problem needs work, and it needs work with Aboriginal communities. I dare say again that we need to get back to the local group—the local mob, as they call themselves—so that we can get some support and help in that area. The funding needs to come through, and we need to have support if we are going to achieve a breakthrough. I have a great affinity with the Aboriginal people. I have known them very well, as I said. They are great sportspeople in my particular area. They know the local area very well and we learned a lot from them. My family learned a lot from them about how to manage the local area. I just cry at times about what is happening. 
We are now getting to the stage where there is division in the community, and that is not acceptable. There are areas where the overall community can see that we are giving support to the Aboriginal community and they believe we are not giving the same support to the mainstream community. It is creating divisions. I really do believe that we must take note of that and try to tackle it, because in the long term it is not in the best interests of anyone to have these divisions in the community. For instance, all too often we hear about crime—mostly things like petty theft and break and enter—that is happening in our communities. Unfortunately, the law and order issues are often targeted at Aboriginal youth, and that is causing great divisions in the community, because the community does not believe that it is being addressed. I have to say again that even the Aboriginal women are telling me that it is not being addressed.
I think that we need to look very closely at this whole area. We need to get this right. We need to look very closely at the structures that are going to be put in place. We do not need to do it from a European or Caucasian perspective. We have to think very carefully about Aboriginal culture and how they handle these things. I am not a great proponent of the idea that we should have traditional law. I think that, even though their law was a very tough law—and I know most of their laws, as I said; my family has grown up with Aboriginal people and I know most of the tribal laws—undoubtedly the young ones respected the elders. The elders administered a fairly tough law and I think that we in this day and age would not accept some of the penalties that were imposed in those tribal systems. Nevertheless, I think we have to get some strength back to the elders in the community because the elders in the community at present do not have any respect. Their respect has been undermined by our system of law. They no longer have the respect of the younger people in whom they are trying to instil the basic principles of living in a society and living together. There is no doubt in my mind that there is a lot of work to be done here. I implore the government to think very carefully about where we are going in this area.
As I have said, I have examples in my electorate of where Aboriginal people have sought loans throughout ATSIC and had good collateral but, because they did not belong to the group, they were not accepted and they did not get loans. I know of an instance where a particular Aboriginal person set up a business and was very successful in that business. He was promised funds through ATSIC to expand this business and in fact finished up not getting any funds. They walked away from it. He has them in court now over this particular issue. There is no doubt that the advice that was given to them or the decisions that were taken did not help to support Aboriginal people in their endeavours to get involved in business and do some work in that area. I have many examples of that. There is no doubt that that just shows a particular failing of ATSIC and the decisions that were taken in ATSIC. 
I would not say that the decision by the government to abolish ATSIC had nothing to do with the leadership of ATSIC. Obviously, the leadership of ATSIC was a fairly difficult problem. But I do not really believe that that is the reason ATSIC failed. I think the reason that ATSIC failed is much broader than that. I think that Aboriginal people themselves believed that it was not delivering to them the services that governments of all persuasions have tried to deliver to the Aboriginal people. I think this decision was made because it was a failure.
The Leader of the Opposition initially raised this, but I cannot come to terms with the fact that the Labor Party is now trying to play games on this and wanting a Senate inquiry. I think that, if we are going to do the right thing by Aboriginal people, we need to consult with them. I agree with the member for Banks that we need to consult very closely with Aboriginal people. We need to come up with policies that are going to give them some say in their future. We are going to have to come up with policies that deliver services to all Aboriginal people, not just some of them. I think that can happen. I am sure that is what I will be working for, and I know that a number of other members of the government will be working very closely to try and achieve this. We need to put in place something that is long term and that will deliver services to the Aboriginal people.
As I said, I am pleased to be able to contribute to this debate because I think I have some background in this area in that, as I said, I have a close association with Aboriginal people and a lot of close friends who are Aboriginal. Many of them are quite successful—very successful, in fact. There are groups in South Grafton that are very successful in the area of Aboriginal art. They are managing their affairs very well. There are groups down in the lower Clarence near Maclean and Yamba that have been very successful in the management of their own affairs. They just need to make sure that they have the empowerment, not the bureaucracy which developed in ATSIC, and that they do not lose through waste of money—which is something that has gone on in many of these areas—the finances that have been made available to the Aboriginal people.
As I said, you lose confidence in the community when you have the wasting of money by ATSIC. The general community, who are basically very sympathetic, absolutely lose faith when they see some of the excesses that go on. I am not going to say that it is the Aboriginal community alone—we see excesses in other areas as well. But the general community are critical of the effects of this particular system. I think they are looking to try and support Aboriginal people in the long term. I would ask the parliament to think very carefully about playing politics with this. I think all of us on both sides of the House need to work very closely to try and come to terms with this, make sure that we do get it right and get a system in place that will, in the long term, deliver services to Aboriginal people.",REPS,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2004-06-01,"—The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004 demonstrates the attitude and the commitment of the Howard government to Indigenous Australians. It is not legislation that has been developed in consultation with Indigenous Australians or that recognises the voice or the needs of Indigenous Australians. Rather, it is the Howard government trying to manipulate the political landscape at the expense of the most disadvantaged and disempowered people in Australia. This is not legislation that is about empowerment; it is legislation that takes away any empowerment that Indigenous Australians have managed to grab over the years. 
This government, in its mealy-mouthed, hypocritical and paternalistic way, is preparing to dispense services to Indigenous Australians in the way that it believes is appropriate—because only the Prime Minister and his band of men and women know what is best for Indigenous Australians. Only they know what will work best for Indigenous Australians and only they should be able to dole out money for the services and programs they believe are appropriate for Indigenous Australians.
This is the Howard government's approach, which is embodied in this legislation: no consultation, abolition and then telling Indigenous Australians what is best for them. Nothing demonstrates the difference between the government's and the opposition's approaches to the abolition of ATSIC more graphically than the ALP's commitment to consultation and inclusion. Yes, we support the abolition of ATSIC, but we know that if any legislation is going to work it can only be made to work when you involve the people that the legislation will affect. Whilst the ALP support the abolition of ATSIC, it is how that abolition is handled that is important. What happens next really demonstrates the difference between us on this side of the House and the government.
Labor has already consulted widely with Indigenous Australians throughout Australia and will continue to do so. I cannot emphasise strongly enough that good legislation and good government both involve consultation—a grassroots approach to government, involving the people that the legislation will affect. In no area is it more important than when a government is legislating for Indigenous Australians—Australians who are having their voice silenced by this legislation. This bill gives effect to the government's decision to abolish the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, ATSIC, by amending the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989. It concentrates much of the power that was previously held by ATSIC into the hands of the minister for Indigenous affairs and his or her delegate. The bill also makes some consequential amendments to the act. It transfers ATSIC's assets and liabilities to the Commonwealth; it establishes a new housing fund to replace the ATSIC housing fund, which is to be administered by Indigenous Business Australia; and it transfers money held in regional land funds to the Indigenous Land Corporation. It extends the function of the Indigenous Land Corporation, including empowering it to make payments to Indigenous Business Australia, which I previously mentioned. It expands the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit to undertake audits and evaluations of Indigenous programs, departments and agencies as well as the individuals and organisations that receive funding under Indigenous programs. It abolishes the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board, investing the minister for Indigenous affairs with new powers for the proposed life of the ATSIC regional councils.
It really concerns me that the minister will have so much power. There are not, to my way of thinking, appropriate checks and balances in place. The accountability involved is all directed towards Indigenous Australians. I would like to see greater accountability and greater transparency on the part of the government. The government has always demanded very high levels of accountability from Indigenous Australians and has always been highly critical of Indigenous Australians, and now it is going to take all the money and all the responsibility for delivering programs to Indigenous Australians and mainstream them. It is of great concern to many of us on this side of the House. We really worry about the long-term wellbeing of Indigenous Australians. 
Some of the other changes in this piece of legislation include the removal of the requirement for the minister for Indigenous affairs to consult with any Torres Strait Islander organisation prior to the appointment of a Torres Strait Islander to the board of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. If that is not a paternalistic approach, I have yet to find one. There will be no consultation; the minister makes the decision and Torres Strait Islanders are ignored. Another change is the removal of the requirement for the minister for the environment to inform an Indigenous representative organisation of a proposal received under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and invite some comment on the proposal.
These are changes to legislation that will affect Indigenous Australians, and their voices are being silenced. Not only has there been no consultation in the development of this legislation, but the plan is for no consultation in the future. That makes me very sad, because I really wonder where we are going as a nation in our relationship with Indigenous Australians if we cannot even respect them to the extent of giving them input into decisions and proposals that directly affect them.
Another thing that concerns me more than most is the removal of the requirement for a nominee of an Indigenous representative organisation to sit on the National Health and Medical Research Council. I, like most members of this parliament, am aware of the abysmal mortality and morbidity rates for Indigenous Australians. We are aware that their life expectancy, levels of illness and weights of their babies—every health indicator—are much worse than for the remainder of Australians. Yet no longer will it be a requirement for an Indigenous representative organisation to sit on that National Health and Medical Research Council. It is the same paternalistic approach of, `We know what's best. We'll tell you what to do. We'll dole out the dollars. We'll put them into the programs that we think are the best.'
I am really quite disappointed with the government's approach—the approach that is embodied in this legislation. The final point I would like to touch on is that this legislation also provides the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department with a new power to determine grants to native title representative bodies. It is the same old story, the same thing: you put the power in the hands of the Howard government and you have it doled out. You have decisions about money made for Indigenous Australians. They are not included or consulted; they are just told what to do.
Much of the Howard government's rationale for the abolition of ATSIC is that it is committed to `practical' reconciliation. I have often heard members on the other side of the House say it is much better than the feel-good approach of whole-of-person reconciliation. The government argues that it is its practical reconciliation approach that has delivered better outcomes for Indigenous Australians. I would argue that that is not true.
In support of my argument I would like to refer to a paper from the ANU, from the Centre for Aboriginal and Economic Policy Research. This paper is called Monitoring `practical' reconciliation: evidence from the reconciliation decade, 1991-2001. This paper outlines and evaluates the period between 1991 and 1996, which saw a focus on a whole-of-government approach, a symbolic Indigenous rights approach and a practical socioeconomic improvement reconciliation type approach. It then compares it to the period following, which is a period under the Howard government—1996 to, I think, 2001. This paper clearly demonstrates that there is no evidence that the Howard government has delivered better outcomes for Indigenous Australians than governments in the previous period did. In particular, it shows that the relative gains appear to be better in the period of 1991 to 1996 than they do for the period of 1996 to 2001. 
I will refer to a few of the key socioeconomic determinants to support what I am saying. The number of participants in the labour force is lower, relative to other groups in the community. Fewer Indigenous Australians are participating in the work force as a percentage in comparison to non-Indigenous Australians. Their health outcomes are no better—they are worse. Their education outcomes are worse, and the percentage of the population over 55, in comparison to all the other groups of Australians, is worse. Rather than the socioeconomic indicators showing that practical reconciliation has worked, they demonstrate pretty strongly that practical reconciliation has not been successful. I will refer to one particular part of the conclusion of that paper:
Practical reconciliation forms the rhetorical basis for much of the Indigenous policy initiatives of the current government. Despite the policy rhetoric of three Howard governments, there is no statistical evidence that their policies and programs are delivering better outcomes for Indigenous Australians, at the national level, than those of their predecessors.
In fact, as I have already shown, those socioeconomic indicators are worse. This is also supported by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's Social Justice Report 2003, which goes through and looks at progress in addressing Indigenous disadvantage. It looks at gross household income. The income of Indigenous people increased by 11 per cent between 1996 and 2001, in comparison to non-Indigenous Australians, whose income increased by 28.4 per cent. Employment tells a similar story, as do education and housing. The only thing that has probably increased is contact with the criminal system—during the period of the Howard government that has increased in comparison to the overall population of Australia. Life expectancy generally within Australia has increased. It has increased within the Indigenous community, but in comparison to the non-Indigenous population that increase is small.
Much of what I have referred to is fairly easily accessible. Unfortunately, the Howard government chooses to ignore it. It relies on rhetoric and its paternalistic approach to Indigenous issues. I, like many members of the opposition, have met with Indigenous leaders. The message they have given me is that they are very, very unhappy with the Howard government. They do not like its decision or approach in relation to ATSIC and they do not like its approach to dealing with Indigenous Australians and the issues that are important to them. They are not happy with its consultation process and they fear for the future.
One Indigenous Australian I spoke to who is quite active within the Indigenous community said that this is little more than blackmail. The words he used were: `It is a form of economic assimilation.' He said that it is taking away the control of his own destiny, that his individuality is being taken away. He made the point that, if the government had problems with ATSIC, why did the government not take legal action and clean up the problems rather than abolish it? He argued that there should be greater accountability for all Australians, but he felt that the accountability demanded of Indigenous Australians was much greater than that demanded of others. 
He went on to say that Indigenous Australians are encouraged to stay at school and get better qualifications. They are built up, then once they get these qualifications they are discriminated against and not treated in the same way as non-Indigenous Australians. He argued very strongly to me that the whole issue of reconciliation needs to be revisited and that changes to ATSIC should be made in consultation with the Indigenous community—they should not be made for the Indigenous community. He strongly believed and said that his family believed that what was happening was disempowering and took away local and regional initiatives. He was particularly upset with the approach of the Howard government.
Another issue that I would like to quickly address is that, with the abolition of ATSIC, $79.1 million will be saved over four years, as will the $6.8 million projected ATSIC cash balance. The government says it is going to put that money into high-priority programs. I do not have faith in this government about where that money will go. I see the government cost cutting and I see that it is going to be an exercise that will not involve the Indigenous community, just as this legislation has not involved them.
This legislation is an example of an arrogant government led by an arrogant Prime Minister that has no respect for Indigenous Australians. Until our Indigenous Australians are respected and allowed self-determination, the appalling health, employment, education, housing and other social determinants will continue to worsen. Indigenous Australians need to be included in policy and program development, not mainstreamed without being consulted.",REPS,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2004-06-01,"—When the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004 was introduced into the House by the member for Moreton, he argued:
The purpose of the bill before the House is to make major changes to the Australian government's institutional structures in Indigenous affairs in order to improve the lives of Indigenous Australians.
It would have been far more honest for the member to say that the bill is about turning the clock back and denying Indigenous Australians even a modicum of self-determination. At the heart of the bill are two significant changes which, contrary to the minister's assertions, are detrimental to Indigenous people and their aspirations. These are, firstly, to abolish a national representative voice for Indigenous peoples and have this replaced with a national Indigenous council—the council would be a non-statutory advisory body of hand-picked members, not necessarily representative of Indigenous peoples and their communities—and, secondly, hand in hand with that, to remove current programs which ATSIC and ATSIS are responsible for and to allocate them to mainstream government agencies in accordance with the government's mainstreaming philosophy and their belief that practical reconciliation is what will address the longstanding injustices and disadvantages faced by Indigenous Australians.
My opposition to the government's proposals is that, firstly, they were arrived at without any consultation or discussion with Indigenous peoples and, secondly, they fly in the face of the recommendations made by the government's own review panel—the first comprehensive external review of ATSIC since its inception in 1990. One could ask: `Why have a review, if all of its major recommendations are so easily and thoughtlessly jettisoned?' A fundamental principle is the right of Indigenous peoples to have a say and a role in any agreements between governments on proposed new models which might replace ATSIC. In the words of Patrick Dodson, who is known throughout Australia as the father of reconciliation: 
It cannot be another artificial construct foisted on us by governments deciding what is acceptable.
A starting point must surely be the right of Indigenous peoples to engage and negotiate as equal partners in a relationship based on mutual respect. This starting point is nowhere in this government's calculations. The review report of November 2003 argued that ATSIC was in need of urgent structural change. I think we all agree that change was needed. The ALP's position, as put by the shadow minister earlier in the debate, supports the proposition that change is necessary.
The review committee itself recommended a revised structural arrangement which would have given greater control of ATSIC to Indigenous people at the regional level, with the chairs of the 35 regional councils becoming the core of a reformed ATSIC. The committee argued that the existing objects of the act should be retained. At no stage did the committee recommend the abolition of a national representative voice for Indigenous peoples. In my view, the objects of the act remain a sound framework for designing new structural arrangements that are informed by the experiences of the past 14 years. The review committee's findings state quite categorically:
In the course of the review there have been many suggestions about ATSIC and the way it has evolved, with criticisms levelled at nearly all aspects of its structure, role and operation. However, the overwhelming view expressed to the panel was ATSIC should continue to operate as the national representative organisation.
Labor's policy position supports the continuation of a national representative body because we believe in the principle that Indigenous peoples have the right to drive change and shape their own futures. We want to ensure a continuing participation of Indigenous peoples in decision-making processes on matters that are so vital to them and that affect them and their communities. In the words of Lionel Quartermaine, the acting chair of ATSIC, that means:
Taking control of our own lives and our own affairs means taking ownership of the mistakes and responsibility for fixing them, as well as taking credit for achievements. We want to learn from experience and adjust accordingly.
There is no doubt that a lot has been learnt in the period since ATSIC's inception. Some of that experience has been decidedly positive, and it is of great regret that the government never talks about some of those positive achievements.
I know first-hand of the wonderful work being undertaken by Aboriginal elders and the community in the Illawarra region. One needs only to visit the Aboriginal Cultural Centre in Kenny Street, Wollongong, to feel and sense the enormous pride of the local Indigenous communities. I have seen at first hand services that are being delivered, be it through the child-care centres, the medical centre, the legal services, the promotion of Indigenous arts and crafts or the CDEP program at Windang. I pay my respect to the elders and the community for their wonderful efforts over so many years to address the concerns of the people they represent.
ATSIC is an organisation unique in the world. As well as being the elected voice of Indigenous peoples, it also has the responsibility for funding and administering many programs. The recent splitting of the elected arm from the administrative arm was not a new suggestion. I can remember sometime ago that the then chair, Lowitja O'Donoghue, in fact raised this proposal, but it took until 2003 for the government to give it legislative effect. The separation of representative functions from decision making on funding has widespread support, not least because it provides the means of avoiding any possibility of conflict of interest. 
Similarly, one needs to appreciate that from the beginning a fundamental dilemma inherent in the original ATSIC proposal was the imposition of a Western political and administrative model, alien to Indigenous family, clan and community structures. In commenting on the environment in which ATSIC and other organisations have operated, the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research said:
These organisations are extremely new, having only emerged in the last 30 years, as ways of delivering government-funded services to Indigenous communities. They are also extremely complex `hybrid' organisations which have to try and balance and mediate Indigenous social norms of personal reciprocity and support with more impersonal bureaucratic norms emanating from the government funding context.
Having learnt from the experiences of ATSIC, the need for structural change is obvious. It is however important to restate that there must continue to be a national representative voice for Indigenous peoples and that the nature of that body and the model to be followed must be a matter for negotiation and engagement with Indigenous peoples.
It is of much regret that the review panel, in reaffirming the objects of the original act, now see this bill jettisoning many of those fundamental objectives that were enunciated when ATSIC was first created. To remove ATSIC and replace it with a hand-picked, non-statutory advisory council is counter to the principles and objects of the original legislation, which had at its core the need to ensure maximum participation of Indigenous peoples in the formulation and implementation of government policies that affect them.
I want to just touch on this issue of self-determination, because I know this government has the view that it is not interested in engaging in what it crudely describes as `symbolic matters' to do with reconciliation, and the emphasis has to be, as it argues, on practical measures. I do not think either is mutually exclusive. I found this quote from the Murdi Paaki Regional Council, which I think expresses very simply and cogently what Aboriginal communities mean by the notion of self-determination. Their submission to the review committee said:
Appropriate structures for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be based on ensuring we have the capacity and support to manage our own affairs and control our own development.
...	...	...
We see improved governance arrangements as central to achieving our goals. Through them, we are aiming to improve our living standards and quality of life and give us social justice. It involves empowering our communities to make their own decisions and ensuring accountability to us of the way services are delivered and their outcomes.
I think the aspirations expressed in that statement would have widespread support in communities across the nation but have little, if any, expression in the proposals contained in the government's bill.
I now want to turn to the issue of Indigenous disadvantage, funding arrangements and the mainstreaming of programs for which ATSIC and ATSIS are responsible. The government rightly argues that the rate of progress in eradicating entrenched disadvantage is not good enough. I think anybody who follows the debate would agree with that sentiment; that is not controversial. What is controversial is the government's abrogation of responsibility, for I believe the rate of progress—and the lack of it in many areas—is a collective responsibility and a collective failure that absolves nobody from the equation.  
The perpetuating disadvantages endured by Indigenous peoples have been the subject of many reports, and I do not want to cite all those reports tonight. They are well known to people who follow the debate. One need only look at the recent reports by the Social Justice Commissioner and the Commonwealth Grants Commission. What I do find interesting is that it is only in recent years that there has been any analysis of government responsibilities at all levels. 
The Grants Commission report in 2001 examined the delivery of programs and services and made a number of significant observations which pointed to: systemic and government failures, including cost shifting; the obscuring of responsibilities between different levels of government; the fact that funding was generally not allocated on the basis of need, except in housing and infrastructure; and the fact that links between funding and outcomes were not direct or strong enough. However, in reading the minister's second reading speech, one gets the feeling that all the blame somehow rests with ATSIC, which he describes as `Labor's failed experiment'. 
The review panel took up the issue of the public perception and debate about just who is responsible for the lack of progress in dealing with Indigenous disadvantage. I want to quote a number of the findings of that report, as a number of misconceptions need to be nailed in this debate. The first point I want to make is that from the beginning ATSIC was intended to be a supplementary funding body and was never intended or funded to be the provider of all programs and services to Indigenous peoples. In 2001-02 its budget was approximately $1.1 billion, less than half of the government's allocation for Indigenous-specific programs. Its two largest programs—CDEP and the housing and infrastructure program—together account for about two-thirds of ATSIC's budget. The creation of ATSIC did not absolve mainstream agencies from their responsibility to meet their obligations to Australia's Indigenous citizens. Primary health care, for example, was transferred and mainstreamed in 1995. I must say that the reports show that the outcomes in that mainstream service still leave a lot to be desired, even though this was mainstreamed some eight years ago. The review committee rightly pointed out:
This mix of funding and program delivery is often confused, illogical, not effectively coordinated, blurs responsibility, creates duplication and produces sub-optimal outcomes.
Taking all of that into account, the ATSIC review came to the right conclusions, which were:
The hopes pinned on the organisation—
 Namely, ATSIC—
—that it could and would effect instant change were not realistic.
The Review Panel also believes that mainstream Commonwealth and State Government agencies from time to time have used the existence of ATSIC to avoid or minimise their responsibilities ... Because public blame for perceived failures has largely focused, fairly or unfairly, on  the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, those mainstream agencies, their Ministers and Governments have avoided responsibility for their own shortcomings.
So the solution for the eradication of entrenched disadvantage in my view will require much more than the simplistic response that we see in this bill—that is, move everything from ATSIC, eliminate the notion of self-determination, hand it all over to mainstream agencies and somehow this will achieve the results we all want to see. What the government does not say is that up until the last couple of years there was little if any coordination of government programs, nor were there benchmarks or performance monitoring so that we could assess the progress, or lack of it, that was being made in so many areas of disadvantage being suffered by Indigenous peoples. In fact, as I said earlier, progress to date in important areas like health and education, which are mainstreamed, has left a lot to be desired. So I do not believe mainstreaming is the solution that will produce the outcomes that we all want for our Indigenous peoples. The review committee argued against the mainstreaming option because as they said in their report: 
... there was no persuasive evidence that the programs would be delivered more effectively by any other agency.
As a former member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation I welcome the belated fact that a national coordinating framework is now being set in place by COAG agreement. This will help our country establish meaningful targets, benchmarks and performance monitoring strategies to address the endemic problems that confront so many of our Indigenous peoples and their communities. There are eight trials of this whole-of-government approach to service deliveries now in place in partnership with and with the cooperation of Indigenous communities. Much will be learnt from these trials. Hopefully, too, the work of the Grants Commission and the Productivity Commission—and their cooperation with the Indigenous communities—will provide us with a better index for determining relative needs of Indigenous communities.
The way forward in attacking endemic disadvantage is not to have this phoney debate about practical versus symbolic reconciliation, as this government likes to have, but to recognise that, if we want to produce positive outcomes, we have to develop models that place regional Indigenous governance in a direct relationship with governments and agencies—that is, the local communities participate in decisions on the delivery of services that they believe are essential for the wellbeing of the people of their communities. You cannot do it on your own. A mainstreaming option that denies Aboriginal communities the rights of self-determination and involvement will only lead to failure. We moved away from the mainstream assimilationist model many decades ago, and it is regrettable that the tenor of the debate on this bill is indicating that government members see that as some form of viable solution into the future. 
I think there has been significant progress made in coming to an understanding that we all have a collective responsibility for the failures of the past and that the collective way forward is to ensure that all levels of government stop passing the buck, accept their responsibilities, have their performance measured against agreed objective standards, stop cost shifting and stop blaming ATSIC and Indigenous communities for the failures to break through and achieve significant progress in all the areas of endemic and entrenched disadvantage. In conclusion I want to say that I commend the amendment moved by my colleague the member for Fraser and urge the support of the House for our alternatives to the government's ill-conceived bill.",REPS,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Organ, Michael, MP",AG,2004-06-01,"—This is a sad day indeed for the Indigenous people of this nation, for we are here to debate the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004, which implements the government's unwarranted decision to abolish ATSIC, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission—a decision which has unfortunately received the support of the opposition. This bill is a national disgrace, for the abolition of ATSIC and the current push to mainstream its programs is nothing less than a return to the bad old days of assimilation, a further `white-out' of Aboriginal society and civilisation. I welcome the opportunity to outline why I say this, for Aboriginal issues are rarely discussed or debated in this place—at least, they have not been dealt with to any substantial degree since I was elected some 20 months ago. 
This bill repeals the provisions in the ATSIC Act which establish the national board of ATSIC. It will take effect from 1 July 2004. The bill aims to repeal part 2 of the ATSIC Act. That part provides for the establishment of ATSIC and its functions, constitution, administration and operation. The bill makes consequential amendments to the ATSIC Act arising from the abolition of ATSIC. These include the transfer of ATSIC's assets and liabilities to other agencies and the establishment of a new housing fund to be administered by Indigenous Business Australia to replace ATSIC's housing fund. The bill also modifies the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit to take into account the abolition of ATSIC. The government's decision provides for the retention of ATSIC's regional councils only until 30 June 2005 and for their abolition after that date. The government has argued that $79 million in savings will arise over four years from the abolition of ATSIC and the regional councils and that these savings will be reallocated to Indigenous-specific programs. 
This is a regressive piece of legislation. It has been introduced to scrap Australia's major Indigenous representative body, with no immediate plans to appoint a replacement. It is clear that this government does not believe that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have a right to control their own affairs. This has all occurred amid strong criticism and protest from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their supporters. Aboriginal leaders have claimed that the changeover is a shambles.
To make matters worse, on the 37th anniversary of the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on 27 May 1967, the government moved to take away a body which was established to attempt to assist in the process of self-determination. It is clear that this government does not believe that the Indigenous people of this nation—the original owners—have a right to self-determination. It does not believe in empowerment of Indigenous Australians; it believes in their marginalisation. It means that it sees nothing wrong in our history—in the massacres, the taking away of the children, the racist slurs, the dispossession, the denigration, the destruction of cultural heritage, the disempowerment. It means that the government is blind to all of this.
It means that they wish to sweep aside the overwhelming issues faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people today, issues which the government are clearly not up to facing. It means that, in their most devastating blow to Aboriginal self-determination since coming to power in 1996, this government have undermined the ongoing fight by the Aboriginal people of this country to determine their own affairs. This is a right which this parliament should be supporting, not undermining or removing. Surely the symbolism of this government acting to abolish ATSIC on the anniversary of non-Indigenous recognition of Aboriginal people in our Constitution is lost on no-one. This is a nasty government and another nasty piece of legislation.
The problems with ATSIC were fixable. They were not purely of the making of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; they were largely inherent in the system, a system which fails to show due respect to the culture and civilisation of the first Australians. The government just does not get it. The Prime Minister obviously does not understand Aboriginal society and culture either—this is perhaps `a hopeless quest', as the member for Lingiari suggested. Some members of the government do get it, I suppose, to a degree. I note the considered words of the member for Page and his rejection of across-the-board mainstreaming, pointing out that we need to `empower local groups'. I could not agree more. But the member for Page also rejected the adoption of traditional law. 
The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has announced that she will establish a government-appointed national Indigenous advisory council by the end of the year. Why? Is this what the Aboriginal people want? No. Acting ATSIC Chairman Lionel Quartermaine was scathing of coalition and Labor support for the abolition of ATSIC. Aboriginal leader Alison Anderson warned that anyone who joined the government's new advisory body would be `absolutely crucified by the black nation'. Aboriginal people in my own electorate of Cunningham have said to me that they once again feel let down by this government—and understandably so. As Patrick Dodson so eloquently stated in the inaugural National Reconciliation Week address delivered in the Great Hall of Parliament House on 25 May:
Too often, governments have chosen to pursue the path of denial, to continue to ignore our interests and our rights as citizens; chosen not to heal the wounds of division and discord. The powerbrokers and politicians chose confrontation over negotiation, legislation over compromise, and litigation over mediation.
Now government seeks to remove the one small formal voice of indigenous people from the table of our national discussion, on the basis that it was failing the indigenous people in terms of service delivery, advocacy and advancement of our place in the society. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission was created by government to give indigenous people a national and regional voice. We are now in the position where this voice is to be removed, on a whim, in a fit of pique, and without any discussion or negotiation with indigenous Australians. And without a vision for any alternatives.
...	...	...
For 200 years, indigenous people have been living in a time of cultural drought where the sustaining of our language, law and culture under conditions of social stress caused us enormous damage. But, like the land from which we come, we have survived ...
I was in the audience to hear Mr Dodson speak that night. I was saddened by his words, which rang so true, and was once again ashamed of the actions of this parliament and politicians with regard to our native peoples. We fail to go to the core of the problem, we fail to listen to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia and we fail to see.
Indigenous Australians die, on average, 20 years younger than non-Indigenous Australians, and the gap is widening. In a speech he delivered at the Sydney Opera House on National Sorry Day this year, former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser pointed out:
... health experts say that an extra $300 million a year spent in Aboriginal health would reduce the death rate by 30% within a decade. Neither Labor nor Coalition Governments have been prepared to commit these resources. Yet we have just had a Federal Budget twhich gave several billion dollars to middle-class and wealthy Australians.
...	...	...
Both—
the main parties—
say they will abolish ATSIC, but neither seems to have any idea what they will replace it with, if anything.
And there is the rub. The decision by the Leader of the Opposition to jump right in and support the Prime Minister's move to abolish ATSIC bodes ill, I think, for the Aboriginal people of this country if the ALP should happen to win government at the next election. This decision is a real setback. The Aboriginal people must now turn to parties such as the Greens to support them in their fight for self-determination. And they can rely on us for that support. 
Madam Deputy Speaker Gambaro, it was fascinating and painful to read the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission submission to last year's ATSIC review. I would like to draw your attention to some of the important points that were made and subsequently ignored by this government. They clearly outline, in unambiguous terms, the position of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people—a position the government should perhaps listen to one day. The submission opened with the following:
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, as the original owners and occupiers of this land and its seas, never relinquished the rights and responsibilities that go with being the owners and custodians of the land even though colonisation resulted in the dispossession of much of our lands, territories and waters. The rights of Indigenous peoples to autonomy, self-determination, and informed consent in respect of activities on Indigenous land have long been recognised by international law. These rights are protected by UN human rights treaties. ATSIC supports the protection of Indigenous rights set forth in the UN Draft Declaration on Indigenous Rights.
Self-determination is both a right and a necessity—programs and policies imposed on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples rather than negotiated with them do not work. There has to be ownership of programs by Indigenous people. Indigenous people must participate in the design and delivery of all programs that impact on them for positive outcomes to be achieved.
In addition to the expropriation of the land and seas, successive colonial, State and Territory and Commonwealth Governments over the last two centuries have destroyed or disrupted existing forms of governance and the knowledge systems that underpin them. These systems of knowledge, laws and governance evolved over thousands of years, providing Australia's first nations with sustainable communities able to manage their own lives and destinies. In their place successive governments have imposed forms of governance that are alien to the traditions and social organization of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and that have never provided the opportunity to ensure our communities are able to grow and develop on a healthy and sustainable basis.
While for some, the principal vehicle at a national level for self-determination is ATSIC, neither the original legislation nor subsequent amendments in fact mention this concept and therefore ATSIC has fallen well short of the expectations and hopes of others. While the concept of self-determination itself was never embraced formally in the legislation, the legislation provides a platform upon which to build an organisation that could lead to an appropriate form of self-determination for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples—a basis which all Australians might one day accept as a starting point to building a truly inclusive Australian identity. This is indicated in the Preamble to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 1989 (the ATSIC Act). The Preamble refers to the aims of self-management and self-sufficiency and notes that it is “appropriate to establish structures to represent Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to ensure maximum participation in the formulation and implementation of programs and to provide them with an effective voice within the Australian Government”.
Despite its shortcomings the current legislation establishes a unique organisation. ATSIC is not simply another agency, expendable with changing circumstances. This does not mean that ATSIC is, or should be, immune from change. However, it is essential that any changes to ATSIC promote its current role and ideally enhance the opportunity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to enjoy and express our right to self-determination.
Given the significance of ATSIC, changes must be very carefully considered. They certainly must be fully negotiated. Anything less would mean falling short of Australia's responsibilities to respect the human rights of its Indigenous citizens, would further increase the risk of adopting inappropriate approaches to the delivery of public policies, programs and services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and would reduce the chance for building a truly inclusive Australia. 
That says it all: self-determination, empowerment, rights and respect.
ATSIC emphasised the need for careful and constructive deliberations in respect of change, and the need to consult widely and negotiate fully. This was not done. The primary objective, the submission stated, must be to enhance the social, economic and cultural rights of Indigenous people in the context of self-determination and full and equal partnership. This is clearly not what this government has chosen to deliver with this bill. Indeed, I do not believe that the government was ever committed to dealing honestly and fairly with this review. The continuing existence of a relatively independent body such as ATSIC was obviously at odds with the philosophy of this government, which repeatedly fails to acknowledge the significance of Aboriginal society and culture in this land. Whether it is based on racism, self-interest or just plain ignorance, at the end of the day it has the same result.
Indeed, the outcome of the extensive review specifically warned against the path that this government has chosen to follow via this bill. The government has done this despite the fact that the review panel undertook two major rounds of public consultation, visiting state and territory capitals and a number of regional centres and meeting with all 35 ATSIC regional councils. The panel also met with the ATSIC board, the women's advisory committee, the Torres Strait Regional Authority and the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board. The panel considered the abolition of ATSIC, with all its activities being devolved to relevant mainstream agencies. Importantly, the review panel specifically stated that it was not supportive of this abolition option.
The first rally in Australia in support of ATSIC, after the government's announcement of its proposed abolition, was held in my electorate of Cunningham on Thursday, 29 April 2004. The speakers at the Wollongong rally included: Aunty Mary Davis, ATSIC regional representative and Director of the Illawarra Aboriginal Corporation; Stan Jarrett, coordinator of Aboriginal client service specialists at New South Wales Local Court; Chris Foley, current ATSIC commissioner; Fred Moore, retired miner and social justice activist; and Col Markham, former New South Wales Parliamentary Secretary for Aboriginal Affairs. The MC was Richard Davis, with music by Aunty Betty Little.
This formidable group passionately outlined to a large audience why such pre-election announcements by both sides of parliament were disingenuous and sought to play on complaints of maladministration rather than seek solutions for ensuring better use of funding in the future. Speakers highlighted the hypocrisy present in our society at the moment. They rightly pointed out that improper behaviour by a parliamentarian does not result in the abolition of that institution but rather that strategies are put in place to ensure future best practice and honesty. It should likewise be the case with ATSIC.
Speakers outlined the hardships facing Indigenous Australians and called for genuine commitments to fund health, education and welfare improvements within Aboriginal communities. There was no dispute that what is urgently needed is increased funding for grassroots organisations such as the Illawarra Aboriginal Corporation and other bodies that provide valuable community and welfare services. For example, there was widespread support for our local CDEP program. Many Aboriginal communities and individuals throughout Australia and in my electorate of Cunningham face great social disadvantage and are not appropriately consulted on issues affecting their lives, thereby making the abolition of ATSIC a decidedly negative step when development and further financial and social investment are what is needed. The gathering applauded the sentiment that this was simply the beginning of a campaign for social justice for Indigenous Australians. 
The Greens call on the government to immediately open a dialogue with Aboriginal people and allow them to determine their own future. As we have seen, Aboriginal people in this country have been governing themselves for thousands and thousands of years—more than 40,000 years, in fact. They have in place traditional structures and means of governance. Why do we then, as a nation, continue to ignore them? Why do we, in our arrogance, continue to belittle Aboriginal traditions and culture? We think we have all the answers, but our involvement in places such as Iraq reveals that we clearly do not. I call on the government and opposition to work with Aboriginal people in finding the best way forward for this country.
Aboriginal self-determination—a term that I have used a lot during this speech—is based on Aboriginal governance and empowerment. This is an area in which we, non-Indigenous Australians, are clearly not the experts. I often despair at our stupidity and ignorance in this regard. After 216 years, we appear to have learnt very little. Our invasion and occupation have left the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this nation sick, dispossessed, disempowered, disillusioned and dying. This bill does nothing to address these issues. Until governments in this country at all levels—local, state and federal—commit to true self-determination and recognition of the rights of Indigenous people, I cannot see any change forthcoming. In fact, we seem to be going backwards. And that is the feeling out there in the community—that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community are going backwards.
I am very disappointed by the opposition's stand on this matter. I have to ask myself why the opposition is not opposing this bill in this place, the people's house. Why isn't the passion and knowledge of the member for Lingiari, for example, reflected in the ALP's action? The member for Fraser has told us that the ALP will not allow this bill to pass until it has received very serious consideration in the Senate. Frankly, that is just a cop-out. History will show that the opposition did not oppose the abolition of ATSIC in this place. That is sending a clear message to the community, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and the Greens will not be party to this. Our position is clear. We support Aboriginal self-determination. It is a disgrace that the major parties do not. I therefore cannot support this bill.",REPS,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Hoare, Kelly, MP",ALP,2004-06-01,"—At the outset, I would like to acknowledge that, whenever we meet in this place, we are meeting on Ngunnawal land, and I would like to pay my respects to the elders of this country. As the Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I would also like to convey my condolences to the family of Mr Djerrkura, who passed away last week during Reconciliation Week. In doing that, I would like to refer to Mr Djerrkura's last public address at the launch of the book This Country: A Reconciled Republic? by Mark McKenna. Mr Djerrkura said at that time that ATSIC had its flaws but deserved better than execution by prime ministerial decree. He said:
As we have so often heard, the Federal Government is the champion of “practical reconciliation”. As a senior elder of the Wangurri people in the East Arnhemland/Yirrkala Aboriginal community, I live every day understanding the extremely urgent needs of Aboriginal people. But I also understand the importance of symbolism.  
Symbolism matters because it is a reference point for all Australians. The symbols of our nation embody our ideals. They speak to us and to other nations of our identity and beliefs.
Symbols can also be a sign of change, a beacon of hope and a declaration of intent. When they reflect our aspirations, they are empowering.
At the same address, he also said:
The Prime Minister has long refused to accept the fundamental difference of Aboriginal people in our community. He was never sympathetic to the principles on which ATSIC was based and founded. He has always rejected any suggestion of indigenous autonomy and self-determination.
Those sentiments are exactly what we see reflected in this bill before us this evening.
In our history it has always been Labor which has proposed every initiative to advance Indigenous Australia, most notably land rights for Indigenous Australians—under both the Whitlam and the Hawke governments—and the Racial Discrimination Act. Labor's amendments include condemnation of the government for failing to consult, negotiate or discuss with Aboriginal Australians the provisions in this bill. This lack of discussion and consultation stands in stark contrast to wide-ranging discussions which were undertaken by Minister Gerry Hand prior to the establishment of ATSIC. To emphasise this point I refer to the then minister's second reading speech. In introducing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill back in 1988, Gerry Hand said:
Today, 21 years after the 1967 referendum which gave the Commonwealth the power to legislate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, I present legislation which, for the first time, will ensure the place of the indigenous peoples of this country in the decision-making processes of government.
That is the very place that this government is trying to rip away from Indigenous Australians. He went on to say:
It would also mean their own elected representative, one of their own people, would be part of a commission which would have the power to formulate and implement policies for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.
In referring to discussions and negotiations, Gerry Hand at that time referred to a meeting in `far away Wingellina' as being `just one of hundreds of meetings around the country held to discuss this new proposal'. This was prior to the Labor government establishing ATSIC. He said:
... this legislation is the product of a great deal of consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.
... more than 21,000 copies of my parliamentary statement, Foundations of the Future, and 1,000 copies of a video were distributed to more than 1,000 separate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and communities throughout Australia. In the order of 537 preliminary meetings were held involving some 14,500 people to discuss the proposals outlined in Foundations prior to my meetings with communities and organisations.
He said that between January and March of 1988:
... I personally visited and spoke with some 6,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representatives at 46 separate meetings. Subsequently, an options paper was prepared which identified a range of alternative proposals based on suggestions and recommendations received as a consequence of my consultations with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That paper was widely circulated and was discussed at another 88 meetings involving some 2,700 people.
That is what discussion, negotiation and consultation with Aboriginal people should involve. That is what Labor is committed to—a wide ranging discussion with the communities about the kind of elected representation that Aboriginal people wish to have, the kind of service delivery that they expect from government, and how those services would be delivered in their own communities for their benefit. 
Labor's position in relation to ATSIC has been very clear and widely accepted by Indigenous Australians. On 30 March 2004 Mark Latham released Labor's new framework statement on Indigenous self-governance and program delivery. Two weeks later the Prime Minister and the minister announced that the government would eliminate Indigenous Australians' input into policy and programs by abolishing ATSIC and mainstreaming all Indigenous programs. Unlike the Howard government, Labor is committed to self-determination for Indigenous Australians. We believe that Indigenous Australians have a right to determine who speaks for them and a right to inform the development of programs delivered to their communities. Labor will create a new directly elected national Indigenous body that will support directly elected Indigenous regional bodies that will have key responsibility for program development and delivery at the regional level.
In the past month Senator Kerry O'Brien, the shadow minister for reconciliation and Indigenous affairs, has been travelling around the country, meeting Indigenous leaders and communities and talking about Labor's plan. Kerry has also written to elected ATSIC representatives and peak Indigenous organisations, inviting comment. I have also written to and met with many Indigenous organisations in my electorate, and I am sure all my colleagues on this side of the House have. As I stated, that is what genuine consultation, genuine discussion and engagement are all about.
The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill, as proposed, is totally inadequate in that it fails to acknowledge the accepted right of Aboriginal people to self-determination, as enshrined in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989. The bill, as proposed, has obviously been prepared hastily with little thought to the consequences of the amendments and, it seems, more with an eye to implementing the Howard government's strategy of cultural assimilation.
The principal change throughout is a semantic one that replaces references to the ATSIC Board of Commissioners with the words `Minister' or `Secretary of the Department'. Significantly, it contains no proposal for an alternative structure for elected representation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, which is Labor's policy. Apart from the glaring problem that the ideology of the bill represents, it also contains some highly dubious propositions as to the administration of programs currently administered by ATSIC or ATSIS, the Howard government's executive agency that is currently subject to a High Court legal challenge by the commissioners. These include the proposed changes to the Aboriginal home loan program, the Indigenous Land Fund and Indigenous Business Australia. What the proposed amendments do is move the housing fund to operate within Indigenous Business Australia and rename it the New Housing Fund.
The concern is that given the commercial imperatives of the IBA, as distinct from the non-commercial imperatives of the board of commission, under which the housing fund presently functions, there will be pressure to increase grants to commercial lenders and reduce those to individual Aboriginal community organisations. The point is that without the oversight of the board of commissioners and, down the track, without the regional councils in place, schemes like the housing loan program, in the hands of mainstream agencies, will lose their Indigenous-specific tailoring. There is also a risk of large slush funds of money sitting in the coffers of large commercial lenders. This risk is quite real. 
I would like to talk about some good news stories, some good programs—some good work—that have been occurring under the ATSIC model in my region. In my area we have the Yarnteen Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Corporation. Yarnteen was established in 1991 in Newcastle, and it has both social and economic objectives, including improving social wellbeing, building capacity within Indigenous communities, sharing information and encouraging strong, ethical leadership. It also has an objective of sustainable economic self-sufficiency to encourage greater Indigenous participation in the broader economy through Indigenous-owned enterprises and self-employment.
Some significant achievements of Yarnteen include the Yarnteen CDEP, which is one of the largest CDEPs in New South Wales. It has been successful in providing mainstream employment opportunities for the participants and, through its group training company, it has placed over 200 participants into traineeships and apprenticeships over the past four years. Another achievement is Port Hunter Commodities. This is a wholly owned subsidiary company of Yarnteen and is a modern, up-to-date bulk warehousing and commodity-bagging enterprise located within the Port of Newcastle area. In 2000, Port Hunter Commodities was awarded a National Quarantine Award for excellence in plant quarantine. It has a small business assistance and incubation program, which has helped several Indigenous small businesses to get established and has continued to support them.
We have the Yamuloong Resource Centre, which is located in my electorate. Yamuloong means coming together. This community resource centre was established to provide a facility for training, cultural awareness, conferencing and education. Yamuloong has 10 full-time employees, of whom nine are Indigenous. Yamuloong has achieved numerous awards, including in 2003 the NSW Tourism Indigenous Business of the Year and the Many Rivers ATSI Council Awards—the Community Service, Small Business and overall Community Achievement Award.
Yarnteen also runs the Indigital Access Strategy, an information and communication technology strategy for Indigenous communities aimed at bridging the digital divide. Yarnteen has established a cultural camp on 100 acres in the Wollombi-Broke area. The cultural camp is utilised by many educational groups for cultural education purposes and by sporting and recreational groups. Individual members of Yarnteen have reached the highest positions in Indigenous affairs in Australia.
Yarnteen has been held up as a model and benchmark for Indigenous community and enterprise development. The success of Yarnteen has been attributed to the vision, stability, cohesiveness and cooperation that it has been able to generate from all sectors of the Indigenous and wider community. Yarnteen has advocated the way forward for Aboriginal people and continues to place a great emphasis on economic empowerment of the individual and family and the consequential development of the means for financial independence at this level. Yarnteen states that it must empower family units and youth to enable them to participate in education, employment and business development opportunities and to have the choices to make informed decisions.
Yarnteen would not exist today if it were not for ATSIC. Yarnteen is one of the many success stories—which far outweigh the bad news stories that this government would have you believe—right across this country. Leading in these successes is Sean Gordon, a young, dynamic Aboriginal leader—I thought he might be here; he is somewhere in the parliament this evening—with a strong, supportive and active family background. Sean is the CEO of Yamuloong Resource Centre. Also with him, leading in these successes, is the Indigenous businesswoman Leah Armstrong, who is the general manager of Yarnteen Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Corporation. Leah is also chair of the NSW Aboriginal Business Roundtable, which was established in 2002 to foster partnerships between Aboriginal communities and enterprises and the private sector and to advance Indigenous economic development and job creation. I applaud the work that Sean and Leah have done in our community. There are many others with them. Jim Wright is another one who comes to mind straightaway. 
There are many great people working in our communities for the advancement of Aboriginal people, to rectify some of the disadvantage that Indigenous people experience. These are the people who are being told by this government that they are failures. They are not failures. This government has failed Aboriginal people, and this particular piece of legislation is no way to address the failings of this government. The only way that those failings can be addressed by government is for a Latham Labor government to be elected.
Our region also has its problems. I am currently working with Beverley Dargin OAM, a Many Rivers councillor representing my home town of Toronto, on finding solutions to problems in the local rental market for Indigenous people. Beverley initiated this process in a letter to me in November 2003. She said:
I am writing to tell you of the difficulties Aboriginal people experience in acquiring homes to rent in Toronto. As you may know, it is effectively impossible for an Aboriginal person to rent privately in the Westlakes area. We have demonstrated this many, many times. Racial discrimination may be silent and hidden but it is nonetheless real.
...	...	...
Even tenants with a perfect rental history (such as April and Mark, married with two children and living and paying rent for the past 2 years in a one bedroom flat) cannot move on to larger premises. It is utterly disheartening and discouraging.
She said:
Kelly, I ask you to do some creative imagining. I ask you to imagine what it would be like to be black and to be in need of a home and have to face thirty humiliations ... before being considered as a potential candidate to rent a home. Would you give up or would you stick it out? Would you, as a confident, professional person have the moral strength to be dragged through the manure pit thirty times as a precondition to being considered worthy to being placed on a list to maybe sometime in the future getting a home to rent when you had no alternative in the private rental market and the 3 bedroom house you were living in with 15 to 27 other Kooris ...
No, Beverley, I cannot imagine that I would be able to put myself through that process. I do not think any Australian should have to. She says:
Kelly, I know you are a caring person. I know you have a good heart and you have a heart to help Aboriginal people. I ask for your help. We need to solve the problem of Aboriginal homelessness and overcrowding that is caused by cruel and heartless racism.
This is happening right across our country. We are talking about a regional urban area—Lake Macquarie, just south of Newcastle on the west side of the lake. Beverley and I are hosting a housing forum in July this year, where we will invite the real estate agents, the chambers of commerce and the Real Estate Institute to come along and hear first-hand what their policies and their actions put everyday Australians through. 
Notwithstanding any government programs, there is continuing and unacceptable disadvantage in Aboriginal Australia. This disadvantage continues to be highlighted—most recently in the report of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner of 2003. I know that a few of these statistics have already been referred to in this debate, but I will quote them again. In 2001 the gross household income for Indigenous people was 62 per cent of the rate for non-Indigenous Australians; 54 per cent of Indigenous people of working age were participating in the labour force compared with 73 per cent of non-Indigenous people; the unemployment rate for Indigenous people was 20 per cent—three times the rate for non-Indigenous Australians; 18 per cent of all Indigenous people in employment worked on a CDEP scheme; 69 per cent of Indigenous students progressed from year 10 compared with 90 per cent of non-Indigenous students; 63 per cent of Indigenous households were renting compared with 27 per cent of non-Indigenous households; Indigenous people have also consistently constituted 20 per cent of the total prison population; Indigenous people are imprisoned at 16 times the rate of non-Indigenous people; and Indigenous women are imprisoned at more than 19 times the rate of non-Indigenous women. These statistics go on and they speak for themselves.
In conclusion, I want to quote the father of reconciliation, Pat Dodson. In his ANU reconciliation speech in the Great Hall of Parliament House last week, he said:
ATSIC was created by government so as to give indigenous people a national and regional voice.
We are now in a position where this voice is to be removed, on a whim, in a fit of pique, and without any discussion, consultation or negotiation with indigenous Australians. And without any vision for alternatives.
(Time expired)",REPS,<title>ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Lawrence, Dr Carmen, MP",ALP,2004-06-01,"—The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2004 should carry a title that more accurately reflects its genesis. It should be called `Howard's Revenge.' It is a crude payback for the humiliation the Prime Minister believes he suffered when members of the Indigenous community took him to task at Corroboree 2000 for his refusal to apologise for the stolen generations, for the Wik legislation which neutered native title, and for his refusal to acknowledge the unique position of Indigenous Australians who were dispossessed of their ownership of this land.
Corroboree 2000, celebrating reconciliation, was meant to be a great national occasion to begin the process of acknowledging and redressing past wrongs, and to start building a future based on mutual respect and understanding. After having seen so many Australians opening their hearts to the idea of reconciliation and taking part in marches and celebrations around the country, many expected Howard to respond to the momentum for change and behave like a statesman. He could not do it, he would not do it—and subsequently he adopted the policy of so-called `practical reconciliation' as an excuse not to say sorry. The people present on that occasion, which could have been a time of renewal, jeered and booed a mean-spirited, graceless speech—as Australians do—and some turned their backs on him. Howard has never forgotten or forgiven.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I simply ask the honourable member for Fremantle to refer to the Prime Minister by his correct title.
—I am happy to do that, although most people know him colloquially as Howard. The Prime Minister has never forgotten or forgiven. Remember his lectern thumping, red-faced hysterical rant—he certainly does. And now he hopes to act out the last scene of this revenge drama by silencing those who dared criticise him. 
These actions, by the man and the government, demonstrate, as Mick Dodson put it, `a deep-seated disrespect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and our cultural rights and obligations.' See the Prime Minister's almost obsessive denigration of the black armband view of history as evidence of this. He has an almost visceral reaction to any attempts to write a history which is inclusive of Indigenous stories and which accurately depicts the grim, as well as the admirable and heroic, deeds of our settler forebears. He cannot apologise on behalf of the nation because he really does not see that there is anything for which to apologise. In fact, he caricatured the request for recognition and reparation from the stolen generations as an unreasonable attempt to make people like him feel guilty about our past. Mind you, he has no trouble at all appropriating the courage of our war dead and feeling proud of their actions. I say to the Prime Minister: you cannot have one without the other.
After a sustained campaign of vilification of Indigenous organisations and their supporters—mounted from almost the first day of its election—the Howard government now seek to close the chapter on what they call `a failed experiment'. In announcing the government decision to abolish ATSIC and not replace it, the Prime Minister claimed, `We believe very strongly that the experiment in separate representation, elected representation for Indigenous people has failed.' The truth is that the Prime Minister was never interested in any objective assessment of the `experiment' as he calls it. He made his mind up a long time ago. When the bill to establish ATSIC was introduced in 1989, he argued that `the legislation strikes at the heart of the unity of the Australian people' and would `divide Australian against Australian.' If he had his way it certainly would. 
The Prime Minister has long been an opponent of any mechanism which gives Indigenous people any form of autonomy, preferring assimilationist policies—that is his history—which the government, of course, now seeks to entrench in so-called `mainstreaming' of Indigenous programs. But scandalously, in my view, in getting rid of ATSIC the government offers no alternative legitimate Indigenous voice, no mechanisms to allow our original people to help design and implement policies needed to improve their lives, no vehicle for holding governments to account for their performance in redressing disadvantage and no body with the breadth of views to represent the interests of all Indigenous Australians—nothing. It appears to want to replace what it regards as a failed experiment with structures which we know have failed even more spectacularly to deliver improvements to Indigenous communities. Several members in their speeches have already referred to the work by IATSIS on so-called practical reconciliation, so I will not recite those gloomy figures again. Suffice it to say that, if you want to find a failed experiment, it is this government's approach to practical reconciliation.
The $1 million plus review of ATSIC, cynically and inaccurately used by the government as justification for the abolition of ATSIC, gave people false hope that the recognised flaws and failings of ATSIC would be analysed and repaired, and that a new set of arrangements would be developed to improve and advance Indigenous people's circumstances, rights and representation—all three of those things. Amongst other things, the review recommended that a stronger regional focus was needed. But it did not recommend abolishing elected representation. The members of that committee—parti-cularly Jackie Huggins, the one Indigenous member—have been treated with very considerable disrespect. It is pretty typical, I have to say. Jackie Huggins found out about the abolition of ATSIC from a television journalist. In response to a question on a recent SBS program, Jackie, who is always incredibly polite, said: 
... for me personally, it was completely a bolt out of the blue. We knew that there would be changes. I didn't realise—nor did many people—how drastic these changes would be. So I was very much shocked and embarrassed and disappointed that as an Indigenous member, the only Indigenous member of this review team and a woman ... the rightful opportunity to tell us about the review was not given by the Government to us. I mean, I found out through Lola Forester—
an SBS journalist—
who's in the audience tonight—through the Indigenous media—that ATSIC was abolished ...
 That's the way Indigenous people are treated by this government. She went on to say, in another interview, that the axing of ATSIC was `contrary to our view', although the Prime Minister has used the review as justification. Jackie Huggins says:
In no way would our review team be aligned with the abolition of ATSIC. It was not our intention. I didn't expect such a drastic situation might occur, with ATSIC being annihilated and abolished.
Other Indigenous leaders have made even less kind remarks about the government's actions.
But Jackie Huggins has good reason to complain. The government, indeed, did not even wait for the report to be concluded before stripping ATSIC of its responsibilities for program delivery and placing it with a new body, IATSIS—a process that took place without consultation and without the scrutiny of this parliament. It is a disgrace. It was, as we now see, preparatory to this complete abolition, making the dismembering of ATSIC so much easier than it would otherwise have been. It was a very cynical ploy. This legislation that we are debating here is a return to the days following the 1967 referendum, replacing the elected representatives of ATSIC with an appointed advisory body. I am sure that the Prime Minister would like to take us even further back than that, but even he does not dare to do that.
As we all know, Indigenous people themselves were very keen for reform, but they also knew and they know now that ATSIC had been made to carry burdens not of its making and well beyond its capacity. The government and its apologists—the Alan Joneses of this world—have cultivated the view that the poor state of Indigenous health, education and living conditions is principally the fault of ATSIC. ATSIC is the most recent of all bodies, in fact, and the least culpable. The truth is otherwise. Most of the programs to deal with these problems are designed and funded elsewhere by mainstream departments and programs in state, Commonwealth and territory governments.
ATSIC was always supposed to have a supplementary role. That was the intention of this parliament. Indeed, the original objectives are clearly stated in the original legislation and I think they get washed away in this bill. They did not provide for exclusive and comprehensive service delivery. That was never contemplated. However, because of the failure of state and Commonwealth governments to adequately deliver services, ATSIC did in some respects become the funder of last resort, supplying funds for essential services and infrastructure such as roads, water supply and sewerage—services otherwise routinely supplied by state and local governments for the rest of the community.
Australians do not understand, I think, that many of the things that they find shocking about Aboriginal circumstances are mostly not the responsibility of ATSIC. Its programs were meant to supplement the provision of essential services to Aboriginal communities by Commonwealth, state and territory gov-ernments. As the Auditor-General reported, ATSIC was increasingly a replacement funder because governments refused to accept their funding responsibilities to Aboriginal people. Now we are going to do away with the one body that might have given us hope. 
One of the biggest unanswered questions with this legislation is: what will now happen to those communities which have relied on ATSIC, the funder of last resort, for the most basic of services? As the minister and the senior public servants who appeared before the estimates committee this week have demonstrated, they do not know or, if they do, they are not telling anyone. It is clear that the abolition of ATSIC without a replacement body or the reforms recommended by the government's own review will further disadvantage Indigenous Australians. As if it could be any worse!
As Linda Burney, a New South Wales Aboriginal member of parliament points out, the regional ATSIC councils have also been a conduit for leadership development. That is something I think this government is not much interested in. She says:
Can Aboriginal people aspire to positions of leadership? ATSIC at a regional level was one of the key vehicles for developing that sort of leadership and capacity.
And it is now to be abolished. She asks, `How will these young leaders now cut their teeth?'
This action proposed by the government is fundamentally a denial of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's human right to identity and an elected voice—something that we certainly intend to remedy when in government. If this government gets its way, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will now have no decision making context for accessing and participating in the right to self-determination as defined in the United Nations International Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights, to which we are a signatory.
The changes in this bill are poorly motivated, as I have pointed out, poorly conceived and, as we have seen in the estimates committee this week, poorly executed. There is still no clarity in the arrangements for transferring staff and programs to other agencies, and the provisions in the bill for disposing of assets create more problems than they solve. The arrangements have all the appearance of being hastily cobbled together to meet political and not policy timetables—pretty typical of this government.
It is also obvious that the abolition of ATSIC and the failure to develop substitute arrangements does nothing at all to address many of the impediments to effective policy development and program delivery, many of which were identified in the government's own review. For instance, they do nothing to address the cost and responsibility shifting between state and Commonwealth governments. It is not just cost shifting; they pass the buck. The lack of coordination between departments and agencies is not addressed. There is nothing about the persistence in mainstream departments of programs that are short term, ad hoc, fragmented and overlapping—pilot programs coming out your ears. There is nothing to address the ignorance and lack of capacity that characterises much of the mainstream service delivery. There is much talk about lack of capacity in the Indigenous community. In my view, it is often on the other side of the table. There is nothing about the proliferation of policy advisory bodies which have already been set up to listen to competing Indigenous voices, as Larissa Behrendt put it, `allowing policy makers to forum shop for opinions that best suit them'. Mainstreaming, of course, does not allow for representative input into policy development and programs—you can pick and choose the voices you want to hear. 
What we should be doing instead of passing this legislation is trying to learn from an honest assessment of ATSIC's strengths and weaknesses. That is what we in Labor propose to do and it is why we will be referring this bill in the Senate for a considered eval-uation of the key issues and a comprehensive consultation with Indigenous Australians. ATSIC did a pretty good job in policy development, as is evident in the government's taking up of many of its proposals on domestic violence in the most recent budget. It was, to the government's great discomfort, also a powerful advocate on Indigenous rights and native title—those areas that the PM has derided on many occasions, including this claim:
I do believe that—
ATSIC—
has become too preoccupied with what loosely may be called symbolic issues and too little concerned with delivering real outcomes for Indigenous people—
as if discrimination, rights and land were not real.
We need to learn from the past and work together to build on ATSIC, which was a model of limited self-determination but which had much to offer and did much good work, despite its failings. As one commentator put it:
... ATSIC has been battered and bruised. Poisoned by perception.
It has been systematically and cynically poisoned by perception. That is why the chair of ATSIC was hung out to dry for so long without resolution of that matter. That commentator might have added, `Destabilised by a systematic campaign, which has reduced it ultimately to ashes'.
As parliamentarians we should now concentrate on building upon ATSIC's successes while conceding it had flaws, like most human organisations—the political parties represented in this place, for example. But, as Pat Dodson reminded us last week, it was never a construct of Indigenous people. ATSIC is a creation of this parliament. Instead, ATSIC was, as Dodson said, `one small formal voice' which was provided with the `resources of a poorhouse orphan and expected to perform like a prodigy.' But, as he and many other Indigenous leaders have agreed, the concept of providing Indigenous people with an elected voice at the national level was right and `must be saved from the road wreck'. And that is what we intend to do. It is more important than ever that Indigenous people's views are put forward and heard in the forums of government in this country. It is also vital to deal with the unfinished business that the Howard government has steadfastly refused to address.
I continue to be amazed at the optimism of Indigenous Australians—that they are still prepared to enter into a discussion about the best means of achieving formal and substantive equality. This time it cannot be, as Pat Dodson reminds us, `another artificial construct foisted on us by governments', but rather a matter for Indigenous people. This is a time to listen and to become real partners. We can fashion a new agreement, as Dodson puts it, `between mates', but an agreement that represents the views and aspirations of Indigenous people. I have to say I very much doubt that the Howard government is interested in this journey, but I hasten to assure Aboriginal people that we are.
Like many Australians, I noted with sadness the death of Mr Djerrkura. He had little to say before his death about the demise of ATSIC. He said simply that ATSIC deserved better than this. In the course of his discussion, he also noted the way in which this decision was made and the language with which it was delivered. He was very sad about that. He said: 
In the classic imperial fashion, without negotiation, without understanding and with little empathy, the great white leader announced that Aboriginal people had, yet again been a “failure”. ATSIC would be abolished. No more paternalistic model of government could be found.
I guess in some ways we should not be surprised at that, considering that the Prime Minister, who worked with Mr Djerrkura during his time as chair of ATSIC—indeed, appointed him to that position—did not even put out a press release noting his passing. Indeed, it was not until his death was raised with the Prime Minister at a press conference that he made the most desultory remarks about a fine Australian. That, sadly, says a lot about this government's approach to Indigenous affairs.
—It is almost 9 p.m., and I would therefore be quite prepared, with the consent of the House, to propose the question that the House do now adjourn rather than call an additional speaker and have them interrupted 30 seconds into their speech. So if there is no dissent—
—Mr Speaker, I wonder if you might be able to reflect upon the member for Fremantle's contribution in this debate and remind her of standing orders 76 and, indeed, 80.

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2004-06-01,"—Earlier today, I was not able to give the full record of Liverpool Council's finances, so let me now give the complete account of the council in the 1990s. During my time as mayor the council's debt servicing ratio fell from 17.2 per cent to 10 per cent, which was half the Western Sydney average of 20 per cent. At my last council meeting, in mid-1994, the council adopted a debt retirement strategy that, if followed, would have made it debt-free in 2005. Between 1991 and 1994 the council's working funds balance increased from $770,000 to $1.1 million—that is, its liquidity increased by 50 per cent. At the end of 1994 the budget surplus was $1.6 million.
In each of the three budgets during my time as mayor the council achieved significant productivity gains—an efficiency dividend of three per cent in 1992, four per cent in 1993 and four per cent in 1994. Between 1991 and 1994 council staff numbers fell from 500 to less than 400, a sign of the financial disciplines that were applied. That is the true financial position during my three years as mayor: a lower debt servicing ratio, higher working funds, budget surpluses, significant productivity gains and tighter staffing. This was a well-managed and efficient council.
The efficiency gains were realised through a combination of strategies involving commercialisation of council functions, contracting out, the commercial management of council assets and significant labour market reform, moving away from the centralised award to the first enterprise agreement in the council's history. An example of these reforms was the outdoor works department, which was placed on a full commercial footing and exposed to contracting out and a 25 per cent staff reduction achieved through voluntary redundancies. 
—You should have stayed there!
—I welcome the interjection by the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs that I should have stayed there, such was the high quality of financial management. I welcome his support and urge him to speak to the Treasurer. This reform was described in the Institute of Public Affairs' IPA Review—not normally associated with the Labor Party—in 1994 as `the most radical and extensive reform in municipal government in Australia'.
Comment has been made about the council's capital works program and the way in which it was funded. The strategy was straightforward. The Macquarie Street mall was funded from the Westfields road sale, and the Whitlam Centre and Powerhouse facilities were funded from federal government grants—the Keating government's local capital works program in the 1992 One Nation statement. The council's efficiency gains, if maintained, were available to fund the long-term recurrent operation of these facilities.
Unfortunately, the councils elected in 1995 and 1999 abandoned these strategies. For instance, they returned the outdoor works function to in-house management and staff and wound back the commercialisation process and the contracting out. They also overturned the decisions in the 1994 council budget on debt retirement and on placing a cap on future capital works commitments. The following commitments had not been planned for in 1994 but were included in the 1995 and 1996 council budgets: the purchase of a $2 million property in the Liverpool CBD; the establishment of a $500,000 council service centre; $4.5 million funding for a youth centre; and the expansion of the floor space and costs of the new central library. In fact, the council in 1996 ran a capital works budget of $35 million and also allowed recurrent costs to escalate. In areas not connected with capital works, operating costs increased by between 32 per cent and 600 per cent. The council lost its cost control discipline and efficiency dividend—ultimately, it was sacked in 2004 for financial mismanagement, a full 10 years after I left the council. These are the facts—
An opposition member—How long?
—Ten years after I left the council.
—That's a 10-year plan!
—It is a 10-year plan indeed! It is also a 10-year misrepresentation by the government. These are the facts, as opposed to the misrepresentations and fantasies of the Howard government.
The Liberals, of course, know the truth, but in their political desperation they have invented stories about Liverpool Council during my time as mayor. Why do I say that they know the truth? In January 1994 I ran in a national by-election campaign for the seat of Werriwa and the Liberals did not say boo about Liverpool Council. The member for Bennelong, then the shadow minister for industrial relations, was heavily involved in the campaign for the Liberal Party. I was the sitting Mayor of Liverpool at the time, but such was the strong state of Liverpool Council's finances and performance that the Liberals never raised it as a campaign issue. Ten years later, in rewriting history, they now say that there was an issue. Why didn't they raise it at the time that I was mayor, when it would have been directly relevant to a national by-election campaign? Why only raise it 10 years later?
In truth, I am very proud of my achievements in municipal government and I am not prepared to let a bunch of Tories like the Treasurer and his acolytes, who have never been to Liverpool let alone understood the council's finances, say otherwise.

"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-06-01,"—As I said to the House last night, the 2004-05 budget of the Howard-Costello government is a family budget. Last night I outlined the basic provisions. I said that today I wanted to establish the economic base upon which this budget is founded, which I think is very important. I want to do that by initially comparing the last five years of historical budget outcomes under the previous government with the last five years of historical budget outcomes under this government. If you look at the historical cash surplus—effectively, the budget bottom line at the end of the year—you see that in 1991-92 there was a deficit under the then Labor government of $11½ billion; in 1992-93, a deficit of $17 billion; in 1992-93, a deficit of $17.1 billion; in 1994-95, a deficit of $13.1 billion; and in 1995-96, a deficit of $10 billion. All up, over those five years there was a collective national debt of approximately $68 billion.
If we compare that with the last five years of coalition budget results and estimates, we see in 2000-02, a surplus of $5.9 billion; in 2001-02, a deficit of $980 million; in 2002-03, a surplus of $7.4 billion; in 2003-04, an estimated surplus of $4.6 billion; and in 2004-05, a surplus estimated of $2.4 billion—or, effectively, an approximate collective surplus of $19½ billion over those five years. All up, there was a turnaround from the last five years of the previous Labor government to the current five years of the present Howard-Costello government of $87 billion. That represents the turnaround in the fiscal situation of the Commonwealth of Australia and, therefore, the people of Australia over the last five years of the two respective governments. 
Why does that matter? It matters for two reasons. It matters, firstly, because it unshackles future generations from an extraordinary debt. It unshackles future generations from the interest payments, from the burden of debt and from the impact of high interest rates. Those are the fundamental macroeconomic effects of large-scale debt on future generations. In essence, what occurred during 1991 to 1996 was an act of intergenerational theft that has been unparalleled at any point in Australian history by any Australian government in the amount of debt run up in a short time for future generations to repay. That is the first reason why it matters. The second reason is that through the action of fiscal discipline—through the control, through the discipline, through the planning and through the coordination which has allowed those surpluses—we see an improvement in the entire current national economic health and, perhaps most importantly, the ability to deliver families the benefits contained within this budget.
That brings me to the specific family benefits and measures within this budget. First and foremost are the family tax benefit results under family tax benefits A and B. Within my electorate of Flinders, over 12,000 families will benefit from the immediate payment of $600 per child, with an additional payment of $600 per child in the coming year. As I have mentioned to the House previously, a woman who approached my office in the last two weeks has four children, all under family tax benefit A. She, due to circumstances which were against her wishes, is now a sole parent. As a result of that she will receive $2,400 in cash payments and that will help her as she makes the decisions that she talked to me about: whether she buys fresh fruit, shoes or many of the basics for her four children as she struggles as a single mother. This is a real and profound impact on her life. 
The family tax benefit A changes, along with the change in the taper system which was announced in family tax benefit B are of practical, real and tangible benefit to 12,000 families in towns such as Rosebud, Dromana, Rye, Hastings, Somerville, Kooweerup, Baxter, Lang Lang, Grantville and Cowes within my electorate of Flinders. That is where real people receive real benefits immediately. That is what these family tax benefit changes are about.
The second element of the family budget which I want to refer to is the fact that there is an increase in financial support for carers. Within the electorate of Flinders, again it is estimated that over 2,000 beneficiaries will immediately receive the benefits outlined in the budget papers. That means that people on the carers payment—people who give their lives to caring for others—will receive a benefit of $1,000. People on the carers allowance—those who make significant contributions—will receive a benefit of $600. Together, in some cases, it will amount to a benefit of $1,600. The Omonds of Hastings—who have given me permission to use their name in parliament—have a very difficult situation and for them this $1,600 will make a dramatic difference. Of course they have a greater need than that—that is undeniable—but this initial payment makes a very important inroad into the challenge that they face.
The third benefit for families under this budget is the income tax deductions. For all of those workers who have an income of over $52,000 there will be a genuine and significant income tax benefit. What this does is complement the $600 per child for the lower income families under family tax benefit A. That is the importance of the package as a whole: it has the family tax benefit allowances for low-income families and the taxation deductions for middle-income and above families. That is why it is a comprehensive package. 
There are over 7,000 individuals who will receive significant benefits through the changes to the taxation system. These changes are the completion of a process launched through the 2000 and 2003 round of tax reductions. They represent a very important and real benefit. They represent encouragement for enterprise, for people such as plumbers and policemen and health workers who are finding themselves pushed, through their additional work, into the highest tax bracket. The net result will be that 80 per cent of employed people within the electorate of Flinders will be within the 30 per cent taxation bracket. That is a tremendously important step forward.
The next element for families which I want to mention is the maternity allowance of $3,000 per child. That is an important step. We have calculated—not precisely but I believe on an estimated basis—that approximately 850 babies are born to parents per year within the electorate of Flinders. Finally, I am particularly pleased about the nursing home and hostel benefits which come under this budget. Around $3,500 per bed will be paid for approximately 1,600 residents in Flinders to nursing home and hostel operators to assist with the capital upgrades to facilities, such as the Rosebud Private Nursing Home, Killara Hostel, Westernport Nursing Home, Warley Hospital's aged care facility, the Bays Nursing Home, Baxter Village aged care facilities—both high and low care—and many others throughout the electorate of Flinders.
All of these facilities will have an immediate benefit as well as, perhaps most significantly, a reform to their ongoing payments. There was a gap. There is no doubt that there was a gap, as I have discussed previously with the member for Perth, in the recurrent funding of high-care beds. The government has taken a step forward and taken real action. These changes will mean an annual increase in the payments, starting at $1,000 and going up to $5,000 over the next four years per patient per bed, with an additional increase in the capital accommodation charge, which will either be paid by the Commonwealth or be chargeable by the nursing home in question. That represents a fundamental reform of the aged care system.
I wanted to focus in this budget on two things: firstly, on the underlying ability to transact these reforms—the difference between a net debt of $68 billion over the last five years of the previous government and a net surplus of $19½ billion over the last five years of this government—and, secondly, on the practical benefits to over 12,000 families which those hard economic challenges have delivered for the people of Flinders through family tax benefit A, through $3,000 being received by 850 mothers for each new child and through both the immediate up-front and the ongoing payments that over 2,000 carers and nursing homes—there are 1,600 nursing home beds—will receive. These are tremendous, practical results. This budget is a family budget and I am delighted to have been able to rise in support of the budget. I am delighted to be able to commend the family tax benefit payments, the maternity payments, the support for carers, the increase for nursing homes and the tax deductions for people in my electorate of Flinders. I commend the budget to the House and I urge its speedy passage.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2004-06-01,"—Today I would like to make my remarks on the appropriation bills in my capacity as shadow minister for immigration. Over the past two years, the public policy, media and political debate in Australia has focused almost exclusively on the unauthorised arrival, primarily by boat, of people seeking asylum and protection in Australia under the refugee convention. Since March 1996, 221 boats have arrived in Australian territory without authority. A total of 11,696 people came on these boats. During this parliament—that is, since the end of 2001—only four boats have come. In September 2002 a boat with 65 people landed on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. In July 2003 a boat carrying 53 Vietnamese people practically docked in Port Hedland. There was a boat that was returned to Indonesia after landing at Melville Island late last year, and a boat with 15 people on board landed at Ashmore Reef a few months ago. Of those that came prior to the 2001 election, many have remained in Australia on temporary protection visas—TPVs—or have been granted permanent protection. 
The people who have been granted either permanent protection or TPVs have been accounted for within Australia's humanitarian migration program. This program comprises both offshore resettlement and onshore protection. Onshore protection is for those people who arrive in Australia either unauthorised or on a temporary basis but in an authorised manner and who subsequently claim Australia's protection. Our onshore program is a consequence of our obligation to be a good international citizen under the refugee convention.
Labor's basic principles and approach on refugee and humanitarian issues can be found at chapter 7, `Human Rights and Equal Opportunity for All', of Labor's national platform Immigration: a link to Australia's future growth. Today I propose to focus on four aspects of Labor's approach: children in detention, the so-called Pacific solution, temporary protection visas and better decision-making and review arrangements. My priorities for Labor in government are to clean up the Howard government's backlog in the asylum seeker area: the children in detention backlog, the Nauru and Manus Island backlogs and the TPV holders backlog.
Once this backlog has been cleared, the task will be to set up an asylum seeker system for the future so that what the Howard-Ruddock administration has presided over can never happen again. Clearing the backlog requires getting kids out of detention, ending the Pacific solution by returning the running of Australia's immigration and detention system to Commonwealth officers on Commonwealth territory and efficiently and individually processing the 9,000 TPV backlog.
Labor believes in an orderly immigration system—a system based on the rule of law and a system of integrity in which the Australian people will have confidence and trust. For the Australian people to have confidence in the administration of our immigration system, it must be built upon rigorous procedures and processes which protect our national interests and our national borders. We must also treat individuals fairly and with dignity. Treating individuals fairly requires that they be dealt with in a speedy and efficient manner where decisions are based on fair procedures and are subject to appropriate review. Protecting our national interests and national borders requires zero tolerance of people smugglers, who must be subject to harsh penalties to deter their activities and to stop unauthorised boat arrivals. It is also in our national interest to conduct ourselves as a good international citizen and to do our fair share for those who are subject to persecution and who need protection.
Labor in government will ensure that our borders are secure and that the processing and detention of asylum seekers is both civilised and fair. Labor will maintain mandatory detention to ensure that, in the first instance, people who come here in an authorised way are checked for identity, health, quarantine and security. But we say that you can also have graduations of detention. The best example of graduations of detention is having no children in detention—children out. With sensible graduations, you can ensure that families, including fathers, can live in residential-style hostels with discreet supervision and discreet security, based on a model that can best be seen at Port Augusta. We believe it is essential that, if the Commonwealth has to detain people, they be detained by Commonwealth officers on Commonwealth territory. The best way of ensuring accountability and transparency is to ensure that the Commonwealth is responsible and accountable and that that accountability is transparent. That is why we need an inspector-general of detention, sensible media access and sensible access to medical services as well. 
In budget week we saw the long-awaited release of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's report entitled A last resort? The report of the national inquiry into children in immigration detention. The HREOC report into children in detention is an indictment of the Howard-Ruddock children in immigration detention policy and an indictment of the government's administration of that policy. The government has presided over a bad period. The government should simply acknowledge that its policy administration has been a mistake and set the system up for the future so that this cannot happen again. If the government does not do this—and it is unlikely that it will—on coming to office Labor will.
Since 2002, Labor has had an absolute commitment that immigration detention centres are no place for the long-term detention of children. Last week, in Senate estimates, the government indicated that the two-page joint press release from the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the Attorney-General at the time of the tabling of the report on 13 May was the government's formal response to the HREOC report. I am surprised that the government thinks this is an adequate response to such a comprehensive indictment of its policy and administration of the long-term detention of children in immigration facilities.
It came as no surprise when the government tabled the report under the shadow of budget week. The cynicism is reinforced when you consider the findings of the report. HREOC condemned the government for presiding over an immigration detention regime where the welfare, safety and health of a child was not the primary concern. HREOC underlined the commonsense view that the long-term immigration detention of children is not in the best interests of children nor in the public interest. The report found there are inadequate guidelines for dealing with children in detention facilities between the government and the private managers of the centre, ACM. This underlines Labor's point that the management of immigration detention centres should not be privatised or outsourced to overseas countries, international corporations or private companies but should be a matter for Commonwealth officers on Commonwealth territory. 
Labor agrees with the HREOC recommendation that the minister for immigration should not be the guardian of an unaccompanied child in immigration detention. Labor has a commitment to establish a federal children's commissioner and believes the guardianship of unaccompanied children seeking asylum in Australia would be an ideal role for the children's commissioner. Labor will now consider all the detailed findings and recommendations of the commission's report with a view to setting the system up for the future so that this cannot happen again.
One of the practical problems we find at the moment is the government's absolute refusal to countenance the removal of men from immigration detention centres to residential housing projects, whether they are 18 or 28 years old and single or 58 years old with a wife and three kids. I believe it is possible to make sensible judgments—to exercise discretion wisely—that consider both the risk of absconding and security risks, where we can see families, including fathers, housed in residential housing projects, of which I am a strong supporter. 
Minister Vanstone and the Prime Minister both say that if children are released from detention it will simply send the wrong message to people smugglers and will not act as a deterrent. HREOC discounts that and I discount that as well. The reason the boats have stopped coming is not that the people in the coffee shops of Baghdad or Kabul see a lone person on, or an empty, Manus Island or people on Nauru or children detained in immigration detention centres. They have stopped coming because after four years of neglect the Howard government finally got round to entering into an agreement with Indonesia to stop the boats coming; Saddam Hussein used to be a tyrant in Iraq, and now he is a prisoner of war; and the Taliban have been removed from parts of Afghanistan. These are the fundamental causes that have stopped the boats from coming.
Labor also shares HREOC's concern that, despite the extensive consideration of mainland immigration detention facilities, the conditions and facilities of children in Nauru remain unscrutinised. There are approximately 70 children in immigration detention in Nauru. This is more than the total in all other detention centres put together. Yet the Howard government continues its ongoing denial of Commonwealth responsibility for the so-called Pacific solution. It would not even allow HREOC to include Nauru in its investigation. The government cannot continue to deny responsibility for Australia's immigration detention centre on Nauru. Labor, on the other hand, remains committed to ending the so-called Pacific solution. 
Labor welcomes the recent decision by the government to grant refugee status to 131 Afghan asylum seekers on Nauru on the basis of changed circumstances in certain regions of Afghanistan. This flurry of activity has been triggered by the UNHCR granting 22 Afghans refugee status following the UNHCR assessment of those changed circumstances. The government now needs to indicate the status of the remaining 33 Afghan detainees on Nauru. It also follows logically that if the Australian government has agreed to reconsider the case of Afghans on Nauru on the basis of changed circumstances in certain areas of Afghanistan, with the lion's share being assessed as refugees, then presumably those changed circumstances could well apply equally to the cases of any relevant Afghan asylum seeker currently in immigration detention on the Australian mainland. 
The government also needs to indicate what is the status of the 50 or so Iraqi detainees on Nauru. This is particularly the case as the government recently announced that, given the ongoing difficulties in Iraq, it would recommence the assessment of Iraqi TPV holders seeking further protection from Australia. As the number of detainees on Nauru is about to decline rapidly, Labor again calls on the government to end the costly Pacific solution. In doing so, Labor has indicated it will respond positively to whatever transitional arrangement the government sensibly wants to put in place to effect this. 
Minister Vanstone, in announcing the granting of refugee status to those 131 Afghans, has repeated the following claim:
Australia has made it clear all along that it will take its fair share of refugees needing resettlement from the offshore processing centres and this announcement confirms the Australian Government's commitment to that. 
This is a far cry from the mantra of the Howard government seeking re-election in 2001 that not one of these people would set foot on Australian soil. Prior to these recent announcements, nearly 400 asylum seekers originally placed on Nauru and Manus had been resettled in Australia. On the government's own admission, most of the Afghans reassessed as refugees will now be resettled in Australia. That would see more than 500 originally placed on Nauru and Manus resettled in Australia. On that basis, there is no reason in principle why the remaining detainees on Nauru could not be brought to Australia, to either the mainland or Christmas Island, on a transitional basis.
I note the government's decision to grant Aladdin Sisalem, the lone asylum seeker on Manus Island, a protection visa which will allow him to live in Australia. With Mr Sisalem no longer on Manus Island, the immigration detention facility will be empty. Minister Vanstone has confirmed that, despite the fact that it will be empty, the facility will remain operational. The government revealed during Senate estimates last week that the cost to the Australian taxpayer to keep the facility running for one detainee was $250,000 a month. The government also indicated that an empty facility would be operational at the same cost of $250,000 a month under the agreement with the PNG government which ends in October. When quizzed further by Labor senators, the government admitted that it might extend the operation of that facility beyond October.
We are now in the ridiculous situation where the Howard government is prepared to spend $1.25 million of taxpayers' money to keep the empty Manus Island facility open until October. The cost of keeping the detention centre running each month is equivalent to over 9,700 bulk-billed GP consultations or a total of 48,500 bulk-billed GP consultations until the end of October. The government also confirmed at Senate estimates that it has now spent $200 million of taxpayers' money on the so-called Pacific solution and has budgeted for another $85.3 million for the next financial year and anywhere up to $300 million in the forward estimates. The Pacific solution is now a ridiculously expensive farce, and the government should end it immediately.
Let me now turn to a better processing and review system for asylum seekers. Labor will reform the current asylum seekers' appeal mechanism to ensure that its decision making and operation is cost efficient, fair and consistent. While the rights of asylum seekers to seek judicial review must be maintained, it is important that a streamlined and more formal system of appeal is instituted to provide a better filter and alleviate the High Court's immigration caseload burden. Labor agrees that our courts are burdened with significant amounts of immigration cases. The government has made several attempts to ease this burden through legislative changes and the introduction of privative clauses.
Labor believes that, before one gets to a judicial review of an administrative decision or a ministerial delegate's decision in the migration area, it is important to focus on the original decision and the merits review. Currently we have a system where the minister's delegate will make an original decision which is subject to appeal in the Refugee Review Tribunal. I have made it clear that there is a want of confidence, firstly, in the initial decision-making process and, secondly, in the Refugee Review Tribunal's review. There is clearly a need to attend to the backlog of judicial reviews which we find in the courts at the moment. This is why Labor has adopted an approach of saying that, firstly, we believe the Refugee Review Tribunal should be abolished and replaced with what we describe as a `refugee status determination tribunal' and, secondly, appeals from that tribunal should go to the Federal Magistrates Service, essentially by way of a one-stop shop appeal. 
One way in which the quality of these decisions can be improved is by making sure the individual asylum seeker is fully aware of the procedures which attend an application for refugee status under the refugee convention. That is why I believe a system of case managing individual asylum seekers will assist the quality of the original decision, will assist the efficiency of merits and judicial review and will also, if the outcome is refugee status and resettlement in Australia, assist settlement here. If the outcome is a rejection of refugee status and then a requirement to return to a country of origin, it will make the prospects of voluntary return to a country of origin better.
I envisage a model where individual asylum seekers would be case managed through this process from day one. There are a number of possibilities as to who might do that case management. My own view is that, on balance, it is probably best done by non-government organisations. We have a range of organisations in Australia whose officers have become very experienced in refugee and migration settlement matters. The Red Cross is one example and the Uniting Church another. My view is that it would actually assist the quality of original decision-making processes and improve the efficiency and quality of merits and subsequent review if case management along these lines was effected from day one. That would include ensuring necessary translators, access to legal advice, access to information about the welfare of one's family and the like.
The second area where I believe improvements can be made is in the merits review process. My own assessment is that there is an ongoing lack of confidence in the Refugee Review Tribunal. If there is an ongoing lack of confidence in an administrative body or a merits review body, then there is the danger that the superior courts—the courts of review—will seek to rectify that problem at source rather than focusing on what they should be focusing on; namely, a review which goes to error of law, want of jurisdiction or breach of natural justice.
Our approach is to abolish the RRT and replace it with a refugee status determination tribunal that would be chaired by a person who is legally qualified. There would be a panel of three, with two community members or community representatives effectively on either side of the legally qualified chairperson. My aspiration or ambition would be to have as the legally qualified chair a recently retired state Supreme Court or Federal Court judge. This would ensure confidence in the tribunal insofar as the superior courts are concerned.
From the refugee status determination tribunal so comprised we envisage an appeal to the Federal Magistrates Court on the basis of that effecting an efficient and speedy outcome. I have to acknowledge that some have suggested that it would be better to continue to pursue appeals to the Federal Court and that the focus should be on court based procedures of law, written applications and written submissions—sensible, court based, timely procedures to ensure that there is an efficiency of review and a removal of the current backlog. 
While our preference is to pursue the Federal Magistrates Court option, I have indicated that, because I am open to sensible and positive suggestions in this area, I am happy to parallel track, in a sense. In addition to working on that approach of improving the quality of the original decision by a ministerial delegate, improving the standing and quality of the merits review through the refugee status determination tribunal and then having a one-stop shop appeal to the magistrates, I continue to explore, in consultation with interested people in this area, sensible procedures which would see speedy appeals to the Federal Court. 
Let me now turn to temporary protection visas. The refugee convention has always envisaged that the protection of the convention might not be required on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, Labor will maintain a TPV system for unauthorised arrivals. Labor will introduce a one-off TPV period of two years, after which, consistent with the convention, if ongoing protection is still required, permanent protection will be provided. There are currently 9,000 TPV holders in the Australian community, and they came here as unauthorised arrivals on John Howard's watch. He said that they were refugees and that they could live in the Australian community, which they are now doing—some of them already for up to three or four years.
John Howard believes that TPVs somehow operate as a form of deterrent to unauthorised arrivals. If they are such an effective deterrent why do we have nearly 9,000 people here on his watch, living in the Australian community? We say that there is a role for TPVs but only if that role is consistent with the refugee convention. While this point is often forgotten, the refugee convention always envisaged that there would be circumstances in which the ongoing protection of the refugee convention was not required. Under Labor's model an unauthorised person who comes here and is determined to be a refugee will go on a TPV for a one-off two-year period, after which, if the ongoing protection of that person is required, the onus will be on the Commonwealth and that person will have a pathway to permanency. We also have to deal with John Howard's TPV backlog. What do we do with the 9,000 people here on temporary protection visas? 
For a government that have spent so much time complaining about the delay in review, they are clearly indifferent to the 9,000 people here on temporary protection visas. We say that two years is an appropriate time to make a judgment. Two years is an appropriate period to give protection, but after that period a different public policy consideration comes into play. We say that if ongoing protection under the refugee convention is not required, in the case of those people who have been here on TPVs for two years or more, you can make a judgment: are these people who have been out and about in the Australian community making their family, community, social and economic contacts; are these the sorts of people whom in any event Australia would want as part of our migration intake? 
Labor say that our two-year TPV period will replace all the TPV categories that the government have developed in recent years; there will be no seven-day rule and no permanent temporary protection. There will be a one-off two-year visa and at the end of that period, if a person is found to be needing further protection in Australia under the refugee convention, permanent protection will be granted. Labor will also ensure that, in addition to existing services, TPV holders have access to English language training and employment assistance. Labor will also ensure appropriate settlement support and alleviate the financial and organisational burden borne by the states, territories and welfare and volunteer organisations. Labor understand that you have to ensure that people are dealt with fairly, with dignity and with civility. You can have an immigration system which protects the national interest and secures our borders but at the same time treats the people who come here with civility and fairness. 
Labor's policy is well founded on three principles—three principles to which Labor has always attached itself. The first principle is formulating policy on the basis of protecting and defending our national interest and protecting and defending our borders. That is a principle that we hold dear as a party. The second principle is adherence to international obligations, and we do that through our adherence to the refugee convention. The third principle is a simple, well-founded basis—that whoever comes to us seeking our protection is dealt with with dignity and civility and dealt with fairly.  
Our approach is to clean up the Howard government's backlog and then set up the system for the future so that the bad period that this government has presided over cannot happen again in the refugee and humanitarian immigration area.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Cobb, John, MP",NATS,2004-06-01,"—I would like to make some comments about the budget in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005 and the cognate bills, especially in relation to western New South Wales, country areas in general and my electorate of Parkes in particular. The budget has a number of significant funding and assistance announcements. Certainly this funding and assistance is designed to help all Australians, and I believe it will particularly help country regions. The budget is affordable and sustainable. After eight years of stewardship by the coalition government, after paying back almost $70 billion of Labor's debt and achieving record and generationally low unemployment of less than six per cent, we are in a position to do for all Australians what this budget does. We are in a situation where business confidence is very high, where the Australian economy is performing as well as any in the world and where the government has shown that it is in firm control of the economy and that it certainly has an eye on what Australia will need in the future.
The budget is very much about families. That is obvious to anyone. As the Treasurer has said in recent times, this government views families as the building blocks of our future, and nowhere is that more true than in country and regional areas, such as in the electorate of Parkes. In the next few weeks, between now and the end of June, families all around Australia will receive $600 per child if they receive family tax benefit A, and once they have done their assumptions for the new year they will receive a further $600. They will receive $1,200 in all by the end of the year if they can do their figures in time. In Parkes, where we have 16,000 families, that is no small amount of income and that is no small amount of money to put into the community, especially for needy families such as those who will be receiving this $1,200. If the 16,000-odd families in Parkes had one child per family, that would be approximately $20 million.
The $3,000 baby payment to new mothers which will come in on 1 July provides an opportunity for those mothers who are working, or who want to work, and makes it more affordable for them to take time out from a life which is very different from that which existed when I was young. These days women work, for a variety of reasons. They work because they choose to, because that is what they want to do with their lives; they sometimes work purely to support their families. That is obviously what is happening around Australia today. Mothers and fathers both work—for the family home, for lifestyle or because that is what they want to do. If they want to do that, we should help them to do it. The baby payment will assist them to take time off work to have children. I do not believe, as some have said, that this is going to have any effect on single mothers and so on. This is about helping families to preserve or to get into the lifestyle they want. To suggest that we should penalise all of those mothers who need this sort of assistance simply because of a few who may take advantage of the situation is totally ridiculous. In Parkes, which is certainly one of the older electorates in terms of average age, this is sorely needed. I think the Australian people and Australian governments of all persuasions have come to realise that giving a mother assistance to take time out to have children is something that the community accepts as necessary. 
After what has happened in the last few months, a lot of people have probably forgotten that MedicarePlus is very much a part of this budget. Not only have bulk-billing figures increased for children and concessional card holders; there has also been an increased use of bulk-billing, which has come to the fore very recently. The generous safety net, which has become available to so many Australians, has been a wonderful addition, especially in western New South Wales and the central west. The Medicare safety net will mean that 80 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses will be met, once the annual cost of $300 is reached by families in that bracket. Under Medicare we have also included allied health professions to provide improved health care to Australians. That means that, where a patient has been referred by a doctor to a dentist, a dietician, a therapist, a physio or a chiropractor, 80 per cent of those out-of-pocket expenses will be met. For all Labor's talk about looking after those less fortunate in Australia, this is something that they have never done and never purported to aim to do. The coalition government are able to provide this today, and provide it in a sustainable, long-term manner, because we have had eight years of a very well-managed economy, having paid back $70 billion over the last eight years of the $96 billion of debt run up by the Labor Party, now the opposition.
I am also particularly pleased with what we have been able to do for aged care in this budget. As I said, the electorate of Parkes has a higher average age than a lot of regions in Australia. Broken Hill, which is certainly the most famous regional city in Australia, is much older than most and has a high proportion of people in aged care. Aged care is very important to it. In towns like Dubbo, Forbes and Parkes, aged care is a growth industry. Regional centres with good medical facilities are attracting people from the smaller towns around the electorate.
The Intergenerational Report, which was released with last year's budget, shows where we are heading, despite the fact that the opposition have seen fit to knock back the PBS reforms, which are very necessary. If we do not go down that track, we are going to be in enormous trouble in the future, as the opposition know well. However, they have chosen to play politics with this. We do have very much a changing population. I think this budget recognises, as the last budget did, that we have to deal with that. The necessary policies and programs to deal with an ageing population were in the Intergenerational Report, but this budget, probably more than any budget in the history of Australia, seeks to deal with that. It includes $2.2 billion over five years for more aged care places, far greater subsidies for aged care workers and greater spending on capital works and facilities to better meet the needs of aged care residents.
In recent times this government has put a lot of money into helping aged care facilities build up their infrastructure in western New South Wales. For example, $5 million has gone to Broken Hill over the last few months and $2 million has gone to Condobolin simply to upgrade aged care facilities. Enormous amounts of money are going into aged care, whichever way you look at it. Aged care providers in Parkes will also receive $3,500 per resident. In Broken Hill, on its own, that is probably around $900,000 to further help them improve their facilities, amenities and safety standards. Also, recognising the problems that aged care providers have in training their own workers and retaining them, we have provided 200 aged care nursing scholarships precisely for rural and regional students. 
When I took the committee on ageing around to Alice Springs and Broken Hill in particular, it was shown how hard it is not so much to train but to retain workers in the aged care industry. Broken Hill is a very good example of the fact that when they train them they quite often lose them. Recognising this and helping to train another 200 persons for aged care is enormously important. The government is also increasing the amount of assistance for family carers, well over $100 million over the next four years. This is something carers have been asking for. The government has listened to that and in country areas that is far more important than in most others. 
In this budget agriculture was not forgotten. I think I am right in saying that this is the most money ever allocated to agriculture in a budget. Part of the reason for that, quite obviously, is the cost of the drought. The government made a commitment that, however long this drought took, we were there and we would support farmers, with almost $500 million being spent so far and well over that committed to the future. As the drought continues, as it certainly does in New South Wales as we roll over into the third year of exceptional circumstances, that figure must blow out far beyond that. But the government, the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and  the coalition—The Nationals in particular—have made the commitment that while ever this drought continues so shall the government continue to support farmers. 
The Rural Counselling Service has been financed for a further four years instead of getting annual funding as in the past. There is almost $140 million for a refocused Farm Help program. Almost $67 million is being spent to extend FarmBis, one of the most successful education programs for farmers around Australia. There would have been more money for that except that this is one of those programs that has dollar for dollar funding from the state governments. The state governments cut back in some cases—such as New South Wales, which has cut back on most things—so obviously the Commonwealth had to cut back as well. It would have been more money except for the fact that the state did not want to put in the amount of money it had in the past. There is over $11 million to help the livestock export trade meet the new requirements and regulations coming into force. 
In my electorate the changes to the wine equalisation tax, the WET, make a huge difference. It affects up to $1 million of wineries' domestic wholesale sales. Boutique wineries such as Tanmor Wines, Red Earth Estate, Lazy River Estate, Boora Estate wines and Murrin Bridge Winery—I think almost every winery within the Parkes electorate—will have the WET rebated up to $290,000, so I do not think there will be any wineries still forfeiting money on that account.
There has never been a government more in tune with, or dedicated to, helping small business than the coalition. The help we have given small business is one of the major reasons for the fact that we do have such a strong economy, that we do have unemployment at well under six per cent, which is a generational target that has not been seen, as I said, in an awfully long time. The budget reduces the GST compliance costs for many small businesses. You cannot do that simply by standing up, as the opposition leader does at question time, and talking about policies. You cannot do that unless you have actually put them into practice and unless you have shown that you can manage an economy and do it the way we have done it in the last eight years. We have paid off $70 billion of Labor's debt and we have reduced interest rates to their current low level to produce unemployment figures like that. That is the reason we have been able to come up with a sustainable long-term budget in the way that we have. 
The things I have mentioned are, in many cases, what people would say are the highlights of the budget. Coming from where I do, having lived in western New South Wales all my life and being very much involved in the export trade, I can tell you that for a broadacre-farming, mining and tourism area like ours, which is totally underwritten by exports, mainly agricultural—almost 70 per cent of Australia's agriculture is exported—the highlight in this budget is the investment that the Commonwealth is putting into transport infrastructure.
We have towns like Broken Hill in the far west on the transcontinental railway line. That is still a significant mining area. We have Cobar on the railway line—a very significant mining area. And we have Parkes, which is not just a significant mining area but on the crossroads of the Newell and the Great Western highways and on what will be the crossroads of the transcontinental railway line and, when it is completed, the inland rail which will eventually go from Melbourne through to Brisbane. We have the Mitchell Highway, the Great Western Highway, the Golden Highway, the Silver City Highway and the Cobb Highway. To us, transport infrastructure is life. We know that over the next few years the amount of transport going to ports around Australia is going to double. There is absolutely no way Australia can continue to sustain that kind of transport and movement on our current road system.
As I have said, exports are the lifeblood of the electorate of Parkes and underwrite just about everything we do. It does not matter what industry you are in, exports are what sustain it—be it agriculture, mining, tourism or service. To give you an idea of how important transport is to us, Dubbo has something like 2,200 people involved in the trucking industry out of a population of 40,000. Parkes, as I said, is at the crossroads of the road system and before very long it will also be the crossroads of the rail system in New South Wales.
I am terribly proud to be part of a government that is looking to the future. It is not just looking to the next couple of years but to the next 10 years—in fact, the next 50 years—in making a huge investment in the transport infrastructure of our country. There is $11.4 billion in this budget which will eventually be transformed into upgrading both the road and rail infrastructure around Australia. Without it, we will fail.
I can give you an example of a country that has not had the foresight of Australia: Brazil, a country with the agricultural and, to some extent, the mining ability to overtake Australia, let its infrastructure go—it let its road and rail go—and that has just about crippled it and its ability to export. If we did not do what John Anderson and the coalition government are doing, details of which I think are going to be released on Monday, then we would not be doing the right thing, not just by farmers, miners and those in the tourist industry but by Australia.
I believe this is the big thing in the budget—looking to the future and what we have to do with regard to exports, transport and haulage right around Australia. This budget has roughly $11.4 billion involved in that transport infrastructure. There is $450 million going to the Australian Rail Track Corporation to build new rail infrastructure around Australia. It has recently been announced that ARTC, or the Commonwealth, will be taking over the main lines of New South Wales to create a national rail system under the one facility.
Our major roads are facing huge increases in traffic levels. As I said, freight on our roads is looking likely to double over the next 20 years. We have to get far more of that back on the railways, and AusLink and this infrastructure program are looking to do that. It is not just a matter of whether roads can carry the transport; it is also a matter of safety for ordinary passengers and drivers of cars who are not involved in haulage at all. (Time expired).

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2004-06-01,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005 and cognate bills. This is without doubt a budget that continues the government's efforts to dismantle universal social entitlements, redirect national wealth up the income scale and run an economic program for the benefit of a small elite in the vain belief that their wealth will trickle down to the rest of us. Under this government's so-called reforms, public, Catholic and independent schools are being starved of funds while the country's wealthiest schools receive a funding increase of up to 190 per cent. Universities are again becoming educational citadels accessible only to the children of the elite. Each year, more than 15,000 young people are being turned away from TAFE, despite meeting the entry requirements and at a time when the economy is experiencing an acute shortage of skilled workers. Access to quality and timely health care is becoming increasingly based on the ability to pay rather than on medical need. We face the very real prospect of Medicare becoming a second-class safety net solely for low-income Australians, with everyone else's health care dependent on how much money they have in their pockets. The parents of 46,300 children are unable to find a place for them in long day child care while those who can are facing significantly higher fees. 
What is more, despite the pre-budget expectations, only those earning more than $52,000 a year received a tax cut. It is outrageous that, while I will receive a weekly tax cut worth about $40, many of the people whom I represent in this parliament will receive not a single cent. However, they will pay more for their health care, pay more to educate their children and even pay more for having the phone line connected to their home. The ideological agenda within which the 2004 budget was framed will simply reinforce, if not widen further, existing social and economic inequalities. Many Australians will not receive a dividend from greater national prosperity.
One final general observation I will make with respect to the 2004-05 budget relates to the budgetary ramifications of an ageing population. At the time of last year's budget the Treasurer asserted that it was fiscally unsustainable not to increase the prices of basic medicines. However, just 12 months later the same Treasurer is arguing that it is fiscally sustainable to deliver a $4 billion a year tax cut to the top quarter of Australian taxpayers. Either the Treasurer misrepresented the magnitude of the ageing `crisis' in 2003 to justify making the lives of ill and disadvantaged Australians harder, or he has this year jettisoned long-term fiscal responsibility in the name of political expediency. I raise this contrast to highlight the hypocrisy and what is truly meant by so-called reform under the Howard-Costello government.
I turn now to matters related to my shadow portfolio responsibilities of employment services and training and, in particular, a program which this government considers one of its greatest achievements: the Job Network. Since the last budget, a new three-year Job Network contract, employment services contract 3, has commenced. According to the Howard government, ESC3 represents a revolutionary advancement in labour market policy. Over the past 18 months I have been travelling around the country, talking to not only the managers of Job Network providers but also, more importantly, front-line staff. The feedback I have received has led me to one conclusion: the reality has certainly not lived up to the government's over-hyped rhetoric. In fact, a system which promised greater flexibility, a focus on individual job seekers and a priority for getting people into work has become mired in regulatory activity designed to manage unemployment rather than reduce it. 
Links between Centrelink and the Job Network are complex and bureaucratic, leaving job seekers confused and uncertain about what is required of them. The current combination of administrative Job Search tests and non employment focused mutual obligation requirements, followed by customised assistance that is non-intensive, has created a confusing and complex hybrid. No other OECD country has created such a complex and difficult to navigate service for job seekers. Job Network providers are themselves burdened by substantial administrative tasks and forced to devote a significant amount of time and resources to monitoring job seeker compliance rather than addressing and removing their barriers to sustainable employment. According to Jobs Australia, an organisation that represents not-for-profit Job Network providers, the highly prescriptive nature of service provision enunciated by the third Job Network contract limits the ability of providers to `respond innovatively and creatively to the needs of different job seekers and different labour markets'.
The work of providers has been further undermined by a financial crisis that has been of the government's own making. Changes to the method by which providers are paid—namely, a greater emphasis on outcome payments, as opposed to fees for service—combined with fewer than anticipated job seekers entering the Job Network and requiring the services of providers, have left many organisations struggling to remain financially viable. Already, providers have collapsed and referred their contracts back. Job Network providers servicing rural and remote areas are under particular pressure, and this situation persists despite two government bailouts.
The job seeker account, championed by the government as a significant enhancement to the Job Network and intended for use by providers to purchase services and products that would help job seekers to find and maintain employment, has proven overly bureaucratic and has imposed significant administrative costs on providers. Just this week DEWR revealed in estimates that, more than 10 months into the current financial year, only 40 per cent of the available funds in this account have been used.
At a broader level, Australia's system of employment assistance is one of the most fragmented in the world. Partnership arrangements between the government and non-government sectors are weak, and there are few linkages between federal and state programs. Furthermore, the implementation and operation of the Job Network has been marred by turf wars between the two responsible departments: the Department of Family and Community Services and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. It is important to note that concerns about the Job Network have not come just from the Labor Party. The Productivity Commission and DEWR in the recent past have conducted detailed evaluations of the Job Network's performance, and both assessments provided strong evidence that Job Network providers are provided with too few resources and too few incentives to invest in particularly disadvantaged job seekers.
More recently, the Australian National Audit Office has commenced an audit into the Howard government's handling of the transition to the third Job Network contract. It will also assess whether the Job Network is delivering high-quality services to job seekers. This audit will, no doubt, shed further light on the integrity of the financial model underpinning the system and on the IT problems that have so frustrated staff and will test the government's repeated assertion that the Job Network delivers value for money to taxpayers and superior assistance to job seekers. Nonetheless, given the structural problems we are already aware of, which I outlined earlier, it is not surprising that the number of people receiving benefits for more than 12 months is higher today than it was when the Howard government was first elected. The average duration of unemployment for mature age workers is twice that of younger workers. 
Unemployment amongst our Indigenous communities is currently running at six times the national average. Communities in areas such as Wide Bay in Queensland, the Tweed and the Illawarra in New South Wales, and northern Tasmania have unemployment rates of over 10 per cent; and 860,000 children now live in families where neither parent works. The government's gratuitous self-gratification over the headline unemployment rate conceals growing levels of welfare dependency. If further inroads into welfare dependency, particularly in the forms of long-term unemployment and workless households, are to be made and sustained then the Job Network's structural deficiencies need to be acknowledged and then addressed. In this respect, the 2004 budget was a disappointment and reflected Minister Brough's ongoing state of denial.
I want to outline what the Labor approach will be. To avoid the botched big-bang approach associated with this government's handling of the transition to the third Job Network contract, a Latham Labor government will adopt a very different approach with the next Job Network contract, due to commence on 1 July 2006. In particular, Labor's efforts to strengthen the effectiveness of Australia's system of employment services would be guided by the following key principles: (1) an employment-first focus, where the pace and intensity of assistance will be maintained from day one, with the purpose of getting job seekers into sustainable employment or full-time job-specific training at the earliest possible opportunity; (2) a rights and responsibilities regime that balances the obligations to participate with the right to substantial and meaningful assistance; (3) a clear delineation of responsibilities between the government and non-government sectors; (4) a collaborative partnership not only between non-government organisations and the public sector but also within the non-government sector; (5) recognition and reward for high-performing individuals and organisations within both the public and non-government sectors; (6) consistency and certainty in the delivery of employment services assistance, with reforms rolled out over time to avoid the sudden major changes which inevitably undermine performance and create confusion; and (7) a commitment to timely and independent evidence based evaluation and continuous improvements based upon what works.
In addition to these key principles, Labor from the outset will ensure that providers and their industry bodies are partners in the reform process, not the victims of it. During his budget reply the Leader of the Opposition announced Labor's Youth Guarantee: Learn or Earn. This initiative represents Labor's initial enhancement to Australia's employment service system and will target early school leavers aged 15 to 18. Labor's youth guarantee will be a preventive program which will aim to ensure that no 15- to 18-year-olds leave school early and move onto unemployment benefits. To accomplish this goal, the youth guarantee will provide additional in-school support for at-risk young people. Labor will abolish TAFE fees for VET in Schools and will expand outside school opportunities by providing 7,500 more TAFE places, 7,500 new apprenticeship places and a jobs gateway which will allow young people to gain accredited training while working for a regular employer for up to two years.  
Whichever option a young person decides on, they will receive one-on-one support, advice and encouragement from a training mentor to ensure they stick with it. This intensive level of support is what distinguishes the youth guarantee from current programs. To assist today's teenage job seekers, the youth guarantee will also enhance the Job Network in areas with very high unemployment. The labour market disadvantage confronting early school leavers cannot be overstated. Research reveals that, seven years after leaving school, only seven per cent of all year 12 leavers are unemployed. By comparison, 21 per cent of young men who left school early are unemployed and for young women the unemployment rate hovers around 60 per cent. 
To date the government's critique of the youth guarantee has varied. Some in the government have complained that it is not being introduced soon enough, while others deny there is a youth unemployment problem. For the benefit of government members, I would like to spend a little time addressing some of the more uninformed assertions coming from ministers. Assertion No. 1 is that the youth guarantee is just Work for the Dole by another name. This assertion was made by the Treasurer on the ABC's AM program on 14 May 2004. For the record, the youth guarantee is very different. First, to qualify for Work for the Dole an early school leaver must be claiming unemployment benefits for at least six months. The youth guarantee will intervene to ensure that early school leavers never have to claim unemployment benefits in the first place. Second, under-18s are not required to participate in Work for the Dole. It is voluntary—something some in the government do not seem to understand about their own program. The youth guarantee will assist all 15- to 18-year-olds who leave school early or are at risk of doing so. Third, Work for the Dole provides two days a week of work experience in a community based project, with participants receiving little formal training. A Work for the Dole placement is for only six months. Under the youth guarantee, young people not in full-time education or training will be given accredited training or industry recognised skills while working for up to two years in a mainstream workplace.
Assertion No. 2 was made by the minister for youth, Larry Anthony, on the Channel 9 Sunday program on 23 May: `We were the government that introduced mutual obligation.' For the record, this is completely wrong. Mutual obligation was first introduced in 1994 as part of Labor's Working Nation program. However, the Howard government's approach has resulted in the implementation of one-sided mutual obligation initiatives. The government now has a plethora of research which indicates that this punitive approach is actually hindering the ability of job seekers to find work. The youth guarantee will balance the right of young Australians to substantial and meaningful assistance, with the obligation on them to accept it. Under Labor, mutual obligation will no longer be a mechanism to punish youth welfare recipients but a tool to give them the support that they need to secure sustainable employment.
Assertion No. 3 was that the youth guarantee's enhancement to the Job Network, the link-up program, would only help those living in selected regions. In a media release the Minister for Employment Services has claimed: 
Now it's time that they tell us who is in the A-list and who dips out. Then Labor can tell us what it would say to those 23,000 highly disadvantaged unemployed teens who would get nothing out of this policy because they live in the wrong area.  
This is one of the minister's more bizarre statements. By making this statement, the minister is asserting that young job seekers who do not get access to Labor's link-up program and have to rely on existing Job Network services are somehow missing out or receiving substandard assistance. I therefore welcome the minister's acknowledgement that link-up is an enhancement to the Job Network. Again, for the record, despite more than a decade of employment growth there are many communities across Australia where youth unemployment is no longer the exception but the norm. Thirty-seven per cent is the youth unemployment rate in the northern suburbs of Adelaide. In many of these communities the situation has worsened since the last federal election. The Job Network in these disadvantaged communities will benefit from an additional investment of $49.4 million. Young job seekers in other areas will continue to receive existing levels of service from the Job Network determined by individual need. Furthermore, all young people will benefit from the other opportunities provided by the youth guarantee including additional in-school support for at-risk young people, removing TAFE fees for VET in Schools, 7,500 New Apprenticeships places, 7,500 new TAFE places, and the Jobs Gateway. The youth guarantee is a long-term vision to prevent today's early school leavers becoming tomorrow's long-term unemployed. 
The 2004 budget contained no long-term plan to alleviate Australia's growing shortage of skilled workers—a problem that, if not addressed, threatens the country's future economic development. According to Group Training Australia, an organisation that has made a significant contribution to skilling Australia, there are currently national skills shortages in all key trades including all the engineering trades, vehicle trades, construction trades and food trades, as well as electrical, electronics, printing, wood, hairdressing and furniture upholstering trades. The Australian Industry Group, in its submission to the Senate's skills inquiry, reported that `over half of the businesses surveyed faced skills shortages'. Unfortunately, the plight of these employers is likely to worsen. Over the next five years, 175,000 workers are expected to leave the traditional trades, with only 70,000 expected to enter. It is absurd that at a time when more than one in five teenagers are looking for full-time work, businesses are crying out for skilled workers. 
This situation highlights a failure of government policy. Under the Howard government TAFE funding has been cut by $377 million, leaving more than 15,000 young Australians each year without a place. Furthermore, most of the growth in the New Apprenticeships system and in traineeships has occurred in areas where there are no skills shortages, such as retail and private security. If Australia is to address skill bottlenecks and remain fully competitive in the global economy, raising the skill level of our work force is absolutely essential. But this will not be achieved if the Commonwealth government is unwilling to invest in our human capital, fund our public TAFE institutions adequately, ensure our apprenticeship system readies young people for the current and future skill needs of our economy and integrate vocational education and training into our school system. On all four of these tests this budget has failed to make the necessary reforms and investment. Once again the Minister for Education, Science and Training missed the opportunity to have growth funding for the ANTA agreement included in the budget, which remains unsigned, which remains outstanding. He has said that he will negotiate and talk to state and territory ministers in October, well after the election is held and well after he has ceased to be a minister.  
In conclusion, today 2.1 million Australians are living in poverty; 330,000 families are struggling to put a roof over their heads; one in seven children is growing up in a household with no breadwinner; our public hospitals are starved of funds and under pressure; our public schools are run down; tens of thousands of young people are unable to get into either a university or a TAFE college, despite having the marks; public transport desperately needs billions of dollars worth of improvements; and our rivers and farmlands are in urgent need of restoration. After eight years of conservative rule, Australia needs an alternative—an agenda of public sector renewal and of restoring social entitlements. I do not want a society where the middle class are fighting to get out of the public health  and education systems. I want them fighting to get into them. Furthermore, I share the views of my Labor colleagues that social justice demands that tax relief be extended down the income scale. So never let it be said that political parties are all the same and that voting is a waste of time.
This year the Australian electorate will face a stark choice: either we can continue to move relentlessly down the free market route in the vain search for more and more material possessions and allow our system of universal social entitlements to be replaced by one of harsh competitive individualism or, through a Labor government, we can reclaim our collective strengths and renewed solidarity to build a society where power and opportunity are in the hands of the many, not a privileged few.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2004-06-01,"—I would like to consider the overview in which this budget has been framed. The Australian economy is forecast to grow at over three per cent in the immediate future. We have already had 13 years of continuous economic growth, and the budget forecasts predict that this will continue. This is one of the longest periods of economic expansion that Australia has ever known. The budgets in the future will be in surplus. Of the nine budgets that Treasurer Peter Costello has delivered, seven have been in surplus. The last five delivered by Labor were all deficit budgets. In eight years this government has moved from a budget deficit of two per cent of GDP, or $10 billion, to a surplus of 0.3 per cent of GDP. When Labor lost office, government debt was $96 billion, or almost one-fifth the size of the Australian economy. Government debt today is less than $25 billion, or just under three per cent of GDP.
If you look around the world at most developed countries, certainly those in Europe such as Germany and other OECD countries, on average you see government debt levels of 50 per cent or more, and they have been increasing over recent years. Our government debt is just under three per cent of GDP. The average OECD budget deficit is 3.7 per cent. Australia has a 0.3 per cent of GDP budget surplus. The important thing about reducing debt is that it has enabled the Howard government to spend more specifically in the areas of health, family and community services and child care because we are not paying as much interest on the debt that was left to us by Labor.
It is predicted that strong economic growth and low inflation will continue, and over the next year a stronger world economy should help growth as our exports recover. Inflation will again be two per cent or less over the next year. Unemployment has been about 5.6 per cent for some time now, and that is now the lowest unemployment rate we have seen since May or June of 1981. Compare this with an OECD average unemployment rate of seven per cent. So we have the golden triad of unemployment below six per cent, growth more than three per cent and inflation less than three per cent. The last time you would have seen that in Australia would have been in the late 1960s and early 1970s. We have not seen those three things in our economy since Whitlam. We have not had an economy like that since Whitlam. This is not the result of some happy accident; it is not the result of serendipity. It has come through sound management of the economy by the government and the independent Reserve Bank conducting monetary policy and targeting inflation in a very effective, sound way. 
A lot of this budget is focused on families. But already the government has delivered a lot for families. We have seen child-care places increase by 85 per cent since 1996. A lot of that increase has come in the area of out of school hours care. Remember the days when mortgage rates were up around the 17 per cent mark? In 1989 and 1990, when Labor were last in office, they were 10½ per cent. They are now around six or seven per cent, and this provides very significant relief to families with mortgages. The base rate of family assistance in January 1996 was $600 per child. It will be $1,700 per child in July 2004. So it took from 1901 to 1996 to get up to a level of $600 per child. In eight years of the Howard government that amount has almost tripled.
One of the important issues that Australia faces is the ageing of the population. We expect over the next 40 years to have a doubling of the proportion of the population who are over 65 and a quadrupling of the number of those who are over 80. Part of the reason is that people are living longer, but another part of the reason is that our fertility rate has fallen. Our fertility rate was about three children per woman in the early 1960s. It fell below replacement level—that is, 2.1 children per woman—in 1978, and the current fertility rate is 1.73 children per woman. This compares with fertility rates in New Zealand and the United States, comparable countries to Australia, of over two children.
But within the OECD Australia is in the top quarter of countries ranked according to fertility rates. Some of the countries in southern Europe—Italy and Greece—as well as Japan and South Korea, have fertility rates of about 1.2 or 1.3. The lower the fertility rate, the faster the population ages. Can we do anything about the fertility rate? Experience internationally has shown that where they have introduced measures—in France and Sweden and so on—they have made small changes in the fertility rate, but often that involves bringing forward planned babies.
British sociologist Catherine Hakim, in looking at the whole issue of work and family, has said that women broadly fall into three categories: 20 per cent of women are focused on career, 20 per cent are principally focused on family and 60 per cent are what she terms `adaptive'. In considering work and family issues, one of the solutions raised was paid maternity leave. The problem with paid maternity leave is that it applies to one specific group of women, one specific group of families. It does not apply to all. I think this budget, with the income tax cuts but also all the family measures, is a much better solution because it will fit a much broader group of families and it means that people will be able to arrange affairs to suit themselves.
For households, there are three interlocking parts to this budget. First of all, there are the income tax cuts. People earning between $21,601 and $63,000 are going to pay only 30c in the dollar. For every extra dollar they earn, they will only pay 30c tax in the dollar. This means 80 per cent of taxpayers will be paying 30c or less on every extra dollar earned, and people will only be in the top tax rate when they earn over $80,000. Before these changes, you were in the top tax rate once you earned over $62,500. 
Second, there are the family benefits. These are very significant, and there are five aspects. There is a maternity payment for babies born after 1 July this year. That is originally $3,000 and will ultimately increase to $5,000. There are 40,000 extra out of school hours care places and also 4,000 family day care places. There are reduced taper rates for the family tax benefit part A and part B, and this is very significant in reducing the effective marginal tax rates. But, more significantly, reducing the overall tax rate does help to reduce effective marginal tax rates. Last of all, there is a lump sum for all families who are eligible for or are receiving the family tax benefit part A. That is $600 before 30 June—they should receive it about mid-June—and they will also receive another $600 in the next financial year after they reconcile their tax statement.
Third, there is the super co-contribution. This has been increased to a maximum of $1,500 for a $1,000 voluntary contribution for those on incomes below $28,000—and there is still some benefit until incomes reach $58,000. This is a measure to encourage people to save, because we have seen that employer contributions to super have been growing strongly, but the level of voluntary contributions has been much more variable. Some members will have seen the ads where you put $1 in a piggy bank and the government puts in $1; now the government is going to put in $1.50. So you have those three interlocking things affecting households—the super co-contribution, the family benefits and the income tax cuts.
Some people have said, `The income tax cuts are only at the higher end; they are only for people on incomes above $52,000.' What that ignores is that people who are on incomes of $20,000 have already had their tax reduced by $2,145, or 23 per cent, through A New Tax System, which we introduced on 1 July 2000. Those on incomes of $50,000 have had their tax reduced by 21 per cent. The people who are on the higher incomes—people on incomes of $90,000, for example—after this year's tax cuts will have their tax reduced by 18 per cent. So, proportionally, after these tax cuts people on higher incomes will still not have had their income tax reduced by as much as the reductions in the taxes of people on lower incomes.
Very importantly, this is a budget which is targeted, and it is very much targeted at families on lower and middle incomes. I will give some examples taken from the cameos in the government's booklet More help for families. A single-income family on $35,000, with one child under five, pays $1,849 in tax. In this year's budget, after increased family assistance and the increased government co-contribution per annum, they are entitled to receive an extra $1,674 per annum. Taking into account their family assistance, right now they pay $1,849 to the government. After this budget, they will be paying $175 to the government. That is more than a 90 per cent reduction in the amount that this family, a single-income family on $35,000, will be paying to the government. It means that a single-income family on $35,000, after these budget measures, will have a disposable income of $34,825—virtually the same.
Let us look at a dual-income family with three children, one aged under five and two aged five to 12, and a family income of $55,000, with a fifty-fifty income split. They currently pay $6,384 to the government, after taking into account income support payments and family tax benefits. They will receive an extra $4,571 per annum in this budget. It leaves them with a net transfer to the government of just $1,813. So they pay $6,384 to the government now; after this budget they will be paying $1,813. Their disposable income is very close to their actual income: just over $53,000. 
Let us again look at a dual-income family with three kids, with a one-third to two-thirds split and an income of $60,000—one parent on $40,000 and one on $20,000. The existing net transfer to the government for this family is $7,958. After this year's budget the benefit to this family is $3,961 per annum. This halves the effective tax that this family is paying. The income is $60,000 for this family; the disposable income is $52,042 pre-budget, but post-budget it will be $56,003.
These are just random examples. They are not the biggest recipients in the budget by any means; they are typical families. This demonstrates that, through the combination of income tax cuts and, particularly, family benefits and the super co-contributions, there are a lot of benefits in this budget for families on lower and middle incomes.
The biggest recipient of all is a dual-income family, again with three children. One parent is on $44,000; the other parent is on $11,000. So there is a principal breadwinner, but there is someone earning some additional money to add to the household income. The existing transfer to the government now is $7,195. The benefit they receive from this budget amounts to $6,123.88. The income now is $55,000; the pre-budget disposable income is $47,806 but the post-budget disposable income is $53,929. This means that, for this family, the amount of money that they give the government has been reduced by 85 per cent—again, a very significant benefit for families.
There are other aspects of the budget that affect particular classes of people. There are 27,900 extra aged care places. There is $513 million—that is, $500 per bed—for residential facilities to improve safety in building standards. This will be given before 30 June. There have been previous announcements not only on education and, again, record funding for schools but also, more importantly, on things that are very important to this government: choice for families in schools, enforcing literacy and numeracy standards, encouraging better literacy and numeracy and having better reporting to parents.
As for carers—this is a measure that not many people are aware of yet—there is a $1,000 bonus payment for recipients of the carer payment, and that is due before 30 June 2004. There is a $600 payment for recipients of the carer allowance, again due before 30 June 2004. There is an expanded eligibility of the carer allowance applying to those who do not live with a care recipient. There is also up to four weeks respite care per year for parents over 70 with a child with a disability. In this budget the Australian government is spending $41 billion on health and aged services. That is a doubling of the amount of money that was spent eight years ago on health and aged services. About 10 years ago, approximately 8.5 per cent of GDP was spent on health. The figure is now about 9.3 per cent. All of that increase has come from the Commonwealth government. None of it has come from the state or territory governments or from people's pockets.
A very important reform that this government undertook was the introduction of A New Tax System, including the GST. As members will be aware, all GST revenue goes to the state and territory governments. This budget shows that all states and territories are better off. My state of South Australia will receive $130 million more. Many states and territories will receive more. Queensland is the real standout in being way ahead in the GST revenue that it receives. Part of this reform was the abolition of a number of inefficient taxes. One of the last ones to go will be the bank account debits tax, which will be abolished on 1 July 2005. 
I commend this budget. As I have said, the important points in understanding the benefits of the budget, which opposition members have not got their minds around, are the three interlocking parts: the result of the income tax cuts, the result of the very significant increases in family assistance, and the super contribution. All in all there is an extra $37 billion going into households and to families over the next four years. That will provide significant relief to families, who are a very important part of our society.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,2004-06-01,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005. One of the advantages of this debate is that it permits a wide-ranging examination of different aspects of government policy. Tonight I intend to focus on a number of particular matters which constituents have brought to my attention over the last six months or more, all of which relate to priority decisions taken by this government and expenditure choices which have not been to the advantage of those whom I represent. We have just heard a strong defence of the government's priority setting in relation to this budget. It would be churlish not to recognise that within the budget there are a number of initiatives which ought to be welcomed. The Leader of the Opposition has welcomed a number of those initiatives, as has, I imagine, every member of the opposition. 
The sad fact is that this budget is narrowly targeted. It excludes from its benefits mostly those who fall within the earnings ranges below $52,000. There are particular exceptions that relate to those with families at certain stages of their development, and noone would begrudge that, but it excludes from benefit more than half of the Australian population. That is a particularly significant omission in my own state of Tasmania where, compared with the rest of Australia, we have the lowest average earnings and the highest levels of welfare entitlement. It is not always the case that people who find themselves requiring assistance from the Commonwealth are people whom we should in any way scorn. That seems to be one of the messages from this government: if you are a pensioner, a beneficiary or somebody who is seeking work but who is currently unemployed, you are really left out of this government's area of attention or focus.
I received an email from my office today. A constituent came into my office. He is 63 years of age, and he asked my staff to pass on his comments to you. He had been working as a volunteer overseas for eight years. He has arrived back in Australia and is looking for work but, at 63 years of age, Centrelink, through Salvation Army Employment Plus, is making him participate in a retraining scheme to make him employable again. If they had a focused and well-targeted scheme directed at somebody 63 years of age he would not be complaining, but he makes the point that the training is focused on younger participants and is hardly relevant to him. He is particularly concerned that he is essentially being forced to go through a program that is not directed to his needs simply because the government has an arrangement in place—a test which it is necessary to sit in order to secure benefits to put food on the table but which is not focused on his actual needs. Similar stories are legion, and I do not think anybody in the government or the opposition would not know of instances of that kind.
I instance another case where a pensioner wrote to me about his circumstances. I do not want to put names on the record, because it would be a breach of privacy, but this is the letter I received, typed out neatly. He says that he wants to let me know how the little people who make up the majority of the community are getting on. He sets out his weekly income—his pension of $281.95—and the outgoings. It is all neatly ruled up and set out in blue biro. He points out that he pays rent to a real estate company, acting for his landlord, of $105 a week, which is a very modest rent. He pays $19.23 a week for electricity and $9.60 for the telephone. It is not much, is it? Surely a person who, because of their income, is unable to use the phone frivolously uses it only as needed. Pharmaceuticals cost him $24.88—and he has included a list of the drugs that he is required to take. He has budgeted $3.22 a week for dental, 61c a week for hearing aids, 48c a week for eyeglasses, $19 for loan repayments to Centrelink and $28.50 for personal finance, because his capital has been run down. He has a carer cost on pension days to shop and pay accounts of $10 a week. That is $20 once a fortnight. Other expenses are: entertainment, nil; travel, nil; cigarettes and alcohol, nil; outings, nil; and supermarkets and foodstuffs, $50 a week. Members of this parliament would think nothing of picking up some takeaway for $50 a night. I do it. I do not make any particular point of partisanship here. All of us would do that for our families. He pays $50 a week for food. He lists clothing as Salvation Army, $5 a week; and sundries, placed aside for stationery et cetera, $6.43. The total is $281.95. Every cent is accounted for there. This is a man who is obviously getting by through being thrifty and careful, and there is not a single thing in this budget for him—not a single thing. 
All I can say is that I hear what is said about the benefits that go to some people in certain categories if they have certain kinds of dependants—you can always make a case based on statistics—but this really was a big end of town budget. For those few who are in the $35,000 or $44,000 a year group who fall within circumstances where they get significant benefits, good luck to them. But the truth is that the vast majority of the benefit goes to those who earn over $55,000 a year. Indeed, the greatest benefit goes to those whose incomes are greater than $82,000 a year. That, again without any party partisan point, includes every member of this parliament.
The effective benefit that each and every one of us in this parliament receives from those tax breaks alone is equivalent to a $5,000 a year—or thereabouts; I do not pretend to any specific accuracy—wage increase. And we all received just the other day an automatic wage increase of a quite substantial amount. Every one of us who is speaking in this House tonight and participating in public life will have received, in just the budget measures and the automatic flow-on from wage increases, wage increases of around $8,000 to $9,000. To ask somebody who has benefited at $33,000 by a particular amount to be particularly grateful is, in those circumstances, a rather large ask. I have got to be careful here, because I do think parliamentarians are actually under-rewarded for the task they undertake in the community. I am not making a partisan attack on our salaries; I am simply making the point that this budget focused the greatest benefits in tax reduction and flow-on benefits to those highest up the income tree and omitted the most needy in our community.
I rarely do this, but when I received that letter from my constituent I saw it almost as if my grandfather had written it, because it had exactly the same care in its particularisation of every cent that needed to be spent because money is tight. When you realise that someone has only got $281.95 a week, and you see how it is spent and you see `entertainment, nil; travel, nil; cigarettes and alcohol, nil; outings, nil' you cloud over for a bit and you wonder why, in a budget that was directed towards an election outcome—which I think is how everybody sees this budget—something could not have been directed towards the interests of those in such a situation. 
I should mention, in terms of my Tasmanian constituents, the issue of health, because we do have a significant and looming problem with an ageing population in Tasmania. That will only be partially addressed by additional aged care places. I took the opportunity the other evening to speak about the fact that Tasmania's demographics show that Tasmanians are ageing at a far greater rate than the national norm. For example, our age profile in 2015 will not be matched in the ACT until 2050. We are going to need to move more rapidly in Tasmania to deal with the looming pressure on aged care. Dealing with it simply on the basis of so many places per so many persons already in those age brackets is not going to anticipate that growing need. It is a case that needs to be made again and again by Tasmanian members, and I simply state it here again.
One of the issues that concerns every elderly person, and everyone else in the community, is bulk-billing. We are seeing a frightening decline in bulk-billing. In March this year I asked the Minister for Health and Ageing certain questions on notice about bulk-billing in my electorate of Denison. Minister Abbott responded by indicating that Medicare statistics by electorate are no longer produced on a quarterly basis, and he provided me with certain statistics on a calendar year basis. The proportion of total unreferred general practice attendances bulk-billed for my electorate was down to 47.4 per cent. The total number of attendances in 2003, the year that the information was provided for, was 460,283, and the average patient contribution for a billed service for unreferred attendances was $10.44.
There is about $2½ million accounted for there in direct health expenses. But that figure is dwarfed when you realise that so many of these attendances are just not being bulk-billed and that people are being forced to pay, as well as meeting the expenses that I have referred to—for example, those my pensioner would meet. If he cannot find a bulk-billing doctor—and that is becoming increasingly difficult, even for those on pensions—that means a significant extra increase on a budget that is already stretched to a point where it can accommodate no more and that already requires borrowings against his Centrelink entitlements. So I am very concerned about the decline in bulk-billing and the failure of the government to develop an effective plan to encourage and to reward doctors to move back into bulk-billing.
I would now like to raise a couple of points which are particular to my own electorate—given the opportunity in the breadth of this debate. The first is a point which has both a national and a state connotation. I have been in correspondence for some time with a former Federal Court judge—the Hon. Russell Fox AC QC. Mr Justice Fox has been advocating the need for a research centre to look at judicial process to ensure that we have the best and most efficient system of administration of justice. Following his representations, I have written to the University of Tasmania commending the initiative to it as a project that would fit well within the university's law school, but I also commend it to the Attorney-General and to the federal minister for education. It is one of those `unsexy' but vital areas of public administration that we in this parliament give insufficient attention to. The efficient management of the judicial system is a dark corner of public administration. It has little academic or public attention, save when particular matters come to light because of the grossness of the way in which delay has occurred or procedures have gone awry.
Routinely, there are large amounts of litigants' money wasted. Procedures are often anachronistic and not properly reformed because attention is not given to them in a strategic and systemic way. I would commend former Justice Fox for his persistence in advocating these measures. He has written on these subjects and I indicated to him that I would raise this in the parliament, and this is an occasion on which I can do so. I would hope that my concerns in that regard are drawn to the attention of the ministers involved by the duty members at the government table. 
Finally, in this wide ranging debate, I highlight concern on behalf of two particular constituents who have raised their concerns about the way in which the new electronic security devices at airports are operating. In both instances those concerns have been drawn to the minister's attention already—in one by a protracted correspondence between my constituent and myself and the minister; in the other, more recently, only by the constituent. In the first instance, the concern was around attempts to screen the person and a bag of their possessions after false traces of explosives were identified in those detection devices. She raised these issues, firstly, because obviously the detection was in error; but, secondly, because she was placed in a situation where she was taken away from her possessions and so was not able to independently verify what was happening, and she felt this was an abuse. She felt humiliated and she was delayed for a long period of time. She felt she was treated without any courtesy. She felt that the protocols for it were inadequate—so did I, and I still do. If we are going to subject passengers to these kinds of quite intrusive searches, we should make sure that there can be no complaint later that arises from the way in which they are conducted.
The second instance arose in relation to a child when a child was taken away from their responsible adult and subjected to a search without the adult being able to be present. Again, the expressions of humiliation and anger that come out in that correspondence would be understandable to any parent. If it had been my son I would have been similarly affronted and offended. Both instances have raised the possibility, for example, where these situations arise without supervision and without proper protocols in place of allegations of planting of evidence and the like. Obviously, they did not happen in these cases and, in the end, the child and the adult both got on the plane, much delayed, much frustrated, much angered and much stressed, but nonetheless got on the plane. But the kinds of rubbish responses I have got so far from the minister and his staff really do no credit to them. These things should be fixed rather than defended.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"May, Margaret, MP",LP,2004-06-01,"—This year's appropriation bills, of which Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005 forms part, once again build on the strong economic management this country has continued to enjoy under a coalition government for the past eight years. Our economy has continued to grow against worldwide trends and challenges that noone could ever have predicted. Our economy has continued to grow through the Asian financial and economic collapse. We have survived the devastating SARS epidemic and, of course, September 11, the war in Iraq and the worst drought this country has ever seen. There is not another developed country in the world that enjoys a budget surplus. For the seventh time our budget has been in surplus—although, as the Treasurer has said, it is a prudent surplus. It is certainly not a large surplus, at $2.4 billion, but is indeed a surplus. America does not enjoy a surplus, nor does Britain, nor does France, nor does Germany and nor does Japan. These are the big economies of the world and they are not in as strong a position as we are as we look towards the future. 
So what does this budget mean for Australians? What can they expect in the next 12 months from what I believe to be a family friendly budget? This budget has invested heavily in our future as a country by investing in our people; by continuing to introduce policies that will see Australia maintain low unemployment, low inflation and low interest rates; and, very importantly, by reducing the debt that Labor left behind. That debt has now fallen from $96 billion in net terms to $26 billion. That means more money for Australian families as that debt continues to fall and the government does not have to make the interest payments on the debt. It means more money for services like education, health and aged care and more money for the security for our country, the provision of more help for our families and the income tax cuts.
The Treasurer has indicated on a number of occasions that strong economic management is not an accident. He has said it is not a fluke, and indeed it is not. It takes commitment and discipline to continue to deliver surplus budgets to this country. We all know how hard it is to balance the budget and keep something in the cupboard for an emergency. This government has a record achievement in strengthening its fiscal position. We have met the challenges of the past eight years and still reduced our debt, and the benefits of those achievements mean more for Aussie families and services.
This budget includes the largest package of assistance for families ever, with an additional $19.2 billion over five years. This record amount of funding is a massive investment in Australian families. The coalition government recognises the cost of raising a family and the ongoing costs of providing safe and secure environments for our children, and we have delivered for all Australian families. In the first instance, the family tax benefit will assist 2.2 million Australian families, who will receive increased family assistance. Nearly one million of these families do not pay any tax. You cannot cut tax for people who do not pay it, so this measure will ensure all families eligible for family assistance will receive it directly. In fact, each family receiving family tax benefit in 2003-04 will receive a lump sum payment of $600 per child—so if there are two children, $1,200; if there are three children, $1,800—before 30 June. And these families will also benefit from an increase of $600 a year in the maximum and base rates of family tax benefit A for each dependent child, which will be paid after their 2003-04 reconciliation of entitlement. That is an additional payment over the next 12 months.
This government also recognises the financial struggle couples have when a child is born. There are always added expenses—the baby furniture or the car seat. To help offset some of these expenses the government will provide a maternity payment of $3,000 for each child born from 1 July 2004, and this payment will be increased to $4,000 from July 2006 and $5,000 in July 2008. This maternity allowance will be non-means-tested and paid for every child born. If there are twins born then the figure will double and for triplets—and these mums deserve all the help they can get—it will be $9,000. This is more direct help for families at a time when they need it most.
To further assist families juggling work and family responsibilities, 40,000 more outside school hours places and 4,000 more family day care places have been provided for in this budget—a massive investment in our future providing extra help for those families that are combining work and family responsibilities and currently have difficulty in finding child-care places. To put this package into perspective, it means that since 1996 this government has increased child-care places in child-care centres, family day care and outside school hours care by 266,000 places—a massive increase of around 85 per cent. 
There has been some criticism about the assistance to low-income earners. However, through these measures—that is, through family tax benefits, through the maternity payment and through the extra child-care places—lower income earners will be directly assisted. As I said earlier, close to one million families do not pay tax, so these measures will assist those families directly.
What of the income tax cuts—the unfinished business, as the Treasurer put it—that the Senate would not pass? The income tax cuts for middle-income earners were part of our tax plan in 2000. There was to be income tax relief across the board, but the Senate, because of Labor Party opposition, denied those middle-income earners income tax cuts. Tax relief worth $14.7 billion over the next four years will improve incentives and help families build their futures according to their priorities. The income threshold for the 42 per cent tax rate will be raised from $52,001 to $58,001 in July 2004 and to $63,001 in July 2005. The income threshold for the 47 per cent tax rate will be raised from $62,501 to $70,001 in July 2004 and to $80,001 in July 2005. This tax relief will mean that more than 80 per cent of taxpayers will have a top tax rate of 30 per cent or less for the next four years.
These tax cuts continue the government's commitment to ongoing structural tax reforms and strengthen the international competitiveness of the tax system. The coalition government has always been committed to restructuring the Australian tax system and it has always been our commitment to deliver tax relief by adjusting tax thresholds when it has been fiscally responsible to do so. Another budget surplus has meant that further tax cuts can be delivered and will be delivered if the Labor party supports these cuts in the Senate.
The question of superannuation is often raised with me by constituents. For a number of years people have been told they will not have enough savings for their retirement. Through this budget the government has increased the incentive for low- to middle-income Australians to make additional voluntary savings through the superannuation system. This measure will cost $2.1 billion over the next four years. This measure increases the government's co-contribution from $1,000 to $1,500 to match a $1,000 personal contribution. The maximum government co-contribution of $1,500 will be available to everyone with an income below $28,000 who makes a personal contribution. Previously the income threshold was $27,500. This incentive will phase out at $58,000, but the incentive is essentially geared towards the low-income earner. This superannuation measure is crucial for assisting low-income earners save for their retirement. The superannuation surcharge will be further lowered to 12.5 per cent in 2004-05 and to 7.5 per cent in 2006-07 and following years.
All these family initiatives are against Australia's low unemployment rate of around 5 per cent—a level which has only been reached briefly once before in 23 years. It means that the percentage of the working age population now working is around the highest in 30 years. This is a major benefit of ongoing reforms to labour and product markets and of better macroeconomic management over recent years. Unemployment has fallen in both regional areas and capital cities. In my own southern Gold Coast electorate of McPherson I have watched our unemployment fall from double figures into single digit figures. This is due in no small way to the strength of our economy and successful programs such as Work for the Dole. It has been particularly pleasing to see youth unemployment fall, and this in my view is directly attributable to our policies, including our very strong commitment to Work for the Dole—a program that continues to deliver real outcomes on the Gold Coast. 
This government has made a massive investment in aged care with a positive response to the Hogan review by providing more places, more funding and a commitment to better care for the elderly in our communities. We all know of the challenges our country is facing with an ageing population, decreasing birth rates and an increasing life expectancy. However, this government can be proud of our record in aged care. This budget has continued to build on our commitment to older Australians by providing an extra $2.2 billion over five years to expand the number of aged care places and improve the quality of care and facilities. This government has continued with aged care reforms since 1996 to ensure quality of care for all older Australians. This government are responsible for the introduction of accreditation, certification and the Aged Care Complaints Resolution Scheme. These measures through the Aged Care Act provide a quality framework for residential aged care and the promotion of rights of older Australians.
Carers have also not been forgotten in this budget. In my view, these people provide a valuable service in our community. There are a growing number of ageing carers who care for an adult child with a disability, and the government will provide $255 million for a oneoff carer bonus to be paid to eligible carers in June 2004 in recognition of their role of caring for a person with a disability. The bonus is tax-free and will not be treated as income when calculating social security payments. Parents aged 70 and over who provide primary care for a child with a disability will be guaranteed access to four weeks of respite care per year, and up to two weeks respite per year will be available for a primary carer parent aged between 65 and 69 who needs to be hospitalised.
The Treasurer announced a massive investment in Australia's infrastructure through a new program called AusLink. There is $1.1 billion over five years for our road and rail systems, and this is in addition to the $2 billion announced in January 2004. Under AusLink, the Australian government will take a strategic leadership role in national land transport infrastructure. It will do this by establishing a national land transport plan and through funding processes that give competing land transport solutions and providers equitable access to Australian government funding. As announced in January, the Roads to Recovery program will continue for four years from 200506, providing direct funding to local councils to maintain and upgrade local roads. My own Gold Coast City Council has benefited from this program, and some great projects have come to fruition with this direct assistance from the federal government. Road funding for this great, vast continent is important, and the lack of it often has communities up in arms.
I am delighted that the federal government, through the budget, has confirmed its commitment to the Tugun bypass, a road which is critical for the southern Gold Coast and northern New South Wales regions. We have had an impasse for months on this road. It is the responsibility of two state governments, New South Wales and Queensland, but the federal government put $120 million on the table to assist with the construction. Then came the impasse. New South Wales said no to their land being used, and Queensland wanted a new route which included the resumption of 14 homes. The federal government stood firm that this new route was not in fact a bypass. Finally, last Monday came the announcement that New South Wales would allow the original route. The C4 would go ahead. What a relief for Gold Coast and northern New South Wales residents—particularly those people whose homes were going to be resumed. Those homes that were going to be left behind were going to be left with a sixlane highway in their front yards. At long last commonsense has prevailed.  
The Premier of Queensland has had a real windfall from the federal government, with $343.3 million allocated in 200405 for Queensland land transport infrastructure. It is about time the Queensland government, with its GST windfall, accepted its responsibility and started allocating substantial funding to road infrastructure in Queensland. The state road infrastructure on the Gold Coast is a disgrace. The Queensland government just keeps turning its back on its responsibilities—and this includes the areas of health, education, policing levels and, of course, road infrastructure.
There are many pluses in this budget, and I would like to touch on a couple of areas that I believe will continue building Australia's future. Our environment is very important and precious. Sustainable development is just one of the keys to Australia's continued economic future. The coalition government is committed to fixing the MurrayDarling river system. It has allocated $70 million over three years to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to fund capital works and education activities and to oversee important salinity mitigation work. There is the national water initiative; the extended funding to the Natural Heritage Trust; the extension of the National Landcare Program for two more years, providing an additional $80 million; and additional funding for our government's climate change strategy. For science and innovation, there is a $5.3 billion package that continues and strengthens the successful Backing Australia's Ability program. There is extra funding through the Commercialising Emerging Technologies program. Many SMEs on the Gold Coast have benefited from this program—a great initiative to assist companies with the commercialisation of new and innovative products.
The coalition is providing more resources to build a stronger, more potent Australian Defence Force capable of protecting the home front and tackling strategic international challenges. We all know and understand that the world changed on September 11. Australians expect and want the government to ensure that our borders are protected. There is extra funding to provide counter-terrorism intelligence, regional special forces and counter-terrorism networks. I am delighted that an extra $18 million will be provided for ADF cadets over the next five years. The young men and women who join the cadet forces at school deserve to be supported and encouraged to take this very important path at school. It is a great way of attracting young people to our services. It is also a great way to build discipline and commitment in our young people. The power of the cadet units should not be underestimated.
As a result of this budget Surf Life Saving Australia will receive $1 million over three years to celebrate its centenary year in 2007. This great movement is very much part of Australia's history, and this funding boost will allow it to celebrate and commemorate this special milestone. In my own electorate, the beautiful southern Gold Coast, I have 11 surf-lifesaving clubs who undertake a very important role in protecting our beaches. Surf-lifesavers are volunteers—men and women who give up their weekends to protect Aussies in the surf.
Buried in the budget papers was funding under the life-saving drugs program for a disease called Fabry's disease—a disease that affects only a small number of Australians but is deadly. Fabry's disease is a rare, life-threatening fatal genetic disorder. It is a rare, inherited enzyme deficiency that leads to widespread disruption of tissues and organs, with particular effect on the heart, kidney and brain, causing significant morbidity and a reduction in age-matched lifespan among sufferers. Through the Life Saving Drugs Program the coalition government is providing $41.3 million to treat people with that disease. 
That funding is a very personal achievement for me. I have lobbied for it for over 12 months after meeting constituents who had the disease and after doing my own research. There are two young men on the Gold Coast whose lives will be turned around by this commitment from the coalition government: Mr Andrew Gray and Mr Darren Carmichael. Those two men are only in their early 30s but until recently their quality of life has been nil. Both have suffered strokes and kidney failure. Both have had transplants. Both have needed constant care by their families. The funding of this enzyme replacement therapy will not only improve their quality of life but also actually give them a life—a future to look forward to. In Andrew's case, he wants to marry. In Darren's case, he wants to enjoy his young family. Both of those young men want to enjoy life's simple pleasures—taking a walk on the beach, taking in a movie or going shopping—just to get through a day without falling asleep or feeling the pain. To all the Fabry patients and their families, on behalf of the coalition government I wish you well for the future. I thank my colleagues for their support in bringing about this funding.
These appropriation bills are an enormous investment in our future—in the future of our families and in the future of our business community. They are an investment in protecting, securing and building Australia's future. I commend the bills to the House.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2004-06-01,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005. It seemed to me that the government's 2004 budget was a bit like Christmas in the way in which there was a lead-up raising everyone's expectations. Even the Treasurer referred to the number of `sleeps' before he delivered the budget. The media was full of speculation about the goodies that the Treasurer would be leaving under voters' Christmas trees. And in his budget speech the Treasurer did not bore us with anything more than the list of presents for voters. But after budget day, just like on Boxing Day, there were a few sore heads in voterland. Once all the gift wrapping had been bundled up, some voters realised that their gifts were not as good as someone else's. So instead of a happy budget we finished up with an unhappy one.
The Treasurer appeared to have overlooked one thing. As we so often hear from religious leaders at Christmas time, he had forgotten the real message of the budget. It appears that the real message was delivered a week later on 18 May by the Treasury secretary, Dr Ken Henry. Dr Henry is reported to have described to a group of business leaders the true meaning of the budget. According to Dr Henry:
At issue here is a quite profound public policy choice—as profound as any of the great policy debates of the 1980s. Frankly, it surprises me that the debate hasn't generated a good deal more interest.
Clearly, we were all so preoccupied with opening our budget presents that we did not realise the significance of all those budget giveaways. The real message of the budget had been missed. We should have realised that this budget revealed the government's strategy for dealing with the ageing of the population. The Treasurer did give us a hint in his budget speech when he said:
Over the next forty years the number of Australians of working age will grow only slightly, but the number of Australians over 65 will more than double. Tonight I will announce measures that will work to address this fundamental shift in our society. 
And that was the only mention of the real meaning of the government's budget. But, if we take it at face value, the Treasurer would have us believe that the way to ensure that Australia has the resources to meet the demands created by an ageing population is through increased growth. There is no need to reduce spending in non-essential areas. There is no need to increase taxes; in fact, we should cut taxes. That sounds a lot like having your Christmas cake and eating it too. But there it is: the government's strategy to cope with the ageing population is to cut taxes and to increase cash handouts.
I am sure the Treasurer had a real fight on his hands to get those measures through the cabinet. The theory is that lower taxes will act as an incentive to increase productivity. There is a ghost from Christmas past. I am sure we all remember that famous word `incentivation'. That is what is going to save Australia from the crisis of an ageing population. There really was no need to try to increase prescription charges like the Treasurer wanted to do two years ago when he brought down his first Intergenerational Report. Now he has seen the light and `incentivation' is going to save us. But the good Dr Henry did give us one important insight and one that the Treasurer likes to joke about: the reason for concern with an ageing population is not the baby boomer retirement bulge but the halving of the fertility rate from 3.4 in the 1960s to 1.7 today. The obvious effect of this is that the ratio of people in the work force to those of retirement age is increasing to over 100 per cent. We can expect to have fewer people in work than there are retired people or children not yet in the work force. Hence the Treasurer's plea to Australians to go forth and multiply.
Of course, this followed the Treasurer's call to Australian workers last year to `work until you drop', but let me go back to those fertility figures of 40 years ago. That was, of course, before the contraceptive pill came along. Back then the fertility rate was 3.4, and back then 38 per cent of women had full-time employment. Today the fertility rate at 1.7 is half what is was, but the participation rate of women in full-time employment remains at 38 per cent. There is a lot more female employment in part-time jobs and there is no doubting that many women with families prefer part-time work.
But you have to ask: how did our mothers manage to hold down full-time jobs with twice as many kids as mothers today? The answer is that a lot of mothers have opted out of the work force or limited their hours, even if they do not have young children. What is quite perverse is that younger mothers are more likely to work to pay off their high mortgages. So you would expect the government to offer incentives for the many women not in the work force or those only working a few hours a week to increase their hours of work. But what have we found in this government's policies? Where is the `incentivation'? In its now scrapped baby bonus, the government gave the highest payment to mothers who stayed at home. Again, the government's family tax benefit part B gives the greatest benefit to stay-at-home mums. Family tax benefit part A penalises combined incomes. When it comes to tax cuts, only those well above the median for female earnings gain anything at all.
The effect of the budget can be seen in the example given by Elizabeth Hill of Sydney University. If you look at two families each with a combined income of $100,000 a year, if each partner earns $50,000, their gain from the budget is $7.69 a week. But, for a family where the mother earned $20,000, the family would be $42.21 a week better off. That is what the Treasurer calls incentive! 
I am reminded of a conversation I had some years ago with a Liberal member of this House—I think it was back in 1999. We were talking about how boring not all but some branch meetings can be. I was saying how I was sick of hearing about local government problems, and he was telling me how he was sick of hearing calls for income splitting at every meeting he went to. Obviously, the Treasurer has been listening to his branch members, because this budget takes us one step closer to that Liberal light on the hill—income splitting.
In this budget the Treasurer promised changes to family tax benefit part B. This incentive provides up to $2,920 per year to families with a child under the age of five, or $2,036 for families with a child aged up to 18. But the benefit is targeted to stay-at-home mothers and mothers who work only a few hours per week. While the budget extended the cut-off for the benefit to mothers earning up to $360 per week, this is well below the minimum wage for mothers in full-time employment.
A family loses 20c for each dollar over $4,000 earned by the mother. So a mother with a child under five who works 20 hours per week at $18 an hour would get no benefit at all. If you add the cost of child care, it hardly makes it worthwhile to go out to work. At the same time, the North Shore mother of a 17-year-old student who spends her time in the gym or on the tennis court can get $2,036 per year regardless of her husband's income.
I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, where is the incentive to go out to work? And where does this leave the Treasurer's strategy as outlined in the budget papers? `The budget puts in place a series of major initiatives aimed at boosting Australia's medium-term growth potential and addressing the ageing of the population through increased participation and productivity.' What incentive is there for increased participation? Earlier this year the Treasurer outlined measures to encourage older workers to remain in the work force—an extension on his `work till you drop' command from last year—but where is the call to encourage higher participation from women? The incentives are all loaded in favour of reduced participation. It is not even a level playing field.
Today, more than half of the students in our universities are women. Half of our nation's best and brightest are women. Many will work full time after graduation for the better part of their working lives but many will not. The very people who are the key to improving Australia's productivity are not encouraged to participate. And why would they—when child care and after school care are so hard to find, when family friendly workplaces are so rare, when maternity leave is available to only a few, and motherhood is seen as a break in careers? These are all areas that will take some effort to overcome.
But where is the incentive in this budget to encourage university educated women to re-enter the work force or to increase their working hours? There is no incentive. The government thinks that only the higher paid need incentives. The government cannot move beyond its white picket fence image of the Australian family—the male breadwinner and the stay-at-home mum. Australia's participation rates for women are well below most other developed countries, and women's participation is not just in low-skilled areas. Today more than half of our university graduates are women. Women make up the great majority of professions such as nursing and teaching. These are professions for which there is a growing demand. Other professions in high demand also have a high proportion of women graduates, including accounting and business services. So it is foolish for the government to bank on incentives for high-income earners to earn even more when it offers incentives for mothers to stay out of the work force. 
I thought those male breadwinner and stay-at-home mum ideas went out of fashion along with the Barrier Industrial Council. But the government still keeps talking about choice and funding subsidies for stay-at-home mothers. In the real world—thanks to outrageous housing prices and huge mortgages that this government has encouraged—more and more mothers are forced to return to work before their children reach school age. That makes it doubly unfair for the government to provide a subsidy for some mothers to stay at home even when their children are well and truly grown. We once talked about the idle rich. But, when the Treasurer talks about the need for older Australians to stay in the work force but pays idle mothers to stay at home, you have to wonder how serious this government is about increasing participation.
But the government's big worry with an ageing population is not that we cannot afford the cost of pensions and medical care; the biggest worry is that, as the proportion of the population in work declines, the cost of labour will rise, and that will have a major impact on the cost of delivering government services and businesses will face higher wage costs. So the decisions of governments today will have effects for decades to come.
Unless we confront the issue of work force participation rates now, we will entrench lifestyles which will make Australia an economic backwater in the years ahead. Governments have to grasp the nettle of balancing work and family life. At a time when female participation rates in the work force need to increase, this government is giving subsidies to women to stay out of the work force. Instead of providing for child care and after school care for mothers who go out to work, it is giving subsidies to women to work out in the gym. Instead of assisting low- and middle-income families facing high mortgage payments, it is assisting high-income earners to lower their tax and lower their superannuation surcharge. Instead of giving tax cuts to low- and middle-income families, the biggest tax cuts go to the high-income earners.
What concerns me most about this giveaway budget is the sheer size of the government's spending. When you consider the fact that only one in five taxpayers get any relief, you have to wonder just how fair this budget is and what room there is left in coming years to give tax relief to low and middle-income earners. The Treasurer has learned from Marie Antoinette that it is cheaper to give cake to the few rich people than it is to give bread to the rest. As with everything in this budget, the solution to every problem is to throw more money at it. One area of the budget where this approach has been used concerns me greatly. The Treasurer, with his hand over his heart, tells us:
... carers who look after those with disabilities are unsung heroes.
He went on to say:
We deeply value the work these people do.
Like Santa Claus, he announced a $1,000 one-off bonus to people on a carer payment and $600 for those on Carer Allowance. Like a rich man throwing a few coins in the poor box, the Treasurer has eased his conscience. When I spoke to carers in my electorate of Fowler, their reaction was the same: `Thanks for the money, but what we really need is respite.' If they paid the money out for respite care it would not go very far. 
It is typical of this Treasurer and of this whole budget strategy: everything can be solved with a few dollars here and a few dollars there. There is no strategy to deal with an uncertain world economic future. In 1996, the Prime Minister spoke of the recovery from the recession of the early 1990s as `five minutes of sunshine'. To listen to the Treasurer, you would think that the Australian economy will continue to bask in sunshine while ever he is the Treasurer. There is no strategy to address our ballooning levels of private debt. There is no strategy other than hoping and praying that our mushrooming trade deficit will be turned around. There is no strategy to counter the exploding overseas borrowings by Australians. There is no acknowledgment that underlying problems in the United States and measures taken by China to contain growth will not affect our economy in years ahead. As far as the Treasurer is concerned the good times will continue to roll on, and the Treasurer is betting our future on this roll of the dice. There is no vision for the future; there is no vision at all. This Treasurer and this government cannot see past the next election.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Hawker, David, MP",LP,2004-06-01,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005 and to support what I believe is an excellent budget that the federal Treasurer has brought down. Yet again, not only is it a great budget but it also builds on the excellent economic management that the Howard government has demonstrated since being elected in 1996. We are seeing that in many ways, with the fact that the economy continues to grow. In my region, for example, I think it is as good as I have ever seen it in terms of unemployment falling and the general optimism when you walk around parts of my electorate and just see the way people feel they have a real future. That is the real message that has come out of this budget: that it builds on that strength. It is to the Treasurer's credit that we continue to not only see that happening, but also by international standards, when you pick up any recent copy of the Economist, that world renowned magazine, and look in the back of it, not only does Australia top the table—because we happen to start with A—but you also look at the performance figures and by all the major measures Australia is right up there at the top. It is, I think, truly impressive.
I contrast that with the comments from the Leader of the Opposition, and the sorts of things that he has demonstrated in the past, because I think that is the best indication of what we would have were he, unfortunately for Australia, ever to become leader of a government. Looking at that past, it really does frighten me—in fact, it terrifies me. I start by looking at the Leader of the Opposition's mentor. Some of us have very vivid memories of the Whitlam government. It was, in my belief, the worst government that Australia has seen since World War II. I cannot speak for the time before that, but it was certainly the worst in that period. 
To quickly illustrate the point, look at the cavalier fashion with which the Whitlam government assumed office. Who could forget a government with such arrogance that it started off with just two ministers sharing all portfolios and the subsequent bragging about how they could make decisions when they only had a cabinet of two? They did not have any opposition. Both Whitlam and Barnard thought all their Christmases had come at once and they set in train what, as I say, was the most disastrous government we have ever seen. I reiterate: this is the man who not only mentored the Leader of the Opposition but in fact employed him for some time after he had been Prime Minister.
We can look at a couple of other things about the Whitlam government. He had five treasurers in three years. What sort of stability is that? He just fired them when they were no good. One year, as I recall, expenditure went up 40 per cent, and I can remember when inflation took off. When Clyde Cameron was the minister for labour, he encouraged unions to go to the arbitration commission to get a pay rise because he trusted them. Subsequently he recanted and said he was duped by the unions because they did not deliver on what they said they would if they got the pay rise. Do you remember the Khemlani affair? It was a never-ending stream of disasters. Those are the sorts of things that are being passed on to the current Leader of the Opposition by what he would probably see as his No. 1 mentor. 
The second thing that I think we ought to look at is the whole question of getting ideas from other people. We all know that in politics, as in many areas, we are always casting around for ideas from other people, and we are always looking to try to pick the best of other people's suggestions. There is nothing new about that, but I think we have to look at the way that that is handled. I would like to go back to an incident that occurred in May 1996. I am sure the member for Fairfax will remember this well. That was when the member for Werriwa attacked the then member for Cowan about plagiarism. The then member for Cowan was accused of taking an article that had been published by Peter Drucker and using it for a speech. But what the member for Werriwa said about that is quite salutary and is something that he ought to be reminded of, given what has happened since. Day after day, more and more examples are coming forward where he is quite happy to take other people's ideas and not, in most cases, attribute where they came from. It first came up as a question to the Speaker about plagiarism, when the member for Werriwa asked `whether plagiarism is an acceptable practice in this House'. He went further and said: 
... will you recommend a standing order dealing with this practice?
 And thirdly—
... how will you deal with the breach of copyright and intellectual property rights by the member for Cowan?
There is no uncertainty about where the member for Werriwa stood when he wanted to hop into someone from the other side. He went on to have another go—when asked the question about the plagiarism of the then member for Cowan, he said, amongst other things, `I take offence at these comments' over the whole question.
He then went further. He actually moved a suspension of the standing orders that would have prevented the member for Werriwa from moving forthwith that they rejected the then member for Cowan's assertion. The motion said in part that the House expressed its concern at the plagiarism of the published material by the then member for Cowan; noted that this practice was not consistent with the Prime Minister's call, supported by the Speaker, for higher standards; and called on the Procedure Committee, once appointed, to report on an appropriate standing order dealing with plagiarism. The member for Werriwa then said:
This is a very serious issue. This goes to the heart of the integrity and reputation of this national parliament.
These are the member for Werriwa's own words. It gets better. He then said: 
I could not think of anything worse than a member in this place coming in and lifting the comments—word for word, sentence for sentence, paragraph for paragraph—of an American citizen ... It is a shabby practice.
He went on to say: 
This is a massive deceit ... If the member for Cowan were at an Australian university, he would be struck down. He would be thrown out of that university for being a plagiarist.
He went further. He said:
Even worse, we have all been slurred with the accusation of plagiarism.
As I said, he accused the then member for Cowan of saying that everyone does it. The response of Mr Latham, the member for Werriwa, is salutary. On 28 May he said:
I can assure the House that not everybody does it. I do not do it ...
I repeat: that is the member for Werriwa back on 28 May 1996. He said:
I do not do it—
that is, plagiarism—
I have never done it. It would be foreign to every instinct in my body to walk into this House and give a speech on behalf of the people of Werriwa that I had lifted from someone else's ideas. I would be ashamed of that practice and would immediately apologise to the House.
My, how times have changed! I have a couple of other quotes on this to reinforce what the member for Werriwa thought then as opposed to what he seems to think now. He said:
I could not imagine a lower standard of debate. I could not imagine that in the 95 years since the House of Representatives was formed that there was a lower occasion on which a member blatantly plagiarised the words of an American citizen and pretended to this House that they were his words. He stands condemned ... Most importantly, we should make sure that this never happens again. Never again should a member of the House of Representatives be allowed to plagiarise from published material.
My, how times change! I want to pick up on a couple of those points. The member for Werriwa came back to this in an adjournment debate the next day. He said:
It is well and good for the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) to try to explain this away, but the truth is that, if he were a university student plagiarising as extensively as he did in this House, he would be struck out of the university. If he were a medical researcher plagiarising someone else's materials, he would be struck off his practice. If he were a researcher in any academic field plagiarising this extensively, he would be thrown out of the university.
He then went on to make some further derogatory comments about it, including repeating himself. He concluded by saying to the then member for Cowan:
You are a disgrace to the House of Representatives. No member in 95 years has gone lower than this. You are an absolute disgrace. You should get out of here.
He went on to say:
You are nothing more than a cheat, a fraud and a plagiariser. You stand condemned.
Mr Speaker then pulled him up, and he had to withdraw the last part of it.
I want to refer to a few things that the member for Werriwa likes to use now. It is interesting when we contrast them. Let us take BookStart, which is an idea that came from the UK. The UK had a BookStart program, under which parents would receive a BookStart kit for their baby at the time of their first maternal child health visit. We also had the Aim Higher tertiary program. Now we have the Leader of the Opposition talking about Aim Higher. Then there was the Read Aloud Australia policy. That is funny—there was a Read Aloud America scheme. Then there is Read Aloud Week. Virginia has a Read Aloud to a Child Week. I quote: 
Clinton set up a National Mentoring Partnership, so Latham plans a National Mentoring Foundation. Latham's Bright Futures title for his scheme to attract more male teachers is lifted from a Bright Futures program in Florida. Various US states have `Buddy-up' schemes, so—even though it is a purely American expression—Latham must have a `Buddy-up' scheme, too, as part of his plan to get more men into schools.
Maybe I can get a couple more contrasts. Clinton was quoted as saying:
Every eight-year-old must be able to read, every 12-year-old must be able to log onto the internet, every 18-year-old must be able to go to college, and every adult American must be able to keep on learning for a lifetime.
Let us contrast that with someone else:
Every eight-year-old must be well skilled in literacy and numeracy ... Every 11-year-old—
we dropped a year there—
must be able to log onto the internet ... Every 17-year-old must be ready—
we have to be able to do this younger in Australia—
to extend their education into post-secondary qualifications. Every adult must be able to keep on learning for the rest of their lives.
That is interesting. Then we look at some expressions. `Ladder of opportunity' has also been used by Sir Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and George Bush. `Prosperity with a purpose' has been used by both George Bushes, junior and senior. `Aim higher' is the UK university policy. As for the national mentoring foundation, as I said, Clinton had a national mentoring partnership. Virginia has `read aloud'. George W. Bush established a Department of Homeland Security. As for a passport out of poverty, Lyndon Johnson had a `passport from poverty'. `Australia needs a new government that believes in opportunity for all'; Tony Blair had an expression about opportunity for all. Youth guarantee; that was John Cain in 1985.
So the point I make about this as I come back to the beginning is that it is not a question of whether or not we should take ideas from someone else. However, the Leader of the Opposition seems to have forgotten that in 1996 he made it very clear that he would not be one who did that. He made it absolutely clear when he said:
I can assure the House that not everybody does it—
this is the member for Werriwa—
... I do not do it. I have never done it. It would be foreign to every instinct in my body to walk into this House and give a speech on behalf of the people of Werriwa that I had lifted from someone else's ideas. I would be ashamed of that practice and would immediately apologise to the House.
That quote ought to be put in front of the Leader of the Opposition on a regular basis so that he is reminded of how he has adopted new standards now that he is Leader of the Opposition compared with the ones he held when he was just the member for Werriwa in 1996.
I said at the beginning that I was extremely disturbed at the prospect of a Latham government. I have mentioned some points but I want to make a couple of others. To be the Prime Minister of Australia one requires considerable experience, considerable ability and—I would suggest—considerable achievements. I will go back to a very interesting experience that the Leader of the Opposition had. He was mayor of the city of Liverpool from 1991 to 1994. Before his election, he advocated financial restraint. But once he was elected he immediately doubled his personal allowance. He then went on a $36 million spending spree. Thirty-six million dollars—that has a familiar ring about it. Where else have we heard the figure of $36 million? Is that something to do with Centenary House? It just seemed to come to mind. He went on increasing rates and charges for home owners and especially for businesses. He left the next Liverpool City Council in a predicament that was so bad that it went on a department of local government watch list of councils in deep financial trouble. The auditor of Liverpool City Council described the deficit caused during Mr Latham's term as `certainly among the highest I have ever experienced in my career'. 
These are words of warning to the Australian people that, if they were to ever contemplate electing a Latham government, this is the sort of thing that would happen. We have the Whitlam mentoring, the Whitlam experience, the Whitlam approach to government—and the disasters that that caused—and then we have the current Leader of the Opposition's own experience when he did have time to be in government, albeit at a local government level, and the mess that he clearly left the Liverpool City Council in. Australians ought to be well warned about what this could mean.
As I said at the beginning, the Howard government has put Australia in very good shape. The economy continues to grow in a very strong way and, at the same time, we see unemployment coming down, we see inflation consistently low, we see interest rates significantly lower than they were when the government came to power, and we see the prospects for Australia continuing to be very good. We have seen the government manage us through some very difficult times, particularly the Asian financial crisis of some six years ago, and we see no reason that the prospects for Australia should not continue to be very good. But I do give another word of warning: this does not just happen; it occurs because a lot of hard work is done by the government.
There is no doubt that the expertise developed amongst the ministers of this government is something that all Australians should—at least privately—be proud of. I know members of the opposition would have difficulty ever admitting it, but they would have to secretly have some respect for the way the Australian economy continues to power ahead. I am sure that the opposition would have to agree that a lot of the decisions that have been taken, even though they might not have been popular at the time, have proved to be the right ones and have clearly been a major part of the reason that Australia is now into its 13th year of growth. That is probably the longest period of growth we have seen in the postwar period—and, as I say, that is something that does not just happen. I warn Australians that all that could be put at risk if there were a suggestion that we should change government at the next election. Clearly the Leader of the Opposition has form and has been mentored in a way that would certainly not see him continue to govern Australia in such a fashion.
I strongly support the budget that has been produced by the Treasurer. I believe it is certainly his best. I also believe it will give us the opportunity in the coming year to continue to see Australia go forward in a way that all of us can feel very proud of.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Tanner, Lindsay, MP",ALP,2004-06-01,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005. I want to commence with a perspective on the macroeconomic aspects of the federal budget that was handed down by the Howard government a few weeks ago and later on deal with some issues that are pertinent to my portfolio of communications. 
One of the aspects of the budget that have attracted only very limited commentary but one which I think is crucial for the future of this nation is its positioning in the macroeconomic situation. I think this government has placed Australia's medium-term economic health at some risk by an unduly expansionary budget in committing an additional $52 billion of spending over the forward estimates—devoted entirely to assuring its own re-election—and repeating the pattern that we have seen over many years with the Howard government of frittering away the proceeds of growth and the proceeds of high taxation on pork-barrelling and on dubious programs that are designed to maximise electoral appeal but not necessarily produce decent outcomes for the nation.
We have seen much of the Centenary of Federation fund of approximately $1 billion frittered away in various parts of Australia for the purpose of winning political support for the government rather than producing good outcomes for the Australian economy or the Australian people. The Natural Heritage Trust has been largely a set of piecemeal programs designed to make it look like the government is doing something for the environment rather than to achieve broad positive outcomes for the Australian environment. In my own communications portfolio, the Networking the Nation program was recently analysed by the Auditor-General. It was found that $500 million worth of federal expenditure could not be properly audited, measured or benchmarked and that there was no way that the Auditor-General could determine whether the program had achieved its objectives or whether it had contributed a worthwhile outcome for the Australian economy.
Yet again the Howard government is pursuing a strategy of naked electoral bribes that are designed to maximise its prospects of re-election. In this instance it does so at the expense of the overall strength of the Australian economy. The most obvious of these bribes is the $600 family payment to be made in this financial year to eligible families and, even though in many cases that will be eaten up by the debt that many families owe to the government, it will still be a significant injection of liquidity into the economy.
Together with other measures, over several months this will mean the injection of something like an additional one per cent of GDP into the Australian economy in consumption power or overall demand—pumping up the economy further at a time when we are already seeing the initial emergence of some significant inflationary risks, which in turn put pressure on interest rates. So just when some amber lights are starting to appear on the economic horizon with respect to overheating in our economy—and we do have cause for concern about some of these issues—the government is taking a very serious risk by pumping a very substantial additional amount of consumption, an additional amount of demand, into the Australian economy.
The Treasurer today in question time painted a different picture, suggesting that we will be seeing a slowdown and that that will be to some extent counterbalanced by improvements in other countries and a strengthening of the global recovery. That is yet to be seen; time will tell. I accept that it is conceivable that an increase in liquidity in the Australian economy now could end up not being an unreasonable thing. That is yet to be seen. Nonetheless, the government is taking a very serious macroeconomic risk. There is a high risk that this binge, this party that the government is putting on for the Australian electorate prior to the election, will be followed by a hangover after the election. That is the risk the government is choosing to take, and the risk of course translates into the threat of higher interest rates. 
It is very clear that interest rates are going to have to rise in the United States. That will put substantial pressure on the Australian dollar. The Australian dollar went through a period of significant improvement against the US dollar, as did many other currencies. In recent times the Australian dollar's position has softened somewhat. If the gap between Australian interest rates and United States interest rates increases, as it is almost certain to do over the next six to 12 months, that will put downward pressure on the Australian dollar, which is significantly inflationary.
It is important to note that the most recent inflation figures show that inflation in the domestic component of the Australian economy is running at around four per cent, significantly above the target zone, and that it has only been held back to just under three per cent by the effect of imports, which reflects that rise in the value of the dollar and the fact that import prices have been falling for a time. So we can see the build-up of some not enormous but nonetheless significant inflationary pressures in the Australian economy and threats to interest rates. It is therefore a serious risk for the government to be doing things like parcelling out money that is likely to be spent fairly quickly on consumption in order to guarantee, in its own mind, its re-election.
All of the signs are there that, if the Howard government is re-elected, it will have to take back some of the things that it has given out—that because it has run the surplus down deliberately for its own re-election it will find itself in a position where, if there is an increase in interest rates and a dampening of economic activity, it will be pushing the budget into deficit and be faced with being forced to correct the situation that it has created. I do not believe in budget surpluses for their own sake, nor do the Labor Party. But we do believe in ensuring that, when the economy is strong, when you have consistent growth over a period of time, you do have healthy surpluses—that the budget is in a position where if the economy slows it will automatically be corrected and you will have a change in the budgetary situation that will not have to be the subject of serious changes in policy that will, in a sense, aggravate the slowdown.
That is the reason why it is sensible to run significant surpluses in good times. That is why the process of paring back the surplus to a negligible level, which the government has started on and will complete between now and the election, is a very risky approach. It is an absolute certainty that, by the time we get to the election and by the time we get to the fiscal outlook statement immediately prior to the election, the projected surpluses—which have already been significantly shaved during this budget—will be a lot smaller. They will go down to fractions of $1 billion, at least for the first one or two years and possibly right across the board, in order to ensure that the government maximises its chances of re-election and minimises the amount of room that Labor may have, in the mind of the government, to spend that surplus.
However politically crafty some might think that is, it is not economically responsible, particularly if there are some inflationary threats on the horizon. We have got a consumer debt fuelled boom that is continuing, albeit with some ebb and flow. There are some signs that the housing boom has diminished in electorates like mine; nonetheless, we still have a significant underlying problem. Our current account deficit, as the Treasurer conceded today, is huge. Exports have fallen, as a percentage of GDP, to around 20 per cent, and imports have risen to about 26 per cent of GDP. So there is an enormous current account deficit, which means that the Australian economy is very seriously vulnerable to external shocks and that we need the budget in healthy surplus to protect us from those prospective shocks. 
Even though the government is correct in saying that the drought and, to a much lesser extent, SARS have had a significant impact on our export performance, it is worth noting that in the budget strategy and outlook paper, which sets out the detailed perspectives of the government with respect to the macro-economic situation, you will see that import growth is projected to slow and export growth is projected to improve; but the rate of growth that is projected for imports is still set at nine per cent and the improved rate of growth for exports is set at eight per cent. In other words, even though imports are projected to slow and exports are projected to grow, the rate of growth for imports is still going to exceed the rate of growth for exports.
There are also some worrying signs that the process of diversification of Australia's exports which began under the Hawke government and which is fundamentally important to our future prosperity—where commodities, which used to be 75 to 80 per cent of Australia's total exports came down to about 50 per cent—is starting to go into reverse, that our reliance on commodities is again starting to intensify and that the drive to manufacturing exports and to services exports is starting to run out of steam.
Although this in part reflects changes in commodity prices, it also reflects a mentality which is deep within the Howard government and that no-one has better enunciated than the Deputy Prime Minister, who in an infamous statement in 1997 said, `Australia's economic future lies in improving the quality of our raw material exports'. That mentality, however ludicrous it may be, still lies at the heart of the Howard government, and it reflects a Menzian complacency about the economic future of Australia.
Australia's economic position is slowly deteriorating structurally. Our reliance on debt is mounting all the time. We are in effect borrowing to consume as a nation. We are borrowing to consume, not saving to invest. There has been, in effect, a dissaving or a bigger drawing down of savings via equity loans from housing than there has been an increase in the national income as a result of productivity. In other words, even though we have had the proceeds of considerable economic growth aggregated to individuals in recent years, people have actually borrowed more. The earnings have been cancelled out by a greater degree of going into debt, and that is a serious consideration which will have a day of reckoning at some point for the Australian economy.
We still do not have a serious entrenched export culture in this country. We still have domestic oligopolies dominating crucial sectors like banking, telecommunications and the media, where competition is seen as something of an afterthought and where the Howard government is too frightened to bite the bullet and deal with the hard issues of competition regulation. The Howard government has been obsessed with particular agendas, like privatising Telstra and getting rid of unfair dismissal laws for small business, but when it comes to the big structural issues that are fundamental to the future of competition in the Australian economy and to the broader capacity of our economy to develop a genuine export culture—a genuine export orientation and the skills, research, development and capabilities generally that are necessary to deliver that—the Howard government has been unable to take the big decisions or display the economic leadership.
A classic example of this is broadband. Australians are used to being at the forefront of new technology. We are used to being up there in the list of the first two or three countries with mobile phones, faxes, the Internet and so forth. With broadband, we have gone from 13th in the world league ladder for the degree of broadband access in the home a couple of years ago, which was pretty ordinary, to now 20th. We are going down the ladder. We are deteriorating in our position. That is because of inadequate competition, because of the Howard government's refusal to put any pressure on Telstra and because the Howard government does not think broadband matters all that much. All that the government has done is a few minor exercises that are once again designed, like HiBIS, to look like the government is doing something without actually tackling the problem. 
I was in Penguin in north-west Tasmania with the member for Braddon a week or so ago, and we had a meeting of small businesses there. There was an optometrist, an auto-electrician, a computer salesman and one or two other people in similar kinds of businesses. There would have been people from about eight or 10 small businesses there. They cannot get broadband in Penguin, and they are screaming about it. Believe me, they do not think the Howard government is a great friend of small business, because what they need for their businesses in order to be able to compete and to operate effectively in some traditional old economy kinds of activities as well as the information economy is access to broadband, and the current government really is not that interested.
We need a renewed economic reform agenda in our nation. We need more genuine competition, better fiscal discipline, less pork-barrelling, less massive waste of government money on programs that are nakedly designed to facilitate the reelection of the government, more investment in skills, more investment in education, more investment in training and more investment in research and development. What we do not need is the continued pattern of John Howard, the Prime Minister, imitating his great hero, Sir Robert Menzies. I think that when the history of the Howard government is written, the Prime Minister will, ironically, have achieved one of his great aims, and that is to be compared with Menzies. But the comparison will be that, like Menzies, he presided over a superficially prosperous economy that was structurally declining relative to the concerns and prospects that faced Australia in the global arena, and the issues that needed to be addressed to ensure that Australia had the fundamental structures to be able to compete globally and prosper into the future were not dealt with in this era.
Finally, I want to mention one specific aspect associated with the budget relevant to my portfolio, and that is the ABC. I welcome the fact that the National Interest Initiative has been extended by the government—I am sure that the member for Ballarat is pleased to hear that, because it means that the Ballarat ABC radio station will continue. It is no coincidence that this decision is occurring prior to an election, as the announcement of the original National Interest Initiative occurred prior to a previous election. It is also notable that the government has chosen to marginally increase total ABC funding by between $4 million and $5 million a year. All of these things are a cynical effort to assuage the very genuine concerns in many parts of the Australian community about the government's treatment of the ABC—not only its reductions in funding for the ABC but also, and more importantly, its attempt to intimidate the ABC into supporting the government's political line and its attempts to minimise dissenting points of view getting a voice on the ABC.
The real story for the Howard government with respect to the ABC has been funding cuts that have led to the withdrawal of funding for the two digital multichannels that the ABC had; it has been the drift to tied funding, the Ballarat radio station being one example—the ABC has effectively been given money provided that it uses that money for specific purposes designated by the government; it has been the axing of Behind the News, a very popular children's educational program; and it has been the axing of ABC cadetships and various other things. At the time when these things have been occurring the ABC has been struggling to deal with additional financial burdens such as the transition to digital and the costs associated with that, like the need to have a significant presence online. 
The Howard government has also been rightly criticised by me and many others for stacking the ABC board—putting on the board people like Michael Kroger and Ron Brunton who have no background in broadcasting, no background in public broadcasting and no appropriate expertise that is relevant to the job of being a board member. Most recently we have seen a couple of illustrations of how the Howard government goes about seeking to intimidate the ABC. It has managed to bludgeon the ABC board into agreeing to spend scarce dollars that could have been spent on programs like Behind the News on the continuous monitoring of ABC content by Rehame, not just during an election campaign, as has traditionally been done, but continuously and permanently. That is a waste of money and a waste of scarce resource and it is all about trying to intimidate the ABC into submission and into becoming a propaganda arm of the Liberal Party.
It has also been exposed recently that Ron Brunton—the dubious anthropologist who was appointed to the ABC board with the only credential that he has been involved in some issues that are reported on by the ABC—wrote a so-called essay directed at Media Watch and sent it to the head of programming. That was a direct example of a board member interfering specifically in programming decisions—precisely as Michael Kroger, who was previously on the board, did as well. There are a range of other concerns like the creeping commercialisation of ABC programming and merchandising starting to influence the way in which children's programming is directed. Labor will tackle these issues. We will fund the ABC properly. We will have a genuinely arms-length board appointment process that will get rid of the political rorting of the ABC board.

"Schultz, Alby, MP",LP,2004-06-01,"—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005 and to share with you some of the reactions to this budget within the Hume electorate. Treasurer Peter Costello's ninth federal budget is the most constructive budget for the community that I have seen in all the time that I have been in politics. With so many demands on the government's resources, I must congratulate the Treasurer on putting forward a budget that really has something in it for everyone. It is a clever budget in which the government will maintain a surplus, even after providing $36.7 billion in new assistance to families and tax cuts and increased incentives to boost retirement savings. I am pleased to see that the Australian public has recognised the benefits of this budget. This morning's polls are a positive indication of how well this budget has been received.
The new maternity payment has been particularly well received in the Hume electorate, with many expectant mothers—and, for that matter, fathers—praising the additional support of a $3,000 bonus for each newborn child. As you would all be aware, I have proudly rallied with our Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Pru Goward—who happens to be one of my constituents—in her efforts to achieve paid maternity leave for new mothers. Whilst this initiative is not quite maternity leave, it is still a very generous payment that will help up to 250,000 young families each year to find their feet during this joyous but overwhelming time in their lives. Already my office has received many inquiries from young couples keen to know more about the payment and when it will be available. For them, 1 July cannot come quickly enough. 
Families are also pleased with the addition of 40,000 outside school hours child-care places and an extra 4,000 family day care places. The Hume electorate, like many others, suffers from a shortage of child-care places and long child-care waiting lists. These additional places will be welcomed with open arms by the families with young children who will soon be requiring child care.
I was also pleased to see in this budget the changes to taxation which will benefit middle- to high-income earners by raising the income thresholds for the 42 per cent and 47 per cent tax rates. People these days work very hard for their money, and for those in the middle-income bracket it is often disheartening to see such a large portion of their income being eaten up by tax. These changes will increase the rewards for those who wish to work overtime, seek promotion or acquire new skills. In their coverage of this budget the Goulburn Post newspaper interviewed a local lady, Melissa—who is aged in her late 20s, works full time and is expecting her first child—about her views on the changes. She said:
I have been paying tax since I was 15 and until last night it looked as though we would not receive all that much when our baby was born. My husband works a lot of overtime and is often called out in the middle of the night to fix the power and much of the extra money he earned went in tax. The changes in tax rates will certainly help.
Melissa is just one of the many thousands of Australians who will benefit from these tax breaks. Along with middle-income earners like Melissa, low-income earners will benefit from the government's superannuation co-contribution scheme, which has been improved in this budget, and from the reduction in the superannuation surcharge, worth $2.7 billion over four years. I have already received feedback from constituents who, until now, have not contributed to their own superannuation but will start doing so to take advantage of this generous co-contribution scheme. What person would not put away $1,000 a year if they knew the government would give them an extra $1,500? This measure will certainly boost the incentive for people to save for their own retirement. What is more, over three-quarters of the benefits will go to low- and middle-income earners. I hope and trust the government will properly promote this scheme to ensure those who are eligible reap the full benefits.
—$9 million worth.
—It is interesting that, when you are talking about all the good things for low- and middle-income earners, you get the socialists on the other side of politics raising their ugly little heads and bleating.
It was pleasing to see in the budget something being done to address the decline in the number of specialists who treat gold card holders. The $158 million in additional payments to specialists may not solve the problem, but it will certainly help. In the Southern Highlands region of the Hume electorate this has been an ongoing problem, and I hope those higher payments will encourage specialists to continue treating our veterans. One local GP, Dr Ray Burn from Yass—just north of Canberra—is one of many who has welcomed this announcement. He told the Yass Tribune that the changes should make it easier for GPs to get their patients in to see specialists, particularly in Sydney and Canberra. Whilst this budget has not delivered an increase in the fee paid to GPs who treat veterans, Dr Burn, in true Aussie style, said he expected that many doctors would continue to treat local veterans and he said, `Who's going to knock back an old soldier?'—hear, hear! 
On another health issue, the provision of $15.3 million over four years to enable Australians with diabetes to access insulin infusion pump consumables through the National Diabetes Services Scheme is wonderful news. Some of you may recall the Kids in the House delegation that visited this place last year. In that group was a young lady from the Hume electorate, Sarah Hayes, who has juvenile diabetes. Sarah impressed and inspired me with her maturity and courage in living with this terrible disease. The infusion pump treatment the government is helping to supply to diabetics whose condition is hard to manage will dramatically improve their health and quality of life and will minimise long-term health complications.
I turn now to the measures announced under my colleague the member for Curtin's portfolio. Since the budget was announced my office has heard from a number of carers who are thrilled with the additional investment of $461 million to support them in this vital role. As a society we owe our carers a debt of gratitude. As many of us grow old their role will become increasingly important, as is recognised in this package. Those who will be receiving the $1,000 or $600 bonus this month should be pleased. This tax-free payment will help pay for some additional help, a holiday, or some of the things they have had to go without to care for their loved ones. I am particularly pleased to see recognition of the role young carers play and the commitment of additional respite services for them. I think it is vital that we support our young carers and ensure that their future is looked after through education and training. However, the feedback I have so far received tends to indicate that these measures do not go far enough. Numerous people have asked how we will guarantee respite time in communities where no respite exists. That is a very valid and constructive question to be asking. Perhaps this is something that needs to be more fully explained.
The provision of $2.2 billion over five years to the aged care sector is to be commended and has been well received at a local level. Many aged care facilities in the Hume electorate will be hoping to take advantage of this increase in funding. At Young, the Mercy Care Centre will be hoping to attract some additional community aged care packages. At the moment the service has some 10 people requiring community aged care assistance over and above the 30 currently allocated. In Crookwell, Harley Nursing Home, which was successful in obtaining almost $900,000 for capital works last year, will be applying for additional high-care places under the 2004 funding round. On this issue I thank the minister for her invitation to make a submission to the Aged Care Planning Advisory Committee, which will be making recommendations about the new places available in New South Wales and how they will be allocated. Like assistance for carers, providing adequate care and service for our ageing population is critically important and will continue to become more and more important into the future. As a government we need to work with aged care service providers to ensure their needs and ultimately the needs of those placed in their care are met both now and in the future.
One other area of the budget I would like to touch on is education. There has been much debate in recent times about funding for public schools. But in this budget the government has delivered something that will benefit all children, not just those at public or private schools. We have developed an approach to schooling that will eventually ensure consistency and national benchmarks across all schools in all states. This is something that has been lacking for quite some time. We are spending a record $32 billion in the next four years and investing more in programs to improve literacy and numeracy and to help disadvantaged students. Teachers will be assisted through greater support for high-quality teaching. 
At a state level, residents of New South Wales will be pleased that the Australian government will deliver an additional $113.7 million in GST revenue to the state governments in 2004-05 as part of this budget. Hopefully, they will spend it a little bit more responsibly than they have done in the last 12 months and, more importantly, they will undertake to fulfil their role as the government responsible for infrastructure such as schools and teaching facilities in the state of New South Wales. This money can be directed into schools, hospitals and other priority areas such as roads. I only hope Premier Carr and his Labor government use this extra money wisely and address some of the many concerns currently being expressed by residents in the electorate of Hume.
Finally, turning to small business, I was pleased to see in this budget the rebates for wine producers to offset the wine equalisation tax. The introduction of the wine equalisation tax in 2000 placed a very heavy tax burden on small and medium wineries and made the wine industry Australia's highest taxed rural sector. I am pleased, along with a considerable number of my parliamentary colleagues, that the representations we made as a group have resulted in this equalisation tax being relieved. I hope it results, as I think it will, in keeping many of the smaller wineries in particular in business.
Regional wineries have made a significant contribution to regional Australia, quadrupling employment opportunities during the past decade. I visited one on Sunday: McVittie Grove at Berrima in the electorate of Hume. They have a little restaurant there that they have just opened in the last six weeks. They moved in and bought 42 hectares in 1998, and they have a beautiful little winery up and running in a magnificent part of the country. The scenery was absolutely wonderful. I just want to remind some of my parliamentary colleagues that it is these people who put their life savings on the line and invest in these new businesses that need to be congratulated. They not only take a risk with their capital but also make a significant contribution to attracting people into the area, lifting the number of visits from tourists and offering a very significant quality product in their wines. They are also promoting all of the foods that are grown in the area. So I would like to acknowledge the owners of that winery and other wineries that have not long been established in the Southern Highlands. Some 57,000 people are now employed either directly or indirectly by regional wineries. I commend this taxation relief because it will return operating margins to those small businesses, allowing reinvestment in regional Australia and improved prospects for exporting in the future.
While there may have been many positive things to come out of the budget—and I again congratulate the Treasurer on it—I am disappointed that funding was not made available for the Murrumbateman bypass on the Barton Highway in the electorate of Hume. As you may know, this is a vital roadworks project that I have been working towards since I first came into this place in 1998. While I must thank the Minister for Territories, Local Government and Roads, Senator Ian Campbell, for giving me his time on this issue, and his support and quick action on the equally important Towrang Road project, I must express concern that, again, this local road safety project has been forgotten. Hopefully it has only been a short-term forgetfulness on behalf of the appropriate ministers. I can assure them that I will be reminding them in my vigorous way about the need to make sure that there is some significant construction money made available to ensure that that bypass occurs. 
I say that in the context of road safety in general, regardless of the political colour of the government of the day. One of the problems that I have seen, as a federal and state member over the last 17 years, has been the propensity for ministers of the Crown of all political persuasions to leapfrog duplication of major arterial routes, simply because they want to prop up and promote a candidate for their own political parties, at the expense of road safety. I have been highly critical of this in the past. In fact, I got my knuckles rapped just after the 2001 election for making that comment about the Hume Highway. But the reality is that you deal in fact and you deal in truth. If we have a situation where people are driving on dual carriageways, for example, down a major arterial route from Sydney to Melbourne, such as on the Hume Highway, and they come out of dual carriageways into single-lane carriageways and then go out into dual carriageways and into single-lane carriageways again, when they go into those single-lane carriageways they do not know—particularly at night when they are tired—that they are on single-lane carriageway sections, and they go on to the right-hand side of the road and plough into oncoming vehicles. That is the danger of leapfrogging, and that is the danger of setting political priorities rather than safety priorities on those sorts of roads. I do not make any apologies for saying that, and I would say it if it were a Labor government or a coalition government.
In closing, I think it is very important to say that this series of budget measures addresses the needs of those most in need, our families and older Australians, and is setting the pattern for a commonsense approach to the protection of the future of our country. I reminded my daughter-in-law, who is a young mum with two children, of that the other night. She agreed with me and she said to me, `Would you be kind enough, Alby, to pass on my appreciation as a young mum to your government and, more importantly, to Treasurer Peter Costello.' I can put on the record tonight that I did just that in the joint party room the other day, and I think there will be many more mums and dads who have young children who will be doing a similar thing. 
As the Treasurer so rightly pointed out on budget night, Australia must maintain a strong economy and plan for the future for our ageing population, for our families and for our young people. This budget is designed to do just that. I have to once again congratulate the Treasurer and his team on this budget and I look forward to seeing its significant benefits at work in the Hume electorate. I also have to say that, whilst he can make the money available, it is up to the individual ministers to make sure that the money that they get for their portfolios is fairly and equitably distributed regardless of the political identity of the individual candidates. I believe that is very important because, regardless of who we are and which political party we represent, we represent good people, good Aussies out there, and they deserve to have what all Australians need to have from governments when governments make good decisions and have responsible attitudes to managing the economy, as this government has. Everybody should benefit. 
The polling that came back from the community today, a month after the budget was released, is an indication of what is going to happen in the not-too-distant future, and I can only say to my parliamentary colleagues on the opposite side of politics, `You guys got overexcited a little bit too early. You are underestimating the intelligence of the Australian people.' They will make the appropriate, intelligent decision at the next poll and I have absolutely no doubt that, when they see the positives that have come out of this particular budget and look back in history to the year that this government was elected and look at the possibilities facing them from the other side of politics, they will make the appropriate and responsible decision at the ballot box. I for one do not have any problems about anything that is going to happen at the ballot box because I know my constituency and I know Australians. They will make a very well-calculated, sensible decision. ",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2004-06-01,"—Before I begin my remarks on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005, I say to the member for Hume that he might remember the song Que Sera Sera, whatever will be will be, and we shall see. The member for Hume is a colleague on a committee that I am on and I know he makes a very positive contribution to that committee and that he makes a very positive contribution as the member for his electorate. But I am not sure a lot of your colleagues will be returning with you at the next election. 
There are families in my electorate too, mums and dads, as the member for Hume puts it, who did see some benefits in this budget. But I say to you that the greatest percentage of my electorate did not. Nearly 90 per cent of my electorate are not eligible for the tax cuts which everyone opposite has gone on about so much. And, if there has been one major problem with Centrelink that I have had to deal with, it has certainly been the flawed family payment system. No doubt many people will remain in debt and will have money clawed back under the pretence that the current Treasurer likes to trumpet about the so-called $1,200 gift to families. We all know what that is about. The people of Braddon have twice rejected this government and have trusted me as the member, and I hope they will continue to do that. Before the member for Hume leaves this chamber, I say that they will make their judgment and I am fairly confident what that judgment will be.
Like the member for Hume, I want to talk about roads and roads funding. I spoke on the budget when I made comment on the income tax bill which came before the House some days ago. I want to talk about the Bass Highway and particularly the Bass Highway west of Burnie—what I call the road to Smithton. That has been part and parcel of my priorities even prior to my having the honour of being elected in 1998. It also played a significant part in the election promises of Labor in 1998 and 2001. So I would like to relate some pertinent facts about the highway.
First and foremost, it is not part of the national highway system. It is not deemed a road of national importance. Indeed, it is not even included by the Commonwealth in its current list of maps of national land transport network priorities. In fact, I have a copy of that map here and the very large dots relate to Hobart, Launceston and Burnie. So it is not featured on these Commonwealth national land transport network links related to Tasmania. That point is very important.
So, what is its status? It does not have Commonwealth status in any of its road funding programs. In former submissions it came under Roads of National Importance—RONIs as they are more affectionately known—but has been unsuccessful in the past under the Howard government, particularly in relation to the submissions of 1995-96 and 2001. It has no status on Commonwealth Tasmanian maps, as I have pointed out, highlighting national land transport network links in Tasmania. Indeed, this includes only what is deemed to be the national highway in Tasmania, which for the north-west coast ends at Burnie. 
So, what about the current funding of the Bass Highway between Burnie and Smithton on the far north-west coast? Since 1998 the state government has spent more than $26 million on new works: Cooee to Cam River, $11 million; Somerset to Smithton, $11 million; to the Detention River Bridge, $3.8 million; and to the Black River Bridge, $2.1 million. There have been 11 projects in all to date since 1998, including junction upgrades, realignments and shoulder sealing and widening at Sisters Hills.
In addition, the state government has spent $5 million on maintenance funding for the road. Furthermore, the Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources has spent more than $50,000 on preliminary design work on this road to put a case for further upgrading. So what are the Commonwealth contributions? Outside Roads to Recovery moneys to municipal councils and council roads within the region, they contributed only $750,000 to add to the state government's $2.1 million worth of funding for the Black River Bridge.
Commonwealth interest in this important strategic road has existed since the late 1990s—namely, in the form of Labor's election commitments of 1998 and 2001. There has been nothing from the Howard government or any commitment from its candidates. When I was preselected as the Labor candidate for Braddon, firstly in 1996 and later in 1998, I was able to lobby my Labor colleagues to financially commit to this important road—contrary to the then Liberal sitting member, who merely dismissed calls for Commonwealth funding under the argument that it did not constitute a road under the national highways scheme. Nor was the former member prominent in promoting the road as a road of national importance. Again in 1998 and in 2001 the Howard government failed to recognise this road in its Tasmanian package. So when it comes to long-term interest in this road, the Tasmanian government and the federal Labor Party have demonstrated commitment: $26 million in funding from the state government and $12 million in 1998 and $5 million in 2001 from the federal Labor Party in election commitments.
Since 2001 my region has again prioritised this road, especially through the tricky Sisters Hills section. The Circular Head Council, the Wynyard Waratah Council and the Burnie Council, along with the Cradle Coast Authority, the Bass Highway Working Group led by Trevor Duniam, the state government and local and federal and state members have banded together to produce a detailed submission to the Commonwealth government on upgrading this road. The submission has undergone comprehensive community consultation in relation to this.
I was pleased to note that the current state minister, the honourable Bryan Green, on 28 May 2001 made clear and public the intention to submit this road for funding improvements under the Commonwealth Roads of National Importance program by the end of June. This was the demand of all the participants in the drawing up of the submission. This was the expectation of everyone involved. There was unanimous support for the process and the outcome. The submission lists 15 priority projects costed at around $34 million.
Where does this leave the submission? Until 27 May, the Tasmanian government's intention was to submit its collective work to the Commonwealth under the RONI scheme. Why the RONI scheme? Because the road is not deemed, as I mentioned before, to be part of the AusLink national land transport plan as it currently exists. As I mentioned earlier, the Burnie to Smithton road does not register on AusLink national land transport network maps, which the Commonwealth recognises for funding submissions. This understanding was reinforced in correspondence between the Tasmanian government and assistant secretary level in the Department of Transport and Regional Services dated 8 April 2004. I quote from this 8 April letter: 
The national network for Tasmania includes the following road and rail routes:
	the current National Highway system and the rail network connecting, and into, the ports of Burnie, Devonport and Hobart, as previously indicated—
Other correspondence said:
	the road corridor from the National Highway in Launceston into the Port of Launceston at Bell Bay via the East Tamar Highway; and 
	the rail line from Western Junction near Launceston into the Port of Launceston at Bell Bay.
And on it goes, defining what is deemed to be in the national network. The letter also referred to national highway maintenance funding and raised the specific topic of what is deemed to be called the regional strategic transport network. This correspondence refers to strategic transport projects not included in the national network. In Tasmania, nearly all of the regional freight and access roads are owned by the Tasmanian government. They have formed the basis of RONI applications made with the support of local governments. For example, I note that in this year's budget papers the Lilydale-Scottsdale road is listed as a RONI to receive $10 million—and rightly so, and we are grateful for that. The departmental letter of 8 April listed the `Bass Highway west of Burnie' at the top of its list of key, regionally significant roads and rail lines. The same letter welcomed the opportunity to discuss the Tasmanian government's list of potential new road and rail projects under AusLink to a total of $593 million.
To sum up, in the departmental letter of 8 April we have a list of potential new road and rail projects which are eligible for funding under AusLink—that is, under what is located on the AusLink national network. Distinct from this are potential projects listed within what may be termed `road and rail infrastructure projects of strategic regional importance' within what is termed `the intent underpinning the strategic element of the recently announced Roads to Recovery funding initiative'. Within this regional strategic transport network structure it was the Tasmanian government's stated intention to submit the Bass Highway from Burnie to Smithton as its top priority, as outlined in its correspondence of 8 April.
Fortunately, a number of the projects outlined in the AusLink national network related to Tasmania's priority list were funded in this year's budget. These related to national highway submissions totalling $164.5 million, asset preservation funding and $10 million committed to the Lilydale-Scottsdale road, as I mentioned earlier, as a road of national importance. In communicating these financial commitments, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in a letter received by the Tasmanian government on 11 May, had this to say:
As you are aware, AusLink aims to ensure that our infrastructure decisions emphasise long-term planning, encourage innovative solutions, and targeted investments to deliver the maximum benefits. Funding will be directed to projects located on the AusLink National Network—
please note—
that have been identified as priorities. In this regard, I thank you for your recent consultations between our officials on priorities, which I understand were highly constructive.
It also says:
This major increase in funding is due to AusLink, the Government's new land transport plan. The Government will announce full details of AusLink in the White Paper, which will be released on 7 June 2004. Among other things, the White Paper will set out a series of major new land transport projects beyond the ones detailed in the Budget. 
So ends the letter from the honourable John Anderson. You can imagine my surprise, therefore, when I saw media criticism of the state government's commitment to the Bass Highway west of Burnie. This is despite its past investment of $26 million since 1998, its ongoing coordination and support for a RONI submission in October 2001 and the current comprehensive submission progressing since June 2003.
As I mentioned earlier, this priority project has involved a comprehensive consultative process arriving at five key priorities and eight additional projects estimated at something between $27 million and $34 million. In all, these projects would significantly upgrade, improve and make safer the 17-kilometre stretch of the Bass Highway between the Rocky Cape Road and beautiful Boat Harbour to the east. As part of the consultative process local, state and federal politicians were involved—indeed, they were invited to both public and private briefings. In fact, I attended the latest of these extensive briefings on 29 April 2004, along with Tasmanian Liberal senator Richard Colbeck. The clearly stated intention of the process was to draw up a coordinated stakeholder owned submission for consideration as a road of national importance. Indeed, this was the expectation at the comprehensive briefings presented to local political representatives at the Rocky Cape hall on 29 April.
Again you can imagine my disappointment when Senator Richard Colbeck decided to use this important community project as a political football by criticising the state government in a media release of 27 May for:
...not including it on a roads priority submission to the Australian Government.
Senator Colbeck further contends:
...the Australian Government is always willing to listen to the State Government on how it may be able to assist on roads of national importance.
In trying to play silly political games with this important project, Senator Colbeck thought he could get comfort from the federal Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, the Hon. Ian Campbell, who wrote back to him on 26 March:
On March 22nd last the Australian Government formally sought Tasmania's road funding priorities for the new Auslink National Land Transport plan.
Remember, I quoted from this earlier. 
The list provided included 13 projects—
in fact there were 17, but what are two or three projects when you want to play silly games—
and did not refer to the National Highway extension to Smithton.
The reason there was no prioritisation is that, under the current AusLink criteria related to the so-called national land transport network, it could not be prioritised because it was irrelevant to the network as outlined by Senator Colbeck's own government criteria.
Not only does Senator Colbeck stand condemned by this puerile attack but so too does the embarrassed Minister Campbell, who I assume—and I try to be positive; I trust in people—was unaware of the silly predicament he was placed in by Senator Colbeck. What is more disappointing about Senator Colbeck's puerile performance in this matter is his reported comments in the Advocate, my local newspaper, on Saturday 29 May. Senator Colbeck is reported to have said that any submission as a road of national importance was: 
...useless because it was being wound up on June 7 and rolled into AusLink.
When did Senator Colbeck know that the Roads of National Importance process was to cease? Did he know this when the coordinated stakeholder owned process got under way in June 2003? Did Senator Colbeck know this at the most recent private and public briefings and consultations, which he and I attended on 29 April 2004? If he did know, he did not say a single word to that effect. Why didn't he? Senator Colbeck is either being deliberately mischievous and misleading with this or he has been ignorant—like everyone else by the look of it—of the winding up of the RONI scheme.
Confusion has surrounded the whole AusLink concept to date. Trying to get details related to AusLink is like trying to pull teeth. The Tasmanian government received a green paper on the AusLink proposal in 2002, but since then requests for guidelines have been fruitless. In addition, in the two years since the green paper, the state government has made applications and gained funding under the RONI program for Tasmanian roads, as my colleague the member for Bass would well know and as recognised in this year's budget.
The federal government has twice deferred release of the finalised AusLink white paper, and the only indications of what will be included have been the maps I mentioned earlier, which clearly show that the Bass Highway west of Burnie is not part of Tasmania's land transport network. For the benefit of Senator Colbeck, Minister Ian Campbell and local state Liberal Brett Whiteley, this road is prioritised in the state government's list of regionally significant roads, as submitted to the Commonwealth government in its correspondence of 8 April 2004. It is also ready to be submitted in detail to the Commonwealth under what is—or, if you believe Senator Colbeck, what was—the Roads of National Importance Program. Until more details emerge on AusLink, this program will be the only one in existence to bring about joint action on and investment in this important strategic regional road.
The state government stands ready to join with the Commonwealth to upgrade this important stretch of road. Its submission is ready to roll after a 12-month investigative and consultative process. It was criticised for not including the project in its budget of 2004-05, yet its critics have not included it in their alternative budget. Why is this? Is it because they just wanted to engage in playing games, or is it because to sensibly resolve this issue and have this road upgraded and made more safe will require a joint effort? That of course means that one puts forward the criteria and the demands for the road project and then the funding is negotiated between the two. I thought Senator Colbeck and Mr Whiteley were equally dedicated to achieving this result. Their recent political behaviour makes me doubt their sincerity in this matter.

"Georgiou, Petro, MP",LP,2004-06-01,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005. There are some bedrock landmarks in the Howard government's ninth budget: sound financial management underpinning a budget surplus; further repayment of outstanding Commonwealth government debt, the debt we inherited from Labor; funding for important areas of current community need; structural reform and allocation of funds for long-term priorities; tax relief for ordinary Australians; and a positive economic outlook in a difficult international environment.
We have become accustomed to these pillars of the annual budget and we have come to expect them, but we should not overlook the fact that they are only relatively recent achievements. We should not forget the $10 billion blowouts of the Keating years. We should not forget the last-minute asset sales of the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas and a variety of other sales slipped into the budget at the last possible moment, typically without any public knowledge and often without any caucus approval. These all represented an attempt to patch up gaping holes in funding. We should not forget 17 per cent interest rates, 11 per cent unemployment, negative economic growth or rampant inflation. These are all fragments of a past that should not be forgotten. We should not fall prey to forgetting the past for, in a very original phrase, otherwise we are doomed to repeat it. 
We need to recognise that our new-found economic stability is not just an accident or luck. It cannot be attributed to international conditions, which have been far from benign. Economic stability is the result of hard work, careful attention to detail and a sensitive balancing of competing priorities. In 1996, the coalition had to rescue a budget that was $10 billion in deficit. This necessitated some difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions. In 1997, we managed to escape the Asian economic meltdown only by virtue of the fiscal repairs put in place a year earlier. Even then it was a near run thing. In 2000, the burst of the dotcom boom and the fall-back in the broader equities markets could have undermined growth and sparked a recession, but this government's budgetary measures and the implementation of the tax reform package proved the necessary stimuli to sustain growth through a difficult period. Again in 2001, when the terrorist attacks in the United States sent shock waves through world stock markets and extended the global recession, Australia fared reasonably well. We were protected by the government's economic management, robust export earnings, strong domestic consumer demand and our safe haven status with global investors.
World Bank figures show Australia has been at the forefront of global growth for several years now and, with the signs of synchronised economic recovery growing stronger, we are in an excellent position to capitalise on our strength. But our position cannot be taken for granted. The so-called economic miracles in Japan, Germany, the United States and South-East Asia have all screeched to a halt in the last decade and a half. Maintaining momentum for the Australian economy will require continued attention to the fundamentals—to the policy pillars upon which our growth and prosperity have been built. That is what the Howard government is about, and that is what this budget will achieve.
There is always a lot of talk around budget time—in the parliament, in the media and in the community—about who gains from the budget and how much. Articles, letters, statistics, statements, speeches and discussions—thousands of words and dozens of complicated tables focus on the minutiae of budget policy and how the budget affects individuals. In a sense, this is a very good thing. However, the focus on the detail needs to be supplemented by what I think Paul Keating called `the bigger picture'. The reality is that the great majority of the Australian people know they benefit more from steady economic and employment growth, increased real wages and continued low inflation than they ever do from the beneficial impact of individual budget measures, no matter how important they might be.
The first and most important test of a budget is: will the budget deliver these key outcomes for the Australian people as a whole? The answer again this year, as it has been every year for the Howard government, is yes. The budget foreshadows a modest surplus of $2.4 billion, and further repayment of Labor's debt, now down to $25 billion, which gives us one of the lowest government debt to GDP ratios in the developed world. Projected economic growth is 3.5 per cent, with around 175,000 new jobs being created, inflation falling to just two per cent and wages increasing by almost double the inflation rate. And, unlike some previous Labor budgets, these are not pie in the sky projections. They are real and achievable, and possibly even a little conservative. They are certainly not liberal. 
The current Leader of the Opposition at least mentioned the importance of economic management in his budget response. However, his approach to the issue is an unusual one. In contrast to traditional Labor `tax and spend' governments, the Leader of the Opposition proposes a `slash and spend' administration. He wants to axe government agencies and strip millions of dollars out of an already lean public sector. Exactly where all these cuts will be made remains a mystery. Experience of Labor governments over the years makes me suspicious. When Labor promises to cut government waste to pay for irresponsible spending, it means either (a) higher taxes or (b) budget deficits—or, not unusually, both. That is the harsh reality of Labor economics from Gough to Bob to Paul, and from Cain to Kirner and now to Bracks.
The Leader of the Opposition claims the Howard government is the highest taxing government in Australia's history. The truth is that this honour belongs to Labor governments, as the budget papers show. The budget papers provide a blueprint for the future as well as a valuable record of past financial information, and what the budget papers say is that total Commonwealth government tax receipts will be 20.9 per cent of GDP in 2004-05. However, for the 13 years of the Hawke-Keating governments, total Commonwealth government tax receipts averaged almost 23 per cent of GDP.
When it comes to income tax, a similar picture emerges. In 2004-05, income tax receipts will be 11.8 per cent of GDP, whereas for 12 years under Mr Hawke and Mr Keating they averaged 12.7 per cent of GDP. It is not just my imagination or an oversensitive political memory; whatever the Leader of the Opposition may claim—and he does claim quite a lot—the fact is that Labor's record shows that it stands for taxing and spending.
Economic management is clearly a central aspect of the budget debate, but this year's budget goes well beyond fundamental economic management and extends into key areas of social policy. Several years of sound financial management have given the government the capacity to return the benefits of prosperity directly to the community. This is being done via tax cuts and by spending on priority areas, areas which people in my electorate of Kooyong have raised with me in recent years as priorities—families, aged care, child care, retirement savings and health.
In previous budgets, taxpayers earning up to $50,000 per annum received tax cuts of up to $56 per week. Building on this, the thresholds for the 42 per cent and 47 per cent marginal tax rates are now being increased. This will ensure that from 1 July next year more than 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will face a marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less.
A new family assistance package costing $19 billion over five years is being implemented, delivering real, immediate and substantial support for families raising children and seeking to balance their work and life responsibilities. Another 44,000 child-care places are being created, bringing the total number of new places created since the Howard government came to office to 266,000 and giving more choice to families. An extra $2.2 billion is being injected into the aged care sector, creating 27,000 additional places, providing a larger and better trained work force, and improving quality and standards. Retirement savings are also being encouraged through the expansion and enhancement of the government's co-contribution scheme and the reduction of the superannuation surcharge. 
In this budget the government's MedicarePlus package, a package to strengthen Medicare, is being fully funded and unequivocally supported. Medicare, as we all know, has been the foundation of Australia's health care system for some decades. The government remain absolutely committed to it. As a responsible government we appreciate the need to respond to changing circumstances. The reality is that a host of factors—an ageing population, new diagnostic tests, new and more expensive drugs, and the cost of technology—have placed financial pressure on our health system, especially on the affordability of medical care and access to that care.
The Howard government is responding to changed circumstances with new and innovative policies. Under its `Strengthening Medicare' package, GPs will be paid an extra $5 whenever they bulk-bill a concession card holder or a child aged under 16. In rural, regional and remote areas, where there are GP shortages, this extra payment will be increased to $7.50 in order to attract and support bulk-billing practices in those areas. New safety net arrangements will apply to out-of-pocket costs, benefiting around 1.5 million Australians every year. These arrangements will help families, pensioners and people who have been involved in accidents, those with chronic injuries and diseases, and those who have a number of children.
New links between GPs and the Health Insurance Commission will enable customers to receive Medicare rebates more quickly and easily, directly to their bank account rather than having to go to a Medicare office. Other practical reforms will extend Medicare rebates to enable practice nurses in GP surgeries to undertake wound dressings and immunisations, freeing up doctors to attend to more difficult and higher priority cases. More broadly, allied health workers like physiotherapists and occupational therapists will be encouraged to work together with GPs to care for patients with complex medical conditions. This will enable patients to access holistic, multidisciplinary services at no cost where appropriate.
In recognition of the difficult transition experienced by the 40,000 Australians who enter nursing homes every year, the `Strengthening Medicare' package also includes funding for doctors who develop comprehensive management plans and ongoing treatment for elderly patients. Our medical work force will be boosted with the addition of over 200 funded medical places in our universities, a scheme encouraging young doctors to work in rural areas, fouryear registration for overseas doctors, and easier access to Australian Medical Council courses. This will bring thousands of new doctors and nurses to the forefront of medical care provision in Australia. The package as a whole will ensure that Australians have a system of medical care which is both accessible and affordable into the future.
It is important to remember that a number of the measures that have been implemented in this year's budget will take a while to roll out, but I am sure that as people see both the fine points of the schemes and the practicalities of the financial transfers in a number of cases they will come to understand what is being done to improve a whole series of systems across Australia. These are important initiatives that are required to address current areas of concern in our community. But the initiatives which have been mounted in this year's budget are also important from a longer term perspective. The Treasurer, through his discussion paper Australia's demographic challenges, has highlighted the implications of Australia's ageing population for current and future policy makers. Chief amongst these challenges are providing high-quality, sustainable health and aged care systems and infrastructure, ensuring that older Australians are not discouraged from staying in the work force, and encouraging and supporting people who are raising families. The budget, through these measures I have outlined, clearly addresses each of these challenges. 
The budget looks forward in other areas as well. The government's program Backing Australia's Ability has laid a solid foundation for the pursuit of excellence through innovation. The budget confirms our commitment with funding for a successor program, Backing Australia's Ability: Building our Future through Science and Innovation. Funding of $5.3 billion will be provided for important bodies such as the Australian Research Council, the National Health and Medical Research Council and the CSIRO; to help the commercialisation of research through programs such as the Commercial Ready Program and the Commercialising Emerging Technologies program; and to help develop critical skills across the sector, including in important disciplines such as mathematics and science. In the realm of physical capital, the AusLink program provides additional support of $1.9 billion over the next five years for our road and rail systems. Critical upgrades in our security services are being implemented to sustain and protect a secure environment for our nation and our community, which is one of the fundamental obligations of government and a key component to continued economic success.
I have spoken at some length tonight about the new programs and initiatives outlined in this year's budget. Too often, essentially incremental changes are allowed to overwhelm the total picture painted in the budget. But, at the end of the day, the simple fact is that next year the Commonwealth will spend $82 billion on social security and welfare, $35 billion on health, $14 billion on education and nearly $15 billion on defence. These are key priority areas, and the programs funded within them are vital to all Australians. Funding these programs on an ongoing basis requires maintaining an environment conducive to growth and prosperity. That is what the Howard government has done, and it will continue to do so into the future. There will be no wild taxing and spending and no indiscriminate slashing and burning. What there will be is a continued commitment to stable economic management and a sensible funding of key programs which address both current needs and long-term goals.

"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2004-06-01,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005. The Howard government is a government that has for eight years forced Australian families to struggle under increasing financial pressure, offering no realistic sign of relief. Last month the Treasurer handed down a budget that was tipped to be the budget to end all budgets—the barbecue stopper. Clearly, the barbecue ran out of gas at the last minute. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer promised that the measures in this budget would go some way in meeting the needs of families and easing their financial pressures, but the only needs that I can see so far that have been met are those of the Liberal Party.
This is a budget that was designed to meet the political needs of the ailing Howard government, not the needs of Australian families as promised. If the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were serious about delivering relief to families then they would have delivered on many of the measures promised to families more than a year ago, and not sat on them because they did not fit into their political timetable. It is also interesting to note that at the beginning of the year the Australian Council of Social Services predicted that the rich-poor divide would get worse if a budget surplus and a federal election were used to offer some voters a tax cut. ACOSS said that this would mean the poorest people in the country would get no benefit from a cut and, at the same time, the capacity of the government to address urgent problems in health, education and welfare would be reduced.  
What a surprise! That is exactly the budget we have been handed down this month by the Howard government. We have been handed a pre-election budget that offers tax cuts to those earning above $52,000 per annum, which in my electorate of Bass applies to less than seven per cent of people. We have been offered a budget handout with a one-off family payment bribe, but it does nothing to ease the real day-to-day financial pressures that families are facing.
This government is very good at telling people that times are good and that the economy is doing well but, frankly, families are still struggling. They are asking why, if it is meant to be so good, they cannot make ends meet. This government has had eight years of wastage and eight years of fibbing. Where there is waste, a nice little web of intrigue is wrapped around to cover it up. It is the Australian people who have been victims of this charade masked as governance. It is the Australian people who have been victims of this government's malady, as I have mentioned before, of reverse Robin Hood syndrome. This is a syndrome that sees it uncontrollably take from the poor and give to the rich—this budget offers more of the same. 
It is well known that Tasmanians, on the whole, earn less than most other Australians. In the electorate of Bass, 93.2 per cent of people have an individual weekly income of between $1 and $999, rendering them ineligible for the government's tax cuts—that is, 93.2 of people in my electorate who earn an income will not receive any sort of tax relief as a result of the cuts announced in the budget because they earn less than $52,000 a year. As the Prime Minister said, because they earn less than $52,000 a year, apparently they do not work hard enough.
Across the whole of Tasmania, 93.1 per cent of people over the age of 15 earn less than $52,000 a year. The average Tasmanian earns just $33,604 per year—or a median income of $760 per week—coming in well under the $52,000 threshold where the tax cut will kick in. This is in stark contrast to the median weekly earnings in the Treasurer's electorate of Higgins, which is actually $1,570 per week, or in Bennelong, the Prime Minister's electorate, where it is $1,300 per week. I guess most people in the PM's and the Treasurer's electorate will receive their tax cuts, because the Prime Minister and Treasurer are ensuring their re-election but not the good of the greater community.
Of the around 6 per cent of people in Bass who will receive tax cuts, most of them will very likely have their benefit eaten up by the massive debts that they have most likely incurred under the family tax benefit system. In what is a clever little ploy, the government has offered family payments of $600 in an attempt to cover up the fact that many families have actually incurred debts of up to $900 per year under the family tax benefit system. 
What the Treasurer did not announce on budget night was that this payment would be first used to offset any overpayment that may have occurred during a previous year. That is an admission the government essentially made yesterday and again today in question time—an admission that, yes, families would receive the payout but, if they have a debt, it is going to be clawed back after the next election. There are 600,000 families across the country that have large family debts averaging $900. These one-off payments will not provide full compensation for the average debt and the government plan is to claw back the money after it has secured its election victory. The arrogance of this government astounds me. Once again what is being given by this government with one hand is being taken away by the other.  
This government has completely mismanaged the family tax benefit system and these one-off payments create the perception that families are going to receive $600 in their pocket. The reality is that most families will not. Most families will never see this money because it will be eaten up by the existing debts that have been created under this system. The family tax benefit system is a system that is severely flawed and unfair. It is a system under which one in three families each year is slugged with debts, a system where only 44 per cent of all payments are actually made correctly. It is a system that only recently came under fire because of a loophole that allowed millionaires to take advantage of the system—a loophole that the government had no intention of doing anything about until Labor forced the government to conduct an inquiry into the system. 
Moving on to another one-off payment in what has become a budget made up of one-off welfare is the carers payment. I welcome the Treasurer's recognition of the fact that carers' work is hard and generally unrewarded. However, someone should probably point out to him that this work is in fact continuous. A one-off payment is not sufficient to make up for the fact that this government was only late last year ready to cut $87 per fortnight to 30,000 families caring for disabled children following the commencement of its cost cutting measures within the child disability assessment tool. This was a tool that measured the functional ability of a child and forced parents to go through an unnecessary and inappropriate assessment process that only their GPs were eligible to sign off on, processes that forced the expense of unnecessary doctors appointments, along with the wasted time of both the GP and the parents. 
Now, with an election imminent, the Treasurer has decided to recognise carers' work. Well, once again, we ask that he recognise that the ongoing costs incurred by carers will not be eased by this payment. It will not go towards any type of national strategy to help carers with the day-to-day difficulties they face in the responsibilities to their loved ones. It will not help carers who have to juggle combined work commitments and caring responsibilities. It will not address any type of education or training needed by carers or provide any counselling or support services that carers themselves may need. It will not do anything really, except allow the government to tick a box to say they have looked at this group and have attempted to placate their earlier concerns. 
Another box the government believes it can tick off is that of aged care. The aged care industry is in crisis in Tasmania, despite what the Minister for Ageing would have us believe. This government has consistently treated the aged care industry and older people with complete contempt. Its abysmal treatment of the aged care industry has created a crisis of care. We were very lucky in Tasmania just recently. We warranted a visit from the minister so that she could announce our share of the aged care budget. Tasmania got an extra 635 aged care beds. The minister forgot to tell the Tasmanian community that these beds were actually the normal annual bed increase based on population. The Tasmanian aged care industry has already said the government's report card on its attempt at mollifying the industry should read `Failed'. The aged care industry has told me that there is a real danger that 30 per cent of the aged care providers in Tasmania are going to close their doors unless they get a significant funding increase. This does not include the normal population based increases. If the government were serious about providing assistance to the Tasmanian aged care industry, it would immediately restore the operating funding levels in residential aged care by $10 a day, not the dismal $1.37 it offered in the budget. If it were serious about providing assistance, it would provide a further increase of $4 per day for regional and rural facilities instead of the measly 25c that was offered.  
This is a government that has made very large claims about assisting the aged care industry when in fact the budget proved that it is doing very little to alleviate the crisis that it has allowed to occur over the last eight years. The Tasmanian industry have said the funding provided in the federal budget will not have any impact on alleviating their current crisis. The one-off capital grant, yet another one-off payment—that is a theme—of $3,500 per resident is welcome, but it will hardly make a dent in what is required. Our many regional facilities will actually need to use this grant to underwrite their existing losses. The industry has warned that, despite the $2.2 billion for aged care in the budget, it is an industry still in decline. There has been such a consistent undervaluing of aged care services by this government that it has seen an estimated $405 million drop in funding of residential aged care services. This is in addition to the estimated loss of $120 million in funding for community care packages.
This is a government that is acting now only because of the impending election. It has ignored the aged care industry for years and it is now attempting to minimise the negative impact of its existing policies. These measures are not the result of a newfound benevolence by this government; they are the result of many years of begging and pleading for an industry that is struggling to survive.
Another group of people who have been completely overlooked in this budget are children, and more specifically children at risk of contracting pneumococcal meningitis. Despite this government's cheap rhetoric about families, despite its insistence that we go forth and multiply, despite the recommendations from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation—despite all of this—the Howard government still refuses to fund the pneumococcal vaccine. The Treasurer has pontificated on how good this budget is for families and on how it will ease the financial burdens on families, but the Treasurer still continues to refuse to fund the $60 million needed to ensure that all parents have access to the vaccine in order to protect their children from this disease. If you can afford the vaccination, failure to make an arrangement for vaccination supply has meant that parents who attempted to purchase the vaccine back in February are still waiting and will probably continue to wait until July.
Tasmania is further disadvantaged in this situation. We have already established that Tasmanians are among the lowest income earners in the country, that families are struggling to make ends meet and that the government's decision not to fund the whole suite of vaccines means that parents must now make the decision to pay between $400 and $600 for the vaccine or to take the risk and not fully immunise their child. No parent should be forced to make such a decision when it is purely based on cost.
That brings me to child care. The Treasurer announced in the budget that there would be an additional 40,000 outside school hours child-care places and 4,000 family day care places. These additional places are welcome but there is no mention of any assistance for the long waiting lists for long day care places or the vexed issue of affordability. For many families it is not just about finding child-care places; it is about being able to afford to pay the child-care fees. For many families on low incomes it is simply not viable to go to work and pay child-care fees. That of course is for families who already have children, but I know that there are many single women or women who do not have children who have taken great offence at the Treasurer's assertions that women should go forth and procreate. Quite frankly, I am happy to have a child for me and I am happy to have one for my husband, but I draw the line at having a child for Peter Costello. 
Labor welcomes the government's maternity payment and is pleased to see that the government has opted to adopt Labor policy where its own flawed baby bonus scheme was ineffectual. It is good to see that this has now been scrapped and replaced with what is a replica of Labor's baby care payment. Babies and families are not commodities that can be traded off as election sweeteners. Nor for that matter is our universal health care system, Medicare. There was not one thing in the budget for Medicare. The government is satisfied to let Medicare decline and decay under its current regime but, instead of coming out and saying it, it continues to attempt to cover up just how much Medicare is hurting and, in the process, how Australian families are hurting.
Bulk-billing figures for Bass which were released in December last year—the last time we had electorate-by-electorate figures—showed that Bass had a bulk-billing level of 43.6 per cent. Combined with the severe doctor shortage, this means that it is impossible to find a doctor in Launceston who fully bulk-bills. In fact it is only in Scottsdale, one of my regional towns, that a full bulk-billing service still prevails. It only just survives; we have a doctor shortage and this practice has decided to get out of their commitment to the community. It has not been an easy decision for them and it is one that they are financially struggling with.
Despite this dire predicament, the government is trying to cover up its incompetence by refusing to release the latest bulk-billing figures by electorate. This is deplorable, especially because of the fact that the government has recently started a new national advertising campaign to sell this poor excuse for a policy. So just what is the government covering up? It is covering up the fact that, despite the national bulk-billing figure plummeting to 68.3 per cent, it is much worse in regional areas such as Bass, with a dismal 43.6 per cent bulk-billing rate. It is covering up the fact that Australian families are paying exorbitant amounts of money in gap fees to take their children to see a doctor. It is covering up the fact that, instead of providing basic, universal health care for all Australians, this government has just spent $21 million on a television campaign that could have paid for 800,000 bulk-billed consultations or even been a down payment on the pneumococcal vaccination to protect our children.
The people of Bass tell me that they are angry about the government's treatment of Medicare. They want a government that listens to the needs of the community and stops imposing draconian reform agendas that continue to slug families in their hip pockets. The people of Bass need a government that is committed to health care and to restoring Medicare. The people of Bass want a government that will restore Medicare to at least the 80 per cent national bulk-billing level that it was before this government desecrated it.
But it is not just Medicare that people are concerned about when they talk about lack of access to health care services. In northern Tasmania, waiting lists for dental services are still too long. In March 2004 there were 4,152 people on the public dental waiting list. It is an abominable situation that people have to wait so long to get emergency dental work done. The government's treatment of Medicare, its treatment of families and its willingness to embark on a national advertising blitz to push its propaganda are more examples of just how out of touch this government really is. 
The chamber might also be interested to learn that the government recently undertook another propaganda exercise to push its election booty. Around four weekends ago, Sunday newspapers in Tasmania carried full-page advertisements claiming Tasmania was to receive an extra $1.867 million in funding for services and infrastructure. Fair enough, you might say; but they were full-page glossy ads of Sydney trains, advocating that the money was being spent on public passenger train services—the public passenger train services that we have not had in Tasmania for many years. You would think that if you were trying to sell your policy, you would at least ensure that the ads you put in—that you waste taxpayers' dollars on—might be relevant to the electorate and the communities that are receiving these ads. This government has become so arrogant and so complacent, it does not care whether the message is suitable for its audience—after all, it is only money.
This arrogance is further demonstrated by the government's attitude towards workers. The government's record on industrial relations is abominable. I point out that my Blue Ribbon workers are still out. They have won every Industrial Commission hearing but they still do not have their jobs—the jobs that they lost because they refused to sign a dodgy contract. This government has a single-minded anti-union, anti-worker obsession. It has an agenda set to destabilise Australian industrial relations and cut the livelihoods of workers. It frightens me that industrial relations in Australia has repeatedly been subjected to the obvious hostility and gradual dismantling by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, who is clearly delusional in his assessment of a fair and just industrial system.
—The member opposite attempts to interject but I want to remind him about my workers at Blue Ribbon. All they wanted to do was go to work. For over a year now, they have been trying to go to work, but they are not allowed to because their dodgy contract will not allow them back to work. This government's futile engagement in industrial reform is still of no benefit for those who actually rely on employment conditions being fair and ensuring that they are justly remunerated for their work and fairly treated in the workplace.
This budget is an election con job. It is being purported as a family friendly budget, but the reality is different. It is a budget that ignores the needs of six million Australian families who do not get a single cent in tax cuts or a single cent in family assistance. There is a whole theme of one-off welfare that is compensating for this government's bad policy. It is about buying a future for the Howard government. It is certainly not about getting a future for the people of Bass.
There is one outstanding political focus at present, and that is families. So why are families the focus now? That is simple. The policies of this government have hurt them and the government has finally realised that families have become a hot election issue. This government is responding to an election issue; it is not responding to the needs of a community. The government has had eight years of opportunity to do the right thing by families, and it has neglected to do so. It has spent eight years attempting to destroy the social fabric of our nation. It is destroying Medicare; it has thrown the aged care industry into crisis; it is neglecting our children's health; it has put families into debt; it has promised tax cuts that most people will never see; and it has distressed and confused carers. This government has had eight years to help families, but it has just looked after the big end of town, ignoring the plight of the families and ensuring that families in Bass continue to struggle. ",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2004-2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2004-06-01,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005. It is actually a pleasure to follow the member for Bass. That speech would be an unmerchantable product if it were sold in the private sector. It would certainly fail to be fit for purpose, because it was more a Labor Party branch speech where Armageddon was around the corner for all things the coalition were on about. I guess it also depicts the great hubris that takes over the Labor Party whenever they sniff electoral victory.  Really, the only people who are disadvantaged by this budget are the Labor Party. They are already out there measuring up offices and wondering who is going to get what job, and there is speculation about whether Laurie Brereton will be the next foreign minister. They just cannot help themselves. They forget that this is not about them; it is about the Australian community.
The electoral process and the difficult choices about how to invest $200 billion that the Australian government spends each year are not about the circus that the Labor Party seeks to portray as all evil, all mystery and all darkness; it is actually about what can be done to help real people to live a good life and to be certain that they can look to a positive future, be confident in their own security and understand that they have a government that supports their choices—not one that tells them what they should be doing or what they should be thinking.
It is interesting to listen to the member for Bass. She talks about all the things that are evil in this budget. I can only imagine that she benefits from not having been around in 1996 to watch the coalition fix the train wreck that the last Labor government left in this country—the deficits, the decay of basic services and the inability to tackle taxation and industrial relations reforms. I am unashamedly a member of the unofficial union for the people who do not have a job. I see my job in this place as making sure that more people have work, not less. I am not here to protect the interests of those who are in a position to bargain away other people's opportunities. That is not what I am here for. I am here to make sure that everyone has an opportunity for employment. That seems to be the great point of difference between the government and the opposition. The opposition is about furthering the advantage of those who are already in the driver's seat in their world view—which is very much the union dominated attitude—whereas we are trying to create new opportunities for people. That is a very virtuous cause and it is work that is never finished. There is always more that we can do and, as evidenced by this government's budget, there is more that this government want to do—and it will make this country a better place.
The budget is further evidence that good economic management delivers help for families and lays the foundation for a better future. It has been a long time since anyone from the Labor Party has been in a position to talk about surpluses and what they might do with them, because they have not been able to oversee one. The only reason that we are having this conversation about how to return additional revenues—tax receipts—is that they have grown under this government because of the buoyant economy and the reforms that have been put in place. Because the company tax receipts are growing quite significantly, as a result of improved compliance with the tax reforms and improving profitability from the good economic climate, we have a choice about what to do with those resources, which are now in excess of what is required to implement important and essential government works and services. That is what this discussion is about.
There is a reason why the dividend of good economic management is being delivered back to needy and deserving Australian citizens and families in this way. You do not make a system change when you are not certain that we can sustain that change. That would be a bit like promising l-a-w law tax cuts, realising that they cannot be delivered and then pulling them, as the Labor Party did. It would be a bit like saying that we are going to give broader and fairer tax cuts to all Australians and never actually saying when that will be. It would be a bit like saying that we support the family benefits in this budget but then holding back to deny the right to the second tranche of those benefits, which is the Labor Party position. It would be a bit like running around saying the best thing we can do for our kids is to make pneumococcal vaccine available but then denying it to people who are already in the infant age bracket, as was identified in a weekend newspaper. With no program to go back to those people that are not conveniently within the— 
—I welcome the interjection because it shows the blatant ignorance of the opposition about the at-risk programs that have already been put in place. This is the difficulty. If the Labor Party can ever lift themselves out of this perpetual branch meeting that they use as a substitute for informed and considered debate, they might think a bit more before they speak; they might actually do some homework before they come out claiming to be on the side of virtue, without having the foggiest idea of what is already going on. It is the kind of behaviour that sees the Labor Party with stolen property in the form of a cabinet leak that recommends some changes to the maternity arrangements that the government has put in place, say, `Here is some hot property. It is so hot. We have done none of the work. We have done none of the research. We have put in place none of the infrastructure that even saw these changes implemented in the first place, but we will grab the government's work in progress because we do not have to be accountable for anything that we say—we never stay on a topic long enough to do that,' and then claim it as their own policy. That is the contest at the moment. It is about whether a cabinet leak—out of the bureaucracy to the Labor Party—surfaces before a considered, measured, funded, well thought through policy announcement is made by the government. It is an interesting kind of alternative government if that is the best they can come up with.
As I was mentioning earlier, this is a careful, forward-looking federal budget. It shows that an experienced team running an economy well can create new opportunities for expanded services and improved benefits for our citizens. I have spoken before in this place about the very impressive family assistance package that is in here. Again, we look at the opposition of the Labor Party to the tax reforms that saw a huge increase in the amount of benefits that were made available.
—I welcome the interjection of the member for Throsby—who I am actually quite fond of and admire. But she was not here when all this was going on. The idea around tax reform included going to the electorate and putting the full package forward in the bright spotlight of an election where everybody could see it—warts and all—and then decide whether they wanted a piece of it. That is accountable politics.
And it is a vivid contrast to what is going on now, where we have the frog of policy: the opposition leader. He is bouncing from one leaf in the pond to another, quick enough to get away from the swooping seagulls in the media or the government trying to hold him to account, and hoping that the fog comes in so nobody can actually wonder what on earth he is talking about. That is not accountability. That is hardly transparent government. That is hardly even a credible alternative government. That is spin-doctoring, Hawker Britton, where the PR game and the chance to get the spin out first is thought to be a substitute for a sound agenda to carry the country forward. The people I talk to are just left wondering. They are certainly bewildered by the opposition. They are wondering. Time will tell whether the great curiosity that has been triggered by the frog bouncing across the pond is actually going to turn him into Prince Charming or not. 
The issues that I want to talk about include the Scoresby Freeway. It is very fortunate that I am joined by the member for Chisholm—who sighs. I would like to welcome the sigh of the member for Chisholm. That is the first audible contribution she has made in the Scoresby debate. What a treat this is. We should put that out in the papers of the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. I do not know how the member for Chisholm and other Labor Party members operate, particularly at a state level. The member for Throsby might not be an observer of Victorian politics but it is a bit rich when one goes to the electorate and promises a toll free Scoresby Freeway and six weeks later after the election says, `It is all too hard. We're going to change our minds,' when there is a whole busload of ALP members sitting under false pretences in the state parliament of Victoria. They got across the line by a margin of a handful of votes by making this false and misleading promise. It was a blatant lie by any measure. The sadness about all that is who is disadvantaged as a result the communities. Down in the community that I represent, we need that freeway. We need it to be toll free because if it is not the benefits would be reduced to one-fifth of what they would be. They are going to charge a toll for it. The great irony is they got elected on the basis of a false claim.
—Couldn't you talk about something other than the road?
—It is good to see that the member for Chisholm can get animated about someone talking about the Scoresby Freeway. If only she had followed the lead of the representatives of the western and northern suburbs of Melbourne, who have a rich and wonderful transport infrastructure to wallow in out there. Their elected representatives actually represent the community. It is a novel idea, I believe, for the Labor Party in the east and the south-east of Melbourne. But the others get out there claiming the need to have the Calder Highway updated and bypasses here and ring roads there. They are all there. You see the photos in the paper. There are state and federal Labor MPs holding placards saying, `Dear Canberra: we want our money for this road, this road and this road.' If you put the same photo in to capture the advocacy of the Labor Party in the east and the south-east of Melbourne, do you know who would be in the picture? Nobody. There would be nothing but space. There is not one state or federal Labor Party MP—and, frankly, nobody bar one of the aspirants for public office into the future—who has the wherewithal to stand up and claim that, if the Bracks government is swimming in cash, some of it should be actually directed to their electorate.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I know you would never stand for that. If there is cash to be had, we are after more than our fair share. But here is a cunning plan. The Labor Party in the east and the south-east of Melbourne think, `Everyone else is getting a chop of some road funding. We shouldn't actually argue for our case, even though it was promised to these citizens—a million of them—that they would get something.' In return, it was not a promise; it was Mr Bracks's solemn commitment. Six weeks later he walks away from it. He cannot even pull the stunt of `Well, when we were elected to government the books weren't as we thought they would be.' Guess what? The same people were in those offices—the same people were governing the state of Victoria prior to the election and after it. So, in terms of fullness of knowledge, you would have thought they would have had some idea; or is it just patent incompetence, or, worse still, the most devastating lack of interest in the future prospects of the citizens of the east and south-east of Melbourne? 
Down my way, Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know that it takes longer to get from Frankston to Melbourne than it does to get to Geelong? If you and I had $100 million to invest in a new facility or a new service, an employment-generating project, would you invest in a part of Melbourne where the transport infrastructure was not up to scratch, where you were burdened with added costs simply doing the business that those on the Western Ring Road can do without and using infrastructure they do not have to pay for? It is really not that complicated, is it? Well, it seems to be for the Labor Party. They stand condemned for their inactivity in securing a share of the resources that the Bracks government are spreading around to the north and west of Melbourne. They stand condemned, because they are an appalling example of what happens if you get hacks—people with no commitment to their local community and no interest in the wellbeing of the citizens they are supposed to represent. They stand back; and there is that photo—let us see them all line up for the Labor Party, state and federal members. When the photo is taken with the placards calling for cash for the Scoresby Freeway, do you know which Labor Party MPs are in there, Mr Deputy Speaker? None of them; absolutely zero. They are the biggest case of no-shows and no backbone I have ever seen and they are disadvantaging our community for a generation because of it. They should stand condemned—and the member for Chisholm knows that she stands condemned with the rest of the bunch that could do nothing to support their community on this crucial piece of infrastructure. There is no more crucial piece of infrastructure for the next generation than this project—and where were they? They were AWOL—absent without leave—and they have greatly let down our community.
In this budget, though, there is a continuation of that commitment from the Howard government. We have never walked away from that project. We have never walked away from the commitments that were made with the state government of Victoria. We have never walked away from our obligations under the memorandum of understanding. We have been there from the very beginning. We are still there now, and this budget puts another $420 million on the table. It used to be $445 million, but the state Labor government has already spent $25 million of it. It spent $25 million of it and then announced through a press release that it was walking away from a deal. Well, honourable people and honourable parties honour their deals. This is a classic example; it is the most pitiful and poorest of politics that I have ever seen. I hope the Labor Party hangs its head in shame when it reflects on who it is trying to please and what it is trying to achieve, because it fails miserably on both of those tests when it comes to the Scoresby Freeway.
With the family support package, I am pleased that additional child-care places are going to be made available in this program. In the community that I represent we have a distribution of child-care services, including long day care. I was listening to the member for Bass—and, again, she should have checked out the facts. There is no brake, there is no restriction, there is no cap placed on long day care services supported by the Howard government. If the centres are built and a child is there and the parents are eligible, the child-care benefit is paid. There is no gap. In fact, the Commonwealth puts funds in—as it has recently done in a community based long day care centre in my electorate—to support those community based programs, with assistance for capital works and equipment. In terms of there being a need for a long day care facility in a community, there is no brake put on the supply of that. People can come forward, establish those services and go for it and attract the very substantial child-care benefits that are made available. We have had a misunderstanding by the member for Bass, who, again, has been sloppy on the detail and has failed to appreciate the actual policy in the face of trying to make a good Labor Party branch meeting speech. 
On the issue of after school care, I am particularly encouraged by the increasing number of places being made available through this budget. The after school care is a very important program down in the community that I represent. However, we are also seeing that it is one of a range of child-care services that parents and families can choose between to meet their child-care needs. My children participate in an after school care program, and that supports the working choices of the parents.
We have some vacancies in services in one area of my electorate and in other areas there are waiting lists. I am pleased that the Mount Eliza primary school's allocation of places will shortly be coming online at the start of term 3. That is a positive development. I am very supportive of that primary school and others, particularly in the Langwarrin, Mount Eliza and Mornington areas, applying for and hopefully receiving additional after school care places. We have increasing numbers of families moving into those areas placing increasing demand on services that are available. Again, the good news is that where increasing demand arises there is increasing availability, and the government is supporting those choices.
There is some work to do to ensure that family day care program opportunities are embraced, although there is an issue about how we recruit the carers. It is not for everybody, and—it might be the same in some other electorates—there is added capacity in that program. One of the difficult challenges we need to face is how to recruit carers, particularly where you have less typical working hours, rather than the nine to five or regular working day. There is a range of opportunities but, as we know, the nature of work is changing and we need to make sure that the child-care services available are adapted to those changing work demands and hopes from families.
In the few minutes I have left I will again highlight the good work of the greenest government this country has ever seen. The huge investment made in conserving and restoring our natural systems has been further extended by the $300 million addition to the Natural Heritage Trust. We have to recognise that no previous government has made anywhere near the commitments to environmental management and natural systems rehabilitation that this government has made.
That addition sits alongside a suite of other measures, including what effectively amounts to a substantial microeconomic reform in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. How well that is going. There is another $200 million in the budget for the Living Murray initiative. There is the government's investment in protecting the reef—looking at the reef, the health of the lagoon, the water quality and the impact of some of the on-land uses. There is also a further $70 million to strengthen and restructure some of the greenhouse programs as we look at better ways of making sure that taxpayer resources are getting outcomes that would not have occurred had that support not been there. That is an impressive range of programs. 
I see that there are some opportunities to strengthen the performance of the Greenhouse Challenge. The government adopts a `no regrets' position; I strongly advocate a `no loafers' one as well. We do have some companies leading the way, but those dragging the chain or not doing much need to be encouraged to lift their game to make sure that we have a less carbon intensive economy.
In the minute that is available to me I want to reiterate the point that has been made repeatedly in the parliament for the last few days, a point that the member for Werriwa seemed to understand and embrace during the Cunningham by-election. He was going around telling all the constituents of Cunningham that signing the Kyoto protocol was a bad move and would cost them jobs. He seems to have forgotten what he understood then. The protocol is like a starter's kit for illicit drugs—signing this thing would give you a great thrill for two minutes, but the hope is that you become hooked. Then you are stuck with the Kyoto framework, which in its first accounting period will deliver no benefits for the environment. What is really needed to change the way the carbon in our economy and in the global economy is handled is a better way of incorporating all energy sources and all emitters, and that is something that I will look forward to in the future.

"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2004-06-01,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2004-2005 and the cognate bills and in support of the amendments moved by my colleague the member for Hotham when the bills were first introduced. We all know that the Treasurer's ninth budget is cynical and unashamedly partisan. But let's be frank: with an election imminent, what did you expect? You might think these words are mine. They certainly reflect what I think about the budget, but they are the sentiments and words expressed in a recent article written by an eminent associate professor of economics at the University of New South Wales, Neil Warren. Mr Warren's article went on to analyse the impact of the budget and the losers in it: the pensioners, the self-funded retirees and the unemployed, to name a few. He concluded by stating:
This budget has squandered the opportunity to introduce reforms that fundamentally improve the design and operation of the tax and welfare system. Instead, it has favoured a grab for votes and quick and easy solutions, using a truckload of cash to address politically chosen problem areas.
Those short comments say it all. The budget is all about satisfying this government's political needs, not the needs of average Australians. That is why, in a huge spending spree with outlays of around $52 million, the budget is so tightly targeted that three out of five families and singles receive not one single cent by way of a tax cut or in family assistance. This group is quite considerable—some six million families and singles have been left totally out of the government's equations. They are what we describe as the forgotten people of this budget.
The constituents I represent rightly expected some relief from the highest taxing government in Australia's history. They have been doing it tough in an area where the weekly median individual income is about $300 and the median weekly family income is $859. They all know that bracket creep over the past years has reaped a huge bonanza for this government, and yet what is going to be given back to them by way of tax relief in this budget? We know that millions of hardworking Australians will pay for the tax cuts that will go to those earning more than $52,000 per year—that is just under 8,000 constituents in Throsby. But there are 79,000 constituents in the work force paying taxes who get no tax cuts—and that is 91 per cent of the people I represent. So we have an outlay of $52 billion or thereabouts in spending but not one cent of it going into tax relief for the four out of five taxpayers who earn less than $52,000 a year. 
The other centrepiece of this budget was the family package and the family benefits payments. Theoretically, two million families will be eligible for the increased benefits, and no-one begrudges every family receiving additional financial assistance. But you might rightly ask: why is it that relief for families only became a priority issue in the lead-up to a federal election? Why the one-off payments now when relief has been so desperately needed over many years? Why did the problems of the average family remain unaddressed for such a lengthy period of time? I have a genuine concern about how the government is selling—or, really, overselling—the one-off family payment of $600 that will be paid in this and in the next financial year. The first one-off payment of $600 will go into accounts before the end of June, but many families will see this as small recompense, for the average debt in my electorate now stands at $711—debts that have arisen through no fault of my constituents but due to a flawed family payment system. Many people hit with a debt will see this one-off payment of $600 merely as an acknowledgment and repayment of debts that should never have arisen in the first place.
For a constituent like Mrs Gaggin in my electorate, whose case I have raised on numerous occasions both in contributions in the House and in individual representations to the minister, she is owed some several thousands of dollars—a small-business family who, through no fault of their own, ended up with debts not of their making, and I think she, like many others, will see that $600 suddenly appearing in her account when she is owed several thousand dollars as somewhat of a cynical gesture. The second $600 that families have been promised will depend on a reconciliation process, and for many families this money will be clawed back to pay off continuing debts incurred in a flawed system. We already know that one in three families—around 600,000 families—have accumulated debts of $900 on average under this government's system. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
