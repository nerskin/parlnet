"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2002-05-28,"—My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Can the minister inform the House of the government's assessment of the likelihood of war between India and Pakistan? Minister, what is the government's assessment on such a war becoming nuclear and what would be the implications for Australia and Australian nationals if that occurred? Minister, what is your department's estimate of the number of Australians living and travelling in east Pakistan and north-west India? Can the minister assure the House that these Australians have been advised to leave the region now? Minister, given that this crisis has direct implications for the security of our own region and for Australia's own national interests, will Australia's foreign minister now travel to Islamabad and New Delhi to argue directly for a peaceful settlement?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Foreign Affairs: India and Pakistan</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Downer, Alexander, MP",LP,2002-05-28,"—There are a lot of questions rolled into one, so let me focus in particular on the question that the honourable member asks about the prospect of nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan. Obviously, our assessment is that it is possible, because both India and Pakistan are nuclear capable states. That is one of the reasons why the level of tension now between Pakistan and India is a matter of such very great concern not just to Australia but to the whole of the international community. In terms of the number of Australians involved, I understand that there are about 1,000 Australians living permanently in India. I cannot give the honourable member a precise answer as to the number who might be visiting the region at any particular time, but our expectation is that the number would be quite high. Obviously, the high commissions in both Islamabad and New Delhi do what they can to get in touch with Australian citizens and to ensure that those Australian citizens are aware of our consular advice.
Importantly, the consular advice is on the web site, so it is available for people who have access to Internet facilities, and we do everything we can to ensure that people do know what our consular advice is. For example, within Australia over the last 24 hours I have taken the opportunity to do a number of media interviews to highlight what our consular advice is, to warn those people who are on the threshold of making a visit to either India or Pakistan that it is the government's considered view on the basis of advice we have received from our high commissions in New Delhi and Islamabad that Australians should defer both holiday and business travel to India and Pakistan, that Australians in Pakistan should consider leaving, and that Australians in India who feel that there is danger should also consider leaving.

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2002-05-28,"—My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism and I refer to the ongoing public liability insurance crisis. Minister, do you recall telling the Channel 7 Sunrise program yesterday that:
The only solution on public liability is that the states have to reopen state insurance offices. They need to get back in the business of providing the old GIO, SIO solutions ... they privatised them in the early 1990s. 
Minister, are you the same Joe Hockey who signed this New South Wales government minute in December 1991 as the convenor, GIO Privatisation Communications Committee, and then followed up with a taxpayer funded trip to England and Ireland to discuss British and Irish privatisation experiences?
—The member for Werriwa will come to his question. He is now advancing an argument.
—Minister, how can you attack the states for getting out of public liability insurance when you were responsible for selling one of the largest public insurers in the country—the New South Wales GIO?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Insurance: Public Liability</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,question
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2002-05-28,"—I would like to thank the member for his question. It was not a little unexpected. The GIO in New South Wales was formed in 1927 when the private sector in New South Wales failed to take up the opportunity to establish workers compensation insurance. When there was a market failure in that case, the state government set up an insurance office and went in to address the market failure. That is the role of state governments. When the GIO was privatised, as it was privatised by state Labor governments—the SIO, the TIO in Tasmania, the SGIO in various other jurisdictions; when they were all privatised—that was because, in 1991-92, the insurance market in Australia was a sophisticated market that provided a large number of products and covered many areas. 
It is fair to say, and I think it is generally accepted by all, that over the last 12 months, and particularly after the events of September 11, there has been market failure in relation to public liability. There is no doubt about that. On this side of the House, the government has a very strong view that there needs to be a reaction and the states have moved in some cases. 
Given that the member for Werriwa has said that the states should not be in the business of providing insurance coverage, I am pleased to advise the House that today the state minister for finance in Victoria has announced that the Victorian government will be establishing a government insurance office. He said:
We are announcing today with the Municipal Association of Victoria a public liability insurance scheme that will cover up to 12,000 not-for-profit community groups that are currently having difficulty getting insurance.
The fundamental point is that the state governments are responsible for insurance. It does not take a genius to work it out: the state governments are responsible for insurance because, when you look at the number of acts that state governments have specifically pertaining to insurance, there are 113 pieces of legislation by the state governments relating to insurance. They cover New South Wales, 34 acts; South Australia, seven; Victoria, 23; and so on. I am happy to table that.
The second point is this: the state governments are milking insurance through the taxation they collect. Some states, like Victoria, have the highest level of taxation of insurance of anywhere in the world. Every small business, every tourism operator and every community group is paying up to 40c in the dollar in tax to the state governments. Now the state governments have to react. The state governments have to alleviate the immediate concerns of the small business community, the tourism operators and the community groups who are overwhelmingly concerned not just about the price levels of insurance but about the fact that they cannot obtain it. It is about time for the states to act. They have been working on the short-, medium- and long-term solutions for too long. At the moment there are community groups out there in need of immediate coverage. I am glad Victoria has moved today. I am also glad about the fact that a number of other state schemes are being developed by the states so that they can get back into the business of insurance when it is necessary.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2002-05-28,"—My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware that the member for Dawson has said today that the full privatisation of Telstra will leave regional Australia `on the telecommunications goat track'? Further, is he aware of comments by the member for Riverina, who said that there will be no discussion with the National Party on the sale of Telstra `in the life of this parliament'? Deputy Prime Minister, when will you stand up to the Liberals and stop the full privatisation of Telstra?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra: Sale</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Anderson, John, MP",NP,2002-05-28,"—I will have a look at the claims in relation to the two members but, as has been observed here many times, you do not want to take for granted the opposition's interpretation of what might have been said by others. I would like to make a few comments. One is a very important one. It is the observation that telecommunications in rural and regional Australia are improving, which is something that we have always said is very important, not just socially but economically as well. The Leader of the Opposition has been saying that he knows all about telecommunications in regional areas and that they are not up to scratch. I am not quite certain that I can recall him actually doing a trip out there and having a look at telecommunications, but if he did he might be interested in the list of what we have done. I will just take a few moments to work through some of the things that, as a result of our efforts, are being rolled out.
Opposition members interjecting—
—You can tell all about their interest in regional telecommunications!
—Red Hill is a region to them!
—That is right. The universal service obligation now includes access to a 64-kilobit Internet connection for all Australians. The customer service guarantee has been put in place. It did not exist under Labor. They had a universal service obligation that was so basic and inadequate that you can only assume that, in their desire for a fully publicly owned Telstra, they would go back to the old universal service obligation which, quite apart from anything else, imposed no time limits whatsoever on the delivery of a telephone. There was no customer service guarantee and no effective USO. But now it is in place, it is being progressively tightened, and it is working. Another example is the CDMA mobile network.
—The member for Swan!
—What was the CDMA network rolled out to replace? Labor's analog system. They entered into a contract to abolish a very good service, and we had to find a replacement. They would have left country Australia with no service. People in the remotest parts of Australia now have untimed local calls. They have wanted that for decades. Who delivered it? We delivered it. By July this year, 250 rural and regional exchanges will have a high-speed broadband capacity. Next month, Telstra will begin a new iridium satellite service across Australia, backed by a Commonwealth subsidy on the cost of handsets, providing satellite communications at about half the previous cost. Also about to be released—this is a first in technological terms in Australia; we have done it ahead of the world rest of the world, as I understand it—is a long-range cordless phone. It gives coverage up to 10 kilometres from an existing phone connection. That will be a real boon for the farming community. 
I think it is very important that we outline these things—I really do. We have a commitment to improving rural and regional services.
—I warn the member for Swan!
—To that, it needs to be added that we instituted an inquiry into the standards of services in rural and regional Australia, headed up by Tim Besley, an eminent Australian, who did a quality job and proved the lie to the ALP claim that he would just do a whitewash. He did not. We responded with $167 million worth of initiatives. We have consistently said that, unless those objectives have been met, no further progression will be made on the issue of the Telstra sale. That has been our position. I have clearly indicated—because it is important—that we are committed to improving services. They are improving. All of those commentators who focus only on the economic aspects of selling Telstra need to recognise something else: having world-class technological capacity in telecommunications in rural and regional Australia is vitally important in economic terms as well because of the wealth, the jobs that are generated and the need for it to have first-class technologies at reliable capacities and at economical rates.
Our position on this is very clear. I believe that it is the right position. Again, I would just make the point that the ALP have put up a list of options on how they would break up Telstra and put it back together again. But there is a glaring omission in that policy position. There is nothing in it; there is no commitment at all to ensuring that rural and regional Australia has the telecommunications it needs.

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2002-05-28,"—When I last spoke on the Space Activities Amendment Bill 2002, I pointed out that the government third-party indemnity of $3 billion provided for licensed space launches was probably based on a US assessment of the worst-case scenario, which I understand involved a launch vehicle hitting the Miami Hilton during an American Bar Association convention. As I said previously, I think it is very unlikely that a space launch from Australia would hit an American Bar Association convention, unless of course it was meeting in Broome. I suspect that there may have been scope for a more realistic assessment of the potential third-party risks from a space launch from Australia that would limit the size of the indemnity. 
I understand that the North West Shelf joint venturers have made some significant play about the risks of overflight by space vehicles of their petroleum production facilities. I understand that they were strident on this matter and that their contribution on this issue was neither constructive nor realistic. I do not think that such an incident would be likely to have a cost approaching $4 billion in the unlikely circumstance that it did occur. A careful government protecting the interests of taxpayers could be expected to exercise considerable care in minimising the amount of any indemnity which it did extend. In this case, it should be remembered that the liability which is indemnified is not limited to one incident: it is possible that it could be invoked on more than one occasion. Therefore, limiting the size of that indemnity is all the more important.
In 1999 the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit tabled a report on Commonwealth guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. The report followed a performance audit by the Auditor-General. In that audit it was noted that the Commonwealth's exposure had fallen from a total of $415 billion, as at 30 June 1996, to $215 billion, as at 30 June 1997. The fall reflected two things. The first was that asset sales had shifted risks to the private sector. In the relevant time frame the sale of the final tranche of the Commonwealth Bank occurred. That was a decision of the previous Labor government, and one of the significant policy reasons for it was to limit the exposure of the Commonwealth to financial risk. The second was the exclusion of Commonwealth superannuation liabilities from that figure. The budget papers this year show that those Commonwealth superannuation liabilities will have grown to $82 billion by the end of next month. The most positive thing I can say about this $3 billion third-party indemnity for space launches is that it is being dealt with in a transparent manner here in this bill. That is quite unlike a lot of other guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort that the Commonwealth has accumulated over the years.
It is important to break the psychology that these things can be given without cost. The Commonwealth accepting a financial risk may seem a costless way to assist a project, but the reason the proponents seek a government guarantee is that they are unwilling or unable to assume that risk themselves or cannot find an insurer or a bank to take that risk. The reason for that is that these risks are not costless. Sometimes the chickens come home to roost in unexpected ways. For years the Wheat Board sold grain to Iraq and was able to do so because the government, through EFIC, provided cover on the national interest account. When Australia went to war with Iraq in 1991, the outstanding liability was, from my memory, around $400 million. People who you go to war with usually do not pay their trade bills.
If risks are taken so seriously that they require a government third-party indemnity for a project to proceed, then those risks should be carefully calculated and weighed, and the government should take all reasonable steps to protect taxpayers' interests. In this case, where the amount of risk that the proponent is expected to take is fixed in nominal terms, the proportion of the risk effectively borne by the Commonwealth will increase over the years. I think the Commonwealth should not be afraid to revisit the issue of the size of this indemnity when it has gained a better appreciation of the risks that are being taken in this endeavour.",REPS,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2002-05-28,"—It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on the Space Activities Amendment Bill 2002. This bill is ultimately about support for the high-technology industry within Australia. It is about an industry which has enormous potential and is capable of producing a high level of export dollars for Australia, about creating jobs and also about national pride as a symbol of Australian high-technology leadership in the world. In looking at the bill, I want in particular to address three elements. Firstly, there are the provisions of the bill itself. Secondly, I want to look at a particular example of a project which is of great importance within Victoria and has particular relevance for my electorate—the STARS Supanova project. Thirdly, I want to examine the broader question of what is necessary to create the conditions for high technology and IT investment in Australia and show how this bill contributes to that overall practice and pattern. 
Looking at the first of those questions, the provisions of the bill: the bill is to amend the Space Activities Act 1998. In essence, the bill implements new arrangements relating to liability, insurance and safety, and it has three principal effects. Firstly, it provides greater protection to the public and industries underlying flight paths, so it provides a means of protection for all of those people in industries who fall within the flight path of a space launch from Australian property. In particular, that has significant relevance for those launches which occur in the north-west of Australia and for underlying gas and oil production, hence the high level of liability compared with that of a conference in Miami, as the previous speaker referred to. (Quorum formed) I would particularly like to thank the member for Franklin for inviting other members into this House to talk about the value of high-technology industry to Australia.
The second benefit of the Space Activities Amendment Bill 2002 is that it improves the competitiveness of Australia's space launch industry. Thirdly, it increases opportunities for non-profit, scientific and educational organisations to engage in space and science research. How does it do that?
Firstly, it provides protection and it increases competitiveness. It provides protection by requiring that launch proponents— those firms engaged in the process of preparing to launch satellites from Australian soil—have $750 million in public liability insurance of their own. In addition to that, as a symbol and as a tangible sign of Australian government support for that activity, the Commonwealth takes responsibility under this amendment for liability for the gap from $750 million to $3 billion. In addition, it assumes liability for any costs or damage to foreign nationals or their property. The real purpose of this is the focus on preventing any harm, either to the tangible assets or to the notional assets, of offshore drilling in Australia's North West Cape and Shelf.
Secondly, the bill also applies a stronger test of risk to space launch activities, so it imposes the requirement that the risk before any activity is approved should be as low as reasonably practicable. Thirdly, it provides opportunities for scientific and educational organisations. In particular, the bill implements new arrangements to license scientific and educational institutions conducting research based launch activities. Importantly, these arrangements will provide for an alternative application process and fee structure which is less onerous and better suited to the modest scale and limited risks associated with scientific and educational launches and returns. Very simply what that means is that scientific or educational groups wishing to participate in space launch activities within Australia are encouraged rather than discouraged from doing so.
In particular, I want to refer to an example from Victoria: the STARS Supernova program. While not benefiting directly from this particular amendment, it is an example of exactly the sort of activity which we seek to encourage within Australia. In 1999, the then Victorian Premier, Mr Jeff Kennett, and Australia's own astronaut, Andy Thomas, helped launch the STARS Supernova program. It was a program which aimed to allow a Victorian school to contribute an experiment to a NASA space shuttle project. That project was won by Glen Waverley Secondary College and it was coordinated by Kevin and Jenny Manning, NASA teachers from within the town of Cranbourne. Cranbourne is within my electorate and hence I have a particular interest in that. Since that time, Kevin and Jenny Manning, with the strong support of Gary Rowe, the Victorian MLA for the seat of Cranbourne, have worked towards bringing this project to fruition.
The space shuttle was due to be launched on 9 July 2002, just over 1½ months from now. But what has happened is an extraordinary piece of bureaucracy. The Victorian Department of State and Regional Development, under Minister John Brumby, wrote to the United States authorities cancelling the project only some months before the space shuttle was due to be launched. Worse than that, students had already been to the United States and spent their own money on the basis of this promise. What was the total project cost to the Victorian government? It was $US65,000. But there was a cancellation fee. How much was the cancellation fee? It was $US60,000. So for a benefit of $US5,000 the Victorian government wastes $60,000 and destroys a nascent space and scientific activities program.  
I call on the Premier of Victoria and the state and regional development minister, John Brumby, to take urgent action to allow the students of Glen Waverley Secondary College and Kevin and Jenny Manning to be allowed to participate in and complete this project. If the opposition in this place talks about its commitment to high technology then they should speak very quickly with their Victorian counterparts to make sure that a project, for the benefit of $5,000, is not discontinued and $60,000 wasted in the process of so doing.
I want to turn briefly to the final point, and that is that this bill is part of establishing the conditions for high-tech and IT investment in Australia. Firstly, you require a legislative regime which is encouraging, and that is where this bill fits in. Secondly, you require appropriate research and development support. The current federal government has already agreed to provide $100 million from the strategic investment incentives program to facilitate the Asia Pacific Space Centre at Christmas Island. So there are a number of commercial contracts and intergovernmental agreements already in place which all work towards providing the basic facilities for space activity—airport, road, port, and all at Christmas Island. That is a tangible show of the government's support for R&D for space activities within Australia.
Finally, there has to be a general economic environment which encourages overseas investors. Those facts, as were set out in the budget last week, are very clear. We have interest rates in the low six per cent range. We have a labour force which has dropped in unemployment from 10 per cent in 1991-92 to 6.3 per cent now, and in so doing there are increased levels of skills and effectiveness. Interestingly, we have had an increase in the participation rate from 62.9 per cent in 1991-92 to 63.4 per cent now. Very importantly, we have a low inflationary environment and a low debt environment—from 19.1 per cent of Commonwealth government debt as a percentage of GDP in 1996 to 5.8 per cent now. All of these activities have a significant impact on the overall economic environment.
In arguing for the bill, I note simply that it provides the legislative arm of a three-part process for encouraging the conditions for IT investment. Firstly, there has to be the legislative regime; secondly, there has to be R&D support; and, thirdly, there has to be a solid economic environment. This bill firmly puts in place the first limb of those elements. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2002-05-28,"—I would like to speak very briefly to the Space Activities Amendment Bill 2002. I think most members would be supportive of the general intent of the bill. I would like to reflect on some parts of this bill. I listened to the previous speakers talk about the insurance indemnity issues and the insurance dilemma that the Commonwealth may face in relation to some problems with space material. I would like to place on record my absolute disgust that parliament today is not even bothering to debate the issue of public liability and the concerns that the general community have about medical indemnity and public liability in relation to the normal activities of our daily lives. I know it is terribly important to have indemnity insurance for things that may happen in space, and I know that this bill is of crucial importance to what may fall on us at some future time. But I think those crucial matters of medical indemnity and public liability are of much more importance for this parliament to debate at this particular time. 
I think the general public of Australia would be more concerned about having space for their kids at a pony club, space in a doctors surgery somewhere in country Australia or space for a Lions Club to carry out a charitable event in the future for their communities, rather than having the debate on public liability insurance gagged today to bring on the space activities debate which is about liability in terms of junk from space and some of the activities of our own space program. So I want to put on the record my absolute disgust at the way the parliament has conducted itself today, the lack of concern displayed by the Liberal and National parties about the public liability issue and the need for that debate to take place. I would hope that the opposition or perhaps the Independents at tomorrow's sitting will raise that issue once again, because it does need debate. The Australian public is looking for some leadership in relation to this issue. They are looking for solutions in relation to this issue.  
—It is all very well for the Minister for Small Business and Tourism to interject and suggest that it all has to be done by the states. There is a leadership role, particularly in the medical indemnity area—
 (Hon. L.R.S. Price)—Order! The minister is not in his seat. It is highly disorderly to interject that way.
—There is a leadership role for the Commonwealth to play, particularly in relation to medical indemnity. There are a lot of people in our community who are very concerned about what is happening. There is a lot of stress in our community, particularly in relation to the doctors at the moment, and 2 June is becoming a very crucial date in relation to those particular issues. I would urge the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, who is now seated, to take that on board and show some leadership on what this place can do in relation to medical indemnity.
—You should have done this back in the state parliament.
—I support the bill before the House, and I ask the parliament to debate a much more important issue at the next available time.",REPS,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2002-05-28,"—I would like, first of all, to thank those members who participated in the debate on the Space Activities Amendment Bill 2002 today. I welcome the opposition's general support for this bill. The government, however, does not support the amendment moved by the member for Rankin. As important as the issue of the rising cost of public liability is, with all due respect, it is not relevant to debate on this particular amendment bill. It is, of course, nonsense for the member for Rankin and for the member for New England to suggest that the government has been inactive in addressing concerns associated with the rising cost of public liability. As the Minister for Small Business and Tourism suggested a moment ago, had the member for New England been a little more proactive when he was a member of the state parliament, a lot more could have been done to address these concerns. 
It is very much a real concern to the coalition government. The Assistant Treasurer, Senator Helen Coonan, has been doing a magnificent job in facilitating negotiations with the Labor states and territories on this issue and is certainly driving the issue forward. I would remind both the member for Rankin and the member for New England that, as I said earlier, the bulk of the responsibility for fixing these problems in fact rests with the Labor state and territory governments. I thank the members for Flinders, Wentworth and Kooyong for their positive contributions and comments.
I welcome the commitment of $100 million towards the development of Christmas Island as a centre for commercial rocket launches. The aim of the strategic investment coordination process is to attract to Australia investment that would otherwise be located offshore. Indeed, just a little over 12 months ago, countries such as Brazil were very actively trying to lure APSC to their purpose-built rocket facility. The imminent commencement of construction of APSC's facilities on Christmas Island brings Australia to the closest point that we have ever been to successfully starting a commercial rocket launch industry. It is estimated that $800 million will be invested by APSC and up to 550 jobs created. This will certainly be a tremendous outcome and I wish APSC every success.
The Howard government is committed to supporting the aspirations of the Asia Pacific Space Centre in establishing a rocket launch facility on Christmas Island, as we are committed to supporting the aspirations of other potential proponents; namely, Spacelift Australia and Kissler Aerospace. Indeed, the amendments in this bill are critical to the future success of those project proposals. A number of commercial contracts and intergovernment agreements are already in place and others are in the process of being finalised. 
I reject the member for Corio's claim about an alleged lack of consultation with the Christmas Island community. I know for a fact that former territories minister, Senator Ian Macdonald—who, I must say, played a vital and integral role in locking in APSC's commitment to locating their project in Australia—made a number of visits to Christmas Island to discuss the development of the APSC project. He met the Christmas Island Shire Council and other community leaders as well as the island's administrator. I, too, have been to Christmas Island to discuss the APSC project and to meet with representatives from the shire council and other community leaders. I am sure that the current minister is continuing that dialogue and consultation.
Only yesterday I met with APSC's Managing Director, Mr David Kwon, who outlined the company's plan for the next round of consultation with the Christmas Island community. I understand that Mr Kwon also met yesterday with members from the Northern Territory and the member for Batman to update the opposition on the progress of the APSC project. I have also seen publications that were put out by APSC in other languages so that there could be no confusion by the Christmas Island community. So any suggestion that there has been a lack of consultation is totally rejected and is just an absolute nonsense.
In terms of the environmental impact assessment, APSC committed some $2 million to this process, developing a detailed management program over the course of some three years. The proposal by APSC to construct and operate a launch facility on Christmas Island has been subjected to a full environmental assessment under the Environment Protection Impact of Proposals Act 1974. The former environment minister, Senator Robert Hill, set down some 65 conditions for APSC to meet with regard to environmental management and the conduct of their proposed commercial rocket launch facility. This has been by no means a quick and expedient process as suggested by some members opposite.
As set out in Minister Ian Macfarlane's second reading speech, the Space Activities Amendment Bill 2002 amends the Space Activities Act 1998. This bill enhances liability and insurance arrangements governing space launches and affords greater protection to Australia's oil and gas facilities. It also brings Australia's insurance and liability arrangements into line with international practice. This will enhance certainty for, and the competitiveness of, Australian industry and will protect Australia's strategic economic assets. In addition, this bill provides for new arrangements for the licensing of space launch activities conducted by scientific and educational organisations, thereby promoting the development of space science expertise in Australia. The Space Activities Amendment Bill 2002 facilitates the development of Australia's space industry by putting in place the regulatory framework needed to create a competitive environment, to promote research into space science technology and to encourage private investment in emerging space launch and research projects.
 (Hon. L.R.S. Price)—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Rankin has moved as an amendment that all words after `That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.
Question agreed to.

Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.",REPS,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2002-05-28,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2002 amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 and the A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge Fringe Benefits) Act 1999 to increase the Medicare levy low income threshold amounts for individuals, married couples, sole parents and pensioners below age pension age. It also increases the phase-in limits as a result of the increased threshold amounts. There are also two minor technical amendments. These measures were announced in the recent budget. 
In general terms, the bill amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the Medicare levy low income thresholds for individuals, married couples and sole parents. The dependent child-student component of the family threshold will also be increased. These increases are in line with movements in the CPI, which is the tradition in which this bill has been effected for a number of years. The bill also amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the Medicare levy low income threshold for pensioners below age pension age so that they do not have a Medicare levy liability where they do not have an income tax liability, and it also amends the Medicare Levy Act to allow a family income threshold to apply to a taxpayer where the taxpayer is entitled to a child-housekeeper rebate or a housekeeper rebate. The bill also amends the A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge Fringe Benefits) Act 1999 to increase the Medicare levy surcharge low income threshold, again in line with movements in the CPI, which is the annual tradition in this matter. The bill also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to make a technical amendment to correct references to the provisions of the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986. 
The increased Medicare levy and the Medicare levy surcharge low income thresholds will apply from the 2002-03 year of income and later years of income, the technical amendment to the Medicare levy family income threshold applies to assessments for the 2001-02 year of income and later years of income and the technical amendment of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to the definition of prescribed purposes for the Medicare levy purposes applies to assessments for the 1997-98 year of income and later years of income. As those amendments apply a benefit to the taxpayer rather than a detriment, there is of course no objection to the retrospective nature of the effect of those amendments to those assessments for the years 1997-98 and continuing.
No Medicare levy is payable for low income individuals and families where taxable income does not exceed threshold amounts. For couples and single parents, the family income threshold amount increases by a set amount per child. The Medicare levy shades in at a rate of 20 cents in the dollar where the taxable income or family income exceeds the threshold amounts. The individual threshold amount is proposed to be increased from $13,807 to $14,539; the family income threshold is increased from $23,299 to $24,534; the amount added by each dependent child or student is increased from $2,140 to $2,253; and the threshold amount for pensioners who are under age pension age is increased from $15,970 to $16,570. 
A surcharge of one per cent applies on taxable income in certain circumstances where taxpayers do not have private hospital cover. However, a married person is not required to pay the surcharge where the total of their taxable income and reportable fringe benefits does not exceed the individual low income threshold amount. The threshold for the Medicare levy surcharge is proposed to be increased from $13,807 to $14,539. So far as child-housekeeper rebate or housekeeper rebate amendments are concerned, taxpayers are generally denied a child-housekeeper rebate or a housekeeper rebate due to the introduction of the family tax benefit. However, some persons are still entitled to this rebate and in these circumstances a family income threshold can be used when determining their Medicare levy liability. 
The opposition has no objection to those amendments; indeed, we support them. These have been done essentially on an annual basis to ensure that low income members of our community are not adversely impacted upon by increases in the CPI, and the threshold and levy arrangements reflect that. 
This bill goes to the heart of Medicare and goes to the heart of an important component of Medicare and, as a consequence, at the conclusion of my remarks I will formally move a second reading amendment, which my colleague will second. To draw the attention of the House to that second reading amendment, the second reading amendment is in the following terms:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
 “the House, recognising that the provisions of this equitable measure will appropriately exempt some individuals, couples and sole parents from the levy and surcharge in line with movements in the consumer price index, supports the bill but:
(1)	notes that the Government's overall approach to Medicare has seen the regrettable position where General Practitioner bulk billing usage has declined to only 74%;
(2)	notes that the average extra cost to a patient for a non bulk billing GP visit is now $12;
(3)	notes that those who can afford private health insurance have been subject recently to substantial increases in premiums, on average $150 extra per year;
(4)	notes that pensioners and concession card holders and those families under financial pressures will suffer further as a result of the Government's latest budget measures, in particular the proposed 30% increase in payments for essential medicines; and
(5)	calls on the Government to recognise the Australian community's belief in and support of bulk billing and Medicare and to accept that the Government must match that community commitment in its health policies”.
In some important respects there is an irony in the bill before us. The essential irony is this: the bill seeks to implement increases in threshold and levy measures equitably so far as low income persons are concerned, and that is supported. But it is against a backdrop of a range of measures which the government has effected or is proposing to introduce which place enormous financial pressure on the one hand on pensioners and concession cardholders and on the other hand on families under financial pressure. Bulk-billing goes to the heart of Medicare as a universal health care system, and visits to general practitioners go to the heart of primary care for beneficial health outcomes for Australians, and they go to the application of preventive measures so that Australians will not fall even further into our health system. Bulk-billing is an essential part of Medicare. 
Last week we saw the annual quarterly production of the Medicare statistics—an invaluable document produced by the Department of Health and Ageing. The statistics go from 1984-85 to the March quarter. I will draw the attention of the House to a couple of extracts from the Medicare bible. On page 18 there is graph No. 5, `Medicare services by broad type of services for the year 2000-01'. It simply makes the point that GP consultations make up 47 per cent of Medicare services by broad type. So almost half of Medicare is essentially consultation with general practitioners. 
What we also see in the Medicare statistics published last week in table B7, which is again an invaluable table in this matter, are details of the percentage of services direct billed by quarter and financial year of processing. There are some important adverse and deleterious developments which we are seeing, not based on quarterly figures but on annual figures, over a period of time. 
I take the government back to when it was elected to office in March 1996. Looking at table B7—it does not much matter whether you take the 1995-96 financial year—I think you can fairly say that by June 1996 it was unlikely that any of the government's new policies would have had an impact on those statistics. So you can take the 1995-96 year and fairly say that it probably accurately represents the last annual statistic of the previous Labor government. The year 1996-97 is, if you like, the first accurate year of life under this government as we have come to know it. 
I draw the House's attention to the fact that in the 1995-96 financial year the percentage of general practitioners' services directly billed or bulk-billed was 80.1 per cent. In the following year, 1996-97—the first full year of the Howard government— the statistic was 80.6 per cent. That makes up, as I have indicated from the graph in table No. 5, about 47 per cent, which is essentially half of the Medicare services. Table B7 also deals with specialist services, obstetrics services, anaesthetist services, pathology services, diagnostic imaging, operations, optometry, and totals them all up.
I will not draw the House's attention to all of them because not all are directly relevant to this debate, but I make the point that, in 1995-96, 32.5 per cent of specialist services were bulk-billed and, in 1996-97, 32.4 per cent. For pathology, the rate was 76.1 per cent in 1995-96 and 77.8 per cent the following year, 1996-97. For diagnostic imaging, it was 61.3 per cent in 1995-96 and 62.7 per cent in 1996-97. For optometry, it was 94.5 per cent in 1995-96 and 96 per cent in 1996-97. When that was averaged out by the department for a total in the financial year 1995-96, 71.1 per cent of Medicare services were direct or bulk-billed. In the following year, 71.8 per cent were direct or bulk-billed.
When you come to this quarter—essentially, the period of life under the Howard government as we have come to know it— the rate of bulk-billing or direct billing by general practitioners has fallen from a high of 80.6 per cent—essentially 80 per cent when the government came to office—to 74.5 per cent. That has shown a decline year in, year out, since 1996-97. So only 74.5 per cent of GP services now are bulk-billed. So far as specialist services are concerned, we have seen a fall from 32.4 per cent to 29.2 per cent. You would not regard that as being historically surprising. In pathology, we have seen an increase from 76.1 per cent or 77.8 per cent in those respective financial years to 84.1 per cent. In diagnostic imaging, it has been relatively stable—61.3 or 62.7, down to 60.4. So far as optometry is concerned, it has gone from 94.5 or 96 per cent to a relatively stable 96 per cent and it all averages out at 70.5. When the government is confronted with these statistics, the Minister for Health and Ageing in the other place says, `Oh no, you have to look at the total amount, not at the GP decline.' When we see increases in optometry and quite substantial increases in pathology it is no wonder that the decline in the average or the total amount is not as stark as the average for GPs. But this is 47 per cent of Medicare services and it is at the heart of primary care or preventative care for Australians. 
I drew attention to pathology and diagnostic imaging because, when you go back to the graph in table 5 on page 18, pathology makes up 29 per cent, nearly one-third of Medicare services by type, and diagnostic imaging makes up six per cent. So if pathology makes up one-third, then the increase from 1994-95 from 74 or 76 per cent to 84 per cent gives you the explanation as to why the total, or the average, has only fallen from a 1995-96 figure of 71.1 to a 70.5 figure today, which is the minister's relatively or completely implausible excuse for the situation that we see in the bulk-billing decline by GPs. 
That concern is reflected by the second reading amendment. It means that bulk-billing rates for GPs are now the lowest in a decade. When the Prime Minister and the government came to office the rate of bulk-billing for GPs was over 80 per cent. Now it has fallen below 75 per cent. There are about 100 million GP services a year. That means that on John Howard's watch the number of GP services which are bulk-billed have declined by five million a year over that period. The average cost of a visit to a GP who does not bulk-bill is now $12. That can vary. In some instances that have been drawn to my attention, it can go as high as an extra charge of $50, but the average cost, in accordance with the departmental figures, is $12. That means Australian families are paying $60 million extra each year for GP visits than they were paying when the government came to office. 
—Did you introduce it? 
—You do not even know what we are talking about, Minister. I would not interject. I am talking about GP bulk-billing; I am not talking about pharmaceutical benefits. I will happily move on to that. Joe, you have difficulty in getting it right when you know what subject matter you are talking about. When you interject and you do not know the subject matter, you are even worse.
 (Mr Lindsay)—Order! Please address your remarks through the chair.
—Why shouldn't people pay for it?
—Order!
—I am asking him a question and he doesn't want to answer it.
—Member for Perth, through the chair, please.
—I am happy to respond, but the impression I have, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that you do not want me to. Australians are paying $60 million more per year for their doctor visits. In terms of the burden that places on Australians under financial pressure, that is on top of the extra $500 million Australians are now paying for increases approved by the government in private health insurance premiums—and that comes to an average of $150 per family per year—and in addition to the extra $300-odd million that the government would want Australian pensioners and concession cardholders to pay on their Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme copayments if the government's proposals in the budget go through the parliament, which we, of course, will oppose.
It is quite clear, by the range of government proposals—whether it is GPs bulk-billing, the cost of essential medicines or private health insurance premiums—that this government is placing a huge burden on families under financial pressure, those who are the sickest and those who are least able to afford it. There is an element here of `one story before the election and a different story after,' which we have seen so much from this government.
—The minister interjects about whether people believe what they say. We know precisely what the government and the Prime Minister think about bulk-billing. Whilst they tugged their forelock and said they had a different view in the run-up to the 1996 election, and continue to say that disingenuously now, we know what John Howard and the Liberal Party actually think about bulk-billing. In the run-up to the 1987 election, when John Howard was Leader of the Opposition, he said:
We will end bulk billing, which produces a scandalous waste of money.
He was being interviewed by John Laws, and he said:
We will be proposing changes to Medicare that amount to its defacto dismantling. 
John Laws asked:
So you'll pull it apart?
And John Howard responded:
Yes, we'll pull it right apart.
To get yourself elected in 1996, you said you would not make any changes. What have you been doing for a six-year period? You have been doing what John Howard said you would do: de facto dismantling. Your inaction on the medical benefits scheme and the relative value study has seen a deliberate policy approach to ensure that more and more doctors are forced to charge a copayment and not engage in bulk-billing. This has been John Howard's approach from day one. You could not do it through the front door because you knew the backlash in the community would be substantial, so you spent a six- or seven-year period doing it through the back door. I do not need to go through the litany of other quotations in that respect.
—How are you going to pay for it?
—One thing you might want to do, Minister, is have a look at the relative value study, which you have put in the dust cupboard and not looked at. That might actually be a sensible way of proceeding in this area, rather than sitting on your hands, doing nothing and deliberately running bulk-billing and Medicare down, which is your strategy. 
—Bulk-billing is in place. You know that.
—Bulk-billing is in place. It has fallen every year since you have been in office. It has fallen from a high of 80.6 per cent in the former Labor government's time to 74.5 per cent on this occasion.
—So people are choosing to pay. It isn't a bad thing if people choose to pay.
—People are not choosing to pay; people are being forced to pay. What do we find? We find plummeting rates so far as bulk-billing is concerned; we find a $500 million increase in the cost of private health insurance premiums to Australians—on average $150 per family—and we find the government introducing a 30 per cent copayment increase so that one million pensioners and concession cardholders will pay the maximum extra $52 per year for their essential medicines and 300,000 Australians in families will pay the maximum of $190 extra per year.
Across the board, we find increasing copayments for pharmaceuticals, increasing payments for visits to doctors for primary care and preventative medicine, increasing costs of essential medicines and increasing costs of private health insurance—not to mention the way in which this government, over a six-year period, has ripped between $600 million and $700 million out of the state public hospital system. There is a nice irony about the equitable nature of this proposal in the bill and the great inequity which we see across the board now so far as the government's approach to health policy is concerned. I move:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
 “the House, recognising that the provisions of this equitable measure will appropriately exempt some individuals, couples and sole parents from the levy and surcharge in line with movements in the consumer price index, supports the bill but:
(1)	notes that the Government's overall approach to Medicare has seen the regrettable position where General Practitioner bulk billing usage has declined to only 74%;
(2)	notes that the average extra cost to a patient for a non bulk billing GP visit is now $12;
(3)	notes that those who can afford private health insurance have been subject recently to substantial increases in premiums, on average $150 extra per year;
(4)	notes that pensioners and concession card holders and those families under financial pressures will suffer further as a result of the Government's latest budget measures, in particular the proposed 30% increase in payments for essential medicines; and
 (5)	calls on the Government to recognise the Australian community's belief in and support of bulk billing and Medicare and to accept that the Government must match that community commitment in its health policies”.
That does not mention the adverse implications that will come with the cost to the Australian taxpayer and the Australian community as a result of the government's mismanagement of medical indemnity insurance and public liability insurance—matters, Minister, in respect of which you do not come to either argument with clean hands. On medical indemnity insurance, we find a government asleep at the wheel and subsequently mismanaging a crisis.
The opposition support the bill, but we place very strongly on record the concerns that we have about the government's deliberate attempt to reduce the capacity of Medicare to be a universal health system and to reduce the capacity of bulk-billing to continue to play a very important part in our national health care system.
 (Mr Lindsay)—Is the amendment seconded?

Sitting suspended from 6.29 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY AND MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2002-05-28,"—It is a great pleasure to see you in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield. I know that many of your constituents will find that the Taxation Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2002 fits the bill for them. It will be just perfect for your constituents, many of whom I know. For those whom I do not know, I know you will be advocating the attributes of this tremendously thoughtful government. The bill is only 19 lines long but it does some important things: it changes the limits for people who do not have to pay the Medicare levy and it increases the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for individuals, married couples and sole parents. The dependent child/student component of the family is important in the way in which those assessments are made. The bill applies to people who are below pension age so that they do not have a Medicare levy liability where they do not have an income tax liability. It allows a family income threshold to apply to a taxpayer where the taxpayer is entitled to a child-housekeeper rebate or a housekeeper rebate. 
There we are, Mr Deputy Speaker: it is a very comprehensive piece of legislation that is only 19 lines long but it has attached to it two schedules that set the levels of the levy that will be applied under this government in 2002. The increases are set out in schedule 1. The minister made a speech of about 20 lines when he introduced the bill but we are giving it too little attention, bearing in mind what it achieves. The bill grants concessions for people who deserve concessions. The thoughtfulness in the way in which this is to be applied, due to the changes in the tax system, indicates the heart of this government for Australian families.
The bill provides that no Medicare levy is payable for low-income individuals, as I have said, and families where taxable income does not exceed a certain threshold. The documents show that for an individual taxpayer this year no levy is payable if the taxable income or family income for the current financial year does not exceed $14,539. There is a reduced levy if taxable income or family income is within the range of $14,540 to $15,717. A pensioner under age pension age is relieved from paying any Medicare levy if their taxable income is below $16,570, and that is an increase of about $600 per year. The levy is reduced if there is an income range of $16,571 to $17,913. A married taxpayer with children or students has this benefit: with a family income of $24,534 or less there is no levy. If their income ranges from roughly $24,500 to approximately $26,500, they will get a graduated payment opportunity. 
What I like, what your constituents will like, Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, and what the people of Mitchell will like is that where there are children the levy goes up— there is increased income without the levy being paid—and the amount rises. Regrettably these days, not too many families have six children, but a family with six children can have a family income of $38,052 and not pay the levy. It is then graduated from $38,053 to $41,000-odd. There is a real advantage for families. That is what the government has been on about. Nothing better illustrates the commitment of this government than the Medicare levy or the Medicare levy surcharge. There we have it in a nutshell: all the levels have increased from about $500 to a couple of thousand dollars per year for families with several children. That makes quite a difference per week for the average family. Throw in the other benefits of the changed tax scales—low inflation and low interest rates—and it is evident we are trying to do a better job for families.
I would be the first to admit that you are going to identify problems and find individuals who fall outside the range of what governments do. Whilst this is very significant and laudable, there will always be more that we can do for families. The trouble with government from such a distance as Canberra is that it is so generalised in the application of its formulas that people fall between the cracks. That is where we need to support and rely on non-government agencies to pick up on what governments cannot do. Governments cannot do everything, but they should assist those agencies which have the ability to assist families. They should be supporting those agencies to fulfil a total delivery.
The financial impact of this process and the changes are valued at $42.8 million in the coming financial year, $21 million in the following year and so on. In each year there is a cost to the tax revenue, as the tax commissioner puts it, but I prefer to say that there is a concession for families that is well warranted. I am delighted that we are passing this legislation through the House tonight and I am delighted at its impact on Australian families. 
However, I am not so pleased about some aspects of the amendment moved by the Australian Labor Party. One aspect is completely and absolutely dishonest. Paragraph (4) of the opposition amendment makes the claim about: 
... the proposed 30 per cent increase in payments for essential medicines.
That is absolutely, grossly wrong. If you think that you are going to run that line out there with the community and frighten them as you tried to with the GST, you are going to fail again with this one. The fact is that medicines have not risen by 30 per cent. A product like a Ventolin CFC-free inhaler with 200 doses costs $17.20 and the price will stay the same for a non-pensioner; it has not increased. The only changes are at the margin where the benefit level changes from $22.60 to $28.60. That is an increase of $6. Some items are no longer within that previous range and some items will cost slightly more. However, no item, even at that top range, will cost more than $6 in addition to the $22.60. Some of the items that are subsidised by the government cost hundreds of dollars per prescription. Many of them are in the range of $60 to $80 per prescription. Nobody who is part of the national health scheme will pay more than $28.60. 
There is a slight change for people who are not eligible for pension benefits under this scheme, but let me repeat: to say that medicines have risen or will rise by 30 per cent is an absolute lie and the Australian Labor Party ought to be ashamed of itself for trying to run this line in its amendment. It will not work because people out there will find that there is no change for all low-priced medicines. They will go into chemists and will be amazed to say, `I thought this was going up,' and the pharmacist will say, `There's no rise. It's under $28.60 so there's been no change to it, and anything that's priced over $28.60 will not cost more than $28.60 because that's the way the subsidy program works.' For elderly people, pensioners or those on benefits, there has been an increase of $1—from $3.60 to $4.60. They will not pay more than $4.60 for anything. The 30 per cent increase just is not there. I do not know what you think you will achieve as an organisation by trying to run this line.
The other line the Australian Labor Party has tried to run on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is that the changes mean that all prescriptions are going to increase by $6.20, and that is not right either. On both accounts you are wrong and have been misrepresenting the case. If it is so bad, you do not have to misrepresent it. Through this process I feel that you are cooking up something that you can manufacture as a reason for having a go at blocking this measure in the Senate. 
Whilst it would be most desirable that all pharmaceuticals never changed in price and the price always stayed the same, the fact is that the costs of the most beneficial products are increasing rapidly. There are high research costs and high costs to the taxpayer who subsidises them. In 10 years, the cost of this scheme has risen from a shade over $1 billion to over $4 billion. We need to take some action now, considering the population's age, and modify the process. The user needs to pay a little more and that is what this is about. The user will be paying a little more than previously.
You can run through product after product, the commonly used products if you like. I will repeat some of the things that have been said in the House today, because they bear repeating. I will say again that a CFC-free Ventolin inhaler with 200 doses costs $17.20 today; with these changes, it will cost $17.20 tomorrow. There is no change in the cost of a product like Ventolin. If we take sleeping tablets, Normison, for instance, the cost for 25 tablets is $7.58 before the changes; after the changes it will be $7.58. No misrepresentation will add 30 per cent to that, and you will endeavour to fit the figures around it—I know you did not, Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, but members of your party did prior to the introduction of the GST—to try to scare people. But, see, it just did not work. They did not believe you.
You will not do it with this either, because the fact is that Normison, after these changes, will stay at $7.58. It will stay the same price before the changes as after the changes. Sleeping pills, antibiotics, Ventolin—you have consistently as an Australian Labor Party tried to mislead the people of Australia, and they are not going to accept that. They are not going to believe it, because that is not the way it is going to turn out. When they do see the impact of it they will be surprised by how little change there really is, and what change does occur is a necessary change. 
I conclude my remarks tonight on a related medical issue, which is partly referred to in the amendments by the opposition, and that is the problem of indemnity insurance for the medical profession and for specialists in particular. It is a huge worry for all Australians, and it is something that in my mind is much bigger than the Ansett crash, because it does affect everybody and the solutions are not particularly easy to find. I have a friend who is a neurosurgeon, a brilliant surgeon who is paying for insurance to protect himself and his family from any litigation. He is paying something like $96,000 a year. To join the fund he has paid $11,000. So you are looking at $110,000 before he opens the door. He is saying to me, `I can't go on like this, and not knowing whether I am going to be covered.' He said, `I don't expect the Australian government to pick up the total bill, but we have got to find a certainty through this.'
One of the things that has disturbed me most in the process over the last few weeks is to hear the CEO of the Doctors Fund come out and so strongly endorse the fund and encourage doctors to continue to support it and then within a month it was in liquidation. That, to me, is a huge worry: that somebody can so, I would say in this place, misrepresent the situation of their company. It is totally unfair, totally unwarranted and totally inept. I wish the government well in the gradual process over the next few days of clearing up step after step in a methodical way. I wish to compliment the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer on the way in which she has been able to approach this. But it is a huge worry and it is going to be expensive for all Australians.
I just hope that we do not find that we have a system where the only safe haven for doctors to practise is in the public sector and that we continue to have a thriving private sector, and that the insurance factors—the litigation, the greed in some ways of people wanting to demonstrate that they can grab some of the insurance companies' money by using clever lawyers or by having judges who seem to make very inconsistent decisions—support them when they go to court. We will all be aware of the case of the surf club and the man at Bondi Beach who received $3.75 million. I quote from the Daily Telegraph of 15 May—where that gentleman who received $3.75 million said that he would have been happy with half a million; he did not really need the extras—where it is claimed by Sir Harry Gibbs:
Some judges seem to strive to find a reason for finding in favour of a plaintiff, particularly if the injuries are serious, so that he or she may receive compensation ... 
In the result, damages are sometimes awarded in cases in which a reasonable and informed person would not have thought that the defendant was at fault.
Sir Harry Gibbs is a very distinguished former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. I think his comments are sensible. There is case after case of a similar nature. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY AND MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2002-05-28,"— The Taxation Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2002 lifts the low income thresholds for the Medicare levy and in so doing is a progressive move, one of the rather few progressive moves that this government has initiated in its term of office starting back in 1996. It should not come as a surprise, because it is doing what a Labor government would do— that is, making sure that low income families do not pay the Medicare levy. For those very basic and fair reasons, Labor supports the legislation.
Equally, Labor supports the second reading amendment to this legislation, because we remain very concerned about the direction of the government's health policy under the stewardship of the Prime Minister of Australia. When the Prime Minister was elected to that position in 1996, the Australian people knew very well what they were getting. He had been a man in public life already for a long time and, in lieu of any sort of vision for the country's future, he had a very simple agenda of three or four items. One of those items was changes to the industrial relations system, essentially to tilt the bargaining table in favour of employers at the expense of employees. Certainly under the current Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations the zeal with which the government pursues the Prime Minister's long cherished aims is undiminished. In fact, I think it is fair to say that even more zealotry is being displayed day by day under the current minister. 
So that has been a fundamental item on the Prime Minister's agenda for many years. Another, of course, was the implementation of the goods and services tax, which he first flirted with as Treasurer of this country as early as 1980—more than 20 years ago. We know that in the year 2000—20 years later— the Prime Minister achieved his cherished goal there and implemented the goods and services tax. I will say a little more about the implications of the financial arrangements flowing out of the GST for health in a moment.
A third and critical item on the Prime Minister's narrow agenda has been the dismantling of Medicare. You do not need to rely on my assertions to form a judgment that what I am saying is true; you need to rely purely on the words of the Prime Minister himself when he was opposition leader. In the lead-up to the 1987 election in an interview with Alan Jones—the same Alan Jones who is still on radio in Sydney—on 27 May 1987, the then opposition leader and present Prime Minister said:
What I'm going to do is take a scalpel, without punning too much, to Medicare. I'm going to say to people if you want to get out of Medicare and make your own private health insurance arrangements you can do so. They will be given an incentive to do it. They will not have to pay the levy. I'll get rid of bulk billing completely for people other than pensioners. I'll free up the whole private health insurance market so that health funds can in competition with each other offer a variety of packages to help consumers.
That was the Prime Minister's agenda then, 13 years ago. Just a few days later, on 1 June 1987, he told the John Laws program:
There will be many major reductions in health, the Medicare system is a total disaster, we will be proposing changes to Medicare that amount to its de facto dismantling. We will pull it right apart.
That is what the Prime Minister has been on about all these years. But the Australian people delivered an adverse verdict on that agenda in 1987 and the Hawke government was returned with an increased majority. The opposition went underground with its desire to pull Medicare right apart, to take a scalpel to Medicare, and it decided that the smartest thing to do was to do it by stealth, because Medicare was, and is, very popular with the Australian people.
They appointed an unfortunate man, as it turned out, as their health spokesman—Peter Shack. Peter Shack was an aspiring politician. He had made it to the opposition frontbench. He was a relatively young man and was given the job of coming up with an alternative health policy. Three years later, after the now Prime Minister had been saying that they would pull Medicare right apart, that they would make money out of the process and that they would make no-one worse off, he gave these as terms of reference to poor Mr Shack and, of course, they were impossible to achieve. Mr Shack did not know that and the pin was pulled on him just before the 1990 election. I would like to remind members of the parliament, many of whom were not around at that stage—I was a staffer—of a famous press conference where the coalition sent him out to explain how after three years there was no health policy. He had these remarkable statements to make:
Now I want to say to you, with all the frankness that I can muster, the Liberal and National Parties do not have a particularly good track record in health and you don't need me to remind you of our last period in government.
That last period in government was when they tried to gut Medicare, in the form of Medibank at that stage. He then went to say at the same famous press conference:
We went through Medibank Marks 1 to 4, or 4½; or 5, when we were last in government. Since we have been in opposition we have had four health spokespersons and we have produced four health policies—two of which were never made public. I think the last one in the 1987 election probably lost us votes instead of winning us votes. 
That was the current Prime Minister's health policy in the 1987 election, and Mr Shack was right: it did cost votes. The hapless Mr Shack conceded at this great press conference, in this great moment of candour:
You might accuse us of a lot of things but one of the things I don't think we're guilty of is learning from our past mistakes.
Never a truer word was said. That was in 1987. In 1990 the Prime Minister was still at it, but he knew that the way to do it, because Medicare was so popular, was to dismantle Medicare by stealth—and that is the agenda. The parliamentary secretary at the table tonight used to work for the—
—The member for McEwen.
—The member for McEwen, indeed. I am happy to acknowledge her as the member for McEwen. She was a staffer for the recently departed health minister.
—For a very short period of time.
—For a short period of time, she reminds me, and I am sure that she would not disown him! But the health minister at that time, I assert, did have some commitment to Medicare. I think the health minister, though a member of the coalition and a Liberal, did have some commitment to Medicare. If he had had no commitment to it, I think the Prime Minister's agenda of dismantling Medicare by stealth would have happened faster. I cannot pass a judgment in these early days on the new health minister, but I hope that she does stand up to the Prime Minister because he certainly will be continuing with zeal his ongoing effort to dismantle Medicare by stealth.
That is why we moved the second reading amendment, which notes that `the government's overall approach to Medicare has seen the regrettable position where general practitioner bulk-billing usage has declined to only 74 per cent'. That is the lowest level in a decade. Let us recall what the Prime Minister said in relation to bulk-billing:
I'll get rid of bulk billing completely for people other than pensioners.
That is what he said in 1987 when he was telling the truth to the Australian people and that adverse judgment was delivered, but he is still committed to getting rid of bulk-billing. As a result of that, we have this appalling situation where bulk-billing has fallen to 74½ per cent. 
The second reading amendment goes on to note that `the average extra cost to a patient for a non-bulk-billing GP visit is now $12'. This is making it harder for patients who go to doctors who do not bulk-bill, because the average payment is a very significant sum— again, part of the ongoing agenda to dismantle Medicare by stealth.
The second reading amendment also notes that `those who can afford private health insurance have been subject recently to substantial increases in premiums, on average $150 extra per year'. In the government's official projections before the last election, the projections for increases in the cost of private health insurance were much lower than what has actually happened—yet another example of the government saying one thing before the election and doing another thing after the election, saying and doing anything that it deems necessary to save its political bacon.
We then move on to the next part of the second reading amendment, which notes that `pensioners and concession cardholders and those families under financial pressures will suffer further as a result of the government's latest budget measures'—that is, those measures in respect of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We have just heard from the previous speaker a very Orwellian observation that, although the changes in the PBS are going to yield hundreds of millions of dollars, they are really not going to hurt anyone. If you listen to his speech, he says, `No-one's really affected; we're just going to collect hundreds of millions of dollars.' It would be lovely if you could collect hundreds of millions of dollars from the community without them being affected, but of course we know that they will be adversely affected.
We do not have to think back very far to remember the government's proud boast that health would be GST free. The argument at that time was whether there would or would not be a 10 per cent GST on health. The government said, `Of course we wouldn't do that; that would be a terrible thing to do.' That was before the election. After the election, changes to the PBS—if they pass the Senate—would increase pharmaceutical costs by up to 30 per cent: three times the 10 per cent GST. So the government had one position before the election and another position after the election. It is all right if you tell people before the election what you are going to do. But of course the government never told the Australian community that they were going to impose such large increases in the costs of pharmaceuticals for so many Australians. In fact, when the previous health minister was interviewed in the media before the election, he said that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was sustainable, that there would therefore not be any necessity for these dramatic changes, for these increases in cost to people who use pharmaceuticals. But of course once we get past the election the story changes: say one thing before the election and another thing after the election. Labor will use all our power in this place and, more importantly, in the Senate to do everything we can to protect Medicare, to protect universal health insurance, to ensure that the Prime Minister does not achieve his objective of dismantling Medicare by stealth, because that is what he wants to do. 
I was very encouraged that the Courier-Mail is onto the government. The heading of the Courier-Mail editorial on Saturday, 25 May is `States face attack on GST funds'. It points to the Intergenerational Report, which was used to justify these increases in the cost of pharmaceuticals. The article says, in part:
However, it is likely the forecasts will be used by the Federal Government to push the states to take up more of the anticipated burden of providing services for an increasingly ageing population.
That has always been on the cards. We indicated well before the last election, when the GST was coming in, that there would be a fundamental realignment of the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states, and so there was. The Commonwealth introduced the GST and, on the same day, they abolished all of the untied grants. You do not hear the present government talking about the fact that they abolished $17,000 million worth of untied grants to the states, but they did. Not only that; they are now attacking the tied grants to the states—again, something that we said would happen. The government put their hand on their heart and said, `No, that will not happen because we have signed an agreement with the states,' pretty much the same sort of agreement that the Treasurer signed with the then shadow Treasurer about fixing up the tax system by cracking down on tax avoidance. He said, `Yes, we'll do that,' and later laughed, virtually saying, `Why would you believe anything that I've put in writing?' Of course, the government did not do that; they reneged on those promises and they are reneging on the commitments that were made with the states to protect the specific purpose payments to the states, the tied grants to the states, just as we said they would.
At the last meeting with the premiers, there were a number of aspects in which the government had already reneged. I can confidently predict that it will do the same thing with health payments. The specific purpose payments for health to the states add up to $8,000 million. The government's agenda will be either to cut those in absolute terms or to allow them to erode with inflation over time. The Courier-Mail is right. We were right in the statements that we made in the parliament. In fact, in an article that I had published in Labor Essays I predicted that this would happen, that the specific purpose payments would be attacked by the Howard government after the election; it would allow them to erode over time and it would break its agreement with the states. That is precisely what is happening.
The total consequence of all this is that the Prime Minister is pressing ahead with his agenda to dismantle Medicare by stealth. It is a shameful agenda. He has never believed in Medicare, he has never believed in universal health insurance in this country; he has believed in people looking after themselves. Wealthy people will be able to, but if lower income people cannot look after themselves he believes that that is a bit of social Darwinism that they will have to come to terms with. I proudly stand here in the parliament tonight supporting wholeheartedly the second reading amendment to this legislation and condemning the Prime Minister for his ongoing efforts to dismantle Medicare by stealth. ",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY AND MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2002-05-28,"— The Taxation Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2002 amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 and the A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge Fringe Benefits) Act 1999 to increase the Medicare levy low income thresholds for individuals, married couples and sole parents in line with the movement of the consumer price index. The individual low income threshold for Medicare levy surcharge purposes is similarly increased. The effect of this measure is to ensure that people on low incomes are exempt from the Medicare levy and the surcharge. The bill also applies to increase the income threshold for pensioners below the age pension age. The effect is that where these pensioners do not have a tax liability they will not be liable for a Medicare levy.
This bill applies to the income year 2001-02 and later years of income. These are important measures that provide increases in the income threshold in line with the consumer price index for all those groups mentioned and for the dependent child student component of the family income threshold. It also allows a family income threshold to apply to a taxpayer where the taxpayer is entitled to a child-housekeeper rebate or a housekeeper rebate. These are people in the community who have very low incomes, and I support these government initiatives to alleviate financial burden in these cases.
This bill provides the opportunity to highlight some of the issues raised in the recent budget in relation to the growing cost of health care and the need to effectively target taxpayer funded benefits to those in the community who are most in need. It is easy for the opposition to take cheap shots over the improved targeting of assistance in the health area and for public critics to suggest that this is just about the government saving money, but we do need to be constantly reminded that the taxes that are administered by government are moneys contributed by the taxpayers and there is an obligation to ensure that benefits are effectively administered to ensure appropriate levels of support for those who do need it. This bill does target that particular group of people. 
The Treasurer made an important point in question time today about appropriate targeting in response to a question about changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in the 2002-03 budget. I think it is fair to say that rapid and dramatic improvement in the diagnosis and treatment of many illnesses places a greater obligation on government to ensure the sustainability of the medical system—the health system—and, in particular, to subsidise pharmaceuticals, for example. The Intergenerational Report released by the Treasurer in the 2002-03 budget gives the community a basis for discussion, an input into policies for the future of health care. This is an essential process if we are to ensure a sustainable economic climate within the context of meeting social policy obligations and the social expectations of the community. I think communities do expect governments to take a responsible position with their fiscal management while at the same time making provisions, such as those that have been made in this bill, to protect those who are on the lowest income and assist them to access health care.
The Treasurer made the point today and in the budget that, if we are to meet the increasing expectations of the provision of health services, then we have to take care to ensure sustainable programs for future generations. He foreshadowed that the pressure on health spending would come primarily from new technology. It already does: we have some very sophisticated diagnostic technology today involving nuclear medicine, and it is improving the outcomes in terms of better health care. But there is a cost. As I said, the Treasurer made the point that there are increasing expectations and foreshadowed that these cost pressures on health spending would come primarily from the new technology increasing the use of services and strong consumer demand and expectation, rather than the ageing of the population. 
The government has implemented sound economic management techniques to meet the considerable cost pressures in health that are placed on contemporary governments of all persuasions. It is a great disservice to the community when the opposition attempts to make capital out of the difficulties in continuing to provide quality health care to the public and being able to manage that within the context of a budget. It is a pity that these attempts do not always attract bipartisan support—I think that is a great disservice to the community. As the Treasurer highlighted on budget night, since 1991 the cost of the PBS has almost quadrupled from $1.2 billion to $4.2 billion, and this could be the most significant area of cost pressure on the health budget in the future. Over 40 years this could amount to a cost blow-out of $60 billion in today's dollars, and it would simply be irresponsible for government to ignore this pressure at the risk of jeopardising the listing of new medications coming onto the market and, of course, in terms of accountability to Australian taxpayers.
There is no doubt that medical science is rapidly producing improved medications for many illnesses and this is resulting in a better quality of life and greater longevity for many. The ability of the community to access these medications must be considered a priority. The measures taken in the budget are significant and need to be coupled with a concerted effort to reduce overprescribing and the stockpiling of medications in the bathroom medicine cabinets around the country. I am sure all of us have had clean-outs from time to time and certainly any pharmacist can attest to the fact that they get bucket loads of these medications in for appropriate destruction. Their disposing bins are full of outdated medication. These prescriptions have been subsidised by taxpayers.
Rather than money being wasted in medications that are never used where there is overprescribing or inappropriate prescribing of medications, that money would better go to targeted groups—such as we are targeting in this bill that we are debating tonight. In fact, I know that the government does have plans to look at the inappropriate prescribing of medications and other measures because we need to take those measures to help us reduce this waste, as I said, and better target that money to people who need it.
Again in the budget papers, the Treasurer highlighted the high cost of some commonly used medications, some of them priced from $230 per prescription to over $1,000 per prescription. This tends to put things into perspective because the taxpayers, via government, are subsidising the high cost of these medications. In fact, a treatment widely used by insulin dependent diabetics costs $229.13 per prescription. When you consider that diabetes is a growing health problem with over four per cent of the population now at risk of developing diabetes, that is going to be a huge cost in that one area alone. If undiagnosed and untreated, diabetes is a major cause of blindness in people under 60 years of age. It is the most common cause of non-traumatic amputation and it is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. And there is a high mortality rate associated with the disease of diabetes.
It is enormously important to recognise the many new treatments potentially available to improve the quality of life and longevity of people in the community and to ensure that nothing prevents the continuation of that process of listing new and improved medications. These are sensible measures and they do not mean that the price of all drugs will rise as result of copayment increases for families, as has been alleged by some members of the opposition. In fact, 45 per cent of items listed on the PBS are priced below the general copayment level of $22.40. The government anticipates that from 1 August those who fall into the non-concession category will not need to pay any more for many common and often used medications for asthma, high blood pressure, pain control, arthritis and many other common conditions that require medication.
Furthermore, copayments for concession cardholders, such as pensioners and seniors health cardholders, will still be covered by a safety net that allows those with the need for a large number of prescriptions to receive all medicines free once they have paid the small copayment for 52 prescriptions. Even then, the copayment will rise for that category by $1 to $4.60. When you start to look at that in relation to the cost of medication, it is a relatively small contribution. Non-concession cardholders who pay $847.90 in a year for their PBS medicines will be eligible for further PBS medicines at concession rates for the remainder of the year. 
To return to this bill, it is a very positive step in providing some relief to low income earners. As I said, there has to be this proper management of the whole health system if we are going to be able to properly target the resources towards people in the community who most need them. Part of the reason for this bill is the introduction of a Medicare levy surcharge of one per cent, which applies to taxable income where taxpayers do not have private patient hospital cover. A married person who would otherwise be liable for the surcharge is not required to pay the surcharge where the total of the person's taxable income and reportable fringe benefits do not exceed the individual low income threshold amount. There is no shading of the surcharge above the threshold amount, unlike the Medicare levy.
To summarise the main amendments in this bill, they include: the raising of the threshold amounts and the phase-in limits for individuals, married couples, sole parents and pensioners who are under age pension age; the raising of the threshold below which a family member is not required to pay the surcharge on taxable income; and the raising of the threshold below which a family member is not required to pay the surcharge and reportable fringe benefits. The amendments ensure that where a taxpayer is entitled to a child-housekeeper rebate the taxpayer is allowed a family income threshold, and that where a taxpayer is entitled to a housekeeper rebate the taxpayer is allowed a family income threshold.
The Intergenerational Report demonstrates strongly the Commonwealth's commitment to health care. I think it is interesting to note that the Commonwealth is responsible for almost half of the total health spending in this country. I listened with interest to the member for Rankin and his comments about the state governments. I think people should pause for a moment and consider the enormous contribution that is made by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth in that spending—which amounts, as I said, to almost half of the total spending on health care in this country—has a primary responsibility to fund the medical benefits scheme, Medicare and the PBS. The government also makes a major contribution to funding public hospitals, which are really the responsibility of the state government.
In my electorate there is a deep concern about the current state government in Western Australia looking at the running of state hospitals. I know what their agenda is. Lately, everywhere I go in the country, people express their concern to me, saying that the state government is looking at doing away with the volunteer country hospital boards. This work is done by people in the community for no remuneration and they know what the community needs; yet the Western Australian state government is in the process of unpicking this. We know what they will do. They will put in bureaucrats. They will have to have many more to cover the cost of the voluntary work done by the community. Then they will come back later and say, `This is too expensive; we can't afford to keep country hospitals, and we will start closing them.' So it is all very well for people to take a tilt at the Commonwealth, but the states have a lot to answer for in the way they have managed or, in some cases, mismanaged some aspects of health care.
The Commonwealth government not only helps to fund public hospital services provided by the state governments but also provides a 30 per cent rebate to subsidise the cost of private health insurance. When the Medicare system was brought in the architect said that, if people going into the private health scheme fell below a certain percentage, the whole scheme was in danger of collapsing. That is where we were when we came into office. We have managed to turn that around by providing a 30 per cent rebate and ensuring that more people are going back into private health insurance, where they can afford to do so, and taking the pressure off the public health system. The Commonwealth also spends money to provide support for medical research, public health programs, indigenous health programs and education programs. One of the ways that we are going to reduce some of the pressures on health in the future is to ensure that we have strong public health education programs, helping people to live healthier lives. We are seeing some of this in operation today, where people are far more conscious about their diets and about exercise. These are some of the measures that can often prevent the onset of serious diseases.  
The Intergenerational Report does make the point that Australians' life expectations are among the highest in the world. In relative terms, Australia's health outcomes are achieved at a moderate cost, with total health spending about 8.5 per cent of GDP, which is about average for the OECD countries. As I said before, factors such as the listing of new medications and the greater use of sophisticated diagnostic procedures will save lives, add to the quality of life through early diagnosis and improve treatment regimes, but it is, and will continue to be, with great cost pressures that have to be sensibly managed. A responsible government will take measures such as those in this bill to give appropriate support to people and families on low incomes and take sensible action to ensure a sustainable health program for all citizens both now and in the future. I would like to strongly add my support for the measures in this bill that go to help those families and individuals in the community who most need this kind of assistance.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY AND MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2002-05-28,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2002 amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 and the A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge-Fringe Benefits) Act 1999 to increase the Medicare levy low income thresholds for individuals, married couples, sole parents and pensioners below age pension age. It also increases the phase-in time as a result of the increased threshold amounts. There are two minor technical amendments that the government has put into this legislation. I support both of those amendments because, for once, this government is moving to assist Australians on low incomes. That is certainly something that we are not used to seeing in this House. It is something which is very different for this mean spirited government that usually targets rather than assists people on low incomes.
I also rise to strongly support the bulk-billing amendment. Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, you have been a visitor to the Central Coast, and you would be very aware of some of the facts I am about to present to you. General practitioners in the Shortland electorate have largely stopped bulk-billing. It has been said that there has been a decline to 70 per cent of GPs bulk-billing. The people in the Shortland electorate would be ecstatic if only 70 per cent of the doctors in the area bulk-billed. In 2000-01, a large number of doctors stopped bulk-billing. It started on 1 July when a few doctors ceased bulk-billing and on 1 September a large number of doctors decided that they would stop bulk-billing. They have ceased bulk-billing for not only families and working people but also pensioners—people who find it extremely difficult to pay for their medical care.
I first raised this issue in parliament in September 2000. On the Friday following that we had a public meeting in the electorate. Over 100 people turned up from one small area, because every doctor in that suburb stopped bulk-billing. It was an area of high unemployment and an area where there were a lot of elderly people living. The suburb was Swansea in Lake Macquarie. That was the start of a major campaign within the Lake Macquarie area to restore bulk-billing. Out of that meeting a group called SMARTS was formed. They campaigned vigorously for bulk-billing to be restored and for the government to act to encourage doctors to resume bulk-billing.
I think it would be appropriate if I shared with the House some of the concerns of the people of the electorate of Shortland—how they were upset and how they found it so difficult to cope with these changes. First of all, I will refer to a letter from one of the doctors to give you an idea of the sort of letter that was forwarded to the people of the Shortland electorate. I will say this surgery gave two months notice and said that they would stop bulk-billing and introduce a fee paying system from 1 September 2000. The letter went on to say that the cost of running the surgery was constantly increasing and that the margins they were receiving under Medicare had been reduced. That is an important fact to remember, and I will talk a little more about that further on. The letter went on to say that they found it very hard to do and they knew it would be unpopular but they felt that they must do it. 
It is very difficult for people that really have no choice about what doctor they go to to object to that. They are in a situation where either they go to that doctor or they find themselves queuing at the local hospital. I have a letter here from a lady who moved to the Toukley area and she wrote to me early last year. She said that she had searched around for a doctor but she was told that they were not taking any new patients. She finally found a doctor that agreed to see her. He would see new patients, but to see him she would have to pay $40 a visit. He had a sliding scale and he allowed some people to pay $30 but that was the minimum amount that he ever charged. This lady went on to say that she paid rent; she got some rent assistance but she did not know how she was going to cope because that $30 or $40 was a fair amount each week out of her pension. I am giving you a sample of the types of letters that I have received over this period of time.
I received another letter from a young woman who received youth allowance of $150 a fortnight. Out of that she gave her mother $100. She wrote that she had rung at least seven medical centres and doctors surgeries to make an appointment for herself to get a prescription for the contraceptive pill. Of all places she rang, not one of them was bulk-billing any more. She went on to say that without the contraceptive pill she would have a greater risk of becoming pregnant and she would also have some medical problems. She was bringing it to my attention because she just did not know what she was going to do. She could not afford to see a doctor because doctors did not bulk-bill. There are a number of issues raised in that letter that will affect the health and wellbeing of that young woman.
Another doctor wrote to me recently. I had written to this particular doctor because one of the practice's long-standing patients had come to see me and was most concerned because they were told that they needed to go on a six-monthly basis—and they had a yearly visit for a check-up—otherwise they would be treated as a new patient. The only patients that were being bulk-billed were long-standing patients. The doctor wrote to me saying:
Please be advised, first of all, that we are a business and in financial trouble regarding bulk-billing. We did not take it lightly to stop bulk-billing but you, being a politician, should know how the medical profession is in trouble. We introduced to all patients that are not regular that we no longer can afford to bulk-bill them and as of 1 May this year the practice will stop bulk-billing. 
Once again, there is another doctor's surgery having problems and no longer able to bulk-bill.
This is just a little bit of a different slant. This is from a Mr Smith who lives in Belmont. He had recently attended the accident and emergency centre in the local hospital. Unfortunately, he had to wait for a considerable time before he could get in to see the doctor. Whilst he was there he was talking to other people and these people were saying that they were there because they could not afford to go to see their doctor because their doctor was no longer bulk-billing. When people have to wait in excess of 2½ hours, as this gentleman did, it is no wonder that there are some problems. I spoke to another person who waited for five hours at the local hospital and the situation was very similar. He also spoke to people in the waiting room and was advised that they were going to the local hospital because they could not afford to visit the local doctor, who no longer bulk-billed. 
I have raised this issue a number of times with the government. I have made representations on behalf of these constituents and other constituents. But my words and my letters have fallen on deaf ears. I have raised it a number of times in this parliament and it really concerns me that the government has no commitment to Medicare, that it has no commitment to bulk-billing. I have submitted a petition to this parliament with nearly 10,000 signatures on it. 
Recently I attended a meeting on the Central Coast, as I mentioned when the member for Greenway was in the chair. That meeting was a public forum of people from the electorates of Shortland and Dobell. The issue that was raised time and time again was the fact that GPs were not bulk-billing in that area and that there was a shortage of GPs on the Central Coast and that the average time a person had to wait to see a doctor was between seven and 14 days. On the same day as that meeting I met with Mr King, who is a pharmacist in the area. He has been campaigning for some time to have the Central Coast recognised as an area of need. I notice that in the budget paper there is talk of outer metropolitan areas being recognised in that way, but I am very worried that yet again the Central Coast will be ignored. 
The average number of GPs is one per 1,000 head of population; that is the benchmark. In the northern part of the Central Coast there is one per 2,500 head of population. You can see the crisis that exists there. It was pointed out that bulk-billing is virtually non-existent. There is no Medicare office in Toukley and no Easyclaim facilities. That creates difficulties because that area has an elderly population and a very poor transport system; it is a private transport system and people have to wait a long time for buses and it takes quite a considerable amount of time to get to the nearest Medicare office. People also have to wait up to seven hours for treatment at the local hospital because they are being forced to, once again, use that hospital for day-to-day medical treatment. It really is an exercise in cost shifting by this government, shifting the cost of providing day-to-day medical care from the Commonwealth to the state. The government should stand condemned for that.
GPs on the Central Coast are busier than in most areas because there is a shortage and also because of the chronic nature of the health problems experienced by the population: there are very old and very young patients and their health needs are much greater than those of people in other areas. When I saw those figures on bulk-billing that were released, I thought I would check on how they compared with the figures for the Shortland electorate. I discovered that on the Central Coast, which is in the Shortland electorate, the total number of GPs was 35. Of those 35, 63 per cent do not bulk-bill; 28 per cent partially bulk-bill; and only nine per cent, or three of those 35, fully bulk-bill. Those figures come from the Central Coast Division of General Practice and I can assure the House that they are correct. 
I also decided to have a look at how the Lake Macquarie area of the electorate lined up with those figures. My office rang 22 GP practices. Of those 22, 16 GPs do not bulk-bill at all, five partially bulk-bill, and one fully bulk-bills. I think that equates to something like 72 per cent that do not, 4.5 per cent that do and something like 22 per cent that partially bulk-bill. 
The other important point to note is that a number of doctors' practices on the Central Coast and at Lake Macquarie have closed their books. So what are the people in those areas to do? They do not have much choice, do they? If they can afford it, they will go to the doctor and pay the higher costs, then go to the Medicare office and collect their refund. But unfortunately the location of the Medicare offices themselves is a problem. I have already mentioned the situation in Toukley. At Lake Macquarie, one of the first actions of this government was to close the Belmont Medicare office. That closure seriously inconvenienced those elderly people of Swansea I spoke about earlier in my speech—people who in many instances no longer have a licence, who are unable to travel the 10 or 15 kilometres that they need to to collect their Medicare rebate and who quite often need that Medicare rebate to purchase their medicines.
The government's response has been very poor. As I said, I have raised this issue a number of times. I must refer to a letter I received very recently from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, Trish Worth. In it she mentions that 2000-01 Medicare billing statistics indicate that the level of bulk-billing by general practitioners in the Wyong area was significantly above the national average. I thought the national average for bulk-billing was 70 per cent, as opposed to the situation on the Central Coast where 63 per cent of doctors do not bulk-bill and nine per cent fully bulk-bill.  
I find this a matter of great concern. The fact that doctors are not bulk-billing is creating real problems for families. I strongly support the opposition's amendment. If the government's proposed changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme were to be successful, health care would be outside the affordability of families and those people who are more disadvantaged in our community— the pensioners, the elderly and the unemployed.
Last week I spoke to a family in a shopping centre. The mother and two of her children had been sick so they went to the doctor. After seeing the doctor, they had to buy prescriptions at a cost of $98. You visit a doctor that does not bulk-bill and then you have to buy prescriptions that cost $98. When my family was young, I could not have afforded it. Health care would have been outside my budget. I think it is a very sad situation when, in a country like Australia, people have to make a decision about whether or not they can afford to go to the doctor. 
We have in Australia an uncaring government that has no commitment to Medicare. It is creating a two-tiered health system and starving the public sector of resources. It has no commitment to Medicare. In this system if you are wealthy you can afford good quality health care, the best health care; if you are poor you must make decisions, decisions that compromise your health. Bulk-billing ensures that all Australians can access a doctor when they need one. This government needs to make a commitment to bulk-billing and take the actions that are necessary to restore it to its previous level. This government stands condemned for its inaction and for its failure to ensure that all Australians can access quality health care. ",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY AND MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2002-05-28,"—I support the government's Taxation Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2002. This legislation increases the Medicare levy low income thresholds for individuals, married couples and sole parents in line with movements in the CPI. Whilst this measure may protect low income earners from paying a Medicare levy it is very sad that, as far as health care is concerned, this bill represents the maximum commitment low and middle income Australians can expect from the Howard government. We hear every day in this House that the health policies of the Howard government are hurting Australian families and older Australians who rely on and deserve a decent public health system.
The government's mismanagement has led to decreasing rates of bulk-billing by Medicare doctors, increasing premiums and excess costs for private health insurance and increasing copayments for medicines. It is for that reason that, whilst supporting the bill here this evening, I strongly support the amendment moved by the member for Perth, who made a very erudite contribution to the debate prior to the dinner adjournment. The amendment reads:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“the House, recognising that the provisions of this equitable measure will appropriately exempt some individuals, couples and sole parents from the levy and surcharge in line with movements in the consumer price index, supports the bill but:
(1)	notes that the Government's overall approach to Medicare has seen the regrettable position where General Practitioner bulk billing usage has declined to only 74%;
(2)	notes that the average extra cost to a patient for a non bulk billing GP visit is now $12;
(3)	notes that those who can afford private health insurance have been subject recently to substantial increases in premiums, on average $150 extra per year;
(4)	notes that pensioners and concession card holders and those families under financial pressures will suffer further as a result of the Government's latest budget measures, in particular the proposed 30% increase in payments for essential medicines; and
(5)	calls on the Government to recognise the Australian community's belief in and support of bulk billing and Medicare and to accept that the Government must match that community commitment in its health policies”. 
The government's failure to respond to the deteriorating crisis over medical indemnity insurance—the subject of today's, unfortunately aborted, matter of public importance debate—is only one-half of the health emergency facing Australia. The other half, as you know, is the alarming decline in bulk-billing by both general practitioners and specialists. Since the election of the Howard government, the number of GP services bulk-billed has declined by five million a year. When you consider that the average cost of a visit to a GP who does not bulk-bill is $12, it means that Australians are paying $60 million more each year for doctor visits. This is on top of the $500 million extra that Australians are paying for increases in health insurance premiums and in addition to the $300 million that Australians will pay if the Treasurer's proposal for increased PBS copayments goes through the Senate. Who will pay for all this? We know that it will be those who can least afford it—the most vulnerable members of our community: the frail, the aged, the sick and the elderly. 
Bulk-billing is fundamental to our Medicare system. As more and more doctors stop bulk-billing, health care becomes expensive and out of reach for low and middle income families. This moves Australia closer to a USA-style health system where your credit card will replace your Medicare card when you need treatment, and health care will become the reserve of the wealthy and the privileged. There is little doubt that the government's ideological opposition to Medicare—well hidden when they came to office in 1996—is now obvious as Medicare is left to deteriorate. The President of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Kerryn Phelps, was correct in her rebuke of the government when she said:
Medicare is coming apart at the seams and the government is doing nothing about it. 
The decline in bulk-billing is a result of a lack of commitment to public health in Australia. When the Howard government came to office in 1996 the rate of GP bulk-billing was over 80 per cent. Bulk-billing rates are now the lowest in a decade and the health minister's response is, in effect, to say, `So what?' If that is her attitude, the minister needs to explain just how long the government is willing to allow the system to decline before paying appropriate attention to it. The victims of the government's arrogance are the dedicated medical professionals—who will be left with the impossible choice of undercharging for their services in an environment of skyrocketing medical indemnity insurance fees—and their patients, who will be forced to continually pay more or, as it is increasingly the case, will be put in the terrible situation of not being able to find the specialist they need at a price they can afford.
Doctors who subsidise Medicare by continuing to bulk-bill receive their Medicare Benefits Schedule—MBS—rate of $24.45, when the AMA recommendation is that they charge between $48 and $50 for a standard consultation. In not recognising the inadequacy of the Medicare Benefits Schedule, the government is forcing doctors to stop bulk-billing. The problem for doctors and all Australians can only get worse when you consider the additional crisis in medical indemnity insurance caused by the collapse of United Medical Protection. This is summarised in a report in today's Australian newspaper by specialist medical practitioner, Michael Gliksman, who writes:
Just work out how many deliveries an obstetrician must carry out to cover the monthly indemnity insurance fee of $10,000 for 2002...
...			...			...
Is it any wonder almost no specialist and an ever-dwindling number of GPs charge the Medicare rebate? The viability of Medicare is being destroyed by a thousand cuts. And John Howard assures us he doesn't know how the crisis in medical practice came about.
...			...			...
When medical treatment has never been safer, practice costs have never been higher. Medicare benefits in real terms have never been lower.
Last week, an endocrine specialist, who lives in my electorate, spoke to me about the difficulty he is having during the current crisis. He has written me a letter today, fortuitously; I received it only this evening. In part, it states:
Thank you for spending the time to look over some of my concerns, brought into focus with the failure of United Medical Protection. I hope I don't leave you with the impression that I am a whinger. For most of my working life I have just got on with my job, which I love. I am doing the work that I always wanted to do and go home every day knowing that I have made a difference in many people's lives and done an honest day's labour. It's just the non-clinical matters that impinge on my work that are becoming so intrusive into what is the best job in the world. I'm sorry that what follows does not read like a few simple sound bites, but that is more because of the complexity of the problem. That is something that I think you need to understand, but not allocate to the too hard basket. I would be very disappointed if the current opportunity for radical reform in the area of medical indemnity is wasted on petty partisan ambitions and I know it will only be fixed with a bipartisan combined state and federal approach. 
I emphasise that this specialist made it quite clear to me that there has to be a bipartisan approach to this. He works extremely hard in his practice, and the overheads—with the long hours that he works as an endocrine surgeon—are such that his taxable income is $120,000. For someone in such a specialised area, that is not a lot of money for the overheads that he has to bear. He is quite concerned because, at the moment, he is being sued and it looks like he might have to bear costs in the order of $60,000, $80,000 or possibly even $100,000. Like most of us, he has a mortgage, a wife and children to support. It is a very serious issue. He is just one of the innocent victims of the government's failure to keep watch on the insurance industry.
In relation to insurance in this country, I accept that it will require a bipartisan approach if we are to resolve the problems. There are a lot of very nervous people out there at the moment, particularly specialists like the endocrine surgeon that I am talking about tonight, because they are not sure that they can actually stay in practice. I had a call from another doctor who, fortuitously for him, is turning 65 years of age in the near future. He has indicated to me that he will turn it up because he cannot afford to pay the $35,000 premium, with the concomitant risks, because he does not know what will happen after 1 July. That is pretty disturbing. For all of us here, the two things that concern people, when you talk to them before you get elected to the House of Representatives, is that they want a good health system and a good education system; they certainly do not want to feel that they will not be covered. In the case of doctors, they are being crippled by this uncertainty over the collapse of UMP.
One of the many constructive suggestions my constituent makes is that indemnity costs should be shared across medical professionals. He says:
I feel that the cost of indemnity should be contained, whilst maintaining provision for the needs of injured patients. Such compensation must be centrally scrutinised. The funds must be raised across the broadest cross-section of the whole community, which benefits from the provision of medical services. Whilst not popular with GPs, I feel that the insurance rates should be equal across all medical practitioners if that is the way governments elect to raise this money. High risk specialities should not be subject to distortions of the practice economics simply because by referral to a GP has passed the risk on, and similarly the passing of risk (by referral) from a non-proceduralist to a proceduralist should not distort the economics. In any case the risk should be borne across the widest number of patients (who ultimately pay) rather than concentrate the cost borne by those who are most ill.
I don't believe cosmetic surgery should be covered in general medical indemnity and that area should carry its own insurance relevant to that practice and allow appropriate fees to cover that risk. This could be achieved by limiting normal indemnity only to those procedures and consultations covered by the Medical Benefits Schedule.
Indemnity could alternatively be covered by a portion of the Medicare levy, and require that all indemnity cases be centrally registered so that some clearer data is available for study.
That is just part of the letter that that specialist has written to me this evening.
In the case of my constituent, the government needs to provide a written assurance of indemnity for his previously indemnified case, including continuity with the current subcontracted solicitor. He needs United Medical Protection or other substantial organisations to continue seamless cover in New South Wales. Finally, he needs certainty and quality of support with a Treasury managed fund, not just lip-service to risk management programs. That is just one example.  
While the Howard government seems intent on undermining the fundamental and equitable nature of Medicare and while it continues to have no constructive response to the medical indemnity crisis, many more doctors and patients will suffer the consequences. That is why I come back to the very erudite contribution that the shadow minister for health made when he moved his amendment prior to the suspension of the sitting. As the member for Perth mentioned, the legislation ensures that the threshold levels at which people are required to pay the Medicare levy and the Medicare levy surcharge are increased in line with the CPI but elsewhere the health policies of the government are slugging Australian families. He talked about decreasing rates of bulk-billing by Medicare doctors when the government has been responsible for increasing premiums and excess costs for private health insurance and increasing copayments and safety nets for medicines.
In short, as the member for Perth, Mr Stephen Smith, pointed out in relation to his amendment on bulk-billing, bulk-billing rates are now the lowest in a decade. When the government came to office, the rate of bulk-billing was over 80 per cent; it has now fallen to 75 per cent. There are over 100 million GP services a year. That means that on the Prime Minister's watch the number of GP services bulk-billed has declined by five million per year, and the average cost of a visit to a GP who does not bulk-bill is a scandalous $12. That means that Australian families are paying $60 million more each year for doctor visits. That is on top of the half a billion dollars extra that Australians are paying for increases in private health insurance premiums and it is additional to the $300 million that Australian families will pay if the Howard government's proposals for increased PBS copayments go through the Senate, as I mentioned earlier. Moreover, the heaviest hits are taken by those who can least afford them—the most vulnerable members of the community. 
During the election campaign the Prime Minister promised that his government policies would `lead to reduced premiums for health insurance'. Ha-ha! He also claimed that the coalition would make private health insurance more affordable and attractive to consumers. We know that that has fallen down like a pack of cards. As the member for Perth said, given the outcomes of those promises in an area this government supports, we can only wonder where we are headed with its paltry support for the Medicare program.
For us on this side of the House, bulk-billing is an essential part of Medicare and we will be the last people standing—I will be standing right behind the shadow minister for health, the member for Perth, Stephen Smith—if the government attempts to crucify or remove bulk-billing. We introduced the relative values study to help resolve doctors' grievances about Medicare rebates, and the government has chosen not to go down that route. It seems intent on undermining the fundamental and equitable nature of Medicare. We will fight this to the last gasp. Medicare is here to stay. Labor were responsible for introducing it and the government seems to be doing what the Prime Minister indicated in 1987 he would do— that is, tear it apart. As I recall the member for Perth saying before the suspension of the sitting, we will defend Medicare and we will preserve bulk-billing. I commend to the House the amendment moved by the member for Perth and I hope that the government accepts it.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY AND MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2002-05-28,"—in reply—I would like to express my gratitude to honourable members who have contributed to the debate on this very important topic, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2002. The member for Lowe said that the Australian Labor Party supported Medicare and bulk-billing. The facts are on the record: the Howard government have supported Medicare, and we as a coalition are committed to a viable and universal publicly funded health system, which we all know as Medicare. 
The coalition believe that all Australians should have access to a high-quality health care system. If one had listened to the speeches by honourable members opposite, one would have thought that the government are not so committed. The government have delivered a balanced health system, and we will continue to improve Australia's health system by reforming Commonwealth-state relations and by emphasising quality care and preventive treatment. The coalition will continue to provide Australians with a choice of private care combined with a quality public hospital system. That means that Australia will have an affordable high-quality and world-class health system for the 21st century. I suspect that anybody who stops for a moment and contemplates the quality of health care provided in Australia will have to admit that this country is particularly fortunate to have the world-class system to which many other countries can only aspire. 
This bill reflects in a small way the government's commitment to keeping health care affordable. As honourable members who have been here for a while will understand, every year the threshold over which taxpayers are required to pay the Medicare levy is raised in line with the annual increase in the consumer price index. The phasing-in threshold is also raised for people who pay a partial levy, and there is an increase in the per child component of the low income threshold. The measure applies for the 2001-02 and later financial years.
With the increases, low-income taxpayers can receive more income and still be exempt from the Medicare levy or pay a reduced amount of levy. Honourable members will be pleased to understand that these measures are entirely beneficial. This bill ensures that where pensioners below age pension age do not have an income tax liability they will not have a Medicare levy liability. The increase in thresholds also affects liability for the Medicare levy surcharge. The increase in the low-income threshold also flows through to the individual low-income members of a couple.
People listening to this parliamentary broadcast will no doubt have shared the offence I experienced when I heard Labor members suggesting that this government does not support Medicare. I reiterate that this government is indeed committed to a viable and universal publicly funded health care system—Medicare—and the fact that we have given some incentives for private health insurance does not mean that the government does not support Medicare. As a government, we have no intention of allowing Australians to opt out of Medicare. Medicare will remain a universal system available to all Australians. All that is happening is that the government is restoring the balance between the public and private systems to what it was when Medicare was introduced. 
The government rejects the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Perth. It is full of Labor propaganda and anyone reading it would understand that the Labor Party is clearly some distance from understanding the facts in relation to our health care system. One only has to draw the attention of the House to paragraph (3) of the second reading amendment where the Labor Party asks the House to note:
... that those who can afford private health insurance have been subject recently to substantial increases in premiums, on average $150 extra per year;
It is true that premiums have gone up but, if it had not been for the government's 30 per cent rebate, private health insurance would have continued to collapse, it would have been unsustainable and the public health system would not have been able to cope with the additional numbers of people who would have been forced to use it. The Labor Party ought to recognise this and give credit where it is due, and the government is of course particularly proud of the fact that we have brought in this rebate. It has made and kept private health insurance viable, and it gives people very real choice. 
We will all recall that the Hon. Graham Richardson was Minister for Health in a former Labor government. He said:
Medicare was always intended to coexist with the private health system, not replace it.
However, if one ponders the utterances of Labor members, one would think that private health insurance is evil, that somehow it is inappropriate and that we ought not have it. Graham Richardson was a much more realistic representative of the Labor Party when he was the health minister and he pointed out that Medicare was always intended to coexist with private health insurance and not replace it. 
The very fact that we are debating this bill tonight is evidence of the government's ongoing support for the Medicare system. The bill has the effect of exempting more people from the Medicare levy without in any way limiting the access of those people to health services. Under the coalition, Medicare has received its highest level of funding ever.
There has been some discussion in this debate about securing the future of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. There has been criticism of the very necessary measures included in the budget which were required to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The Intergenerational Report, included as part of the budget for the first time, looked at where Australia would be in 40 years time. We recognise in the budget the need to maintain the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and our actions in the budget ought not be looked upon—as the Labor Party would have people accept—as an attack on the PBS, rather they are underpinning the long-term sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The measures were quite moderate and it was necessary to take steps now to make sure that, as we go on with a declining birthrate and an ageing population, Australia as a nation is able to continue to afford this very important underpinning of the health needs of Australians.
The copayment for prescriptions was increased, restoring the balance between what the government pays and the contribution patients make to the cost of their medicines. From 1 August 2002, concessional cardholders will pay an additional $1 per script, up from $3.60 to $4.60. General patients will pay up to an additional $6.20 per script, an increase from $22.40 to $28.60. People have suggested that this means that the minimum cost for scripts will be $28.60 for general patients and $4.60 for concessional cardholders. The fact is that if the cost of a script is less than the $28.60 or, for that matter, the $4.60, only the lower price will be paid. It is quite misleading to suggest that the cost of all scripts is going up to $28.60. Many cost less than that and those that do will remain costing less. 
Concession cardholders will pay a maximum extra of $52 per year, which is $1 per script and, in effect, over a whole year would be no more than $1 per week. So I have to say that I very much regret the scare campaign which members of the Australian Labor Party are maintaining in the Australian community. They are trying to turn the Australian community against the very forward thinking and necessary measures contained in the budget, which is being debated in the chamber over the coming weeks. There were very many other benefits in the 2002 health budget—in relation to cancer treatment; arthritis; Visudyne therapy; palliative care; and $11.4 million towards the acquiring and stockpiling of a range of medicines, antidotes and vaccines to ensure a rapid and effective response to any acts of bioterrorism.
Something near and dear to my heart is the delivery of services to Australians in rural, regional and outer metropolitan Australia. The government is committed to creating a more equitable distribution of medical services across Australia. Programs from the 2000-01 budget's $562 million regional health strategy are currently ongoing. In addition, the 2002 budget provides a further $80 million to increase the number of doctors working in designated outer metropolitan areas by 150 and provides $9 million to continue access to Medicare claiming facilities through local pharmacies. Honourable members would also have been pleased to see the increase in funding to fight the scourge of drug abuse.
As I have said, Labor Party members have come in here and have endeavoured to mount a scare campaign against this government's commitment to make health care affordable for all Australians, to give all Australians access to health care services with priority according to clinical need and to provide a high quality of care. The government also emphasise the importance of Medicare and our very strong support for it, and we reject any suggestion by those opposite that we are in any way lacking in commitment to this important underpinning of our health care system. A policy of the government is to ensure that Medicare provides a universal and equitable health insurance system for all Australians regardless of age, income or disability. Those listening would be interested to know that the government is committed to maintaining Medicare in its entirety, including these principles of universality and equity. 
There has also been a steady growth in expenditure on medical services and benefits, including rebates for general practitioner and specialist attendance. It ought to be noted that in the year 2002-03 these rebates are expected to be $8.3 billion, and this is in addition to the $7.1 billion to the states and territories under the Australian health care agreements. The current agreements focus on increasing public patient access and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery.
The member for Shortland in her speech referred to public hospital waiting lists. The states run these hospitals and, with the states receiving the benefit of the GST, it is about time the states appreciated that they do have an obligation to fund health. The Commonwealth is happy to continue to make its contribution, but it certainly is a disgusting cop-out to hear the state Labor governments simply allowing these long waiting lists for treatment to continue when, at the end of the day, the states do have an obligation to deliver health care in addition to the commitment which we as a government continue to give.
So the coalition will continue to improve Australia's health system by reforming Commonwealth-state relations and emphasising quality care and preventative treatment. We are not going to apologise for continuing to provide Australians with the choice of private health care combined with a quality public hospital system, and this means that we will continue as a nation to have an affordable, high-quality and world-class health system as we proceed through the 21st century. The government does thank honourable members for their support of the bill. We do reject the second reading amendment moved by the member for Perth.

"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,2002-05-28,"—I am very proud to rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03 and the seventh Howard government budget brought down by Treasurer, Peter Costello. Treasurer Costello has surely proven that his fiscal management credentials are second to none. Australia's economy is the strongest in the world, and this did not come about by accident. When the Howard government were elected in a landslide in 1996, I remember the first party meeting in the parliament. The Prime Minister put it to all coalition members that as a new government we had a choice. One option was to do what was popular: spend money that we did not have—as the Labor Party had done between 1990 and 1995—and try to buy ourselves back into government in three years time. The other option we faced was to be a responsible government: to do what we in our heart of hearts knew was the right thing to do. Real leaders do not talk about the need to take tough or hard decisions; real leaders talk about taking the right decisions. The reaction of all the coalition members and senators in the room that day was unanimous: everybody elected that the government should do what they believed to be the right thing to do for the nation. Many unpopular things had to be done. There were members present who were sitting on majorities of a few hundred votes who knew that, if they did the right thing, in all probability they would not be re-elected.
In 1996 the then current budget was in deficit to the tune of about $11 billion. Mr Keating and Mr Beazley had told the people that the budget was in surplus. A succession of Labor deficits had amassed a cumulative debt of $80 billion. When governments have to borrow—like Labor governments always do—they become major players in the money market. Interest is the price of money. When governments are big borrowers, money becomes scarce and its price goes up. That is why big-borrowing Labor governments always end up with high interest rates.
The Treasurer is fully aware of the correlation between government borrowings and high interest rates. It also follows that, when a government pays off debt, the pressure on interest rates is downward pressure and interest rates fall. To pay off government debt, the government needs to produce surplus budgets and use the surplus to redeem debt. That also reduces interest payments by government, allowing that money to be used for other things such as health, defence and security or further debt reduction.
The other big item in debt reduction is asset sales. You can ask why anybody would sell an income producing asset, which is really what a government business enterprise is. Whether a business or a government, an income producing asset could be sold for a number of reasons. It could be sold to retire debt. It could be sold to release capital needed to buy another income producing asset. We did both: we paid off debt and invested in infrastructure. No-one in their right mind could sell an income producing asset and blow that money, but you know who did that: the Labor Party in government. They sold the Commonwealth Bank. They sold Qantas. They sold CSL. They sold other GBEs. Did they retire debt? No, they did not. They sold assets and at the same time racked up further debt. Labor blew the money that was the result of asset sales. Labor sold these great icons and blew the money. They have no gain to show for that pain. The series of Treasurer Costello's budgets are in stark contrast to those of Labor treasurers such as Keating, Dawkins, Kerin and Willis.
All budgets consist of revenue and expenditure measures. To go from a position of massive deficit to a position of surplus, the Treasurer has no option but to cut government expenditure or to raise government taxes. The government commissioned, as one of its first acts in 1996, the Commission of Audit to examine every portfolio to identify potential savings. The process was painful. Only Defence was quarantined from expenditure cuts. Each of the Costello budgets produced a surplus. The surpluses were used to pay off Labor's debt. Every program in every department except that of Defence was given the strongest scrutiny to identify cuts in expenditure. Treasurer Costello used cuts in government expenditure and asset sales— and here I refer mainly to the partial privatisation of Telstra—to produce surpluses and debt reduction. In seven budgets the government has reduced Labor's $80 billion debt by a total of $61 billion.
This fiscal discipline over seven budgets has allowed the government not only to pay off debt but to introduce far-reaching major reforms in the fields of taxation, industrial relations, telecommunications, environment—through the Natural Heritage Trust— and services to rural and regional electorates, such as my electorate of Fairfax. Selling an asset to buy another asset is what the government did. The Coastcare, Rivercare and salinity programs would never have been able to be carried out without the sale of Telstra. Again, the contrast with Labor is stark. You can see where every cent of the accumulated surpluses has gone under Peter Costello. You can see where the proceeds of privatisation have gone.
It is time for the Labor Party to wake up and realise who won the election and the one before that and the one before that. It is time for Labor to realise that they lost these elections, and it is time they allowed us the capacity to govern. The Labor Party have opposed our fiscal measures at every turn. They say we should have surpluses and at the same time use their numbers in the Senate to vote against measures—on both the revenue side and the expenditure side—that the government needs to implement to produce those surpluses. In 1996 we survived a massive Labor budget blow-out. In 1997 and 1998 we survived the Asian economic crisis. We were even able to help our neighbouring countries, Indonesia and Thailand. In 1998 we won an election based on the introduction of a GST. Every major reform of the Howard government has been opposed by Labor. Labor voted against tax reform, the IR reforms and budget expenditure measures. Labor have to wake up, as I said, to the fact that they lost the election.
The government survived the economic impact of East Timor and economic downturns in Europe, the USA, Japan, Singapore and our other trading partners. We have the highest GDP growth rates in the OECD. While the economies of Japan, the USA and Europe have contracted, Australia's GDP has continued to grow. Interest rates are low as a consequence of tight fiscal policy and continuing low inflation. This budget estimates that growth will remain strong at 3¾ per cent for 2002-03. This is higher than the forecast growth for any of the major developed G7 economies of the world and reflects Australia's sound economic management under Treasurer Costello and the Howard government. To quote the Treasurer: 
Business investment is expected to grow very strongly—
in 2002-03—
to be a key driver of overall economic growth. Household consumption is also expected to remain strong.
In line with the outlook for robust economic growth, the unemployment rate is forecast to decline gradually to six per cent in the June quarter of 2003. An unemployment rate of below six per cent would be achievable over the next couple of years provided that economic growth remains strong and progress is maintained on labour market and welfare reforms. There is no reason to think that economic growth will not remain strong. Since the government came into office, over 900,000 jobs have been created in the Australian economy. We expect over one million jobs to have been created by this Christmas. With only moderate increases in wage costs and continued strong productivity growth, inflation is expected to be around 2¾ per cent in 2002-03 and 2½ per cent by the June quarter of 2003, within the medium-term inflation band. Largely reflecting the strength of the domestic economy, the current account deficit is expected to increase slightly to around four per cent of GDP, which is also below the average of the 1990s.
The Leader of the Opposition delivered his reply to the budget at 7.30 p.m. on Thursday, two days after the Treasurer delivered the budget. He started with the words, `Tonight I want to do something different.' I got very excited when I heard the Leader the Opposition say that he wanted to do something different. I thought that he might for once support the government on its budget measures. The Leader of the Opposition talked about modern Labor and the need to produce a strong economy. Haven't we got a strong economy? I have already quoted from the Treasurer's budget speech, which forecasts GDP growth of 3¾ per cent, the lowest interest rates in 30 years, jobs growth, unemployment falling to below six per cent, continuing low inflation and hyperactivity.
I have pointed out that Labor has in the past six coalition budgets opposed every fiscal measure designed to give us that business confidence and that strong economy. I thought Simon Crean was going to announce that Labor would support those reforms in the budget which are there to ensure the responsible fiscal position and achieve a continued strong economy. As the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply wore on, it was obvious that nothing had changed. Modern Labor is still Labor. Here we go again: the Labor Party still has not realised, as I said before, that it lost the election—the third one in a row.
Labor intends to vote against three key budget measures: the pharmaceutical benefits reforms, the disability support pension reforms and measures to give effect to our election platform on the superannuation surcharge. Labor has been peddling several untruths in the week and a half since the budget. Scaring old people and pensioners is an old Labor Party sport.
The Treasurer pointed out in his budget speech that the events of September 11 shocked the world and showed that terrorism can strike the most powerful nations. We cannot take our security for granted. The Treasurer announced many new measures to protect and secure our borders. The Treasurer said:
The hard work of the last six years helped to shield our country and keep people in work. It gave us the capacity to respond swiftly with measures to stimulate the economy like the additional First Home Owners Grant. It allowed us to respond swiftly with a major contribution to the War Against Terrorism.
The Treasurer went on to detail additional expenditure under the heading of `Strong Defence':
·	an Australian special forces task force group—
and other personnel—
participating in operations in Afghanistan against the Taliban and Al Qaida networks;
·	a naval task group of an amphibious landing ship (until mid 2002) and a frigate, and the continued presence of a guided missile frigate in the Persian Gulf to support the Multinational Maritime Interception Force; and 
·	Air Force B707 tanker aircraft to support air-to-air refuelling operations and F/A-18 aircraft deployed to Diego Garcia—
until mid-2002—
to support air defence of coalition forces.
The composition of the deployment is subject to strategic requirements and is continuously under review.
The additional funding over the base funding and over the White Paper for this deployment in 2001-02 and 2002-03 is around $524 million.
Domestic security is vital in the fight against terrorism and securing Australia's borders.
The other contentious issue in the budget referred to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is blowing out and we heard the parliamentary secretary a few minutes ago in the House outlining the drastic measures that would have to be taken to save the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme if we do not bite the bullet now. I said a while ago that it is Labor Party sport to scare people. It has been said over the last week and a half that every prescription would rise by $6.40, and that is just not right. Again, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration pointed out to the House that the cost of prescriptions below that figure will not rise at all. If they were below the $28.60 before 1 August, they will be below that amount after 1 August.
From 1 August the copayments for concession cardholders such as pensioners and senior health cardholders will rise by $1 to $4.60 and copayments for others will rise by $6.20 to $28.60 per prescription. While concession cardholders will only pay $4.60 for a prescription, this is only a small cost of many of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme medicines. The Treasurer goes on to quote three examples:
·	Humulin NPH, widely used in the treatment of insulin dependent diabetes costs $229.13 per prescription.
·	Avonex, a drug used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis costs $1,090.81 per prescription.
A patient on this drug would normally take 13 prescriptions per year. The Treasurer goes on:
·	Zyban, used for the treatment of nicotine addiction, costs $238.85 per prescription.
New drugs with high costs are coming on to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme all the time.
Notwithstanding the cost the copayment will only be $4.60 for concession cardholders.
Safety net arrangements will continue to protect people who need a large number of medicines. Consistent with the current arrangements, once concession cardholders have paid for 52 Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme prescriptions in the year, they will receive further medicines free for the rest of the year. Non concession cardholders who pay $874.90 in a year for their Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme medicines will be eligible for further medicines at the concessional rate for the rest of the year. 
That equates to 30 prescriptions, after which the safety net clicks in. I commend the budget to the House.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2002-03</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2002-05-28,"— The Treasurer says that this budget is designed to address the ageing of the Australian population, but what it does is cut the income of up to 200,000 people with a disability by up to $52 a fortnight and charges Australians 30 per cent more for their medicines—all in the name of preparing Australia for an ageing population. The ageing of the Australian society is the Howard government's favourite smokescreen. Let us look over some of the ways that that smokescreen has been used. It has been used time and again as a huge threat, a time bomb, even as a public policy crisis. In fact, of course, it is none of these things; it is just an excuse by this government for a number of very nasty policies that certainly have hurt a lot of people. 
Future generations of elderly Australians have become this government's favourite scapegoats. Over the past six years, the government has relied on the ageing of the population to justify a number of punitive policies. The government would rather talk about the ageing population than admit to its real agenda: to cut away at Medicare; to cut away at the PBS; to make life tougher for those Australians who are ill, disabled or disadvantaged. If we turn back to 1996 and the National Commission of Audit, the ageing of the population was used then to recommend increased charges for nursing home beds, which of course we saw come to pass. It also recommended the lowering of the age pension. We are yet to see that. That is sitting there in the drawer of the government. We may see that at some time in the future. 
—That is outrageous!
—By 1998 the ageing of the population was used again, this time to justify the GST. For the member's benefit, I will quote from the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said:
... unless we introduced a broadbased indirect tax to fund the growing demands for public services of that aging population we would be failing to match the need of the nation as years went by.
They were the Prime Minister's own words—the Prime Minister once again using the ageing of the population to justify the introduction of a very unfair tax. Now Australians are laden with the GST.
But the ageing population boogieman has not yet been put to bed. It is now the Treasurer's favourite excuse yet again to cut government programs. It does not even matter that the government's own Intergenerational Report does not support the `sky is falling in' spin that the Treasurer would like to have us believe. As the Sydney Morning Herald's Ross Gittins points out, the budget's Intergenerational Report:
... projects that the share of GDP going on the disability support pension and the sole parent pension will be unchanged over the next 40 years, while the share going to unemployment benefits will halve. These savings cut the overall increase in pension and benefit payments to just 0.6 points.
Mr Gittins goes on to say:
There are two reasons we don't have the age pension problem everyone else has—
what he means is other countries around the world with ageing populations—
Because our age pension is frugal, flat-rate and tightly means tested. But also because of the Labor Government's introduction of compulsory superannuation in 1992.
A budget that was designed to address the ageing of the Australian population would have looked very different from the budget that the Treasurer brought down just the other week. This year's budget was a missed opportunity for securing Australia's economic base for future generations. It assumes the worst in terms of our future as a population. It paints a picture of a nation locked into dependency and low productivity. It does not have to be this way.
The budget's medium-term goal should have been to create a more productive Australia through investment in education, research and development, to build the skills that will boost future economic growth and jobs to create the wealth so that we can afford to look after the elderly, the sick and the disadvantaged. These are the themes that should have been at the heart of the Intergenerational Report. These are the themes that were missing. Nowhere in the budget this year did we find any attempt to invest in our future so that we could have the wealth to be able to afford to look after our parents and grandparents. Of course, that is not what the objective of this government is: it is to frighten the public and then take away essential benefits.
A budget designed to address the ageing of the population would have included more than $12 million in new measures for the entire education, science and training portfolio. This is just an adjustment of 0.1 per cent in a total budget for education and training of $12 billion. Australia needs an urgent investment in education. There are over five million students in our schools, our TAFE colleges and our universities. The new measures in this budget provide an extra $2.50 this year to each student—that is it. That is not an investment in Australia's education. It is not an investment in Australia's future.

"King, Peter, MP",LP,2002-05-28,"—I rise this evening to express my concern and anger about the undemocratic actions of teachers at Woollahra Public School, which is located in my electorate. Earlier this month, by arrangement between the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the Woollahra school principal, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs was to visit Woollahra Public School to present an award to one of the students. The student was receiving second prize in a statewide school art competition run by his department to promote cultural tolerance. This obviously should have been a matter of considerable pride for the school community, teachers and, most importantly, for the winning school student and their family. Approximately three days before the event, the minister's office was advised that teachers at the school had voted to black ban the visit and that he was no longer welcome. This was despite written approval for the visit being given by the state education minister, John Watkins.
With some generosity of spirit, I might say, the minister's office, still keen to ensure the student's efforts were appropriately acknowledged, asked the department to see whether the school would allow me, as the local member of parliament, to present the award on his behalf. I too was black banned, as were subsequent suggestions that the award be presented by senior officers from the immigration department. Immigration staff have informed me that they were advised by the school principal that the teachers at his school were opposed to a visit by anyone who officially supported the government stance on the mandatory detention of asylum seekers and refugees.
This is not an issue about the government's policies on asylum seekers and mandatory detention. It is an issue about teachers saying that they are not prepared to allow into a school anyone who has a view different from theirs, even though in this case the minister was simply visiting to present an award to a bright young student, not to present a speech on government policy.
I respect the right of teachers, as individuals, to have views—indeed, strong views— about contemporary social and political issues. What I absolutely reject is the notion that teachers should take those personal views into the classroom in what should be an objective learning environment. It is clear that, inspired by the New South Wales Teachers Federation, teachers at Woollahra Public School acted like they were running some kind of ideological training centre. Our children are entitled to a broadly based education, not a rigid one-world view.
The fact that teachers now believe they can also determine who steps foot in schoolgrounds is disturbing. Teachers must remember that they do not run our schools. That job, as much as the Teachers Federation may not like it, actually falls to a democratically elected government. What those teachers have done is to push their personal views ahead of the interests of one of the students who was to receive some acknowledgment of their efforts by a senior minister. They have also brought the time-honoured traditions of their profession into disrepute. I call on state government and Minister Watkins to bring those teachers to heel. The very basis of our public education system is at threat when students can be exposed to this type of ideological partisanship and unethical behaviour.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Woollahra Public School: Teachers</title>,Adjournment,22,1,speech
