Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (09:32):  I was thinking that the minister might stand to answer the question that I asked when we finished up yesterday, which was about consultations in relation to the location of the RIC in Orange.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:32):  The decision about the location of the Regional Investment Corporation was a decision made by government.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (09:32):  You are saying that there were no consultations outside government?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:32):  Without going through the answer that I gave to a previous question, the decision about the specifics of the office accommodation are obviously a matter for the RIC board; the decision to locate the RIC in Orange was a decision of government. The decision of government was based on a number of criteria, which I talked about in the answer to a question yesterday: the importance of Orange as an agricultural hub which is well serviced by transport links, particularly from Canberra and Sydney; the opportunities for growth in that area; and the fact that it also meets the existing strong commitment by this government to establish hubs in rural and regional areas of Australia.


In addition to that, obviously we had discussions with other operations in Orange to assure ourselves that this was a suitable place for this corporation to go. Departmental officers, I understand, have met with stakeholders in Orange to discuss the establishment of the RIC in that city, that regional location. The meetings were held with a number of organisations, including the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries, the New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority, the Regional Development Australia Central West division, Paraway Pastoral Company, the Rural Financial Counselling Service New South Wales Central Region, Orange City Council, Orange Business Chamber and the New South Wales Farmers Orange branch.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (09:34):  Yesterday, Minister, you stated that you were not aware of any discussions the minister or his department is having about outsourcing functions of the RIC. At the public hearing of the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation in Bendigo on 9 October 2017, Ms Gartmann, the managing director and CEO of the Bendigo Rural Bank, gave evidence in response to the following questions:


… can you let us know if there's been any consultation with rural finance about the Regional Investment Corporation? Has anyone reached out to you about what's worked and what hasn't worked? Going forward, are you concerned at all about this federal organisation coming in and taking core business?


Ms Gartmann replied:


There certainly has been a large amount and a continuing number of engagements between the Commonwealth agencies and Rural Finance Corporation/Bendigo Bank representatives to discuss what is currently being executed in Victoria in partnership with the Victorian government and to explore areas to strengthen and improve the delivery of the government concessional lending and drought-and-disaster support. That continues to take place. Certainly we're always open to supporting a national approach and collaborating and partnering in whatever model is finalised going forward as of July next year.


As was outlined by Marnie, the balancing act is having some efficiency by coordination from a central, national point as opposed to the current delivery by the states and territories. It is the efficiency gained by having one system as opposed to multiple and balancing that out with an entity that is then further removed from the customer base that it is there to support and serve by having a national entity as opposed to those based in states and across the regions. That balance is yet to be worked out. We've still got a number of months to go before that is supposed to be up and running on 1 July, and we will certainly continue to share the experiences of Rural Finance Corporation with the relevant individuals and agencies to try to create a model that will serve and support all the farmers.


Ms Gartmann went on to say:


The offset accounts. They have traditionally not been available to agricultural businesses. But it is a common practice in residential lending. Legislative changes last year at a federal level were passed and that allowed the farm management deposit offset account to be created, which allows farmers to offset funds held in a farm management deposit account against eligible variable rate term lending, thereby reducing their farm lending costs. Rural Bank is the only bank in market offering that at the moment. But those sorts of legislative changes can demonstrate that it leads to positive business and funding changes for an industry, when done and supported by the private sector.


During a break, Ms Gartmann said that Bendigo Bank/Rural Finance was hoping to be able to tender for RIC work, which would be a front, but Bendigo Bank would continue to do the work. Ms Gartmann said they were in discussions with the department about a tender process.


Now that we know there have been discussions about outsourcing functions of the RIC, can the minister provide detail to the Senate about any other discussions? Is the minister aware that the department is having discussions with agencies that are currently delivering concessional loans? Has any work been undertaken regarding the cost these possible arrangements may incur? Will the RIC be regulated in a similar fashion to other financial banking institutions with regard to receivers, evaluators, lenders and who can provide advice to farm businesses seeking a loan?

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:38):  Thank you, Senator Brown. I will do my very best to answer the myriad of questions that you asked in that one long question. As I said to you yesterday, I wasn't aware of the consultations, but overnight I took it upon myself to avail myself of information relating to the consultation process that has been undertaken to date, particularly in relation to the areas that you were talking about: outsourcing and rural financial counselling services.


I can advise you that, in the period from 9 July to 10 August this year, the department engaged with a number of representatives of the banking sector and current concessional loan delivery agencies to gain a greater understanding of the market as well as the risks and opportunities in the service delivery area. As part of this process, they also met with a number of agencies that relate to the delivery of these financial assets to the community. They included the ANZ, Rural Bank, Rural Finance, Rabobank, Efic, the Commonwealth Bank, the National Bank, the Australian Bankers' Association, the New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority, the Department of State Growth in Tasmania, the Queensland Rural and Industry Development Authority, the Department of Primary Industries and Regions in South Australia and the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development in Western Australia.


In relation to the determination about the specifics of the operation, you asked about outsourcing and the opportunity for existing providers to be able to work as service providers and service delivery providers for the Regional Investment Corporation. Whilst some preliminary discussions have occurred around the broader issues of the delivery of the services of the RIC, the government believes it is appropriate that the details of that are a matter for the RIC board, once it is established, and so the detailed answers to the questions that you have asked are not available at this stage. However, I think it is reasonable to say that the RIC board will be given a level of scope to be able to make sure that they are delivering the services to the farming community of Australia in the most efficient and effective way. If they determine that that is using service providers that are currently in the marketplace, and I am sure they will, then that is obviously a matter of which they are able to avail themselves.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (09:41):  Thank you, Minister, and thank you also for coming in and clearing up your response to my question about outsourcing yesterday. In that response, are you saying that any outsourcing is a matter for the RIC board?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:42):  Yes, I am.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (09:42):  So it is solely a matter for the board. Can I ask then: why have these discussions, to which Ms Scartland in particular has referred been occurring, and why have they been undertaken by the department?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:42):  At the moment, the department is doing a level of preparatory work so that when the board is appointed they have as much information available as possible on which to base their decisions. Of course, the board is entirely entitled to go and seek its own information, or additional information, so I suppose you could just refer to it as somewhat of an incoming brief—so that they have information before them. Obviously, anything that the board may choose to do has to be within the terms of the operating mandate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (09:43):  Thank you. So—as I asked yesterday—we will possibly see, as Ms Scartland has indicated, that their wish would be that the RIC would be a front and that the Bendigo Bank—if they were successful in any tender—would be running the work of the RIC. She has indicated—just because you look confused, Minister—that they were hoping to be able to tender for RIC work and the RIC would be a front but the Bendigo Bank would continue to do to the work.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:44):  No, I'm not confused. First of all, referring to the RIC as a front, I think, is probably a very misleading way to be describing it. Certainly, the opportunity exists for service providers to be able to provide services to the RIC, like any other outsourcing of service delivery that were to occur within a statutory organisation.


However, as I stated before, the decisions about the operation, particularly about outsourcing and the operation and delivery of the assets of the RIC, are a matter for the incoming RIC board. So, apart from being able to say to you, Senator Brown, that the opportunity exists for outsourcing to occur, it would be entirely inappropriate for me to be giving direction to the RIC board about what they should or should not be outsourcing. Suffice to say, powers and opportunities exist for the RIC to do that under the terms of its operating mandate. I'm not sure I can give you any more information than that.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (09:45):  You just mentioned the operating mandate. Is that available?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:45):  The operating mandate is currently being developed. It will be an instrument that will require tabling post the establishment of the organisation. Obviously, the passage of the bill needs to proceed for the finalisation of the mandate, and at that time it will be tabled.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (09:46):  On the issue of the operating mandate, we have grave concerns with this bill because of the power that it gives the minister without parliamentary oversight and, in fact, without cabinet oversight. You have just stated that the operating mandate is in preparation, but is it correct that that operating mandate isn't a disallowable instrument?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:46):  Yes, that is correct.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (09:47):  So, essentially, you are setting up the Regional Investment Corporation with an operating mandate that has got no parliamentary oversight. It is giving a huge amount of power to the minister to determine exactly what the responsibilities of the RIC will be and the parliament won't be able to actually have any input into that—is that correct?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:47):  Obviously, the operating mandate is the key vehicle where the government will set out its expectations for the corporation. Whilst the express exemption exists for directions from ministers to corporate Commonwealth entities, the bill provides that the operating mandate is a legislative instrument and must be tabled in the parliament. This gives the parliament a level of oversight. Given the nature and the significance of the potential directions, that is fair and reasonable. It is not proposed for it to be a disallowable instrument. We believe that this is appropriate as it deals with matters over which the executive should retain control. As I said to Senator Brown yesterday when we were discussing the structure of this proposed organisation, the set-up of the RIC is almost a direct replica of the way the Clean Energy Finance Corporation was set up and currently operates in this space. Quite clearly, the mandate of the CEFC is required to be tabled in the parliament, but it is not a disallowable instrument.

 (Tasmania) (09:48):  I'm not sure, Minister, whether you actually did answer my question about whether the RIC will be regulated in a similar fashion as other financial banking institutes with regard to receivers, evaluators and lenders, and who can provide advice to farm businesses seeking a loan.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:49):  First of all, the RIC is not a bank. The RIC doesn't take deposits, so the regulation of the RIC will be appropriate for its structure.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (09:49):  Can I ask the minister to give us some more information as to what she believes is appropriate? We've been asked to pass this legislation—legislation that Labor, the opposition, believes does not have sufficient transparency or parliamentary oversight. So we're here in this committee stage to try to get some answers to allow some of that transparency, not only for the senators and the parliament but for those in the community who are very interested in this piece of legislation. So far we haven't really been able to get any answers to be able to alleviate any concerns that the opposition may have. So I ask the minister whether she can elaborate on her answer.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:50):  Thank you, Senator Brown. I did go to this point to some degree yesterday when I was explaining that this entity is required to comply. With its governance and regulation arrangements in relation to the PGPA, it is required to meet those regulations. But, in relation to its lending capacity and the regulations around lending, because we're lending to the states, we obviously have to meet all the regulations that would be expected of loans, particularly things like debt mediation et cetera. They would have to comply with the regulations of the respective states in which the loans are occurring, as well. There is a series of statutory requirements and regulations that exist as they would exist with any other statutory organisation of a similar type. But, equally, the actions in terms of loans for drought and debt financing would be subject to the regulations as they exist in the states.

Senator RICE

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:52):  The RIC has two ministers. It has the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources and the Minister for Finance. So, obviously, both ministers would be required to sign off on the operating mandate. As to whether the matter goes to cabinet, it is a decision of government.

Senator RICE

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (09:54):  So you could actually have the RIC decide on a completely new class of loan and that would be purely on the ability of the ministers to decide that that was the case, without cabinet oversight or even parliamentary oversight?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:54):  We're probably getting to a level of detail regarding the operation of cabinet. Obviously ministers have to operate within the conditions that are placed on them by the cabinet. However, in relation to the rolling out of a new type of loan or a new type of facility, obviously the states would have a say, because we can't roll out a facility in their state without their consent.


There are a number of checks and balances that occur through this process. Whilst you make it sound like the minister just makes a decision, there is a series of processes that are already in place around the governance, operation and accountability of the organisation through which this is being undertaken—the processes that currently exist in relation to the operation of ministers, their requirements and obligations under the cabinet process and through the relationship that the federal government has with state governments through existing arrangements and through the requirement of the government to comply with the regulations and requirements of the states in which these activities are occurring.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:58):  Currently we are required to work with the states. Under current arrangements, for any new class of loan that is required to be rolled out, a formal process of consultation with the states is required to occur. One of the underlying reasons for the establishment of this particular organisation and the purposing of it to roll out these loans and any new loans is so that we can have a more streamlined, effective and efficient way of getting the loans. Into the future, it would be through discussions between the ministers and the board, because the ministers are required to consult with the RIC board before any direction is given on, in this instance, a new class of loan. However, in the future, once that direction has been given, following that consultation with the board, the capacity to roll out those loans will not require a formal mechanism. However, obviously, we will continue to consult with the states about the delivery of any assistance to their jurisdictions.

However, I would say that I presided over the last ag minister's ministerial council and I've been at all ag minister ministerial councils since this particular organisation has been on the table as a proposed method by which to roll out future loans to the states. It has the overwhelming support of the states in its current proposed structure, so the states are quite happy with the way this is progressing. I'm not quite sure what you're actually asking outside of that.

There is the requirement, however, of the minister to consult with the board, but I just want to clarify that, at the end of the day, the power to decide that a new class of loan or a particular type of loan is going to be rolled out in a particular area rests solely with the ministers.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:03):  Just to let you know, the process through which the water infrastructure loans are administered is a different process. As you might be aware, the process that currently exists, which would continue, requires the state governments to be the ones that actually put forward the proposals in the first place. So it's a completely different process. Obviously, once we've received the applications from the states and they go through a process of evaluation in exactly the same way as they currently go through a process of arm's-length, independent evaluation, the recommendation would go back to the RIC in terms of the funding. At that point, obviously, the RIC board would make the determination in relation to the allocation or otherwise of funding to a particular project. The projects start with the states, so the RIC does not get to preside over the decision-making of the project unless it's already come from the state government.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:04):  In relation to the farm business loans, I am advised that they will be administered by the RIC under the conditions that are set out in the operating mandate.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:05):  If there was to be an entirely new class of farm business loans, the ministers would have the discretion to determine that there was an entirely new class of farm business loans and then the RIC would be able to roll out those loans?

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:05):  So, if there was a particular industry in a particular marginal seat that the ministers decided that they wanted to particularly support with a new class of farm business loans, it would be entirely at the power of the ministers to do that. There would not necessarily be cabinet oversight, let alone parliamentary oversight.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:06):  Thank you very much for your assistance, Mr Temporary Chair Bernardi. Information on directions issued by ministers is required to be contained in the annual report, and the usual parliamentary scrutiny obviously applies to these or any new ones, with estimates being the obvious vehicle through which the Senate has the opportunity to scrutinise any decisions of this nature.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:06):  I want to go back to the water infrastructure loans. I understand from what you've advised that the responsible ministers can direct the RIC to enter into agreements with the states. Is that correct?



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Have you concluded, Senator Brown?




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Yes.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:07):  As I was explaining to Senator Rice, the initial application for assistance in relation to the water infrastructure fund must come from the states. It comes from the states, and the minister provides direction to the RIC in relation to the—



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  Minister?




Senator RUSTON:
  Correct, and then the direction from the minister to the board, but bearing in mind it came from the state in the first place.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:07):  So exactly what Senator Rice has been saying is that this could create a situation, a real and serious situation, with the risk of political spending without the rigorous oversight or analysis. I understand you say they'll be tabled, but nothing that's going to be tabled, as I understand it, under this bill is disallowable?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:08):  The usual government processes are required and will be enforceable on the operation of this instrumentality in the same way as they would be enforceable on any other instrumentality, particularly in relation to the water infrastructure loans. The role of the RIC is to, obviously, assess and provide the expert advice to the responsible ministers on the projects that are being considered. The final decision on the water infrastructure loans is ultimately made by the government and then, on direction from the ministers, the corporation will enter into the administrative approvals process that is required to enter into the agreements for the loans with the states and territories.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:09):  I just want to make sure that I understood you correctly. It will be a matter for the government: the government will ultimately be making the decision whether to grant a loan rather than the RIC?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:09):  Yes, in the sense that, ultimately, the final decision rests there, but there is a process that is defined that has to occur prior to that decision being made. Obviously that requires, first of all, that the project has come forward with the authority, consent and request of the state or territory in which the piece of infrastructure is to be constructed. The corporation then has to go through a rigorous process of assessment and make that recommendation. That process is obviously transparent, in the sense that we know what the process is. Then, after recommendation, the ministers have the final decision in relation to those loans. It's also worth noting, Senator Brown, that that is the current process. There will be a greater level of transparency and an arms-length operation in assessment of these loans under the new facility than there currently is.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:10):  Minister, in terms of the advice that the minister receives, is there anything in this bill, or anything attached to this bill, that requires the minister to actually take that advice? From past performance, Mr Joyce doesn't seem too partial to be taking advice that departs from his view of the world.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:11):  Senator Brown, as I said, there is no greater level of capacity to be able to make decisions without due process under this organisation than there is under any other organisation. There is an established process under which these projects have to be assessed. I hark back to my point that the minister can only make a determination on a project that has been put forward by a state or territory government. So, within the operating mandate of the corporation and within the advice, there are a whole heap of things that the minister is required to do before making a determination in relation to a project. But you are quite right: this is a matter for government and cabinet, and the government has the ultimate power in this to make a determination in relation to a project that has been recommended.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:12):  Minister, you state that the government has the power, but, again, it is the two ministers who have the power. It doesn't even have to go through the rest of cabinet. It doesn't have parliamentary oversight. You also said that it's set out in the operating mandate, but the operating mandate can be changed by the two ministers without parliamentary oversight. These are our concerns about the governance of this project and resting far too much power in those ministers.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:12):  Senator Rice, obviously, unfortunately, I can't ask you a question, but I wonder why we seem to think that the governance arrangements, the scrutiny, the oversight, the notification processes and everything that sits around the Clean Energy Finance Corporation are at an appropriate level to enable that operation to work—and consider the kind of money that's associated with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation—yet for some reason you have a concern that exactly the same operational requirements for this particular organisation are somewhat lacking. Obviously, as I said, I can't ask you a question, but I draw to the attention of the house that they are exactly the same operating requirements. The operating mandate of the CEFC is not a disallowable instrument. I just draw the parliament's attention to that.




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  For the benefit of the chamber, I advise the minister that she is fully welcome to ask a question of another senator. She is entitled to ask a question of another senator in this debate. It is not a one-way flow of traffic.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:14):  Thank you for that clarification, Mr Temporary Chair. Are there any projects currently in the pipeline that may come through the RIC in terms of the discussions that have been had with states and territories? Are there any projects that are at the early stages of being put forward?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:14):  In relation to the water infrastructure facility, obviously, the projects that were approved under the last round are a matter of public knowledge, so you'd be well aware of those. In relation to the loan facilities and products, they are currently in discussion with the states. But, obviously, because the corporation has not yet been established, there have been no decisions in relation to that. I do know, though, from discussions with the states in relation to the transition between the existing situation and the new operation of the RIC, should it be passed, that there are already very detailed discussions in place about how you can seamlessly transition across so that the farmer—or anybody who is in need of the products currently available under the existing situation would be made available under the RIC—aren't inconvenienced in any way.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:15):  I would like to, again, clarify the questions around the operating mandate. You said that the states and territories do not have to sign off on an operating mandate, but are they being consulted? Also, which other stakeholders are being consulted in terms of the operating mandate? 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:16):  The states are being widely consulted on the products that will be made available as opposed to specifically being consulted on the operating mandate. But, obviously, part of that consultation and the feedback they'll get from that will form part of the basis of the decision the government makes on the operating mandate. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:16):  My question actually went to other stakeholders as well. I'm assuming from your answer that you are stating that the states and territories are being consulted on the operating mandate, because you just talked about products. Could you clarify that? 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:17):  Maybe I wasn't clear. The government is consulting a wide range of stakeholders, including state governments, on the products as opposed to specifically consulting them on the operating mandate. The answer to the question specifically is that we are not explicitly consulting on the operating mandate; we are explicitly consulting about the products that will be offered. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:17):  We got there. That wasn't too hard! So you are not consulting with the states and territories, and, I assume, from your response that means that you are actually not consulting with stakeholders. 




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Senator Ruston, is there a point of order? 




Senator Ruston:
  There is a point of order in terms of the accuracy of the response. 



The TEMPORARY CHAIR:  That's, indeed, a debating point. You can resume your seat. I'm sure you can respond. Senator Brown, you have the call. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:18):  I want to clarify whether you're specifically consulting with other stakeholders on the operating mandate. There has been a lot of uncertainty about what will or won't be included in the operating mandate and there has been some disappointment, thus far, as to whether there will be consultation. We are finding it very difficult to even get an answer to that very simple question. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:18):  First of all, a point of clarification on the opening remarks at the start of that question by Senator Brown. You said that we were not consulting. I quite clearly said that we were consulting. I said we weren't consulting specifically on the operating mandate—just to be very clear about that. The bill sets out what can be included in the operating mandate: the objectives to pursue in administering farm loans and the national water infrastructure facility; the government's expectations in relation to the strategies and policies to be followed by the corporation; the eligibility criteria for those loans; and the management of funding in other matters. These will all be outlined in the operating mandate. As I said, it is currently in the process of development. It will not be finalised until after the passage of the bill. However, after the passage of the bill, it will be tabled in the parliament, but not as a disallowable instrument. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:19):  Minister, in terms of the ability for the ministers to have discretion: in this case you were wanting to ask me a question about why we are happy with the CEFC. My understanding is that the CEFC, in fact, has much stricter requirements on the types of investment included in the legislation for the CEFC. However, here we have the ability for the RIC to undertake entirely new classes of loans without parliamentary oversight. So I'd ask the question: why is it seen to be appropriate for those entirely new classes of loans to be able to be at the discretion of ministers in this instance, whereas under the CEFC legislation it was actually included? There were quite strict parameters on what types of investment it could make, and these were included in the CEFC legislation.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:21):  Whilst there is a discretion for new product, these are still farm business loans, and the definition of 'farm business loan' is contained in the legislation. There is already a level of definition in the legislation, so I'm not quite sure why you would be suggesting that there isn't.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:21):  The definition of 'farm business loan' is extremely broad, and, going back to my previous point, the ministers, without parliamentary oversight—without even cabinet oversight—could decide to create a whole new type of farm business loan that is particularly suited to a particular farming type in an area of a marginal seat that happens to be beneficial for those ministers or for that particular party.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:22):  Just to be very clear, a 'farm business loan' means:


… a loan made, or proposed to be made, to a farm business:


(a) engaged solely or mainly in producing commodities for constitutional trade or commerce; or


(b) for the purpose of encouraging or promoting constitutional trade or commerce; …


So it's quite clear that a farm business loan requires the entity for which the loan is being made available to be engaged solely or mainly in the production of commodities for constitutional trade or commerce. That's quite clearly the definition there. But, in regard to your point, the minister is still required to take the expert advice of the corporation in relation to the development of any new products. So there is a level of expert advice that is necessarily provided to the ministers prior to their making any decision.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:23):  Under section 12, the minister must seek the board's advice. That's what the legislation says. It doesn't say that the minister, for other reasons, could decide that he or she is going to override or modify or make a determination that isn't completely consistent with the board's advice. It is within the ability of the ministers to make that decision.

 (Tasmania) (10:23):  The bill talks about a class of loans, but the term 'class' is actually not defined in the bill. Can you define that for the chamber?

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:24):  Senator Brown, the level of detail that you're suggesting needs to be included in the bill is probably something that would not normally be included. I'm talking about a class of licence of a loan. The classification of the loan and the eligibility to receive a loan is in the legislation. We're currently out consulting particularly and specifically about the eligibility criteria for those loans. That is one area of consultation that is a very high priority at the moment. We are consulting with not only the farming industry but also the banking sector and the states and territories to make sure that the eligibility criteria of the loan are fit for purpose and will result in the efficient and effective delivery of assistance to our farming community. I'm just wondering why you would think that would need to be included in the bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:25):  There is concern about this particular area because, as you have said, the minister cannot make directives with regard to particular loans under the farm loan program but they can make directions with regard to class of such loans. I don't think that it's unreasonable that you here are able to define for us what 'class' means in this bill. Essentially, with the minister being able to make directives with regard to particular loans, he's absolutely got the power to issue directives that concern arbitrarily tightening defined classes of loan. I don't think it's unreasonable for the chamber to be advised by government what 'class' means in this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:26):  Senator Brown, I suppose the class of loan is the normal definition of what a 'class' would mean. It's a type of loan.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:27):  I'm not sure that was entirely helpful, because we could see all types of loans being created by the minister in terms of his directions—construction loans? I think it's absolutely important that the government is able to define what it means and the parameters around what the term 'class' means in this bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:27):  Obviously, as we've stated before, the loans must be farm business loans. The legislation requires us to meet the criteria of what a farm business loan is before eligibility kicks in. But, just as an example of a class of loan, the dairy recovery loan package would be considered a class of loan. There is debt recovery. That's what a class of loan would be, as defined, under this.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (10:29):  I thank the minister for her frankness. I hope you are able to obtain the information, given it is a government body—the Productivity Commission—that has raised concerns about the constitutionality of the approach that the government has taken with this bill. There is really no excuse for not having that information available, given you are responding to concerns that were raised by an organisation that is funded—you may want to turn to your left, Minister; I think someone is trying to assist. Further to that, whilst you gave an assurance that you had received constitutional advice, you were unprepared or unwilling to table that advice in accordance with regular government practice. Can you assure this chamber that the advice received on the date you don't know by the organisation that you don't know was, in fact, validating the approach that the government has taken in light of the Productivity Commission's concerns?

 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:30):  I have been advised the Australian Government Solicitor was the body who provided the advice in response to the Productivity Commission's issues in relation to the constitutionality of the loans. My understanding is that the particular issue of constitutionality that was raised by the Productivity Commission actually related to the loans program that is currently being administered and not to the new loans and the operation of the RIC.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (10:31):  Yes, indeed, Minister. I am not surprised, because your new approach hadn't been presented when the Productivity Commission was talking about the constitutionality of the government directly funding loans to farms instead of via the states—if I am right, because I think it was some time in 2012 or thereabouts. I just want to make this clear. You have constitutional advice about concerns that you say are not applicable because, when they were raised, they were not relevant to this current thing. It is like torture; a spaghetti jumble—what happened and how and when it came about. I just want to make sure that the government is 100 per cent confident that what they are doing is compliant with the Constitution, even though I am getting mixed messages with respect to this.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:32):  Perhaps as a point of clarification and so I can be absolutely clear that we are speaking of the same words: my understanding is that the comments from the Productivity Commission in relation to the constitutionality of the loans were related to the existing method by which loans are administered by the federal government. You were asking a question about the advice received by government in relation to the constitutionality of the current operation of the loans program. I responded by saying we had received advice from the Australian Government Solicitor in relation to that. In relation to the constitutionality, you asked me a question about whether we had advice about the constitutionality of the proposed new methods by which loans are administered should the RIC be passed.

I raised concerns, in my speech in the second reading debate, about the direct funding of loans to farmers by government. They were based on the report of the Productivity Commission in looking at alternative ways to deal with the issue. Now, yes, they might not be relevant directly to this bill, but this bill does, in effect, provide the Commonwealth with the facility to provide loans directly to farmers. I am concerned—I don't want to conflate the two issues—but it is about the constitutionality of the approach the government is taking. I am not trying to be tricky. I don't think you are trying to be tricky, but I just want a clear answer. You've had advice in respect of this bill from the Government Solicitor, which is what you mentioned before. I would like to know when advice was received that it is entirely within the constitutional purview of the government to proceed with this approach.

The loan scheme was designed taking into account a large range of factors, including the Commonwealth's constitutional powers to do this. The legal advice that was taken throughout the process was obviously an iterative approach to receiving advice; it wasn't just one piece of advice received at one point in time. So yes, the government has received legal advice. It received legal advice throughout the whole process in relation to the loan scheme that is being currently designed and the decisions in relation to how that is going to work included the constitutional power for the Commonwealth to be able to undertake and deliver the loans under the proposed method.

Do you envisage that a class of loans could be restricted geographically, for example, to a state? Could it be a class of loans to a particular agricultural industry in a particular state?

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:36):  Possibly, Senator. The underlying reason for this particular package is the ability for governments to be much more responsive to the needs of our farming community. As you would be aware, having a keen interest in the farm sector, farming takes many and varied forms. In that case, we can have localised distress occur because a particular area is impacted by a localised or regionalised event or activity. Equally, a single industry can be impacted across the whole country, which means that there is a little bit of the industry through many jurisdictions. A classic example of that more recently has been the situation that occurred with the crisis in the dairy industry; probably no state felt it more keenly than the state which you represent as a senator. So the ability for the classes of loans to be immediately responsive and reactive to situations that we find our farming communities getting themselves into or being impacted by without much notice is important. So the answer to your question is yes. The loan classes are, in effect, designed so that they can be quickly responsive to situations to assist our farmers as quickly, effectively and efficiently as possible.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:38):  Senator Rice, obviously, the criteria of the particular loans will determine the eligibility criteria for access to these particular loans. As I said earlier to Senator Brown, there is quite an extensive consultation going on at the moment in terms of developing the criteria both in the operating mandate in the broader terms of eligibility, which is the consultation that is currently being undertaken, and also in relation to any direction that comes from the minister. Obviously, the criteria under which accessibility of the particular loan would be available would be determined. In terms of the operating mandate, it is an instrument to be tabled in the parliament.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:39):  But there's nothing in the legislation—which is where we as the parliament have the ability to say this is appropriate or not—that would constrain what could be in those classes of loans. So we could have a class of loan, for example, where suddenly there is money available to the wine industry in South Australia just before a South Australian election, or suddenly there is a class of loans available to the dairy industry in northern Tasmania just before a Tasmanian election or a federal election, or suddenly, just before a New South Wales election, there is a class of loans for plantation forestry in northern New South Wales, and there would be no parliamentary oversight over these types of loans. It is up to the operating mandate, which is not a disallowable instrument. It's up to the ministers to decide in their judgement, and just the ministers, not even going to the cabinet. It's going to be up them, with executive power to decide that there's suddenly government largesse that would be available to a particular industry in a particular state. This is why we have grave concerns about this legislation. It is setting up a slush fund to be able to be used by the government of the day.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:40):  Senator Rice, I will have to agree to disagree with the intonation of your response. The eligibility criteria for loans and financial assistance are matters over which the executive arm of government currently has control, and it's the opinion and belief of government that it should retain control. The potential impact on the budget is quite considerable, and obviously the executive of government has a responsibility for budgetary control. Therefore, we absolutely believe that it's appropriate that this remains in the control of executive government.

We have just found through the High Court case on equal marriage that there is a $295 million line in the budget each year that we understood was for urgent and unforeseen circumstances but that the High Court has now found is basically there as a fund for whatever the government of the day wants to fund. So you have that ability to essentially hand out loans to suit the political purposes of the government without the parliamentary oversight that would be appropriate in such a scheme. We haven't got a problem with having loans schemes. There should be much stricter controls included in the legislation, not leaving so much power in the hands of the ministers.

Obviously, the agriculture and finance ministers are required to agree to those guidelines.


I also have a point of clarification on a previous question—I am not sure if it came from you or Senator Brown. Existing loans require a hardship element, and the board will be required to comply with that existing requirement.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:45):  Senator Rice, at the risk of repeating myself for the 14th time, the current situation, which everyone seems to be quite satisfied with, allows the executive of government to undertake and make these decisions in relation to this particular suite of products that are in the marketplace. These products have a very specific role to play, and that is to assist our farming community when situations of hardship affect them—most often not of their own making.


Currently, we have a suite of products. Definitely, after the consultation and discussions that I have had in my role as the assistant minister, and also through my role as someone who's lived in rural and regional Australia for many years, the ability for responsiveness in these loans is something that's been criticised for some time. We have a situation right now where we are providing this assistance to communities across the whole of rural and regional Australia. We're seeking to do so by a mechanism that is now going to enable it to be more streamlined and more responsive, and which is actually going to provide a better service to those people who are affected.


To have a situation as you're proposing, where we have some sort of extraordinarily high level of parliamentary power to be able to come in and make decisions in relation to stuff—decisions that have in the past always been made by the executive arm of government, for the reasons that I stated previously—is, first of all, an extraordinary precedent to set. But think about the farmers who wish to be able to get access—very often with some level of speed. You're suggesting here that it's appropriate for us to have this extraordinarily increased level of intervention by this very parliament. That is something that is quite unprecedented in the level of intervention that you are proposing by suggesting that every single thing has to come here to somehow get ticked off by you.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:52):  by leave—I move opposition amendments (1), (3), (4) and (6) on sheet 8225 together:


(1) Clause 11, page 10 (lines 6 to 9), omit the note, substitute:


Note: Part 4 of Chapter 3 (sunsetting) of the Legislation Act 2003 does not apply to the directions (see regulations made for the purposes of paragraph 54(2) (b) of that Act).


(3) Clause 11, page 10 (after line 31), at the end of the clause, add:


   (4) Section 42 (Disallowance of legislative instruments) of the Legislation Act 2003 applies to a direction made by the responsible Ministers under subsection (1).




Rules



   (5) The rules must prescribe, in relation to loans or financial assistance to be provided by the Corporation, the eligibility criteria for those loans or that assistance.


(4) Clause 12, page 11 (after line 15), after subclause (3), insert:


   (3A) For the purposes of subsection (3), any terms and conditions to be included in an agreement must be in accordance with the rules.


(6) Clause 12, page 11 (after line 21), at the end of the clause, add:




Ministerial directions—water infrastructure projects



   (6) A direction made by the responsible Ministers under subsection (3) is a notifiable instrument.


   (7) Section 38 (Tabling of legislation instruments) of the Legislation Act 2003 applies to the direction as if the direction were a legislative instrument.


   (8) The Minister must cause a copy of the direction to be published on the internet within 30 days after it is issued by the Minister.




Agreements—water infrastructure projects



   (9) The Corporation must give the Agriculture Minister a copy of an agreement entered into under subsection (3).


   (10) The Minister must cause a copy of the agreement to be tabled in each House of Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after its receipt by the Minister.


   (11) The Minister must cause a copy of the agreement to be published on the internet within 30 days after its receipt by the Minister.




Rules



   (12) The rules must prescribe, in relation to agreements to be entered into under subsection (3):


(a) the terms and conditions, or the kinds of terms and conditions, that may be included in an agreement; and


(b) the matters the Corporation must consider in specifying terms and conditions to be included in an agreement.


These amendments seek to strengthen the current bill. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee report found that the current bill lacked the appropriate high-level guidance as to the types of terms and conditions that states and territories will be required to comply with in order to receive payment of financial assistance for water infrastructure projects. Throughout the committee stage thus far, I haven't received any comfort from the minister's responses to the questions that have been asked. Regarding the water and infrastructure projects, this includes a legislative requirement that any directions made by the responsible ministers under subclause 12(3) and any agreements with the states and territories about these grants of financial assistance are tabled in the parliament within 15 sitting days after being made and published on the internet within 30 days after being made.


The scrutiny committee also expressed concerns about the bill exemption from disallowance and sunsetting. Minister Ruston has claimed that the normal parliamentary oversight and scrutiny will exist with regard to the corporation. However, while the bill provides for the operating mandate to be treated as a legislative instrument and will require it to be tabled, it will not be subject to disallowance and sunsetting. 


The minister has sought to reassure the Senate chamber that any directions the corporation receives from the responsible ministers will be published in its annual reports. The government is claiming that this requirement will ensure that there will be appropriate transparency of ministerial directions to the corporation. Non-disallowable instruments do not allow for the proper oversight and parliamentary scrutiny of ministerial directions. Labor's amendments seek to strengthen the proper oversight and parliamentary scrutiny for directions made by the minister.


Minister Ruston also questioned whether Labor had concerns about entities similar to the RIC. This would be a fair question if those entities were indeed established under the exact same legislation that the RIC is to be established under. 


We know that there are aspects of this bill that are unique in nature, and this is most likely due to the fact that Minister Joyce is the architect of the bill. It is lacking in detail, and we have seen a number of amendments put forward in an attempt to strengthen the bill. Labor urges all senators to support Labor's amendments to ensure that there is proper parliamentary oversight and scrutiny of the corporation.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:56):  The government will not be supporting the Labor Party's amendments (1), (3), (4) and (6). The reasons for this have been largely canvassed in the previous discussions prior to the moving of these amendments. In effect, the government believe that the operating mandate should not be a disallowable instrument, as it deals with matters over which the executive arm of government should retain control. We believe that the approach in the bill gives the parliament the right level of oversight of the operating mandate, given the nature and significance of that direction to the entity. Firstly, the bill requires and provides for the mandate to be a legislative instrument, which requires it to be tabled. The approach has been taken despite the express exemption that exists for directions of ministers to corporate Commonwealth entities. We have required that to be included. We believe the government is being open and transparent and, in this instance, going beyond the minimum requirements. As I said before, this approach is not unusual, and I have cited the CEFC as an instrumentality in which the operating mandate is not a disallowable instrument. 


In relation to amendment (3)—that the terms and conditions of water agreements be prescribed in rules and be disallowable—we believe it is inappropriate, as these, once again, are matters over which the government should have control. We believe it would also reduce the Commonwealth's flexibility when negotiating with the states and territories and could be confusing for the corporation in terms of compliance. We believe the parliament has the appropriate level of visibility of these grants for financial assistance and for water infrastructure projects, and this will be achieved through the tabling of the operating mandate and the contents thereof, as well as through the reporting requirements for corporate Commonwealth entities under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:59):  The Greens will be supporting these opposition amendments, which attempt to give the required parliamentary oversight that is essential and currently not included in this legislation. This legislation gives far too much power to, and concentrates that power in the hands of, the ministers. The minister talked about using the example of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation legislation. If you read the CEFC legislation, it sets out explicitly—there is clause after clause after clause—the restrictions on what money can be lent and what types of infrastructure are eligible for funding under the CEFC and what is not. That level of detail is completely lacking in this legislation.


So the Labor amendments, if passed, would give that extra level of parliamentary oversight that is necessary. Alternatively, I think you'd have to go back to the drawing board and set out in much greater detail what it's appropriate for these levels of loans to be spent on. The fact that there is nothing regarding hardship requirements included in the legislation and that there is no definition of what a class of farm business loans is means it is open slather for the ministers to be able to make decisions on their own. The powers for them to direct the board are really setting up a very undemocratic and unaccountable institution. These Labor amendments, which we are supportive of, go some way to having a level of parliamentary oversight that is absolutely required.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (11:01):  As I've said previously, we believe that the level of control, governance and oversight that is contained in the proposal that is before us is appropriate for the actions and the operations of the instrumentality. We believe there are roles for executive government, there are roles for this parliament and obviously there are roles that will be delegated to the board of the organisation. I particularly reiterate that this entity is required to have the reporting obligations of the corporation exist under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act. These obligations require that a corporate plan be prepared and published on the corporation's website. The corporation must also prepare annual reports to be tabled in parliament by the responsible ministers. The corporation's annual reports must include a statement of performance which sets out the results, measurements and assessment identified in the entity's corporate plan, and the annual reports also need to detail any directions issued by the responsible ministers.


So I would just reiterate that there are a number of existing requirements that are set out by normal government procedure that will apply to this organisation, not the least of which is the PGPA Act. Also, as we've mentioned before, the Senate has appropriate levels of scrutiny in relation to the Senate estimates process, through which you have the capacity to prosecute any of the issues that you are raising.

 (Tasmania) (11:09):  I  move opposition amendment (2) on sheet 8225:


(2) Clause 11, page 10 (line 21), paragraph 11(2) (c) to be opposed.


This amendment will remove the ministers' influence on directing the corporation about the eligibility criteria for loans and financial assistance. The independence of the corporation is critical when establishing the eligibility criteria for loans or financial assistance. The lack of detail about what loans and financial assistance will be provided by the corporation is concerning when we know that the current concessional loans take into consideration the viability of the farm enterprise. To ensure that the corporation is able to manage its lending criteria, the responsible ministers should not be able to give directions about eligibility criteria for loans or financial assistance.


Labor strongly urges senators to support the amendment to strengthen the independence of the corporation. Once again, I make reference to Minister Ruston, who compared the RIC to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. These two corporations are different in their objectives, and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is independent in its own right, as opposed to the RIC, which is beholden to the ministers of the day.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (11:12):  In relation to the proposed amendment (2) from the Labor Party, which would have the eligibility criteria for loans or financial assistance prescribed in rules which are disallowable instruments, the government believes this is an inappropriate mechanism through which to provide for the eligibility criteria for loans. We believe they are matters over which the executive arm of government should retain control as they have the potential to impact on the Commonwealth budget. We, therefore, believe it's appropriate that they are provided for in the bill as directions to the entity rather than as rules. We also believe that it's appropriate that they are not disallowable.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (11:20):  I now move opposition amendment (5):


(5) Clause 12, page 11 (lines 20 and 21), omit ""responsible Ministers may give a written direction to the Corporation about"", substitute ""rules must provide for"".


This amendment removes the minister's being able to direct where the corporation must be located. Instead, the rules must provide for where the corporation is to be located.


Minister Ruston earlier referenced the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and made an implication that there is no difference between how that corporation was established and how the RIC is established. Minister Ruston should familiarise herself with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Act. It certainly does not have a clause whereby the responsible minister can direct where the corporation is to be located.


To ensure the proper, efficient and effective performance of the corporation, the board should be allowed to make decisions as to where best the corporation will function. Minister Ruston has provided no detailed information about what process was undertaken to determine that Orange is the best location for the corporation and whether any other regional centre was considered before Orange was selected. Concerns have been raised by stakeholders that the location of the RIC has been unilaterally decided without any apparent economic analysis or even a discussion with the agricultural industry stakeholders, and this in turn has highlighted another dimension of the non-commercial nature of the corporation.


The location of the corporation should not be decided by the minister of the day. The location should be decided on the grounds of where it can best do its job, and this decision should be made by the board of the RIC.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (11:22):  Firstly, can I just put on the record that I'm not entirely sure that I ever said that the CEFC was told where it was to be located.


The Australian government, as I have said time and time again, has a very strong commitment to rural and regional Australia. Our decentralisation policy will certainly be supported by the corporation being located in Orange, New South Wales. Orange is an extraordinarily important agricultural hub, and we believe that this is an appropriate place for the RIC to be located. Meetings have been held with a number of entities, which I have previously put on the public record as part of this debate, which were consulted about the operational arrangements of the organisation, so there certainly has been consultation.


In essence, this is absolutely consistent with our current policy. It's in line with the exemptions under the Legislation (Exemptions and Other Matters) Regulation that a direction is not a legislative instrument and therefore is not disallowable. This approach also provides certainty to the board about where the corporation will be located and will allow it to have focus on having the corporation fully operational by July 2018.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (11:24):  The Greens will be supporting this amendment from Labor. The fact that the board is being directed to establish its headquarters in Orange underlines the whole rationale behind so much of this legislation. It is giving power without any assessment process, without any objective process. It gives the minister the power to direct the board, quite inappropriately.


Orange may well be the best place for the headquarters of such a corporation, but we don't know. There is no process that's been undertaken to determine that, just like with the APVMA, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. Suddenly Minister Joyce plucked Armidale out of the air and said, 'It's going to be there,' with no justification. We saw in the cost-benefit analysis that was done that in fact there was a negative benefit in establishing the headquarters of the APVMA in Armidale.


Here we've got a similar situation. It is blatant pork-barrelling. That's all it is. Without parliamentary oversight and without any process, we have a situation of putting far too much power in the hands of the executive. This might be the way the government wants to do business, but it is not good governance. It is not good, transparent, accountable, evidence-based legislation and governing. Supporting this amendment, at least, is one tiny thing that would improve this legislation. The fact that the government is opposing this amendment bells the cat.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (11:27):  I can confirm for you—just in case you were in any doubt—that it is the heart of the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party and their supporters, which, of course, is playing into the concerns of the National Party. In this debate in this place, I was reminded very much of an event that happened under a former minister, Ros Kelly, with regard to the awarding of grants, where they were mapped out, effectively, on a whiteboard. Are you able to confirm that a whiteboard and a similar process will be used to determine where these grants should be given in the event of propping up marginal seats?

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (11:28):  Thank you, Minister. I'm heartened by your reassurance that all the appropriate probity and accountability of government will be brought to bear in many of these grants. But what you've said flies in stark contrast to what Senator Rice has been saying—which has resonated with me, quite frankly—which is that there is no real, formal approval process. The board can make some suggestions which the minister can ignore and establish new classes of grants and dispense them wherever they like. For example, they could, in the interests of equality, not only give them to Armidale and Orange but they might slot it into Renmark for no particular reason—maybe to support the good work of a senator down there, or something like that. It doesn't seem as if there is any rationale or criteria attached to where these grants can go apart from the whims of the minister at the time.


Now, we may have confidence in the minister—some may not, currently—but no-one knows who is going to be the minister next. To place such discretion in the hands of any one individual without the checks and balances that accrue from the parliament—and I do note that the government has voted against the disallowance of these grants, these potential boondoggles, these potential whiteboard/sports rorts, to coin a term; these could be ag rorts in a future life. These are normal checks and balances that accompany the responsibilities and roles of government.


Further, how does something like this get through the cabinet without these checks and balances? I know you are not in cabinet, Minister. I think you've been given a hospital pass here in some respects, and I'm sorry for that, but, in effect, this doesn't seem even to have gone through the normal cursory examinations and consultation attached to cabinet probity. It just seems as if it's been cooked up on the whim of one or two individuals in order to give them some discretion to prop up political threats, and that really concerns me. I don't think it's the right approach. It overturns the principles of federation. As I said, it overturns some of the concerns raised on the constitutionality by the Productivity Commission. It overturns the expectation of appropriate consultation and examination by the parliament and the ability to say, 'This is absolutely wrong.' It has all the hallmarks of a scheme that is going to be rorted. It may be well intended, but these are serious concerns. Minister, whilst you have assured us of these probities, I still haven't heard an effective response to Senator Rice's concerns that, in effect, this is just a bag of money that is at ministerial discretion to throw out wherever they like.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (11:31):  There are a number of points that I'll try and clarify from the comments that you have just made. First of all, to put this on the record: Orange has a series of quite unique characteristics that make it a particularly ideal location in terms of creating a critical mass of infrastructure in relation to agriculture in a regional community. I'm assuming you are not suggesting for a minute that we shouldn't be decentralising and giving support to the regional communities around Australia, including the one in which I live. But, at the moment, Paraway Pastoral, the New South Wales RIA, the New South Wales DPI and NAB Business Banking all have their headquarters in Orange. The creation of a regional centre of excellence in Orange is something that the government believes is a very worthy and worthwhile application of its activities.


There were a number of reasons why Orange was identified as being an entirely suitable location for the RIC to go to. It's also worth pointing out that all the way through here we have interspersed the word 'loans' with the word 'grants'. I'd like to put on the record and make sure it is very clear that we are referring to loans and not grants.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (11:33):  I would just like to follow on from Senator Bernardi's contribution because the minister in her response made it no clearer to the chamber what the process was that was undertaken to determine Orange as the location for the RIC. There was no indication of whether there were any other locations—and there are many locations around Australia that have vibrant farming communities. Unless the minister can tell us now what the process was and what, if any, other locations were considered, the only thing that we in this chamber can safely assume is that this is about pork-barrelling by Mr Joyce and a political fix for the National Party. That is the only conclusion that we can come to, because the minister has failed to tell this chamber exactly what the process was.


We've seen this all before under Mr Joyce. We saw it with the siting of the APVMA in Armidale, and that has not gone well. We've seen expert people leave that organisation. We have seen the backlog of work that hasn't been able to be undertaken because of the concern and uncertainty that Mr Joyce has caused. So it is vital in this committee stage that the minister tells this chamber quite clearly what process was undertaken to select Orange as the location for the commission.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (11:35):  There are two things here. One is that I think we need to be very careful that you don't make a quantum leap of faith to suggest that the decision of the government to pursue its decentralisation targets and policy to move a number of agencies out of capital cities and into regional communities, where they're closer to the people that they represent, has been the cause of what has been a long-term systemic underperformance of the APVMA. I think we just need to be very careful that you don't accuse something of being the cause of something that it actually wasn't.


However, I don't know how many times I have to reiterate every single indicator as to why Orange would be a very suitable place for the location of this important agricultural institution. Yesterday afternoon, I think, I made the point that it is a decision of government. The government has exercised its right in making that decision, but in doing so it has provided, ad nauseam, a number of different reasons why it believes Orange is an extraordinarily suitable place for this organisation. As a rural and regional member of this parliament, I can assure you that I could go and speak to every one of my colleagues and they would all have somewhere in their electorates where they would like to have a government agency located. However, in doing so, everybody still has to demonstrate that it is a suitable place and an appropriate place and that there are strong reasons for the location of any government instrumentality in any area, rural or metropolitan. Quite clearly, Orange has a whole heap of factors and a whole heap of attributes that are attractive for the location of this instrumentality. I can go through them all again with you, but, in the interests of time, I will allow you to re-read Hansard to be informed of them.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (11:37):  Thank you, Minister. I find this very interesting and very enlightening because, essentially, you've said that there are a number of criteria from which the government has chosen this location, and you've put that on the record. Surely, Orange was not the only candidate. So my question, which builds upon Senator Brown's question, is: how many local council areas were approached about their interest in having the RIC housed within their regions? How many different centres were considered in the shortlist by government? On what criteria, specifically, that weren't demonstrable in other candidates was Orange chosen as the final location?

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (11:38):  There were no other locations in Australia where currently a state department of agriculture and primary industries is located in a regional area. In the case of New South Wales, the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries and the New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority are located already in Orange. The existence of infrastructure in the area makes Orange quite unique.


I can run through all the other reasons why Orange is particularly unique for this particular instrumentality, such as its proximity to both Canberra and Sydney, making it very easy to access, and the existence of a broad range of other organisations that are already there to create a centre of excellence and critical mass in the area. And, as you would know, from your previous experience of belonging to the same party that I do, we quite clearly as a government are trying to establish centres of excellence in our regional areas, so that we can create the economic activity that drives our regional economies because, at the risk of sounding parochially regional, it is our regional communities that drive the economy of this country.

It wasn't an objective process that the department undertook that ended up going through some criteria and saying, 'Yes, after considering all of these criteria—on objective, transparent criteria—Orange came out on top.' It was a political decision made by the minister to establish this corporation in Orange because it suited his political purposes, because it is where the shooters and fishers are threatening to hold the seat which the Nationals lost to the shooters and fishers. It is pure, blatant pork-barrelling. You have not outlined that there was any process at all that was objective, that was transparent or that came through the department. It was a political decision by Minister Joyce, who has got form in making these types of political decisions.

Those criteria obviously have been considered by government as meeting the objectives and the requirements of the location of this organisation better than a number of other locations that were considered, as I've pointed out, not exclusively but including the locations that I read out in response to the question that I received from Senator Bernardi. I can go through all of the reasons why Orange was considered to be the preferred location and why it was chosen as the location for the Regional Investment Corporation.

Can details of that assessment process be tabled so that there is some transparency and so that we can see, on the basis of these criteria, that Orange came out on top, because unless you can do that everything points to this just being a pure and simple pork-barrelling slush fund exercise of getting a government department in Orange to suit the National Party in these circumstances.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (11:46):  I suppose the one underlying factor that differentiates Orange from the other places that were identified in the list I just gave is that the New South Wales department of agriculture is already located in Orange, and, given the other departments and institutions that are located in Orange, it was considered that there was already a significant hub of existing activity that the RIC would be able to support in creating the centre of excellence in Orange.


It is probably also worth pointing out that a number of the other locations that were considered have had agencies of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources relocated there as part of the government's overall decentralisation program, including the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation and the Grains Research and Development Corporation. There have been a number of agencies that have been moved to some of the other locations that were highlighted by Minister Joyce in announcing this particular proposal, so our overall policy of decentralisation is supporting a number of regional communities.

There were about 55 different stakeholders that were formally consulted as part of that process, including instruments of government in the other states around Australia, as well as industry and communities and governments—and banks, obviously, as well, given that it was a loan facility. Quite separately, that consultation occurred in relation to the loans facility.


That's a different question than the question in relation to the location of Orange. As I said to Senator Dastyari, as I said to Senator Brown, as I've said to you and as I've said to Senator Bernardi, it was a decision of government.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (11:59):  The reason I want to clarify this is that you indicated to Senator Dastyari before that there was in fact some level of consultation about Orange, but you've now clarified that there was never a level of consultation in terms of the location where the RIC was going to be established. Can I clarify then also that, for those other potential locations for the headquarters of the RIC, there was never any opportunity for those to put forward their case as to why they should be considered the potential locations for the RIC to be established?

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (11:59):  At the risk of sounding like a cracked record, the location of the RIC in Orange was a decision of government. I have given you all of the background as to why the RIC was chosen. The government and the minister stand by the decision that Orange is the most suitable and the best place for the location. I have provided information to you and to others in the chamber in relation to other locations that were considered by government as possibly being locations for the RIC. The decision of government was that Orange was the preferred location.

Did they even know they were on that short list? Was there any opportunity for any location to provide advice to the minister as to why they felt they were the most appropriate site, or was the process just one of the minister plucking Orange out because he felt that it was the most appropriate location?

 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (12:01):  Senator Rice, no, there was no submission process. However, if you look at the names of the towns I read out, they quite clearly are prominent regional towns in Australia. That was why they would have been identified by government as potential locations for such an organisation as the RIC. However, the decision of government was that Orange was the most suitable.

The deliberations of government as to why Orange was chosen, I think, are self-evident in the characteristics of this particular town.

Senator CAROL BROWN

We want to know how those other locations were chosen as possible locations. Were organisations or local councils in those areas contacted about providing information as to why their town would be a good site for the RIC? We are trying to understand what the process is. In the absence of a response that satisfies what really is a very simple question, we have to assume that this decision of locating the RIC in Orange is a decision that Minister Joyce made himself. We have no idea as to what informed his decision.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (12:05):  I do feel for you, Minister, because it's very clear that you have not got any information to give us, because there was clearly a very inadequate process, if you can call it a process at all. There was no submission process. It sounds like the towns that were apparently on this short list didn't even know that they were on the short list. And why were those towns on the short list whereas other towns that equally could have been on the short list, like Launceston and Cairns, were not? So you aren't able to share any more information with us, but it just goes to the point that there was clearly no objective, transparent process for the selection of the short list. It sounds to me like the minister was riffing off names and saying, 'Yes, we could think of these six cities that possibly could have been sites, and we are choosing Orange.' I have nothing against Orange. It's a lovely place, and there are some criteria as to why it could be appropriate for it to be there, but the point is process. The point is having an appropriate, objective, transparent, accountable, evidence based process that you aren't able to share with us because it's quite clear that it doesn't exist.

The CHAIR:  The question is that the motion, as moved by Senator Brown, that amendment (5) on sheet 8225 be agreed to.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (12:18):  by leave—I move government amendments (1) and (2) on sheet EF114 together:


(1) Clause 12, page 11 (after line 15), after subclause (3), insert:


   (3A) In giving a direction under subsection (3), the responsible Ministers must exercise their powers consistently with the Water Act 2007.


   (3B) Before giving a direction under subsection (3) in relation to a water infrastructure project that is wholly or partly within the Murray‑Darling Basin (as defined by the Water Act 2007), the responsible Ministers must seek the Murray‑Darling Basin Authority's advice as to whether in giving the direction, the Ministers would be exercising the Ministers' powers consistently with the Basin Plan (as defined by the Water Act 2007).


(2) Clause 12, page 11 (after line 18), after subclause (4), insert:


   (4A) If:


(a) the responsible Ministers give a direction under subsection (3) to the Corporation to enter into an agreement; and


(b) the direction is one in relation to which the responsible Ministers received advice from the Murray‑Darling Basin Authority under subsection (3B);


then:


(c) the Board must notify the responsible Ministers when the agreement has been entered into; and


(d) the responsible Ministers must publish the advice on the internet within 30 business days of receiving the notice under paragraph (c).


The government amendments to the Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017 relate to directions that the responsible ministers are able to give to the corporation under clause 12(3) directions to enter into grants of financial assistance for water infrastructure projects. That directions power is an important part of the government's arrangements of the National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility and provides the mechanism for government to communicate its decisions on projects that have been approved for a loan. The amendment makes it clear that, in giving a direction under clause 12(3), the responsible ministers need to exercise their powers consistently with the Water Act 2007. They will also have to seek the advice of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority before issuing a direction under clause 12(3). This requirement ensures that the responsible ministers receive advice on the consistency of the projects with the Basin Plan from the independent body that is best placed to make the assessment. The government is committed to working with states and territories to build the water infrastructure needed for agricultural industries to expand and increase their productivity, and the National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility is a critical part of that commitment.


We are also committed to meeting our water management obligations, and this amendment makes that clear and should provide confidence to the senators in supporting this bill. In moving this amendment, I acknowledge in particular the interest of senators from my home state of South Australia in making sure that we are absolutely explicit that there is no impact on the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and in particular water policy by this organisation. I thank Senator Xenophon for his work with me and the department on ensuring that we have the very clearest of conditions included in the bill to make sure that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is delivered in full and on time and that the Water Act and water policy are not compromised in any way.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-10-18,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:20):  I indicate that, obviously, we support this amendment. This is an important amendment in the context of ensuring that there is no ambiguity in how the Regional Investment Corporation will operate in the context of water policy and that the Water Act will not in any way be affected by this and, in particular, the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and sustainable diversion limits. The amendment is self-evident. Senator Ruston has alluded to productive discussions that I've had with her and the Deputy Prime Minister in respect of this. I believe this is a belts-and-braces approach, to put it colloquially, to ensure there is no ambiguity in terms of the impact of any water projects funded under the Regional Investment Corporation legislation. It will provide strong guarantees in directions in terms of the Murray-Darling Basin, that it must be transparent and that responsible ministers within the basin receive advice. That includes the Minister for Water and the River Murray in South Australia, the Hon. Ian Hunter, who has a strong interest in these issues as well. I have spoken to the honourable Mr Hunter in the last 36 hours about the need for this.


I may ask one question of the minister just so that it's on the record. It's something I have discussed with departmental officers. Does this amendment give rights of judicial review to those who have standing to ensure that it is complied with? In other words, we're not just saying that this must be complied with; can it actually be enforced through a judicial review process?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (12:22):  To clarify the point that you've just raised: under the Water Act and sections 34 and 35 of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan 2012, it is not lawful for the Commonwealth or a state to construct water infrastructure, whether it is funded by the RIC or by any other mechanism, that would alter the level of take above the relevant SDL in that basin. There are well-established avenues of redress for people or entities, including the state and territories, who are or who believe themselves to be adversely affected by any administrative decisions, including the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, so there is nothing in the act that detracts in any way from the longstanding protections of the administrative law that the public may seek judicial review of decisions by the courts.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (12:23):  Labor will be supporting the government's amendments because they do provide additional confidence that water proposals which will be put forward by the responsible ministers to the RIC within the Murray-Darling Basin will need to comply with the basin plan. The amendments will also require the RIC board to consult with the basin authority. I'm not surprised that Senator Xenophon talked about ambiguity in this area, because that ambiguity and that concern follows some of the statements made by the Deputy Prime Minister in response to allegations that water is being taken out of the basin: essentially, that there was nothing to see here.


This is another example of why this corporation is different from other, similar entities. The influence of the responsible ministers means that the corporation lacks the proper independence and transparency required for the corporation to work effectively and efficiently. But we, as I have said, will be supporting the government's amendments.

We note in the contributions by the minister and by Senator Xenophon phrases like, 'It's going to ensure that there's no ambiguity,' and, 'It's a belt-and-braces approach, giving certainty and confidence.' Minister, is there actually anything in these amendments that does change things other than as they would already have been underneath the Water Act? What difference will it make to water projects—compared to the Water Act—if this legislation, and this amendment in particular, is passed?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (12:25):  In essence, the answer is nothing, but what we are seeking to do by this is be explicit in the bill so that there can be no doubt whatsoever that the Regional Investment Corporation cannot override the requirements of the Water Act or, specifically in doing so, the full implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-10-18,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:26):  I may take some slight issue with what the minister has said—not a big issue; don't panic, it's okay! I just wanted to say that Senator Rice's question is a very important question. My understanding, from a point of view of statutory interpretation is that where you have two competing acts there sometimes may be some ambiguity. Having this particular amendment removes that ambiguity. I think it's fair to say that what Senator Ruston said is absolutely right—the intent is that the Water Act is at all times adhered to, particularly when it comes to sustainable diversion limits and the like. But, if there could potentially, as a question of law, sometimes be a conflict between the two acts which could be the subject of legal argument, this amendment would remove that issue of legal argument. You've got some esteemed lawyers from the department behind you who know more about administrative law than I ever will—apart from being a plaintiff or defendant in administrative law cases. I suggest to Senator Rice that this amendment is doing some good work. It's not just a symbolic amendment; it actually ensures that there cannot be an argument down the track to say that the Regional Investment Corporation Act takes precedence over the Water Act, which could be a potential argument. That's my jurisprudential lesson for the day. Maybe the lawyers there will disagree with me; I'll try and dig up some case law if they do, so just give me a moment.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (12:27):  And I probably wasn't exactly accurate in my response to you, Senator Rice. The requirement for the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to prejudge an action by the RIC in relation to water infrastructure as having complied with the Water Act is an additional requirement that does not currently exist. So I should correct myself and say, yes, there is an additional level of protection that is added by the requirement to predetermine the compliance with the act.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (12:28):  To clarify, it depends on your definition of 'symbolic', then, as to it giving that extra certainty, but, essentially, other than that additional requirement of compliance, all of the measures that are in this amendment are just repeating things that are in the Water Act.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:28):  My office sought advice from environmental lawyers about this amendment, and it does do useful things around the rights and enforcement of the Water Act. There may well be environmental lawyers who Senator Rice deals with as well, but I think it is a belt-and-braces approach in a meaningful way.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (12:29):  I move opposition amendment (7) on sheet 8225:


(7) Page 23 (after line 10), after clause 41, insert:




41A


Disclosure of interests



(1) The CEO must give written notice to the Board of any disclosure made by the CEO under section 29 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (which deals with the duty to disclose interests).


(2) Subsection (1) applies in addition to any rules made for the purposes of section 29 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013.


(3) For the purposes of this Act and the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013, the CEO is taken not to have complied with section 29 of that Act if the CEO does not comply with subsection (1) of this section.


The government moved its own amendments in the House to address concerns raised in the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report on this bill. The Pastoralists and Graziers Association of WA argued that a board membership of three was too small, arguing that the size of the board and its composition should be similar to that found in private financial organisations in order to cover the range of qualifications.


In addition to the board size amendments, we have seen the government moving further amendments which clearly show the lack of proper consultation in the development of the current bill, and we urge all senators to support our amendments requiring the CEO to disclose any personal or acquired conflicts of interest. This amendment will strengthen the independence and transparency of the corporation.


Minister Ruston earlier made reference to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, claiming that the RIC is established under the same legislative scrutiny as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. If this is true, the government should have undertaken this amendment on their own to ensure that the CEO discloses any personal interest that she or he may have or acquire which would be in conflict with the proper performance of the CEO's duties.


Disclosing any conflicts of interest by the CEO is about transparency to ensure that decisions made by the CEO are made without personal influence or indeed external influence. Ensuring that the CEO discloses any conflicts of interest will reduce the risk of any potential for corruption and/or misconduct. For the minister's information, that is a part of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. We hope that the government will consider this amendment, see that this is an amendment worthy of support and support the amendment before us now.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (12:32):  Thank you, Senator Brown. Firstly, the reason that we are not supporting this particular amendment is that we believe that it's actually counter to the normal operation of disclosure-of-interests requirements under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act and associated rule. It would also remove the responsibility otherwise appropriately allocated to the board.


As you would be aware, the PGPA Act requires officials of Commonwealth entities to disclose any material personal interests that relate to the affairs of the entity, and it also requires and provides for rules to prescribe how and when those interests are to be disclosed. The PGPA Rule provides for the board, as the accountable authority of the entity, to instruct how officials of the corporation, including the CEO, are to disclose the interests.


There were a couple of comments that you made. You made the comment about three not being a sufficient number of people on the board. You'll note from the legislation that it says 'up to five'. It doesn't say three. It's also worth pointing out that the establishment of the CEFC actually preceded the PGPA Act, so it would not have been relevant to make the correlation between the two.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (12:33):  The Greens will be supporting this amendment from the Labor Party and think that having the level of disclosure is an important extra element to be adding to this. Again, given the issues that we've been discussing this morning about how much power is vested in the minister, having elements of transparency and accountability by the board, and particularly with a potentially small board, is really critical. I note the minister saying that the board can be up to five. You may as well say that the board could be up to 11. If you can have a board of only three, that's the minimum. If you've got a board of only three and you don't necessarily have to have the high levels of disclosure that would be required by this amendment, you have serious potential issues of accountability.


The whole way this legislation has been drafted leads us to have really serious concerns about the accountability at the ministerial level and then at the board level. As to the sorts of processes that have occurred—or the lack of process, as we have previously discussed—on significant issues, as to where the corporation is going to be located: it is very clear there was a lack of process. And this goes to the heart of the problems with this whole corporation in the way it is being set up: the lack of transparency, accountability and good governance process in its establishment.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (12:35):  I won't take up too much time, but I rise to support Senator Rice's contribution. We are talking about a corporation that is administering $4 billion. As to suggesting that a minimum of three on the board is sufficient—it isn't. Throughout this bill, we have seen that the good governance isn't there and the level of transparency that we would normally expect to see under similar legislation is not there. We've just had the discussion about the process undertaken around the location of the RIC. Well, there was actually no consultation, and I think it's fair to say that at least we now understand that there is no location. But this is a regional corporation that is administering $4 billion, and this government is suggesting that just having a minimum of three board members is sufficient. As to this amendment that we have before us now, all it's asking is that there be a disclosure of conflict of interest. I understand, and I take on board, what the minister said in response to my first contribution on this amendment. But, given the lack of governance and the lack of transparency, and the fact that it has been very difficult to find any information around this bill coming from the minister or the government, I really believe that, if what the minister says is correct, there should be no issue with the government supporting this amendment.

Senator RUSTON

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:32):  Without going through the answer that I gave to a previous question, the decision about the specifics of the office accommodation are obviously a matter for the RIC board; the decision to locate the RIC in Orange was a decision of government. The decision of government was based on a number of criteria, which I talked about in the answer to a question yesterday: the importance of Orange as an agricultural hub which is well serviced by transport links, particularly from Canberra and Sydney; the opportunities for growth in that area; and the fact that it also meets the existing strong commitment by this government to establish hubs in rural and regional areas of Australia.


In addition to that, obviously we had discussions with other operations in Orange to assure ourselves that this was a suitable place for this corporation to go. Departmental officers, I understand, have met with stakeholders in Orange to discuss the establishment of the RIC in that city, that regional location. The meetings were held with a number of organisations, including the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries, the New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority, the Regional Development Australia Central West division, Paraway Pastoral Company, the Rural Financial Counselling Service New South Wales Central Region, Orange City Council, Orange Business Chamber and the New South Wales Farmers Orange branch.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (09:34):  Yesterday, Minister, you stated that you were not aware of any discussions the minister or his department is having about outsourcing functions of the RIC. At the public hearing of the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation in Bendigo on 9 October 2017, Ms Gartmann, the managing director and CEO of the Bendigo Rural Bank, gave evidence in response to the following questions:


… can you let us know if there's been any consultation with rural finance about the Regional Investment Corporation? Has anyone reached out to you about what's worked and what hasn't worked? Going forward, are you concerned at all about this federal organisation coming in and taking core business?


Ms Gartmann replied:


There certainly has been a large amount and a continuing number of engagements between the Commonwealth agencies and Rural Finance Corporation/Bendigo Bank representatives to discuss what is currently being executed in Victoria in partnership with the Victorian government and to explore areas to strengthen and improve the delivery of the government concessional lending and drought-and-disaster support. That continues to take place. Certainly we're always open to supporting a national approach and collaborating and partnering in whatever model is finalised going forward as of July next year.


As was outlined by Marnie, the balancing act is having some efficiency by coordination from a central, national point as opposed to the current delivery by the states and territories. It is the efficiency gained by having one system as opposed to multiple and balancing that out with an entity that is then further removed from the customer base that it is there to support and serve by having a national entity as opposed to those based in states and across the regions. That balance is yet to be worked out. We've still got a number of months to go before that is supposed to be up and running on 1 July, and we will certainly continue to share the experiences of Rural Finance Corporation with the relevant individuals and agencies to try to create a model that will serve and support all the farmers.


Ms Gartmann went on to say:


The offset accounts. They have traditionally not been available to agricultural businesses. But it is a common practice in residential lending. Legislative changes last year at a federal level were passed and that allowed the farm management deposit offset account to be created, which allows farmers to offset funds held in a farm management deposit account against eligible variable rate term lending, thereby reducing their farm lending costs. Rural Bank is the only bank in market offering that at the moment. But those sorts of legislative changes can demonstrate that it leads to positive business and funding changes for an industry, when done and supported by the private sector.


During a break, Ms Gartmann said that Bendigo Bank/Rural Finance was hoping to be able to tender for RIC work, which would be a front, but Bendigo Bank would continue to do the work. Ms Gartmann said they were in discussions with the department about a tender process.


Now that we know there have been discussions about outsourcing functions of the RIC, can the minister provide detail to the Senate about any other discussions? Is the minister aware that the department is having discussions with agencies that are currently delivering concessional loans? Has any work been undertaken regarding the cost these possible arrangements may incur? Will the RIC be regulated in a similar fashion to other financial banking institutions with regard to receivers, evaluators, lenders and who can provide advice to farm businesses seeking a loan?

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:38):  Thank you, Senator Brown. I will do my very best to answer the myriad of questions that you asked in that one long question. As I said to you yesterday, I wasn't aware of the consultations, but overnight I took it upon myself to avail myself of information relating to the consultation process that has been undertaken to date, particularly in relation to the areas that you were talking about: outsourcing and rural financial counselling services.


I can advise you that, in the period from 9 July to 10 August this year, the department engaged with a number of representatives of the banking sector and current concessional loan delivery agencies to gain a greater understanding of the market as well as the risks and opportunities in the service delivery area. As part of this process, they also met with a number of agencies that relate to the delivery of these financial assets to the community. They included the ANZ, Rural Bank, Rural Finance, Rabobank, Efic, the Commonwealth Bank, the National Bank, the Australian Bankers' Association, the New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority, the Department of State Growth in Tasmania, the Queensland Rural and Industry Development Authority, the Department of Primary Industries and Regions in South Australia and the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development in Western Australia.


In relation to the determination about the specifics of the operation, you asked about outsourcing and the opportunity for existing providers to be able to work as service providers and service delivery providers for the Regional Investment Corporation. Whilst some preliminary discussions have occurred around the broader issues of the delivery of the services of the RIC, the government believes it is appropriate that the details of that are a matter for the RIC board, once it is established, and so the detailed answers to the questions that you have asked are not available at this stage. However, I think it is reasonable to say that the RIC board will be given a level of scope to be able to make sure that they are delivering the services to the farming community of Australia in the most efficient and effective way. If they determine that that is using service providers that are currently in the marketplace, and I am sure they will, then that is obviously a matter of which they are able to avail themselves.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (09:42):  So it is solely a matter for the board. Can I ask then: why have these discussions, to which Ms Scartland in particular has referred been occurring, and why have they been undertaken by the department?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:42):  At the moment, the department is doing a level of preparatory work so that when the board is appointed they have as much information available as possible on which to base their decisions. Of course, the board is entirely entitled to go and seek its own information, or additional information, so I suppose you could just refer to it as somewhat of an incoming brief—so that they have information before them. Obviously, anything that the board may choose to do has to be within the terms of the operating mandate.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (09:43):  Thank you. So—as I asked yesterday—we will possibly see, as Ms Scartland has indicated, that their wish would be that the RIC would be a front and that the Bendigo Bank—if they were successful in any tender—would be running the work of the RIC. She has indicated—just because you look confused, Minister—that they were hoping to be able to tender for RIC work and the RIC would be a front but the Bendigo Bank would continue to do to the work.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:44):  No, I'm not confused. First of all, referring to the RIC as a front, I think, is probably a very misleading way to be describing it. Certainly, the opportunity exists for service providers to be able to provide services to the RIC, like any other outsourcing of service delivery that were to occur within a statutory organisation.


However, as I stated before, the decisions about the operation, particularly about outsourcing and the operation and delivery of the assets of the RIC, are a matter for the incoming RIC board. So, apart from being able to say to you, Senator Brown, that the opportunity exists for outsourcing to occur, it would be entirely inappropriate for me to be giving direction to the RIC board about what they should or should not be outsourcing. Suffice to say, powers and opportunities exist for the RIC to do that under the terms of its operating mandate. I'm not sure I can give you any more information than that.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:45):  The operating mandate is currently being developed. It will be an instrument that will require tabling post the establishment of the organisation. Obviously, the passage of the bill needs to proceed for the finalisation of the mandate, and at that time it will be tabled.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (09:46):  On the issue of the operating mandate, we have grave concerns with this bill because of the power that it gives the minister without parliamentary oversight and, in fact, without cabinet oversight. You have just stated that the operating mandate is in preparation, but is it correct that that operating mandate isn't a disallowable instrument?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (09:47):  So, essentially, you are setting up the Regional Investment Corporation with an operating mandate that has got no parliamentary oversight. It is giving a huge amount of power to the minister to determine exactly what the responsibilities of the RIC will be and the parliament won't be able to actually have any input into that—is that correct?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:47):  Obviously, the operating mandate is the key vehicle where the government will set out its expectations for the corporation. Whilst the express exemption exists for directions from ministers to corporate Commonwealth entities, the bill provides that the operating mandate is a legislative instrument and must be tabled in the parliament. This gives the parliament a level of oversight. Given the nature and the significance of the potential directions, that is fair and reasonable. It is not proposed for it to be a disallowable instrument. We believe that this is appropriate as it deals with matters over which the executive should retain control. As I said to Senator Brown yesterday when we were discussing the structure of this proposed organisation, the set-up of the RIC is almost a direct replica of the way the Clean Energy Finance Corporation was set up and currently operates in this space. Quite clearly, the mandate of the CEFC is required to be tabled in the parliament, but it is not a disallowable instrument.

So we're here in this committee stage to try to get some answers to allow some of that transparency, not only for the senators and the parliament but for those in the community who are very interested in this piece of legislation. So far we haven't really been able to get any answers to be able to alleviate any concerns that the opposition may have. So I ask the minister whether she can elaborate on her answer.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:50):  Thank you, Senator Brown. I did go to this point to some degree yesterday when I was explaining that this entity is required to comply. With its governance and regulation arrangements in relation to the PGPA, it is required to meet those regulations. But, in relation to its lending capacity and the regulations around lending, because we're lending to the states, we obviously have to meet all the regulations that would be expected of loans, particularly things like debt mediation et cetera. They would have to comply with the regulations of the respective states in which the loans are occurring, as well. There is a series of statutory requirements and regulations that exist as they would exist with any other statutory organisation of a similar type. But, equally, the actions in terms of loans for drought and debt financing would be subject to the regulations as they exist in the states.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (09:54):  So you could actually have the RIC decide on a completely new class of loan and that would be purely on the ability of the ministers to decide that that was the case, without cabinet oversight or even parliamentary oversight?

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:54):  We're probably getting to a level of detail regarding the operation of cabinet. Obviously ministers have to operate within the conditions that are placed on them by the cabinet. However, in relation to the rolling out of a new type of loan or a new type of facility, obviously the states would have a say, because we can't roll out a facility in their state without their consent.


There are a number of checks and balances that occur through this process. Whilst you make it sound like the minister just makes a decision, there is a series of processes that are already in place around the governance, operation and accountability of the organisation through which this is being undertaken—the processes that currently exist in relation to the operation of ministers, their requirements and obligations under the cabinet process and through the relationship that the federal government has with state governments through existing arrangements and through the requirement of the government to comply with the regulations and requirements of the states in which these activities are occurring.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (09:58):  Currently we are required to work with the states. Under current arrangements, for any new class of loan that is required to be rolled out, a formal process of consultation with the states is required to occur. One of the underlying reasons for the establishment of this particular organisation and the purposing of it to roll out these loans and any new loans is so that we can have a more streamlined, effective and efficient way of getting the loans. Into the future, it would be through discussions between the ministers and the board, because the ministers are required to consult with the RIC board before any direction is given on, in this instance, a new class of loan. However, in the future, once that direction has been given, following that consultation with the board, the capacity to roll out those loans will not require a formal mechanism. However, obviously, we will continue to consult with the states about the delivery of any assistance to their jurisdictions.

 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:00):  I'm not quite sure what the difference in your question is, but my advice is that there is no formal mechanism that requires us to consult with the states. However, I would say that I presided over the last ag minister's ministerial council and I've been at all ag minister ministerial councils since this particular organisation has been on the table as a proposed method by which to roll out future loans to the states. It has the overwhelming support of the states in its current proposed structure, so the states are quite happy with the way this is progressing.

There is the requirement, however, of the minister to consult with the board, but I just want to clarify that, at the end of the day, the power to decide that a new class of loan or a particular type of loan is going to be rolled out in a particular area rests solely with the ministers.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:03):  Just to let you know, the process through which the water infrastructure loans are administered is a different process. As you might be aware, the process that currently exists, which would continue, requires the state governments to be the ones that actually put forward the proposals in the first place. So it's a completely different process. Obviously, once we've received the applications from the states and they go through a process of evaluation in exactly the same way as they currently go through a process of arm's-length, independent evaluation, the recommendation would go back to the RIC in terms of the funding. At that point, obviously, the RIC board would make the determination in relation to the allocation or otherwise of funding to a particular project. The projects start with the states, so the RIC does not get to preside over the decision-making of the project unless it's already come from the state government.

 (Victoria) (10:04):  Just to clarify: that's for the water infrastructure loans. So the intention is that those water infrastructure loans will still come from the states, they'll go through the process, they'll go to the board and then the ministers have their final say. What's the process, however, for the farm business loans?

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:05):  So, if there was a particular industry in a particular marginal seat that the ministers decided that they wanted to particularly support with a new class of farm business loans, it would be entirely at the power of the ministers to do that. There would not necessarily be cabinet oversight, let alone parliamentary oversight.

 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:08):  The usual government processes are required and will be enforceable on the operation of this instrumentality in the same way as they would be enforceable on any other instrumentality, particularly in relation to the water infrastructure loans. The role of the RIC is to, obviously, assess and provide the expert advice to the responsible ministers on the projects that are being considered. The final decision on the water infrastructure loans is ultimately made by the government and then, on direction from the ministers, the corporation will enter into the administrative approvals process that is required to enter into the agreements for the loans with the states and territories.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:09):  Yes, in the sense that, ultimately, the final decision rests there, but there is a process that is defined that has to occur prior to that decision being made. Obviously that requires, first of all, that the project has come forward with the authority, consent and request of the state or territory in which the piece of infrastructure is to be constructed. The corporation then has to go through a rigorous process of assessment and make that recommendation. That process is obviously transparent, in the sense that we know what the process is. Then, after recommendation, the ministers have the final decision in relation to those loans. It's also worth noting, Senator Brown, that that is the current process. There will be a greater level of transparency and an arms-length operation in assessment of these loans under the new facility than there currently is.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:11):  Senator Brown, as I said, there is no greater level of capacity to be able to make decisions without due process under this organisation than there is under any other organisation. There is an established process under which these projects have to be assessed. I hark back to my point that the minister can only make a determination on a project that has been put forward by a state or territory government. So, within the operating mandate of the corporation and within the advice, there are a whole heap of things that the minister is required to do before making a determination in relation to a project. But you are quite right: this is a matter for government and cabinet, and the government has the ultimate power in this to make a determination in relation to a project that has been recommended.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:12):  Minister, you state that the government has the power, but, again, it is the two ministers who have the power. It doesn't even have to go through the rest of cabinet. It doesn't have parliamentary oversight. You also said that it's set out in the operating mandate, but the operating mandate can be changed by the two ministers without parliamentary oversight. These are our concerns about the governance of this project and resting far too much power in those ministers.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:12):  Senator Rice, obviously, unfortunately, I can't ask you a question, but I wonder why we seem to think that the governance arrangements, the scrutiny, the oversight, the notification processes and everything that sits around the Clean Energy Finance Corporation are at an appropriate level to enable that operation to work—and consider the kind of money that's associated with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation—yet for some reason you have a concern that exactly the same operational requirements for this particular organisation are somewhat lacking. Obviously, as I said, I can't ask you a question, but I draw to the attention of the house that they are exactly the same operating requirements. The operating mandate of the CEFC is not a disallowable instrument. I just draw the parliament's attention to that.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:14):  Thank you for that clarification, Mr Temporary Chair. Are there any projects currently in the pipeline that may come through the RIC in terms of the discussions that have been had with states and territories?

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:14):  In relation to the water infrastructure facility, obviously, the projects that were approved under the last round are a matter of public knowledge, so you'd be well aware of those. In relation to the loan facilities and products, they are currently in discussion with the states. But, obviously, because the corporation has not yet been established, there have been no decisions in relation to that. I do know, though, from discussions with the states in relation to the transition between the existing situation and the new operation of the RIC, should it be passed, that there are already very detailed discussions in place about how you can seamlessly transition across so that the farmer—or anybody who is in need of the products currently available under the existing situation would be made available under the RIC—aren't inconvenienced in any way.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:15):  I would like to, again, clarify the questions around the operating mandate. You said that the states and territories do not have to sign off on an operating mandate, but are they being consulted? Also, which other stakeholders are being consulted in terms of the operating mandate?

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:16):  The states are being widely consulted on the products that will be made available as opposed to specifically being consulted on the operating mandate. But, obviously, part of that consultation and the feedback they'll get from that will form part of the basis of the decision the government makes on the operating mandate. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:16):  My question actually went to other stakeholders as well. I'm assuming from your answer that you are stating that the states and territories are being consulted on the operating mandate, because you just talked about products. Could you clarify that? 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:17):  Maybe I wasn't clear. The government is consulting a wide range of stakeholders, including state governments, on the products as opposed to specifically consulting them on the operating mandate. The answer to the question specifically is that we are not explicitly consulting on the operating mandate; we are explicitly consulting about the products that will be offered.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:17):  We got there. That wasn't too hard! So you are not consulting with the states and territories, and, I assume, from your response that means that you are actually not consulting with stakeholders.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:18):  I want to clarify whether you're specifically consulting with other stakeholders on the operating mandate. There has been a lot of uncertainty about what will or won't be included in the operating mandate and there has been some disappointment, thus far, as to whether there will be consultation. We are finding it very difficult to even get an answer to that very simple question. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:18):  First of all, a point of clarification on the opening remarks at the start of that question by Senator Brown. You said that we were not consulting. I quite clearly said that we were consulting. I said we weren't consulting specifically on the operating mandate—just to be very clear about that. The bill sets out what can be included in the operating mandate: the objectives to pursue in administering farm loans and the national water infrastructure facility; the government's expectations in relation to the strategies and policies to be followed by the corporation; the eligibility criteria for those loans; and the management of funding in other matters. These will all be outlined in the operating mandate. As I said, it is currently in the process of development. It will not be finalised until after the passage of the bill. However, after the passage of the bill, it will be tabled in the parliament, but not as a disallowable instrument. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:19):  Minister, in terms of the ability for the ministers to have discretion: in this case you were wanting to ask me a question about why we are happy with the CEFC. My understanding is that the CEFC, in fact, has much stricter requirements on the types of investment included in the legislation for the CEFC. However, here we have the ability for the RIC to undertake entirely new classes of loans without parliamentary oversight. So I'd ask the question: why is it seen to be appropriate for those entirely new classes of loans to be able to be at the discretion of ministers in this instance, whereas under the CEFC legislation it was actually included? There were quite strict parameters on what types of investment it could make, and these were included in the CEFC legislation.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:21):  Whilst there is a discretion for new product, these are still farm business loans, and the definition of 'farm business loan' is contained in the legislation. There is already a level of definition in the legislation, so I'm not quite sure why you would be suggesting that there isn't.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:21):  The definition of 'farm business loan' is extremely broad, and, going back to my previous point, the ministers, without parliamentary oversight—without even cabinet oversight—could decide to create a whole new type of farm business loan that is particularly suited to a particular farming type in an area of a marginal seat that happens to be beneficial for those ministers or for that particular party.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:22):  Just to be very clear, a 'farm business loan' means:


… a loan made, or proposed to be made, to a farm business:


(a) engaged solely or mainly in producing commodities for constitutional trade or commerce; or


(b) for the purpose of encouraging or promoting constitutional trade or commerce; …


So it's quite clear that a farm business loan requires the entity for which the loan is being made available to be engaged solely or mainly in the production of commodities for constitutional trade or commerce. That's quite clearly the definition there. But, in regard to your point, the minister is still required to take the expert advice of the corporation in relation to the development of any new products. So there is a level of expert advice that is necessarily provided to the ministers prior to their making any decision.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:23):  Under section 12, the minister must seek the board's advice. That's what the legislation says. It doesn't say that the minister, for other reasons, could decide that he or she is going to override or modify or make a determination that isn't completely consistent with the board's advice. It is within the ability of the ministers to make that decision.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:24):  Senator Brown, the level of detail that you're suggesting needs to be included in the bill is probably something that would not normally be included. I'm talking about a class of licence of a loan. The classification of the loan and the eligibility to receive a loan is in the legislation. We're currently out consulting particularly and specifically about the eligibility criteria for those loans. That is one area of consultation that is a very high priority at the moment. We are consulting with not only the farming industry but also the banking sector and the states and territories to make sure that the eligibility criteria of the loan are fit for purpose and will result in the efficient and effective delivery of assistance to our farming community. I'm just wondering why you would think that would need to be included in the bill.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:25):  There is concern about this particular area because, as you have said, the minister cannot make directives with regard to particular loans under the farm loan program but they can make directions with regard to class of such loans. I don't think that it's unreasonable that you here are able to define for us what 'class' means in this bill. Essentially, with the minister being able to make directives with regard to particular loans, he's absolutely got the power to issue directives that concern arbitrarily tightening defined classes of loan. I don't think it's unreasonable for the chamber to be advised by government what 'class' means in this bill.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:27):  I'm not sure that was entirely helpful, because we could see all types of loans being created by the minister in terms of his directions—construction loans? I think it's absolutely important that the government is able to define what it means and the parameters around what the term 'class' means in this bill.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:27):  Obviously, as we've stated before, the loans must be farm business loans. The legislation requires us to meet the criteria of what a farm business loan is before eligibility kicks in. But, just as an example of a class of loan, the dairy recovery loan package would be considered a class of loan. There is debt recovery. That's what a class of loan would be, as defined, under this.

I hope you are able to obtain the information, given it is a government body—the Productivity Commission—that has raised concerns about the constitutionality of the approach that the government has taken with this bill. There is really no excuse for not having that information available, given you are responding to concerns that were raised by an organisation that is funded—you may want to turn to your left, Minister; I think someone is trying to assist. Further to that, whilst you gave an assurance that you had received constitutional advice, you were unprepared or unwilling to table that advice in accordance with regular government practice. Can you assure this chamber that the advice received on the date you don't know by the organisation that you don't know was, in fact, validating the approach that the government has taken in light of the Productivity Commission's concerns?

I am not surprised, because your new approach hadn't been presented when the Productivity Commission was talking about the constitutionality of the government directly funding loans to farms instead of via the states—if I am right, because I think it was some time in 2012 or thereabouts. I just want to make this clear. You have constitutional advice about concerns that you say are not applicable because, when they were raised, they were not relevant to this current thing. It is like torture; a spaghetti jumble—what happened and how and when it came about. I just want to make sure that the government is 100 per cent confident that what they are doing is compliant with the Constitution, even though I am getting mixed messages with respect to this.

 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:32):  Perhaps as a point of clarification and so I can be absolutely clear that we are speaking of the same words: my understanding is that the comments from the Productivity Commission in relation to the constitutionality of the loans were related to the existing method by which loans are administered by the federal government. You were asking a question about the advice received by government in relation to the constitutionality of the current operation of the loans program. I responded by saying we had received advice from the Australian Government Solicitor in relation to that. In relation to the constitutionality, you asked me a question about whether we had advice about the constitutionality of the proposed new methods by which loans are administered should the RIC be passed.

I raised concerns, in my speech in the second reading debate, about the direct funding of loans to farmers by government. They were based on the report of the Productivity Commission in looking at alternative ways to deal with the issue. Now, yes, they might not be relevant directly to this bill, but this bill does, in effect, provide the Commonwealth with the facility to provide loans directly to farmers. I am concerned—I don't want to conflate the two issues—but it is about the constitutionality of the approach the government is taking. I am not trying to be tricky. I don't think you are trying to be tricky, but I just want a clear answer. You've had advice in respect of this bill from the Government Solicitor, which is what you mentioned before. I would like to know when advice was received that it is entirely within the constitutional purview of the government to proceed with this approach.

The loan scheme was designed taking into account a large range of factors, including the Commonwealth's constitutional powers to do this. The legal advice that was taken throughout the process was obviously an iterative approach to receiving advice; it wasn't just one piece of advice received at one point in time. So yes, the government has received legal advice. It received legal advice throughout the whole process in relation to the loan scheme that is being currently designed and the decisions in relation to how that is going to work included the constitutional power for the Commonwealth to be able to undertake and deliver the loans under the proposed method.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:36):  Minister, going back to the farm loans and the classes of loans, I am just wanting more clarification about what potentially could constitute a class of loans. Do you envisage that a class of loans could be restricted geographically, for example, to a state? Could it be a class of loans to a particular agricultural industry in a particular state?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:36):  Possibly, Senator. The underlying reason for this particular package is the ability for governments to be much more responsive to the needs of our farming community. As you would be aware, having a keen interest in the farm sector, farming takes many and varied forms. In that case, we can have localised distress occur because a particular area is impacted by a localised or regionalised event or activity. Equally, a single industry can be impacted across the whole country, which means that there is a little bit of the industry through many jurisdictions. A classic example of that more recently has been the situation that occurred with the crisis in the dairy industry; probably no state felt it more keenly than the state which you represent as a senator. So the ability for the classes of loans to be immediately responsive and reactive to situations that we find our farming communities getting themselves into or being impacted by without much notice is important. So the answer to your question is yes. The loan classes are, in effect, designed so that they can be quickly responsive to situations to assist our farmers as quickly, effectively and efficiently as possible.

 (Victoria) (10:38):  Can I also clarify, Minister, that for these particular classes of loans there isn't a hardship requirement as to what would make a particular agricultural industry eligible to receive these loans?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:38):  Senator Rice, obviously, the criteria of the particular loans will determine the eligibility criteria for access to these particular loans. As I said earlier to Senator Brown, there is quite an extensive consultation going on at the moment in terms of developing the criteria both in the operating mandate in the broader terms of eligibility, which is the consultation that is currently being undertaken, and also in relation to any direction that comes from the minister. Obviously, the criteria under which accessibility of the particular loan would be available would be determined. In terms of the operating mandate, it is an instrument to be tabled in the parliament.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:39):  But there's nothing in the legislation—which is where we as the parliament have the ability to say this is appropriate or not—that would constrain what could be in those classes of loans. So we could have a class of loan, for example, where suddenly there is money available to the wine industry in South Australia just before a South Australian election, or suddenly there is a class of loans available to the dairy industry in northern Tasmania just before a Tasmanian election or a federal election, or suddenly, just before a New South Wales election, there is a class of loans for plantation forestry in northern New South Wales, and there would be no parliamentary oversight over these types of loans. It is up to the operating mandate, which is not a disallowable instrument. It's up to the ministers to decide in their judgement, and just the ministers, not even going to the cabinet. It's going to be up them, with executive power to decide that there's suddenly government largesse that would be available to a particular industry in a particular state. This is why we have grave concerns about this legislation. It is setting up a slush fund to be able to be used by the government of the day.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:40):  Senator Rice, I will have to agree to disagree with the intonation of your response. The eligibility criteria for loans and financial assistance are matters over which the executive arm of government currently has control, and it's the opinion and belief of government that it should retain control. The potential impact on the budget is quite considerable, and obviously the executive of government has a responsibility for budgetary control. Therefore, we absolutely believe that it's appropriate that this remains in the control of executive government.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:41):  That doesn't give me any satisfaction at all. We have just found through the High Court case on equal marriage that there is a $295 million line in the budget each year that we understood was for urgent and unforeseen circumstances but that the High Court has now found is basically there as a fund for whatever the government of the day wants to fund. So you have that ability to essentially hand out loans to suit the political purposes of the government without the parliamentary oversight that would be appropriate in such a scheme. We haven't got a problem with having loans schemes. There should be much stricter controls included in the legislation, not leaving so much power in the hands of the ministers.

What we're proposing here is a greater level of transparency and notification in relation to those guidelines. Obviously, the agriculture and finance ministers are required to agree to those guidelines.


I also have a point of clarification on a previous question—I am not sure if it came from you or Senator Brown. Existing loans require a hardship element, and the board will be required to comply with that existing requirement.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:45):  Senator Rice, at the risk of repeating myself for the 14th time, the current situation, which everyone seems to be quite satisfied with, allows the executive of government to undertake and make these decisions in relation to this particular suite of products that are in the marketplace. These products have a very specific role to play, and that is to assist our farming community when situations of hardship affect them—most often not of their own making.


Currently, we have a suite of products. Definitely, after the consultation and discussions that I have had in my role as the assistant minister, and also through my role as someone who's lived in rural and regional Australia for many years, the ability for responsiveness in these loans is something that's been criticised for some time. We have a situation right now where we are providing this assistance to communities across the whole of rural and regional Australia. We're seeking to do so by a mechanism that is now going to enable it to be more streamlined and more responsive, and which is actually going to provide a better service to those people who are affected.


To have a situation as you're proposing, where we have some sort of extraordinarily high level of parliamentary power to be able to come in and make decisions in relation to stuff—decisions that have in the past always been made by the executive arm of government, for the reasons that I stated previously—is, first of all, an extraordinary precedent to set. But think about the farmers who wish to be able to get access—very often with some level of speed. You're suggesting here that it's appropriate for us to have this extraordinarily increased level of intervention by this very parliament. That is something that is quite unprecedented in the level of intervention that you are proposing by suggesting that every single thing has to come here to somehow get ticked off by you.

Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:47):  It's not a situation where every single thing has to be ticked off by us. It's just making things like the operating mandate a disallowable instrument so that there is parliamentary oversight on the classes of loans. Just like in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Act, it will specify in the legislation what the types of loans can be. It is having that high level of parliamentary oversight, as is reflected in the proposed amendments by the Labor Party, which the Greens will be supporting.

 (Tasmania) (10:47):  I just want to go back to Senator Bernardi's point about the constitutionality and the powers that have been drawn on, because I am concerned about the risks associated with this. I just want to read from the Bills Digest, where it indicates:


Setting aside the reference to the Desertification Convention, the suite of constitutional powers drawn on for the Bill is the same as that which the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources previously advised the ANAO would not provide broad support for a Commonwealth program of direct assistance to farming businesses through the provision of concessional loans.


I would like to know, Minister, whether the government has assessed any risks in terms of the advice that has been provided.

Why is it considered appropriate to have that level of detail in the legislation where the minister can say to the board, 'This is where your corporation is going to be located,' and yet requirements such as a hardship provision or the fact that you won't be able to target particular regional areas without a hardship provision aren't included in the legislation?

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (10:52):  by leave—I move opposition amendments (1), (3), (4) and (6) on sheet 8225 together:


(1) Clause 11, page 10 (lines 6 to 9), omit the note, substitute:


Note: Part 4 of Chapter 3 (sunsetting) of the Legislation Act 2003 does not apply to the directions (see regulations made for the purposes of paragraph 54(2) (b) of that Act).


(3) Clause 11, page 10 (after line 31), at the end of the clause, add:


   (4) Section 42 (Disallowance of legislative instruments) of the Legislation Act 2003 applies to a direction made by the responsible Ministers under subsection (1).




Rules



   (5) The rules must prescribe, in relation to loans or financial assistance to be provided by the Corporation, the eligibility criteria for those loans or that assistance.


(4) Clause 12, page 11 (after line 15), after subclause (3), insert:


   (3A) For the purposes of subsection (3), any terms and conditions to be included in an agreement must be in accordance with the rules.


(6) Clause 12, page 11 (after line 21), at the end of the clause, add:




Ministerial directions—water infrastructure projects



   (6) A direction made by the responsible Ministers under subsection (3) is a notifiable instrument.


   (7) Section 38 (Tabling of legislation instruments) of the Legislation Act 2003 applies to the direction as if the direction were a legislative instrument.


   (8) The Minister must cause a copy of the direction to be published on the internet within 30 days after it is issued by the Minister.




Agreements—water infrastructure projects



   (9) The Corporation must give the Agriculture Minister a copy of an agreement entered into under subsection (3).


   (10) The Minister must cause a copy of the agreement to be tabled in each House of Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after its receipt by the Minister.


   (11) The Minister must cause a copy of the agreement to be published on the internet within 30 days after its receipt by the Minister.




Rules



   (12) The rules must prescribe, in relation to agreements to be entered into under subsection (3):


(a) the terms and conditions, or the kinds of terms and conditions, that may be included in an agreement; and


(b) the matters the Corporation must consider in specifying terms and conditions to be included in an agreement.


These amendments seek to strengthen the current bill. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee report found that the current bill lacked the appropriate high-level guidance as to the types of terms and conditions that states and territories will be required to comply with in order to receive payment of financial assistance for water infrastructure projects. Throughout the committee stage thus far, I haven't received any comfort from the minister's responses to the questions that have been asked. Regarding the water and infrastructure projects, this includes a legislative requirement that any directions made by the responsible ministers under subclause 12(3) and any agreements with the states and territories about these grants of financial assistance are tabled in the parliament within 15 sitting days after being made and published on the internet within 30 days after being made.


The scrutiny committee also expressed concerns about the bill exemption from disallowance and sunsetting. Minister Ruston has claimed that the normal parliamentary oversight and scrutiny will exist with regard to the corporation. However, while the bill provides for the operating mandate to be treated as a legislative instrument and will require it to be tabled, it will not be subject to disallowance and sunsetting. 


The minister has sought to reassure the Senate chamber that any directions the corporation receives from the responsible ministers will be published in its annual reports. The government is claiming that this requirement will ensure that there will be appropriate transparency of ministerial directions to the corporation. Non-disallowable instruments do not allow for the proper oversight and parliamentary scrutiny of ministerial directions. Labor's amendments seek to strengthen the proper oversight and parliamentary scrutiny for directions made by the minister.


Minister Ruston also questioned whether Labor had concerns about entities similar to the RIC. This would be a fair question if those entities were indeed established under the exact same legislation that the RIC is to be established under. 


We know that there are aspects of this bill that are unique in nature, and this is most likely due to the fact that Minister Joyce is the architect of the bill. It is lacking in detail, and we have seen a number of amendments put forward in an attempt to strengthen the bill. Labor urges all senators to support Labor's amendments to ensure that there is proper parliamentary oversight and scrutiny of the corporation.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (10:56):  The government will not be supporting the Labor Party's amendments (1), (3), (4) and (6). The reasons for this have been largely canvassed in the previous discussions prior to the moving of these amendments. In effect, the government believe that the operating mandate should not be a disallowable instrument, as it deals with matters over which the executive arm of government should retain control. We believe that the approach in the bill gives the parliament the right level of oversight of the operating mandate, given the nature and significance of that direction to the entity. Firstly, the bill requires and provides for the mandate to be a legislative instrument, which requires it to be tabled. The approach has been taken despite the express exemption that exists for directions of ministers to corporate Commonwealth entities. We have required that to be included. We believe the government is being open and transparent and, in this instance, going beyond the minimum requirements. As I said before, this approach is not unusual, and I have cited the CEFC as an instrumentality in which the operating mandate is not a disallowable instrument. 


In relation to amendment (3)—that the terms and conditions of water agreements be prescribed in rules and be disallowable—we believe it is inappropriate, as these, once again, are matters over which the government should have control. We believe it would also reduce the Commonwealth's flexibility when negotiating with the states and territories and could be confusing for the corporation in terms of compliance. We believe the parliament has the appropriate level of visibility of these grants for financial assistance and for water infrastructure projects, and this will be achieved through the tabling of the operating mandate and the contents thereof, as well as through the reporting requirements for corporate Commonwealth entities under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (10:59):  The Greens will be supporting these opposition amendments, which attempt to give the required parliamentary oversight that is essential and currently not included in this legislation. This legislation gives far too much power to, and concentrates that power in the hands of, the ministers. The minister talked about using the example of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation legislation. If you read the CEFC legislation, it sets out explicitly—there is clause after clause after clause—the restrictions on what money can be lent and what types of infrastructure are eligible for funding under the CEFC and what is not. That level of detail is completely lacking in this legislation.


So the Labor amendments, if passed, would give that extra level of parliamentary oversight that is necessary. Alternatively, I think you'd have to go back to the drawing board and set out in much greater detail what it's appropriate for these levels of loans to be spent on. The fact that there is nothing regarding hardship requirements included in the legislation and that there is no definition of what a class of farm business loans is means it is open slather for the ministers to be able to make decisions on their own. The powers for them to direct the board are really setting up a very undemocratic and unaccountable institution. These Labor amendments, which we are supportive of, go some way to having a level of parliamentary oversight that is absolutely required.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (11:01):  As I've said previously, we believe that the level of control, governance and oversight that is contained in the proposal that is before us is appropriate for the actions and the operations of the instrumentality. We believe there are roles for executive government, there are roles for this parliament and obviously there are roles that will be delegated to the board of the organisation. I particularly reiterate that this entity is required to have the reporting obligations of the corporation exist under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act. These obligations require that a corporate plan be prepared and published on the corporation's website. The corporation must also prepare annual reports to be tabled in parliament by the responsible ministers. The corporation's annual reports must include a statement of performance which sets out the results, measurements and assessment identified in the entity's corporate plan, and the annual reports also need to detail any directions issued by the responsible ministers.


So I would just reiterate that there are a number of existing requirements that are set out by normal government procedure that will apply to this organisation, not the least of which is the PGPA Act. Also, as we've mentioned before, the Senate has appropriate levels of scrutiny in relation to the Senate estimates process, through which you have the capacity to prosecute any of the issues that you are raising.



The CHAIR:  The question is that the amendments as moved by Senator Brown on sheet 8225, being amendments (1), (3), (4) and (6), be agreed to.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (11:09):  I  move opposition amendment (2) on sheet 8225:


(2) Clause 11, page 10 (line 21), paragraph 11(2) (c) to be opposed.


This amendment will remove the ministers' influence on directing the corporation about the eligibility criteria for loans and financial assistance. The independence of the corporation is critical when establishing the eligibility criteria for loans or financial assistance. The lack of detail about what loans and financial assistance will be provided by the corporation is concerning when we know that the current concessional loans take into consideration the viability of the farm enterprise. To ensure that the corporation is able to manage its lending criteria, the responsible ministers should not be able to give directions about eligibility criteria for loans or financial assistance.


Labor strongly urges senators to support the amendment to strengthen the independence of the corporation. Once again, I make reference to Minister Ruston, who compared the RIC to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. These two corporations are different in their objectives, and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is independent in its own right, as opposed to the RIC, which is beholden to the ministers of the day.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (11:12):  In relation to the proposed amendment (2) from the Labor Party, which would have the eligibility criteria for loans or financial assistance prescribed in rules which are disallowable instruments, the government believes this is an inappropriate mechanism through which to provide for the eligibility criteria for loans. We believe they are matters over which the executive arm of government should retain control as they have the potential to impact on the Commonwealth budget. We, therefore, believe it's appropriate that they are provided for in the bill as directions to the entity rather than as rules. We also believe that it's appropriate that they are not disallowable.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (11:20):  I now move opposition amendment (5):


(5) Clause 12, page 11 (lines 20 and 21), omit ""responsible Ministers may give a written direction to the Corporation about"", substitute ""rules must provide for"".


This amendment removes the minister's being able to direct where the corporation must be located. Instead, the rules must provide for where the corporation is to be located.


Minister Ruston earlier referenced the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and made an implication that there is no difference between how that corporation was established and how the RIC is established. Minister Ruston should familiarise herself with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Act. It certainly does not have a clause whereby the responsible minister can direct where the corporation is to be located.


To ensure the proper, efficient and effective performance of the corporation, the board should be allowed to make decisions as to where best the corporation will function. Minister Ruston has provided no detailed information about what process was undertaken to determine that Orange is the best location for the corporation and whether any other regional centre was considered before Orange was selected. Concerns have been raised by stakeholders that the location of the RIC has been unilaterally decided without any apparent economic analysis or even a discussion with the agricultural industry stakeholders, and this in turn has highlighted another dimension of the non-commercial nature of the corporation.


The location of the corporation should not be decided by the minister of the day. The location should be decided on the grounds of where it can best do its job, and this decision should be made by the board of the RIC.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (11:22):  Firstly, can I just put on the record that I'm not entirely sure that I ever said that the CEFC was told where it was to be located.


The Australian government, as I have said time and time again, has a very strong commitment to rural and regional Australia. Our decentralisation policy will certainly be supported by the corporation being located in Orange, New South Wales. Orange is an extraordinarily important agricultural hub, and we believe that this is an appropriate place for the RIC to be located. Meetings have been held with a number of entities, which I have previously put on the public record as part of this debate, which were consulted about the operational arrangements of the organisation, so there certainly has been consultation.


In essence, this is absolutely consistent with our current policy. It's in line with the exemptions under the Legislation (Exemptions and Other Matters) Regulation that a direction is not a legislative instrument and therefore is not disallowable. This approach also provides certainty to the board about where the corporation will be located and will allow it to have focus on having the corporation fully operational by July 2018.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (11:24):  The Greens will be supporting this amendment from Labor. The fact that the board is being directed to establish its headquarters in Orange underlines the whole rationale behind so much of this legislation. It is giving power without any assessment process, without any objective process. It gives the minister the power to direct the board, quite inappropriately.


Orange may well be the best place for the headquarters of such a corporation, but we don't know. There is no process that's been undertaken to determine that, just like with the APVMA, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. Suddenly Minister Joyce plucked Armidale out of the air and said, 'It's going to be there,' with no justification. We saw in the cost-benefit analysis that was done that in fact there was a negative benefit in establishing the headquarters of the APVMA in Armidale.


Here we've got a similar situation. It is blatant pork-barrelling. That's all it is. Without parliamentary oversight and without any process, we have a situation of putting far too much power in the hands of the executive. This might be the way the government wants to do business, but it is not good governance. It is not good, transparent, accountable, evidence-based legislation and governing. Supporting this amendment, at least, is one tiny thing that would improve this legislation. The fact that the government is opposing this amendment bells the cat. It shows so much of what the purpose of this legislation is based on.

But what you've said flies in stark contrast to what Senator Rice has been saying—which has resonated with me, quite frankly—which is that there is no real, formal approval process. The board can make some suggestions which the minister can ignore and establish new classes of grants and dispense them wherever they like. For example, they could, in the interests of equality, not only give them to Armidale and Orange but they might slot it into Renmark for no particular reason—maybe to support the good work of a senator down there, or something like that. It doesn't seem as if there is any rationale or criteria attached to where these grants can go apart from the whims of the minister at the time.


Now, we may have confidence in the minister—some may not, currently—but no-one knows who is going to be the minister next. To place such discretion in the hands of any one individual without the checks and balances that accrue from the parliament—and I do note that the government has voted against the disallowance of these grants, these potential boondoggles, these potential whiteboard/sports rorts, to coin a term; these could be ag rorts in a future life. These are normal checks and balances that accompany the responsibilities and roles of government.


Further, how does something like this get through the cabinet without these checks and balances? I know you are not in cabinet, Minister. I think you've been given a hospital pass here in some respects, and I'm sorry for that, but, in effect, this doesn't seem even to have gone through the normal cursory examinations and consultation attached to cabinet probity. It just seems as if it's been cooked up on the whim of one or two individuals in order to give them some discretion to prop up political threats, and that really concerns me. I don't think it's the right approach. It overturns the principles of federation. As I said, it overturns some of the concerns raised on the constitutionality by the Productivity Commission. It overturns the expectation of appropriate consultation and examination by the parliament and the ability to say, 'This is absolutely wrong.' It has all the hallmarks of a scheme that is going to be rorted. It may be well intended, but these are serious concerns. Minister, whilst you have assured us of these probities, I still haven't heard an effective response to Senator Rice's concerns that, in effect, this is just a bag of money that is at ministerial discretion to throw out wherever they like.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (11:31):  There are a number of points that I'll try and clarify from the comments that you have just made. First of all, to put this on the record: Orange has a series of quite unique characteristics that make it a particularly ideal location in terms of creating a critical mass of infrastructure in relation to agriculture in a regional community. I'm assuming you are not suggesting for a minute that we shouldn't be decentralising and giving support to the regional communities around Australia, including the one in which I live. But, at the moment, Paraway Pastoral, the New South Wales RIA, the New South Wales DPI and NAB Business Banking all have their headquarters in Orange. The creation of a regional centre of excellence in Orange is something that the government believes is a very worthy and worthwhile application of its activities.


There were a number of reasons why Orange was identified as being an entirely suitable location for the RIC to go to. It's also worth pointing out that all the way through here we have interspersed the word 'loans' with the word 'grants'. I'd like to put on the record and make sure it is very clear that we are referring to loans and not grants.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (11:33):  I would just like to follow on from Senator Bernardi's contribution because the minister in her response made it no clearer to the chamber what the process was that was undertaken to determine Orange as the location for the RIC. There was no indication of whether there were any other locations—and there are many locations around Australia that have vibrant farming communities. Unless the minister can tell us now what the process was and what, if any, other locations were considered, the only thing that we in this chamber can safely assume is that this is about pork-barrelling by Mr Joyce and a political fix for the National Party. That is the only conclusion that we can come to, because the minister has failed to tell this chamber exactly what the process was.


We've seen this all before under Mr Joyce. We saw it with the siting of the APVMA in Armidale, and that has not gone well. We've seen expert people leave that organisation. We have seen the backlog of work that hasn't been able to be undertaken because of the concern and uncertainty that Mr Joyce has caused. So it is vital in this committee stage that the minister tells this chamber quite clearly what process was undertaken to select Orange as the location for the commission.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (11:35):  There are two things here. One is that I think we need to be very careful that you don't make a quantum leap of faith to suggest that the decision of the government to pursue its decentralisation targets and policy to move a number of agencies out of capital cities and into regional communities, where they're closer to the people that they represent, has been the cause of what has been a long-term systemic underperformance of the APVMA. I think we just need to be very careful that you don't accuse something of being the cause of something that it actually wasn't.


However, I don't know how many times I have to reiterate every single indicator as to why Orange would be a very suitable place for the location of this important agricultural institution. Yesterday afternoon, I think, I made the point that it is a decision of government. The government has exercised its right in making that decision, but in doing so it has provided, ad nauseam, a number of different reasons why it believes Orange is an extraordinarily suitable place for this organisation. As a rural and regional member of this parliament, I can assure you that I could go and speak to every one of my colleagues and they would all have somewhere in their electorates where they would like to have a government agency located. However, in doing so, everybody still has to demonstrate that it is a suitable place and an appropriate place and that there are strong reasons for the location of any government instrumentality in any area, rural or metropolitan. Quite clearly, Orange has a whole heap of factors and a whole heap of attributes that are attractive for the location of this instrumentality. I can go through them all again with you, but, in the interests of time, I will allow you to re-read Hansard to be informed of them.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (11:37):  Thank you, Minister. I find this very interesting and very enlightening because, essentially, you've said that there are a number of criteria from which the government has chosen this location, and you've put that on the record. Surely, Orange was not the only candidate. So my question, which builds upon Senator Brown's question, is: how many local council areas were approached about their interest in having the RIC housed within their regions? How many different centres were considered in the shortlist by government? On what criteria, specifically, that weren't demonstrable in other candidates was Orange chosen as the final location?

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (11:38):  There were no other locations in Australia where currently a state department of agriculture and primary industries is located in a regional area. In the case of New South Wales, the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries and the New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority are located already in Orange. The existence of infrastructure in the area makes Orange quite unique.


I can run through all the other reasons why Orange is particularly unique for this particular instrumentality, such as its proximity to both Canberra and Sydney, making it very easy to access, and the existence of a broad range of other organisations that are already there to create a centre of excellence and critical mass in the area. And, as you would know, from your previous experience of belonging to the same party that I do, we quite clearly as a government are trying to establish centres of excellence in our regional areas, so that we can create the economic activity that drives our regional economies because, at the risk of sounding parochially regional, it is our regional communities that drive the economy of this country.

It wasn't an objective process that the department undertook that ended up going through some criteria and saying, 'Yes, after considering all of these criteria—on objective, transparent criteria—Orange came out on top.' It was a political decision made by the minister to establish this corporation in Orange because it suited his political purposes, because it is where the shooters and fishers are threatening to hold the seat which the Nationals lost to the shooters and fishers. It is pure, blatant pork-barrelling. You have not outlined that there was any process at all that was objective, that was transparent or that came through the department. It was a political decision by Minister Joyce, who has got form in making these types of political decisions.

Those criteria obviously have been considered by government as meeting the objectives and the requirements of the location of this organisation better than a number of other locations that were considered, as I've pointed out, not exclusively but including the locations that I read out in response to the question that I received from Senator Bernardi. I can go through all of the reasons why Orange was considered to be the preferred location and why it was chosen as the location for the Regional Investment Corporation.

Can you outline how each of the other locations that were on the shortlist, such as Bathurst and Albury-Wodonga, compared with Orange. What was the assessment process that was undertaken? Can details of that assessment process be tabled so that there is some transparency and so that we can see, on the basis of these criteria, that Orange came out on top, because unless you can do that everything points to this just being a pure and simple pork-barrelling slush fund exercise of getting a government department in Orange to suit the National Party in these circumstances.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (11:46):  I suppose the one underlying factor that differentiates Orange from the other places that were identified in the list I just gave is that the New South Wales department of agriculture is already located in Orange, and, given the other departments and institutions that are located in Orange, it was considered that there was already a significant hub of existing activity that the RIC would be able to support in creating the centre of excellence in Orange.


It is probably also worth pointing out that a number of the other locations that were considered have had agencies of the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources relocated there as part of the government's overall decentralisation program, including the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation, the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation and the Grains Research and Development Corporation. There have been a number of agencies that have been moved to some of the other locations that were highlighted by Minister Joyce in announcing this particular proposal, so our overall policy of decentralisation is supporting a number of regional communities.

I accept that it's within the government's power to make this decision, but why wasn't there any kind of open tender process?

There were about 55 different stakeholders that were formally consulted as part of that process, including instruments of government in the other states around Australia, as well as industry and communities and governments—and banks, obviously, as well, given that it was a loan facility. Quite separately, that consultation occurred in relation to the loans facility.

 (Victoria) (12:01):  But the question, Minister, wanted a simple yes or no answer. How were those other sites put on that short list? Were they nominated? Did they even know they were on that short list? Was there any opportunity for any location to provide advice to the minister as to why they felt they were the most appropriate site, or was the process just one of the minister plucking Orange out because he felt that it was the most appropriate location?

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (12:01):  Senator Rice, no, there was no submission process. However, if you look at the names of the towns I read out, they quite clearly are prominent regional towns in Australia. That was why they would have been identified by government as potential locations for such an organisation as the RIC. However, the decision of government was that Orange was the most suitable.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (12:02):  At the time the decision was made I was not in the near vicinity of the Deputy Prime Minister. I think, when you consider all of the reasons Orange is a suitable location, you would have to acknowledge that it is. The deliberations of government as to why Orange was chosen, I think, are self-evident in the characteristics of this particular town.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (12:03):  What we're attempting to tease out here—which is proving to be quite difficult—is what the process was prior to the selection of Orange and prior to the subsequent consultation that was had with various organisations in Orange. We want to know how those other locations were chosen as possible locations. Were organisations or local councils in those areas contacted about providing information as to why their town would be a good site for the RIC? We are trying to understand what the process is. In the absence of a response that satisfies what really is a very simple question, we have to assume that this decision of locating the RIC in Orange is a decision that Minister Joyce made himself. We have no idea as to what informed his decision.

 (Victoria) (12:05):  I do feel for you, Minister, because it's very clear that you have not got any information to give us, because there was clearly a very inadequate process, if you can call it a process at all. There was no submission process. It sounds like the towns that were apparently on this short list didn't even know that they were on the short list. And why were those towns on the short list whereas other towns that equally could have been on the short list, like Launceston and Cairns, were not? So you aren't able to share any more information with us, but it just goes to the point that there was clearly no objective, transparent process for the selection of the short list. It sounds to me like the minister was riffing off names and saying, 'Yes, we could think of these six cities that possibly could have been sites, and we are choosing Orange.' I have nothing against Orange. It's a lovely place, and there are some criteria as to why it could be appropriate for it to be there, but the point is process. The point is having an appropriate, objective, transparent, accountable, evidence based process that you aren't able to share with us because it's quite clear that it doesn't exist.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (12:18):  by leave—I move government amendments (1) and (2) on sheet EF114 together:


(1) Clause 12, page 11 (after line 15), after subclause (3), insert:


   (3A) In giving a direction under subsection (3), the responsible Ministers must exercise their powers consistently with the Water Act 2007.


   (3B) Before giving a direction under subsection (3) in relation to a water infrastructure project that is wholly or partly within the Murray‑Darling Basin (as defined by the Water Act 2007), the responsible Ministers must seek the Murray‑Darling Basin Authority's advice as to whether in giving the direction, the Ministers would be exercising the Ministers' powers consistently with the Basin Plan (as defined by the Water Act 2007).


(2) Clause 12, page 11 (after line 18), after subclause (4), insert:


   (4A) If:


(a) the responsible Ministers give a direction under subsection (3) to the Corporation to enter into an agreement; and


(b) the direction is one in relation to which the responsible Ministers received advice from the Murray‑Darling Basin Authority under subsection (3B);


then:


(c) the Board must notify the responsible Ministers when the agreement has been entered into; and


(d) the responsible Ministers must publish the advice on the internet within 30 business days of receiving the notice under paragraph (c).


The government amendments to the Regional Investment Corporation Bill 2017 relate to directions that the responsible ministers are able to give to the corporation under clause 12(3) directions to enter into grants of financial assistance for water infrastructure projects. That directions power is an important part of the government's arrangements of the National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility and provides the mechanism for government to communicate its decisions on projects that have been approved for a loan. The amendment makes it clear that, in giving a direction under clause 12(3), the responsible ministers need to exercise their powers consistently with the Water Act 2007. They will also have to seek the advice of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority before issuing a direction under clause 12(3). This requirement ensures that the responsible ministers receive advice on the consistency of the projects with the Basin Plan from the independent body that is best placed to make the assessment. The government is committed to working with states and territories to build the water infrastructure needed for agricultural industries to expand and increase their productivity, and the National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility is a critical part of that commitment.


We are also committed to meeting our water management obligations, and this amendment makes that clear and should provide confidence to the senators in supporting this bill. In moving this amendment, I acknowledge in particular the interest of senators from my home state of South Australia in making sure that we are absolutely explicit that there is no impact on the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and in particular water policy by this organisation. I thank Senator Xenophon for his work with me and the department on ensuring that we have the very clearest of conditions included in the bill to make sure that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is delivered in full and on time and that the Water Act and water policy are not compromised in any way.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-10-18,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:20):  I indicate that, obviously, we support this amendment. This is an important amendment in the context of ensuring that there is no ambiguity in how the Regional Investment Corporation will operate in the context of water policy and that the Water Act will not in any way be affected by this and, in particular, the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and sustainable diversion limits. The amendment is self-evident. Senator Ruston has alluded to productive discussions that I've had with her and the Deputy Prime Minister in respect of this. I believe this is a belts-and-braces approach, to put it colloquially, to ensure there is no ambiguity in terms of the impact of any water projects funded under the Regional Investment Corporation legislation. It will provide strong guarantees in directions in terms of the Murray-Darling Basin, that it must be transparent and that responsible ministers within the basin receive advice. That includes the Minister for Water and the River Murray in South Australia, the Hon. Ian Hunter, who has a strong interest in these issues as well. I have spoken to the honourable Mr Hunter in the last 36 hours about the need for this.


I may ask one question of the minister just so that it's on the record. It's something I have discussed with departmental officers. Does this amendment give rights of judicial review to those who have standing to ensure that it is complied with? In other words, we're not just saying that this must be complied with; can it actually be enforced through a judicial review process?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (12:22):  To clarify the point that you've just raised: under the Water Act and sections 34 and 35 of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan 2012, it is not lawful for the Commonwealth or a state to construct water infrastructure, whether it is funded by the RIC or by any other mechanism, that would alter the level of take above the relevant SDL in that basin. There are well-established avenues of redress for people or entities, including the state and territories, who are or who believe themselves to be adversely affected by any administrative decisions, including the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, so there is nothing in the act that detracts in any way from the longstanding protections of the administrative law that the public may seek judicial review of decisions by the courts.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (12:23):  Labor will be supporting the government's amendments because they do provide additional confidence that water proposals which will be put forward by the responsible ministers to the RIC within the Murray-Darling Basin will need to comply with the basin plan. The amendments will also require the RIC board to consult with the basin authority. I'm not surprised that Senator Xenophon talked about ambiguity in this area, because that ambiguity and that concern follows some of the statements made by the Deputy Prime Minister in response to allegations that water is being taken out of the basin: essentially, that there was nothing to see here.


This is another example of why this corporation is different from other, similar entities. The influence of the responsible ministers means that the corporation lacks the proper independence and transparency required for the corporation to work effectively and efficiently. But we, as I have said, will be supporting the government's amendments.

We note in the contributions by the minister and by Senator Xenophon phrases like, 'It's going to ensure that there's no ambiguity,' and, 'It's a belt-and-braces approach, giving certainty and confidence.' Minister, is there actually anything in these amendments that does change things other than as they would already have been underneath the Water Act? What difference will it make to water projects—compared to the Water Act—if this legislation, and this amendment in particular, is passed?

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (12:25):  In essence, the answer is nothing, but what we are seeking to do by this is be explicit in the bill so that there can be no doubt whatsoever that the Regional Investment Corporation cannot override the requirements of the Water Act or, specifically in doing so, the full implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:26):  I may take some slight issue with what the minister has said—not a big issue; don't panic, it's okay! I just wanted to say that Senator Rice's question is a very important question. My understanding, from a point of view of statutory interpretation is that where you have two competing acts there sometimes may be some ambiguity. Having this particular amendment removes that ambiguity. I think it's fair to say that what Senator Ruston said is absolutely right—the intent is that the Water Act is at all times adhered to, particularly when it comes to sustainable diversion limits and the like. But, if there could potentially, as a question of law, sometimes be a conflict between the two acts which could be the subject of legal argument, this amendment would remove that issue of legal argument. You've got some esteemed lawyers from the department behind you who know more about administrative law than I ever will—apart from being a plaintiff or defendant in administrative law cases. I suggest to Senator Rice that this amendment is doing some good work. It's not just a symbolic amendment; it actually ensures that there cannot be an argument down the track to say that the Regional Investment Corporation Act takes precedence over the Water Act, which could be a potential argument. That's my jurisprudential lesson for the day. Maybe the lawyers there will disagree with me; I'll try and dig up some case law if they do, so just give me a moment.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (12:27):  And I probably wasn't exactly accurate in my response to you, Senator Rice. The requirement for the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to prejudge an action by the RIC in relation to water infrastructure as having complied with the Water Act is an additional requirement that does not currently exist. So I should correct myself and say, yes, there is an additional level of protection that is added by the requirement to predetermine the compliance with the act.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (12:28):  To clarify, it depends on your definition of 'symbolic', then, as to it giving that extra certainty, but, essentially, other than that additional requirement of compliance, all of the measures that are in this amendment are just repeating things that are in the Water Act.

 (South Australia) (12:28):  My office sought advice from environmental lawyers about this amendment, and it does do useful things around the rights and enforcement of the Water Act. There may well be environmental lawyers who Senator Rice deals with as well, but I think it is a belt-and-braces approach in a meaningful way.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (12:29):  I move opposition amendment (7) on sheet 8225:


(7) Page 23 (after line 10), after clause 41, insert:




41A


Disclosure of interests



(1) The CEO must give written notice to the Board of any disclosure made by the CEO under section 29 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (which deals with the duty to disclose interests).


(2) Subsection (1) applies in addition to any rules made for the purposes of section 29 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013.


(3) For the purposes of this Act and the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013, the CEO is taken not to have complied with section 29 of that Act if the CEO does not comply with subsection (1) of this section.


The government moved its own amendments in the House to address concerns raised in the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report on this bill. The Pastoralists and Graziers Association of WA argued that a board membership of three was too small, arguing that the size of the board and its composition should be similar to that found in private financial organisations in order to cover the range of qualifications.


In addition to the board size amendments, we have seen the government moving further amendments which clearly show the lack of proper consultation in the development of the current bill, and we urge all senators to support our amendments requiring the CEO to disclose any personal or acquired conflicts of interest. This amendment will strengthen the independence and transparency of the corporation.


Minister Ruston earlier made reference to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, claiming that the RIC is established under the same legislative scrutiny as the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. If this is true, the government should have undertaken this amendment on their own to ensure that the CEO discloses any personal interest that she or he may have or acquire which would be in conflict with the proper performance of the CEO's duties.


Disclosing any conflicts of interest by the CEO is about transparency to ensure that decisions made by the CEO are made without personal influence or indeed external influence. Ensuring that the CEO discloses any conflicts of interest will reduce the risk of any potential for corruption and/or misconduct. For the minister's information, that is a part of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. We hope that the government will consider this amendment, see that this is an amendment worthy of support and support the amendment before us now.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (12:32):  Thank you, Senator Brown. Firstly, the reason that we are not supporting this particular amendment is that we believe that it's actually counter to the normal operation of disclosure-of-interests requirements under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act and associated rule. It would also remove the responsibility otherwise appropriately allocated to the board.


As you would be aware, the PGPA Act requires officials of Commonwealth entities to disclose any material personal interests that relate to the affairs of the entity, and it also requires and provides for rules to prescribe how and when those interests are to be disclosed. The PGPA Rule provides for the board, as the accountable authority of the entity, to instruct how officials of the corporation, including the CEO, are to disclose the interests.


There were a couple of comments that you made. You made the comment about three not being a sufficient number of people on the board. You'll note from the legislation that it says 'up to five'. It doesn't say three. It's also worth pointing out that the establishment of the CEFC actually preceded the PGPA Act, so it would not have been relevant to make the correlation between the two.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (12:33):  The Greens will be supporting this amendment from the Labor Party and think that having the level of disclosure is an important extra element to be adding to this. Again, given the issues that we've been discussing this morning about how much power is vested in the minister, having elements of transparency and accountability by the board, and particularly with a potentially small board, is really critical. I note the minister saying that the board can be up to five. You may as well say that the board could be up to 11. If you can have a board of only three, that's the minimum. If you've got a board of only three and you don't necessarily have to have the high levels of disclosure that would be required by this amendment, you have serious potential issues of accountability.


The whole way this legislation has been drafted leads us to have really serious concerns about the accountability at the ministerial level and then at the board level. As to the sorts of processes that have occurred—or the lack of process, as we have previously discussed—on significant issues, as to where the corporation is going to be located: it is very clear there was a lack of process. And this goes to the heart of the problems with this whole corporation in the way it is being set up: the lack of transparency, accountability and good governance process in its establishment.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (12:35):  I won't take up too much time, but I rise to support Senator Rice's contribution. We are talking about a corporation that is administering $4 billion. As to suggesting that a minimum of three on the board is sufficient—it isn't. Throughout this bill, we have seen that the good governance isn't there and the level of transparency that we would normally expect to see under similar legislation is not there. We've just had the discussion about the process undertaken around the location of the RIC. Well, there was actually no consultation, and I think it's fair to say that at least we now understand that there is no location. But this is a regional corporation that is administering $4 billion, and this government is suggesting that just having a minimum of three board members is sufficient. As to this amendment that we have before us now, all it's asking is that there be a disclosure of conflict of interest. I understand, and I take on board, what the minister said in response to my first contribution on this amendment. But, given the lack of governance and the lack of transparency, and the fact that it has been very difficult to find any information around this bill coming from the minister or the government, I really believe that, if what the minister says is correct, there should be no issue with the government supporting this amendment.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (12:45):  In the early 20th century, polio was one of the most feared diseases in industrialised countries, paralysing hundreds of thousands of children every year. For many Australians, polio may seem like just another disease that has been non-existent for years. However, those born before 1955 remember having a great fear of this horrible disease, which crippled thousands of once active, healthy children. It was a disease that had no cure or identifiable causes and it could not be contained, making it all the more terrifying. Although other diseases of the era had much higher mortality rates, none had the permanent ramifications that polio did. Everyone was affected when there was epidemic outbreak. People lived in constant fear that they would be next to catch the disease or, worse, one of their children would contract polio. The lives of polio victims and those who cared for them were changed forever by the impairments that victims of polio suffered. It was not until the development and distribution of the vaccine against polio that people could have a secure sense of hope that they would not fall victim to this paralysing disease.


In 1954, the first vaccinations against polio, developed by Jonas Salk, were given to children in the United States. Following the development of an oral polio vaccine in 1956 by Albert Sabin, polio was finally brought under control and practically eliminated as a health problem in most industrialised nations. However, it took somewhat longer for polio to be recognised as a major problem in developing countries. It wasn't until the 1970s that routine immunisation was introduced worldwide as part of national immunisation programs, helping to control the disease in many developing nations. 


However, tackling these polio cases was, and remains, rather difficult. Conflict, political instability, hard-to-reach populations and poor infrastructure pose significant challenges to eradicating the disease, as is the too often cultural mistrust over immunisation programs. To get the job done requires delivering the vaccine to the door of every household, explaining to parents the importance of protecting their children from polio and preparing communities to welcome the vaccination campaigns. It requires mobilising and training millions of volunteers and it requires funding. Since its inception, the drive to eradicate polio has been an expression of the power of public health partnerships to do great and lasting good.


In polio circles, one organisation remains famous for its steadfast commitment and its hard-nosed determination to eradicate polio across the world—of course, I speak of Rotary. Rotary International is the top private sector contributor and volunteer arm of the eradication initiative. Polio eradication has remained Rotary's highest interest project for over 20 years. Rotary's PolioPlus program has been described as the finest humanitarian project by a non-government organisation the world has ever known, and has seen Rotary nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts. Thanks to Rotary's advocacy efforts, donor governments, including Australia, have contributed more than $7.2 billion to the global eradication of polio. 


Rotarians have matched dollar for dollar the $100 million US commitment from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to eradicate polio. Rotarians have mobilised and trained millions of volunteers, giving public health a new model of service delivery. In their determination to rid the world of polio, Rotarians have not only opened doors at the highest political levels, but most importantly opened the doors of homes at the grassroots level, because this is where the important matter of trust counts the most. When concerned parents want to know if a vaccine is safe, if it is really needed for a child, they trust the answers Rotarians offer them. From the very beginning, Rotarians have contributed practical, on-the-ground experience as proof that striving for a vision is feasible. 


In 1978 Rotary set up a committee to design a program for Rotary International to undertake projects far greater than any club or district could do alone. Of the 16 projects proposed from around the world, one proposal from the Philippines stood out—that, if Rotary could provide the vaccine, they would mobilise all of the Rotarians in the entire Philippines and immunise all Filipino children. This led to some six million children being immunised against polio. 


In 1982 the board of Rotary International approved the idea of giving polio vaccinations to all children across the globe. The project was called Polio 2005. In 1985 Rotary set a fundraising goal of $120,000 and changed the name of the project to PolioPlus. It was the first major fundraising campaign by Rotarians of the world for a single project. 


However, by 1987 Rotary had surpassed the goal of raising over $240 million, leading to Rotary leaders going to the World Health Organization and saying to them that they wanted to join in their task of eradicating polio. As Cliff Dochterman, a former president of Rotary International from 1992 to 1993, who was at the meeting with the World Health Organization, said:


It was not well accepted by all the WHO leaders who represented some of the most knowledgeable health authorities in the world. Rotary was ""just a service club."" Finally, when Rotary told them that we had over a million volunteers and $247 million in our pocket, they said, ""Come on in."" So we became full partners of the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and the US Centers for Disease Control. 


At that time, in 1988, you could find polio in 125 nations of the world and it was estimated that there were 350,000 cases of polio in the world every year. But we took on the project – one country at a time. Our first big immunization day was in Mexico, where we immunized 13 million children. Then we went to Central America and South America. One nation after another became ""polio free.""


Since the launch of Rotary International's PolioPlus program in 1985, Rotary has contributed more than $1.7 billion and countless volunteer hours to immunise more than 2.5 billion children across 122 countries. Thanks to the success of this program, there are now just three polio epidemic countries with 37 polio cases worldwide, which is a reduction of more than 99.9 per cent since 1988, when there were over 350,000 polio cases. Thanks to the steadfast commitment of over 1.2 million Rotarians across the world, the world may soon be rid of this ancient disease, which has destroyed so many childhoods and broken so many hearts.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators Gallacher, Chisholm and McAllister today relating to energy policy.


I just want to put on the record at the outset what we are talking about when we refer to energy and electricity prices. The National Electricity Market generates 200 terawatt hours of electricity annually and supplies 80 per cent of Australia's consumption. We know it operates on one of the world's longest interconnected power systems—from Port Douglas in Queensland to Port Lincoln in South Australia. Given the length and breadth of that network—and I keep returning to this—occasionally there are outages which are caused by weather events. Despite Senator Brandis's attempt to portray all of the ills that occurred in South Australia on wind, solar and the like—renewables—we know these outages were caused by a once-in-50-years storm at one end of a 5,000 kilometre network. You can't be allowed to keep putting the falsehood on the record that it was a decision of the South Australian government that caused those power outages. The public record is clear: it was the Olsen government in South Australia that privatised, it was the Olsen government that sold the network. The Olsen government sold the South Australian public a dud with one interconnector and refused the RiverLink interconnector.


It is really important to note that in the National Electricity Market the generators offer and then the market determines the combination of generation to meet demand in the most cost-efficient way, and the AEMO then issues dispatch instructions to these generators. What we also note from the public record is that the only one that's ever been fined for not following those instructions is the Snowy Hydro Scheme, which is owned by the federal government, the Victorian government and the New South Wales government. This is on the public record—a $400,000 fine. This lot over here created the National Electricity Market. They actually used to believe in a free market. And now what do we see? We see the Liddell power plant, with 20 per cent of New South Wales's generating capacity, at the end of its 45- or 50-year life and a Liberal government is stepping in and telling a private company with shareholders what to do with their fully depreciated asset.


That goes to the political point here. They used to believe in one thing and now they believe in another. The Prime Minister has moved consistently; that's the only thing he's done. He's shifted his position consistently, in line with the division in his caucus room, in line with pressure from the Nats. We saw on the weekend another catastrophic result for the National Party in the bush. There was a 20 per cent swing against them. We see this dysfunctional, divided government not making public policy and sending their caucus out to an electorate to say, 'In 2020, you'll save 100 bucks a week.' That's not going to fly. No-one is going to buy that. You might save 50c cents a week! For the people who are under pressure with their electricity bills, that is an absolute insult. I think the polls we have seen will be repeated all the way up to the next election.


This government will get its just desserts. Its just desserts are a number of terms in opposition for the dysfunction they are displaying, the lack of proper pragmatic policy and the lack of bipartisanship in putting energy security for Australian manufacturing and Australian consumers at the forefront of their policy. They are putting their own survival first. The Prime Minister is putting his survival first and Australia's needs second. In manufacturing, there are areas where electricity is 18 or 20 per cent of their costs. This government is not putting forward a coherent long-term policy that would allow investment to deliver the continuation of the manufacturing sector—in plastics, in cement.


We know that this government is only concerned about survival. What we also know is that the electorate has made its mind up, according to the polls. We are now at 21 polls which haven't gone their way. We'll get to 30 or 31 with or without Mr Turnbull—it ain't gonna make any difference. The only thing that will solve this crisis is the re-election of a Labor government and giving the coalition what they deserve, which is a couple of terms in opposition.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (15:09):  The previous speaker was nearly right when he blamed weather events for South Australia's power debacle. What he should have said was that it was a Weatherill event, because Premier Weatherill is responsible for what occurred in South Australia. Make no mistake. On one day, with renewable energy, South Australia got 91 per cent of its energy needs; two or three days later, only three per cent.


That is why this government has identified the need for a reliable energy supply. And that is why we have called our policy the National Energy Guarantee. What we need is reliability of supply along with affordability.


The extreme green experiment by the Australian Labor Party in South Australia has failed, and failed dismally. It has cost thousands of people in South Australia, their households and their businesses.




Senator Chisholm:
  Households! What are you talking about?




Senator ABETZ:
  It has been a disaster because when the power goes off, Senator, freezers go off and the food in the freezer goes off, and they've got to rebuy food. These are the basics that every single Australian household knows about, but Labor senators opposite are completely oblivious to these day-to-day needs and requirements. That was a very helpful interjection because it shows how disconnected the Labor Party of today is from the needs of the Australian people.


We as a government have said and said very clearly that affordability is No. 1; reliability is No. 2. And this is what this policy delivers. It was interesting that Senator Gallagher, as he is from South Australia—it is bizarre that he would lead the charge, given the track record of Labor in South Australia, but that aside—led the charge trying to quibble about the savings that Australians would get from our policy. Interesting. But he did not deny that there would be savings. All he was quibbling about was the extent of the savings. In doing so, what did he studiously avoid? He studiously avoided the cost of Labor's policy, a 50 per cent renewable energy target, which, in anybody's language, would drive up energy prices and cost jobs. There is no doubt. So the Labor Party, in seeking to quibble about whether it will be $115 or $100 per annum saved, acknowledge that there will be savings under the coalition policy. What they won't tell you is the huge cost increase under their policy.


We know that the Labor Party are addicted to the carbon tax schemes of high taxes, high subsidies and high prices, and then, if people have to pay too much, you tax other people more to give subsidies to pensioners, and so the list goes on. We have a deliberately focused policy, not about a money-go-round, not about idiotic ideology of pursuing renewable energy at all costs. We are having a balanced policy, which the Labor Party now acknowledge and admit will reduce energy prices. All they're arguing about is the extent of it. So I welcome that concession from the Australian Labor Party. But what they do need to tell the Australian people is what the extra cost of their policy will be. They know there will be an extra cost, because they continually talk about the need for increased targets—in other words, read increased subsidies, increased costs paid for by the taxpayer and paid for by the consumer.


This is the great juxtaposition that the Australian people now have in the debate over energy policy in this country. They have a government committed to affordability and reliability, something which the Australian Labor Party now acknowledges will drive down energy prices in comparison to a Labor government that would say, 'We have tried and failed in South Australia and, with that knowledge, we would seek to implement that on a national scale.' It is not good enough for the Australian people.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:15):  I rose yesterday after question time and we'd only had about an hour and a half to digest the announcement made by the government about energy. I suggested that, on the face of what we'd seen, this was a half-baked plan that was barely worked through. I said that because yesterday in question time, over in the other place, it became clear that the government had not prepared a regulatory impact statement and had not undertaken any actual modelling of the proposal that they were bringing before the Australian people. Indeed, if you looked at the fine print of what people were willing to say in their media interviews, all of these finer details, including the commitments around the intensity of emissions and the commitments around reliability, were to be worked up in the lead-up to COAG. It started to look like this was something they cobbled together because of a deadline that was coming upon them this year when the Prime Minister said we would have energy as the defining debate in this parliament. It's nearly Christmas and I suppose they had to do something, but they really weren't ready to go out yesterday. Nothing I have seen since this time yesterday has given me any reason to change my mind.


The government's been keen to talk about experts and to talk about the role of Dr Schott and Mr Pierce in particular. They are both people for whom I have great respect. But both Dr Schott and Mr Pierce actually blew the whistle on this show yesterday because Dr Schott did an interview last night and she was asked, 'Will prices go down? Is the government right when it claims that prices will be reduced by $115 per household?' She refused to endorse the claim. She refused to endorse it for the sensible reason that there has been absolutely no modelling done that could possibly support such a claim. I am extremely surprised that the government has been willing to go out so strongly on this question because I do believe it will come back to haunt them. Mr Pierce was similarly candid. What did he tell the media? He said that there'd been a range of scenarios that had been modelled and they produced, unsurprisingly, different results. Some of those results were as little as just $25 a year in savings for households in 2020. These experts that the government has been so keen to rely on have been disarmingly candid in their assessment about this plan and it reveals what I remarked earlier: there is no plan yet. There is a bunch of vague ideas that are going to be worked up in the lead-up to COAG.


Today in question time, I sought to ask the government about their approach to renewables because, all around the world, investment in renewables is growing at an incredible rate. The IEA reported earlier this month that, globally, renewables accounted for almost two-thirds of the new power capacity in 2016. Where are the biggest markets for renewables? They're in China, India and the United States. They are the three big markets in our region and the three big partners for Australia. Those countries, the big economic players in our region, are moving towards renewables so why wouldn't we ask the government to explain what this plan means for renewables investment in this country? Senator Brandis chose not to explain. He ducked the question. He refused to engage with my premise—fair enough—but he provided no alternative premise. In fact, I have not heard one single member of the government provide any credible explanation of what is expected for renewables investment on the basis of this new scheme that they've brought forward. It's not surprising that there are no details, but why bring such a half-baked proposition before the Australian people?


I will say one final thing. There is going to come a time when these details are going to have to be put into the public domain. You can't go on like this with a series of slogans forever. At some point you're going to have to turn up at COAG and, I'll tell you what, state premiers are not going to be forgiving. That will be on both sides of the aisle. There are a bundle of contradictions in the proposition that you've brought forward. 


You've told the conservatives in your party room that this might deliver on their great hope there will be new investment in coal. You've told everybody else that, sure, this will deliver on the emissions reduction targets that we made in Paris and, not only that, the energy sector will do its fair share and we won't leave it all to the trucking sector or the farming sector. And you've told the Australian public that prices will come down. I'm looking forward to seeing you square that circle, because on the basis of what we've seen I don't believe you can.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (15:20):  I do believe that the opposition has been left quite flat footed on this issue. The opposition has been left with their mouths gaping open, devoid of any answers, devoid of any ideas. This clearly was not a policy that they were expecting, largely because they have been so wedded to a clean energy target for so long for reasons that range from political necessity—obviously you're sandbagging your inner-city seats from your frenemies the Greens—to a lack of imagination and an inability to listen to consumers, to households, to businesses or to investors about what is important to them.


The National Energy Guarantee delivers affordable energy. It delivers reliable energy. It meets emissions targets and meets our international obligations. It's hardly a half-baked idea. In fact, those opposite have been urging the government for months now to present an answer on the clean energy target. The Finkel review came out in June. We have implemented 49 of the 50 recommendations, including, I might add, establishing the Energy Security Board. The 50th recommendation, which was the clean energy target, has been considered. We have done our due diligence, and the Energy Security Board has come up with a solution that we believe meets all of those requirements and all of those objectives.


Unlike the habitually uninformed Senator Gallacher, I am going to accurately quote an expert in this field. It was the Chief Scientist, Alan Finkel, who said of the Energy Security Board:


Consisting of the energy market regulators and an independent Chair and Deputy Chair, it is the country’s most authoritative voice in energy matters.


…      …   …


I am pleased that the Australian Government asked the Energy Security Board to provide advice on this matter.


…      …   …


I know from consultations with the Energy Security Board in the later stages of the development of the new proposals that the process was thorough.


I don't think you can get a more ringing endorsement of this plan, unlike Labor's plan—or lack of plan. Labor has no plan at all for reliable energy. It is a policy one-trick pony. They cannot think beyond the world of subsidies and taxes. They want to impose reckless and irresponsible renewable energy targets that would drive up prices and undermine reliability. They want to take the failed South Australian experiment and they want to take it national. They've given no thought at all to reliable energy needed to keep the lights on when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing. Their plan to give billions of dollars of subsidies to pursue an ideological crusade will only leave families, households and businesses paying more. The cost of this lunacy could be as high as $66 billion.


Most importantly, though, the National Energy Guarantee encourages the right investment in the right places at the right time. Threaten what you will, Senator McAllister, from Labor premiers at COAG; that is entirely inappropriate. This is an opportunity for the flat-footed opposition to take a big leap forward with those flat feet, an opportunity for the crossbench to break free of the uncritical groupthink, and consign the energy wars to the past. We can secure energy supplies, we can keep the lights on, we can bring prices down, we can ease the burden on hip pockets, we can reduce emissions and we can meet our international obligations.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:23):  I want to record for the chamber the fact that members opposite again today have repeated the claim that the privatisation of networks in South Australia is the cause of higher prices in South Australia. Unfortunately for those opposite, that claim that privatisation has caused the high prices has been shown to be completely false by the report of the ACCC out just in the last week that showed: 


The main cause of higher customer bills was the significant increase in network costs for all states other than South Australia.


It goes on to say:


The ACCC estimates that in 2016-17, Queenslanders will be paying the most for their electricity, followed by South Australians …


And they highlight that in Queensland the network is still owned by the government and that the most significant input to the cost to Queenslanders was the network cost. They go on to say:


The closure of large baseload coal generation plants has seen gas-powered generation becoming the marginal source of generation more frequently, particularly in South Australia.


What that means is that, when those peaking plants have to come on in South Australia, the costs go up. (Time expired)

Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (15:25):  I certainly wouldn't accuse the government of being flat-footed on energy; in fact, they've been very fleet of foot, because they've had so many policies over the last couple of years. I think we have to go back and look at some of the history of this. We know that, as Prime Minister, Tony Abbott promised that bills would reduce by $550, yet we know how much they've gone up under this government. We know that under the time line that we can see from Finkel, the government and the Prime Minister and indeed the energy minister were out there advocating for this. They were in the party room advocating for this. They did another PowerPoint presentation advocating for Finkel. It sounds like they went back yesterday and leapt onto their latest plan. We also recall the gas crisis that we've had over the last couple of months that still the government haven't solved. We also saw them, a couple of months ago, talking about Liddell and saying that Liddell power station had to be extended. So they certainly haven't been flat-footed; they've had plenty of policies, but none of them have actually worked.


The saddest thing I've heard in the last 48 hours about this policy is them saying that it was carried by acclamation. It was this mob that clapped this policy. And it's a fig leaf of a policy. It is an absolute joke. They have no credibility. And they've had to roll out the board to give them some credibility because they have done so much damage to their own standing on policy on this issue.


I think it's worth looking at what their motivation is in this. Effectively, in trying to come up with a policy, they've had zero regard for families; they've had zero regard for jobs. But what they have focused on in this policy is keeping the right-wingers on their backbench happy and coming up with a political message that they want to use for an election campaign. This has got nothing about long-term policy for Australian families and jobs. They're all trying to keep their backbench happy and come up with a political message. That is actually what they have been focused on with this policy.


The fact that they've had to attempt to use the security board to provide that fig leaf of credibility shows you how desperate they are. But that's actually the start of the unravelling, because it has been those members that have undermined their claims on costs; it has been the security board members that have undermined their claims when it comes to modelling. This is why the policy will start to unravel, and this is why those right-wingers on the backbench—those ones who are pro coal; those ones who want to live in a previous lifetime—are going to start to realise that they've been hoodwinked, and that is when these problems of the government are going to emerge. The Nationals will be the ringleaders in this, but so will some of those backbenchers in the Liberal Party. So it's a policy that was designed to basically hoodwink the backbench—to give those pro-coal backbenchers something that they wanted to hear so that they could back this policy in. It actually is a very sad outcome that they just sat there and clapped this through without questioning the modelling behind it or the details, because obviously those have been lacking.


It really is a farce when you think that, in question time, the Prime Minister wouldn't even guarantee a 50c-per-week reduction in 2020. Senator Brandis, heroically, tried to deflect that question. But, in question time in the House of Representatives, Prime Minister Turnbull wouldn't even guarantee that 50c reduction. To make matters worse, the very people who advised the government on the new energy policy say that there hasn't been any modelling done to gauge the real price impact of their plan. That just shows you how farcical this is and how desperate this government is.


We also know that for many months now the Labor opposition have had the hand of bipartisanship out and have been prepared to work on a clean energy target, and it speaks volumes that this government wouldn't entertain that. They were dictated to by their backbench. They did not want to end the climate wars. They did not want to have a long-term bipartisan policy that would benefit families, that would benefit jobs and that would benefit the economy. Their focus is on politics. The focus is on trying to keep the backbench happy. But it is going to unravel, because the motivation for this policy is not the Australian people. It is not about providing the outcomes that Australian families and communities need, nor is it focusing on jobs and reliability.

AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION AMENDMENT (FAIR AND BALANCED) BILL 2017


The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment (Fair and Balanced) Bill 2017 amends the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Charter, as set out in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 (ABC Act), to require the organisation's news services to be ' fair'  and ' balanced' .


This obligation will sit alongside the existing requirement that the ABC's news services are 'accurate and impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism' .


The Australian people expect a publicly funded broadcaster to canvass a broad range of issues, and report on those issues in a fair and balanced manner.


There is also a strong public interest in ensuring that Australians have confidence that they can rely on the ABC as a source of information to inform their views on significant issues. 


A statutory requirement for fair and balanced reporting will promote such confidence, and ensure that the ABC is a source of information which they can draw on to inform their views on significant public issues.


It is important to recognise that the bill will not alter or diminish in any way the ABC's independence. Objectively, there should be no concern about this proposal. The ABC's own Editorial Policies require the ABC to adhere to fair treatment in the gathering and presentation of news and information, and a balance in its news reporting that follows the weight of evidence. The amendment contained in this bill simply enshrines this obligation in legislation. 


It will support and strengthen the ABC's reputation for providing trustworthy and dependable news and information services, and ensure the organisation uphold the standards expected of it by the Australian public.

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment (Rural and Regional Measures) Bill 2017 amends the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 (ABC Act) to ensure regional communities are provided for in the functions of the Corporation, and through representation on the ABC Board.


The ABC occupies an important place in the lives of regional communities. Over many decades its services have informed and entertained communities in areas where other media options are limited.


This bill contains a range of measures to support and cement that role, and ensure the ABC continues to focus on and meet the diverse needs of rural and regional Australia. 


I will now turn to the specifics of the bill. 


[Amending the ABC Charter to include regional and geographic diversity]


One of the functions of the ABC, as stipulated by its Charter, is to provide broadcasting programs that contribute to a sense of national identity and inform and entertain, and reflect the cultural diversity of, the Australian community. 


The bill will broaden that mandate to ensure the Charter makes specific reference to the function for the ABC's broadcasting programs to contribute to a sense of regional as well as national identity, and reflect the geographic as well as cultural diversity of the Australian community.


Most Australians would be surprised to learn that the Charter currently has no such references. This is an important amendment that codifies the relationship that the ABC already has with regional Australia, and ensures the organisation continues to provide services that are valued by, and reflect the needs of, rural and regional communities. 


[Establishment of a Regional Advisory Council] 


While the ABC Charter sets the broad mandate for the organisation, its capacity to deliver on that mandate necessitates having in place the right governance arrangements and operational structures. The ABC must be able to understand the needs and perspectives of regional areas if it is to well service rural and regional Australia. 


To this end, the bill will require the ABC Board to establish a Regional Advisory Council within 3 months after the day the bill receives Royal Assent. 


The role of this Council will be to reflect the views of regional Australia, and the ABC Board will be obliged to consult with the Council on any change to its broadcasting services that will have a substantial impact on regional Australia.


The Regional Advisory Council will be established by the ABC Board in the same manner as the existing ABC Advisory Council, under section 11 of the ABC Act.


The Regional Advisory Council will be made up of members who have a substantial connection to, or substantial experience in, a regional community through business, industry or community involvement. 


Regional Advisory Council members will not be permitted to be members of another advisory ABC council or committee and the ABC will be required to report on all consultations with the Regional Advisory Council through its Annual Report.


This amendment will ensure that a more formal mechanism is in place to ensure decisions of the ABC board are taken after proper consultation with affected audiences.



[ABC Board connection to regional Australia]


The bill also makes changes to ensure a minimum level of representation by individuals with an understanding of rural and regional communities on the ABC Board. 


The bill will require the ABC Board to have at least two appointed non-executive directors who have a substantial connection to, or substantial experience in, a regional community through business, industry or community involvement. 


This measure will ensure that at the highest level in the organisation, the needs and views of regional and rural areas are appropriately represented. 


The bill will require the Minister (in relation to non-executive directors) or the Prime Minister (in the case of the ABC Chair) to table a statement in each House of the Parliament outlining the person's substantial connection to, or substantial experience in, a regional community. 


This provision allows the Government to establish a 'baseline' for the regional skills set of the ABC Board, and any future appointment processes will then need to take this into account. 


Through its appointments to the ABC board, the Government has ensured that this new requirement will already be satisfied. This amendment ensures that the ABC board will always have at least two members who have an understanding of the needs of rural and regional communities.


[Annual reporting obligations]


Finally, the bill will introduce a number of additional annual reporting obligations for the ABC. 


These will require the broadcaster to provide statistics on the number of individuals employed in regional and metropolitan areas. 


This will include details on the number of journalists employed in regional areas, as well as the total number of hours of local or regional news bulletins broadcast each year. 


This is important for transparency. It is appropriate that the Parliament, and the Australian people, are able to see the deployment of staff and the production of local content. 


Conclusion


As a whole, the bill contains a range of measures that will strengthen the focus of the ABC on rural and regional communities. They represent important safeguards for those Australians living outside the capital cities and larger metropolitan areas. 


They will ensure that our primary national broadcaster retains and deepens its connection to communities in the bush. 


I commend the bill to the chamber.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (16:43):  Reflect on question time today, where a number of questions were put to the government to provide details on their NEG; their new energy policy. It is a policy, may I say, that's taken the Liberal National Party nearly five years to arrive at—five years to arrive at this. That's the big question that they won't answer and it's probably the question that they can't answer. But we can. We got this policy this week—this National Energy Guarantee—because Mr Tony Abbott, our ex-Prime Minister, gave a speech last week and ignited the culture wars within the LNP by talking about offering goats to volcanos and how climate change was rubbish. That is why we got a policy from our current Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, this week. It is a policy that is so vague on details that it beggars belief.


After five years, Attorney-General Brandis told us today that the experts tell us all we need to know. They tell us that it will provide energy supply guarantees, reliability, lower prices and lower emissions, and even meet our Paris Agreement commitments. If this policy is so good and it's so obviously the solution in front of us, why has it taken five years for the government to deliver it to this place?


I'll tell you why: this is a half-arsed policy designed to save Mr Malcolm Turnbull's political bacon. This is not designed to provide reliable power. This is not designed to provide cheaper power. This is not designed to lower emissions. This policy is a compromise with the far right in the LNP led by Mr Tony Abbott—and, may I say, don't stop there. That's still quite a shallow interpretation, because Mr Tony Abbott and the far right, and our friends in the National Party, have been running a pro-coal agenda, an agenda to subsidise coal to keep dirty, uneconomic coal-fired power stations going for another reason. If you'd gone out and listened to the One Nation press conference the other day, you'd have seen what that reason was. This half-arsed energy policy won't meet our Paris Agreement commitments and that will increase uncertainty in the long-term investment horizons that are necessary for us to continue to roll out renewable energy, something that we know is popular in Australia. We know it will create jobs. We know it will reduce emissions. But that doesn't matter. This is actually about solving a political problem for Mr Malcolm Turnbull.


Don't just take it from me. An excellent article in The Conversation today by John Quiggin, professor in the School of Economics at the University of Queensland, said:


The most important thing to understand about the federal government’s new National Energy Guarantee is that it is designed not to produce a sustainable and reliable electricity supply system for the future, but to meet purely political objectives for the current term of parliament.


Those political objectives are: to provide a point of policy difference with the Labor Party; to meet the demands of the government’s backbench to provide support for coal-fired electricity; and to be seen to be acting to hold power prices down.


It really makes me sad, angry and frustrated after my party has been campaigning in here for 10 years to get a proper policy to tackle climate change, which is a price on carbon. Even the Grattan Institute, which has been fairly glowing in its support for this policy, this NEG, said this morning that a price on carbon is the best policy, that this is second rate and that, in fact, there would be no need for emissions intensity guarantees or reliability guarantees if we had a price on carbon. We brought that in nearly 10 years ago. We campaigned and we got it legislated after 2010—gold standard, the world's best climate package, with a price on carbon and money allocated to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, ARENA and the Climate Council to drive innovation and investment in renewable energy. We were on our way. We were on our way to do more than meeting our Paris targets. We were global leaders in action on climate. How sad and embarrassing that we have slumped to where we are today!


For five years we've had policy chaos. We've had uncertainty in business investment. Even the coal-fired power companies have been calling for the government to get its act together. But it took a speech from Mr Tony Abbott to trigger this policy that we have before us today. Well, we are going to need detail. We're going to need detail on how the emissions intensity scheme within this is going to meet our Paris Agreement commitments. We are going to need detail on how the NEG is going to be integrated into our NEM, our wholesale network, and how Western Australia and the Northern Territory are going to be brought under this scheme. We're going to need details.


It's just not good enough that the government would come out with such a big policy announcement with absolutely no detail on how it is going to work. That's not going to solve the problems with business uncertainty on investment. And we're going to need details on how we're going to meet our Paris Agreement commitments when we go back to the COP21 negotiations and the global economies agree on the further cuts in emissions, the reductions, that are necessary to tackle dangerous global warming. And we have got this half-arsed, half-baked policy in front of us here today. It's just not good enough. It's not good enough for future generations of Australians. We should do better.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (16:50):  The Greens' matter of public importance today is:


The link between the Government's collapse in public support and their hostility towards clean energy, their delusional pro-coal agenda, and their steadfast refusal to embrace progress.


My favourite thing about the Greens' MPI today is not their typical economic illiteracy; it's not their expected over-the-top environmental ideology; it's not even their antihuman, antitechnology lunacy. It's the fact that the Greens, who normally confine themselves to providing policy advice to the government, through this chamber and elsewhere, have now decided that they want to get into the business of providing political advice to the government. Not content with their unsuccessful attempts to try and influence the government's policy agenda, they're now trying to teach us a thing or two about politics.


I'm a little bit surprised by this, because presumably what the Greens want us to do, and what they think is to the government's political benefit, is adopt their environmental policies and their economic policies, and, presumably—given that they think that our current policies have led to a collapse in public support—they think that that public support would soon return and we would soon receive a boost in the polls. There is just one little unfortunate fact about the Greens and the political advice that they offer us, and that is that, presumably, if we were offering the policies of the Greens, we would receive the same amount of political support the Greens do. In the most recent Newspoll, published on Monday, the coalition's primary vote was recorded at 36 per cent. To be sure, all coalition members would like that number to be higher. But also on Monday in the Newspoll, the Greens' primary vote was recorded at 10 per cent. So a political party with a 10 per cent support in the polls is offering political advice to a party with more than three times its political support in the polls. I don't think that the government will be rushing to take up the Greens' political advice.


They shouldn't be disappointed, though, because, in a funny way, the government is following the Greens' policy advice for once. We've listened to them very carefully and to all they have said on energy policy, particularly on the merits of renewable energy. We've taken them at their word, and we've gone to the only possible logical conclusion from their advice. Their advice has come in the form of comments such as this by Adam Bandt in September 2017 when he said:


… it is now cheaper to build renewables than it is to build … coal.


It also came in the form of comments back in November 2015 by the Greens' leader, Senator Di Natale, who said:


It's cheaper now to build wind power than it is to build coal-fired power and … it'll soon be cheaper to build solar as well.


They're not the only people offering this advice. Renewable energy advocates tell us so. Kane Thornton, the CEO of the Clean Energy Council, in May 2017, said:


Renewable energy is now the cheapest kind of new power generation that can be built today—less than both new coal and new gas-fired power plants.


The opposition leader, Mr Shorten, says:


Renewable energy is the cheapest form of new electricity generation.


So I don't understand why the Greens or, indeed, the Labor Party would be disappointed that, having heard their expert advice and opinions on these issues—we have listened carefully—we have taken them at their word and we are now acting on it. Because if they're right—if it is indeed now cheaper to build new renewable energy than it is to build new coal or new gas or other forms of energy production—then all the system of subsidy, support and assistance that the renewable energy sector has received in this country, particularly over the last decade, is now no longer necessary. If they're right and it is cheaper, then the market will decide, and the market will decide in favour of renewable energy. You don't need to force anyone to build new renewable energy—you don't even need to incentivise them to do so—if it is indeed true that renewable energy is, in fact, cheaper than alternative sources of energy.


So all the government has done is accept the advice provided by the Greens, the Labor Party and the renewable energy industry and announced a new policy which finally calls time and draws to an end the era of subsidies for energy—for renewable energy in particular, which has been most generously subsidised over the past decade. We know, for example, that the renewable energy target has been a spectacularly generous form of subsidy for the renewable energy industry. It has been dubbed—I think very appropriately—this week by the Prime Minister and the environment minister as industry policy masquerading as energy policy or environmental policy, because the truth is that this policy was devised and expanded particularly spectacularly under Kevin Rudd's time as Prime Minister as a means of supporting the growth of an industry for industry policy reasons, not really for environmental policy reasons. We know the renewable energy target is in fact a very expensive form of carbon abatement and not a very efficient way of reducing carbon emissions, if that is your major objective.


The renewable energy target will peak in 2020 and come to its natural end in 2030, and it won't be extended by this government. It won't be replaced by this government by any other form of mandate such as the clean energy target, as suggested by some. Instead, it will be replaced by a new policy which puts an appropriate emphasis on two of the other major priorities of energy policy and the things which this government believes should be the top priorities of energy policy: first and foremost, reliability; and, second, affordability.


At the same time, of course, we want to meet our commitments made at the Paris climate change conference to reduce our emissions by at least 26 per cent from 2005 levels, and we are very confident that we will reach that under this policy. We're confident because this policy ensures that there will be continued investment in newer, lower-emissions technology, and we're confident because we believe in technological progress. We believe in innovation. We believe in the wonderful entrepreneurs in the renewable energy sector and elsewhere who are devising new and better ways to produce energy with lower emissions, who don't need subsidies, assistance or intervention by government to ensure that that technology is delivered and rolled out. As we have heard from the Greens, renewable energy advocates and the Labor Party, it is now cheaper to do so.


But a real strength of this policy is that it takes a genuinely agnostic approach towards different sources of reductions in emissions. The truth is the planet doesn't care if those reductions in emissions come about by rolling out a wind farm, rolling out a solar farm, or replacing an old, inefficient, outdated coal-fired power station with a new, more efficient coal-fired power station that has lower emissions. All the planet notices is the reduction in emissions. Indeed, it's true that you can build a new high-efficiency, low-emissions coal-fired power station, including using brown coal in my home state of Victoria, that can reduce emissions from older, out-of-date power stations by up to 40 per cent. A 40 per cent reduction in emissions should be something that everybody who cares about this policy area would welcome. We shouldn't be dogmatic about how the emission reductions come about if our genuine objective is just to reduce emissions. That's why I'm really encouraged by the new policy adopted by the government this week.


I want to finish on one final point. The Greens have accused the government of in this case being unwilling to embrace progress. I've just pointed out how the Greens are unwilling to face progress if the progress happens to be in the form of new, more efficient coal-fired power generation. But, of course, that's not the only area where the Greens are opposed to progress. In fact, you could easily call the Greens an antiscience party, because the Greens are so often against scientific progress if it doesn't fit with their environmental ideology. Coal-fired power stations with new technology are one example of that. Another example of that is genetically modified crops, of which my new colleague from Western Australia, Senator Brockman, spoke about so eloquently this week. It is innovations in agriculture such as the invention of golden rice which have allowed massive productivity gains in agriculture and farming, allowing enormous increases in output that are helping to feed the world better than we have ever been able to feed it before. Of course, the Greens have fought and opposed it every step of the way.


They're opposed to nuclear power. They have irrational fear and hatred of nuclear power and they believe that that's a dangerous technology. It's another example of progress that they oppose. They're even opposed to the harvesting of gas resources, if they're done in new, modern ways, like so-called unconventional coal seam gas extraction, which is working very well in Queensland and which is being used all around the world, particularly in the United States. Indeed, the success of the United States in reducing its emissions, despite the fact that the administration has pulled out of the Paris climate agreement, has come about largely because the US has transitioned to a much heavier use of gas, which produces lower emissions than some alternatives. That has come about because of the shale gas revolution, which, of course, does rely on unconventional means of accessing it. So, it's not the coalition Turnbull government that's opposed to progress; it is the Greens.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:00):  It is sometimes said that amateur psychological diagnoses tell you as much about the person who is making the diagnosis as they do about the subject. I think the same could often be said for the topics the Greens dish up for MPIs. It is telling that a day after a major policy announcement the Greens have given us an MPI not about policy but about the government's polling numbers. It's suggestive of a world view that sees climate change and energy as a campaign issue rather than as a policy issue—a strategy that would prefer to wedge than to achieve outcomes—and I find that disappointing. I've spent perhaps 20 years working, in one way or another, on environmental policy, and that's not how I see climate or energy. 


I don't want to talk about the government's polling numbers, as difficult as they are. The government has dished up a vague, light-on-detail plan for energy, and I want to talk about that instead. Here are three big questions that I think the government needs to answer before the rest of the country can take this energy plan seriously. Big question No. 1 is this: where are the emission cuts going to come from if not from the electricity sector? The plan seems to be built on the idea that the electricity sector will do its share of abatement. But the problem with that is that the sector can make reductions far more economically and efficiently than other sectors in the economy. The government would know this, if it had done any modelling—which it acknowledges it hasn't. Every other exercise, every other detailed government study that's been undertaken by the Treasury to model the approach that we'd take to cost-effectively reduce carbon has shown that the electricity sector is one of the most important places where we can make cost-effective emissions reductions and make sure that the transition to a low-carbon economy is as cost effective as it possibly can be. 


The question we have to ask is this: if there is only, say, a 26 per cent target applied to the electricity sector, where does the rest of the burden land? In the absence of any government modelling or analysis or public information, we can rely on other people like RepuTex, a very important group of analysts. They say that if a 26 per cent target was applied across all sectors of the economy then the modelling indicates the burden to reduce emissions would fall disproportionately on the direct combustion of oil and gas and transport sectors, Australia's emissions growth areas. These sectors would be liable for 31 and 32 per cent of all emission reductions to meet the 2030 target despite only making up 17 and 18 per cent of all emissions. Comparatively, the electricity sector would contribute only 20 per cent of all abatement. In other words, under the government's plan, according to this analysis—and we're waiting to see any government analysis—we won't reach our Paris targets unless there are deep cuts in emissions in other sectors. What's all this going to mean? What will it mean for workers in the manufacturing sector? What will it mean for workers in the transport sector? What will it mean for workers in mining? Or, is the government going to abandon the commitment to the Paris targets? These are questions the government needs to answer. 


The government rhetoric about the price impact of this has all been very certain, and that's the big question No. 2: what impact will this have on prices? The experts, Dr Schott and Mr Pierce, have been relied on by the government for this idea that this is going to save households $115 a year. But when you ask the experts, Dr Schott last night on television said, 'I don't think anyone can guarantee a price reduction,' and Mr Pierce acknowledged that it really just depended on which scenario you were talking about and that in some scenarios you see a much, much smaller price reduction per year for households. The third big question—and perhaps the most important one—is: how long will it be before the government is going to have to capitulate or backflip on elements of this policy to appease the conservative hard Right in its party room?


This plan is clearly half-baked. It needed much more time in development. It needed time for proper modelling. What we've been presented with isn't actually a policy. It's a high-level internal summary that you might write before you go off and do the work to produce a real policy. Year 12 students all across the country are sitting their HSC exams right now. If one of them handed in this plan as part of their assessment, they would be asked, 'Where is the rest?' In truth, this is nothing more than a bunch of ideas that are going to be 'worked up', in the language of the minister, in the lead-up to COAG. The Prime Minister has claimed it was developed by the Energy Security Board, but that entity was only formed in September. Why has the government served up a half-finished plan? I'll tell you what I think: they couldn't afford another week of the member of Warringah talking about energy policy and the government not actually having a response.


Former Prime Minister Abbott has had far more success controlling the political agenda from the backbench than he ever had in office, and that is a consequence of the weakness of this Prime Minister. What we see in response to all of this is a political fix for an internal political problem. It is about isolating and fixing the problem of the former Prime Minister, and it is not about solving the energy crisis that they've allowed to develop on their watch.


The coalition don't have strong views about whether or not this is a good policy solution. They actually don't care. This is a good political solution, and they will presumably be willing to change it, to gut it or to abandon it when the former Prime Minister moves the goal posts on the current Prime Minister once again. It's what we've seen on every other occasion. It's what happened on the ETS. It's what Mr Abbott did to him on the EIS—remember that? Mr Frydenberg came out and said, 'I'd be willing to consider it,' but within 24 hours he was forced to retract that. He said, 'Oh, no, we're not considering it.' It's certainly what happened to the clean energy target, the CET—remember that? It's also what happened on the RET.


We now understand, with quite some precision, how the life cycle of the Prime Minister's policy ideas work. There is a day or two of a media sugar hit. It feels pretty good and people perk up a bit. Then we all start to hear the gentle hissing sound as the air escapes from the balloon and the responsible minister, in this case poor Mr Frydenberg—for whom I do feel some sympathy—is left holding the policy. It's my prediction that this energy policy will go the same way.


Back in 2004, the writer Ron Suskind interviewed an unnamed White House aide. He later identified that aide as Karl Rove. It's one of my favourite quotes, because I think it really defines the mindset of conservatives in politics at the moment. Mr Suskind wrote:


The aide said that guys like me were ""in what we call the reality-based community,"" which he defined as people who ""believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality."" … ""That's not the way the world really works anymore,"" he continued. ""We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you're studying that reality—judiciously, as you will—we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors … and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.""


It's a very muscular approach to politics, isn't it—a very arrogant belief that you can escape the gravity of facts. But I'll tell you what you can't escape. You can't escape gravity, and you can't escape facts.


This government has decided to avoid the judicious study of discernible reality. In fact, it seems to hold contempt for reality, for the trends that are emerging globally in energy policy. After years of ignoring the problems in Australia's energy sector, the government has just acted—no modelling, no planning, no consultation. I'll tell you what. It didn't go that well for Karl Rove, and I doubt it will for this Prime Minister either.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-10-18,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (17:10):  The key function of being a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia is to listen. This morning I retweeted a quote from a self-styled energy activist, Mr Luis Aramburu, who boldly and correctly said: 


The green fringe is against:


Coal


…


Natural gas


Nuclear


and even hydro. What do they want? The starvation of most of humanity?


Mr Aramburu sums up the Australian political landscape so clearly. This country is being consumed by the green fringe, contrary to what people want, and that is the real reason political parties are sliding. We see that at both state and federal level and in the churning of government. The truth behind poll numbers is that both the ALP and the LNP are sliding, not just the LNP. The ALP's primary votes are dwelling in the low 30s. Why? Why are numbers so low?


The reason is that Australian political parties have taken a lurch to the left, abandoned Australian values and trashed common sense, becoming destroyers of humanity, not builders of humanity. Parties have embraced Marxism, and everyday Aussies have had a gutful. No new dams and no new coal-fired power stations are being built. Gas is off the radar, and we won't consider nuclear. Instead, successive governments have relied on the hope and prayer of the sun shining or the wind blowing, and our economy is now paying the price.


The current ruin of our economy shows why the political parties are suffering with poor poll numbers. It is the opposite to the picture painted by this Greens motion. The secret to increasing poll numbers, as history shows, is not to embrace more whacky-backy Greens tripe but to repudiate it, cast it aside, reject it and denounce it. In its place, we should suggest a progressive view of humanity that hopes for and relies on the best of society, a vision of where we once were, a proud nation, united under one vision to build a successful future based on jobs for everyone in a safe and secure society.


We can only build this type of vision that unites Australians when we listen to what Australians need. People tell us they need cheap power, yet not everyone in the chamber is—in fact, few are—apt to be listening. For example, Senator McGrath came into the chamber recently and carried on about where Liberal Party senators live across Queensland, as if that mattered. For what it's worth, Liberal senators could live on the moon, because, from what we see, it doesn't matter where LNP parliamentarians live; they still don't listen to rural and regional Queenslanders around them.


If the Liberals and Nationals listened to people, they would realise that Australians and Queenslanders want the renewable energy target dumped now, not in three years when electricity prices have doubled as a result of the new policy. They want it dumped now. If they would listen, they would learn that people are worried about electricity prices and that to focus solely on reliability instead of price is folly. When the process of delivering a service is improved, the reliability of that service goes up, and the price of that service goes down. We need to work on the process. What we are doing here with this government, this opposition and the Greens is tinkering with the fundamentals and destroying it.


The Greens created a problem that doesn't exist to force action that's not needed. In their rush for seeking Greens preferences, both the LNP and the ALP have fallen for the climate con and now the energy con. Instead of relying on unsupported opinions, we must base policy on solid data that will withstand scrutiny. Human progress depends on cheap energy. That has been shown for 170 years. Now, in the last 10 years, we have reversed that. One Nation's message to Senator McGrath and the general body politic is clear: to win votes and reduce the cost of power, take action today. We can come over to your office, Senator McGrath, and give feedback we've heard from Queenslanders as we travel around our state. Our door is always open, as should be everyone's in this chamber.

Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:15):  I have to say to my good friend Senator Roberts: you are nothing if not consistent. You've come into this chamber consistently, you've had a consistent view and you've maintained that view. I don't believe anything I say or do will be able to change your view. Nonetheless, I will give it a go because we live in hope, Senator. I hope that by the time you leave this Senate your views on this issue will have evolved and changed. I suspect by next week they won't have.




Senator McKim:
  Was that a valedictory speech?




Senator DASTYARI:
  I'll take that interjection. The interjection was, 'Was that a valedictory speech?' I don't believe it was. I understand the tradition for valedictory speeches is they are not cut off at 20 minutes. I believe it will be an exciting four or five hours when and if Senator Roberts delivers a valedictory speech in this chamber. He will take some of the Americans on for time.


What we have seen is a government that will hold, and has held, every single different possible position when it comes to the issue of climate change and the issue of tackling the energy crisis that Australia is facing. It is true that any pressure or ability to lower prices is something that should be welcomed, but I just want to say that the gap between what has been promised and what is being delivered by this government is astronomical. Again, while people under financial pressure should welcome and do welcome anything that's going to make their lives better, let's put this in perspective.


We heard Senator Brandis refer to the government's own experts yesterday. The government's own experts came out overnight and were talking about something in the vicinity of 50 cents a week being saved—50 cents a week! I said this morning that this is soft serve savings. This is enough money to buy a soft serve ice cream. Actually, I have to correct the record: it's not enough to buy a soft serve ice cream. A soft serve ice cream at McDonald's is now 60 cents—it's not even 50 cents any more. I'm as shocked as you are, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams! I can see it in your face. That's where things are at after the big promise and the big process we've gone through. The government has held every single position at a different point in time and the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, has done the same.


Just a few weeks ago, we were told by the Prime Minister that a clean energy target—these were the Prime Minister's own words—'would certainly work'. They were the Prime Minister's own words. The minister, Mr Frydenberg, from the other place, told us that a clean energy target would reduce electricity prices. He went on to say that Dr Finkel has shown his mechanism is to reduce emissions and, increasingly important today, ensure the stability of the system as it undergoes dramatic change. The recommendation at the heart of the Finkel process and at the heart of the Finkel report, was this idea that we were going to have a clean energy target. It's not good enough for the government to say 'we adopted everything else'. The government adopted all the easy stuff, and the one that was going to make the most significant difference, the clean energy target, was the one part of the process that wasn't adopted. Just in the last parliamentary session, we were told that the answer to Australia's energy needs was to keep the Liddell power station open, a coal-fired power station; words that, surprisingly, in this session of parliament don't even pass their lips. In the last session of parliament, it was all about Liddell, Liddell, Liddell. Now, it's not. It sometimes feels strange to be on this side of the chamber, arguing some of these points when normally these are arguments made by those on the other side of the chamber. The idea that a commercial company makes a commercial decision not to go ahead with a power plant for the sole reason that they don't believe it's in their commercial interests to do so, and to have a centre-right government turn around and say 'no, they should be forced to keep it open' because of ideology, when the economics of it aren't even stacking up, is, I think, somewhat concerning. 


The problem with the government's energy politics is they just haven't caught up with the reality that is the future of energy economics. Let's remind ourselves: 10 years ago, there was a bipartisan consensus over the need for an emissions trading system of some kind and for climate action—10 years ago that consensus existed. Under Prime Minister Howard and Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Turnbull—that's right, the same gentleman who is now the Prime Minister of Australia, and Mr Howard was the Prime Minister then—the political contest was about which party would do more on climate change. This was in the lead-up to the 2007 election. Within 10 years, Australia has some of the world's highest power prices and some of the world's worst pollution per capita. 


I want to touch on the issue of the clean energy target, because I think the Finkel report really outlined the significance of having a holistic approach that looks at including these types of measures. The Finkel clean energy target renewables would have been around 42 per cent of our total generation—42 per cent of our total generation. Mr Finkel—as I know you are aware is the Chief Scientist and about as nonpartisan as one can be—recommended a clean energy target because it would keep power prices lower, cut pollution and create jobs in renewables. Yesterday, the PM not only turned his back on his own Chief Scientist and a clean energy target that had the support of groups across the community but also on the renewable energy industry. The future of energy innovation and science in this country has paid for the forfeit of the coalition party room troglodytes. The Prime Minister has come up with a policy that will strangle renewable energy investment in jobs in this country and, instead, has embraced former Prime Minister Abbott's vision of where to head on these matters. The Prime Minister has, in his very typical way, gone with the worst possible option, walking away from a clean energy target. And what has happened as a result of this? Investors are in the lurch. As much as the government likes to pretend that somehow there has now been some certainty created, no certainty has been created by a haphazard policy that has simply been reached in a bid to settle the quarrels within the conservative side of politics. It's left investors in the lurch, it's certainly left business in the lurch, and it's made the job for Australia of reducing our emissions much more difficult. 


The Finkel review noted that, even under the chaotic business-as-usual scenario modelling by Finkel, renewables would have made up nearly 40 per cent of generation capacity. Under the government's plan announced yesterday, renewables will make up just 28 per cent of power generation in 2030 and 36 per cent under the most optimistic proposal that can be put forward. Indeed, there may be no additional renewable energy capacity built beyond what is driven by the existing renewable energy target, which will cease in 2020. 


We, on this side of politics, have been offering bipartisan support to the government for months on proper energy policy. Suddenly, without proper notice, we are expected to support the latest thought bubble from the government, without modelling and without appropriate research. The government doesn't want to have bipartisanship on this issue. They don't want to have that. What they want to have isn't a settlement across Australia; they want desperately to find a settlement within their own party.


Just to touch on what a Labor government would do and what a Shorten Labor government would do: there is a recognition that we have to modernise the energy market laws to give more power to consumers and we have to create renewable energy zones to drive investment. We need to change the Clean Energy Finance Corporation investment return benchmark so they can invest in more generation and storage projects. And, while the government is so tied up fighting with itself and blaming everyone else, Labor has to focus and will continue to focus on a positive alternative to tackle power prices. I thank the Senate for debating this issue.

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2017-10-18,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (17:25):  I would like to kick off where Senator Dastyari started. I look forward to that very constructive, positive alternative approach to bringing down power prices, because to date I have seen nothing. I have seen a history lesson—raking over the coals of history; pardon the pun—in this debate. There has been talk of every position the government has had when it comes to energy policy, focusing on the past rather than actually talking about what they would do as an alternative government as the people who aspire to sit on this side of the chamber. It's all about history; it's not about the future, it's all about division and political pointscoring. It is not about solving the issues that face the Australian community.


After sitting here for the last 20 minutes or so, one interesting observation I can make is that with Senator Roberts on one side saying our policy does not go far enough and on the other side and at the other end of the spectrum Labor and the Greens saying we don't do enough, maybe we have some balance there. Maybe we are approaching things the right way in the interests of the majority of Australians, people who pay power bills and who are struggling to pay those power bills. The point I want to make is this: it's all about certainty. It is about providing that environment of certainty for those who generate the electricity, the market players. They need to be able to invest their money with some certainty so we can plan for the future. It's about having a reliable energy source. It's about having certainty, and knowing that when we flick the switch the lights are going to come on, the factory can start operating at 6 am or whenever it opens up and the jobs are going to be there. It is also about certainty about the price, that we are not going to see incredible increases into the future.


My colleagues have gone over history a little bit already. Every time we talk about energy, I like to talk about a bit of history from my perspective. In my home state of Tasmania, there is a great publication known as the Hobart Mercury newspaper. They published an article on 20 October 1981, a little while ago, entitled 'Coal-fired power best option'. It was written by a gentleman by the name of Wayne Crawford. It says: 'Tasmania's environmental lobby has expressed preferences for coal-fired thermal power generation over construction of more hydro power dams. The director of the Tasmanian Wilderness Society, Dr Bob Brown, said yesterday that if there was to be a new power station, then coal-fired thermal was the best centralised option we have.' He then went on to say, that the conservation movement regarded a coal-fired thermal station as 'manifestly better than more dams.'


Later on in the article, it talks about cutting back the consumption of power, because that's the answer. It is not about catering to the demands of a growing society where we have more people living in our communities. It is about cutting back on demands. Dr Brown said, 'The environmental movement believed that if Tasmania's electricity's consumption now'—at that point in time, 'is the highest per capita in the world, it could be cut back by 15 per cent through an energy-saving program.' There would also be no need for new power schemes. I'm not a big fan of that idea. Given the way the world is going, with the demands society has, increasing technology and the like, we should be catering to those demands, and we can. We have the resources, we have the technology, we should be catering to it.


Later on in the article, it says that the coal-fired power station would 'provide more jobs over a longer period' and could be built more quickly than a hydro scheme and would give the state more flexibility in its power generation. I won't go on about that too long but I think it is great to just reflect on that a little bit. It was the former Australian Greens leader, former Senator Bob Brown, who was being talked about earlier today by my good friend and colleague over there, who advocated for more coal-fired power stations and no more renewable energy in the form of hydro power. It was only a year or two later that we had the Franklin Dam dispute, which saw halted the construction of a dam which would have saved Tasmania the energy woes that we went through a couple of years ago. But, as I say, that's all history.


Going back to the question of certainty—giving energy certainty around the investments they can make, having the ability to know that we will have dispatchable base-load power when it is needed—I heard Audrey Zibelman say that the current situation is not sustainable if we are to actually tackle the cost of power. When we look at situations like the one we had in South Australia and other situations on the National Electricity Market—where demand is far outstripping supply with intermittent renewables—the options for the market operator, Ms Zibelman, to pursue are limited. She pointed to gas-fired power generation and the high cost attached to that, and she used the words that this was 'the most inefficient way of doing it'. So Ms Zibelman, being one of the contributors to the policy, the plan that's been set out here that has been announced by the government, has found a way to provide that certainty. I think that is a great thing.


I want also to talk about the issue of cost—the savings that have been discussed here and the aim of bringing down the price of power. The Energy Security Board has indicated to us that the savings could be in the order of $100 to $115 a year. That's a lot of money. When the Community Affairs Committee considers things like reductions in welfare support, many on the other side of the chamber will point out that reductions of 50c cents or $1 in support payments to people make a massive difference when they have a stretched income. So why is it so bad to find a savings in one's power bill, even if it as little as Senator Dastyari and others have said—50 cents? They are the same people who in these debates say that the welfare reforms that have been proposed, which have resulted in some reductions to people who depend on those payments, will stretch the budget—but, no, we shouldn't pass on a saving in any shape or form when it comes to the household power bill!


I, like most other Tasmanians, have seen a massive increase in my power bills. It's not as big an issue for me as it is for many other Tasmanians. I happen to be a member of the Australian Senate and I'm paid very well—and that's on the public record. My winter-quarter power bill was $3,000. The more recent bill was $2,900—and I don't think that's because power prices have gone down; I think it's because I've been encouraging my three boys to turn the lights out more. But this is the thing: power bills are so significant in my home state, where we have largely renewables based energy generation. We have a plan to actually bring down the cost of power. We are talking about ways that will impact on the cost of power for households and for businesses. We will be able to continue to support businesses and manufacturing, so that people can pay their bills.


We talk about subsidies for renewable energy as well. Labor's plan would see $66 billion in subsidies paid to support renewable energy generation. Where does that come from? It comes from either the taxpayer or from energy users, the consumers. Someone is going to pay; this money doesn't just appear. And that's what Labor are proposing—unlike our plan, which removes those subsidies. Senator Paterson, earlier in the debate, highlighted the comments made by proponents of renewable energy. Coming from a state where renewable energy is generated as much as it is, it is great to hear that that it is one of the cheapest forms of energy in Australia. There is the case made to remove those subsidies. So why does the opposition cling to this need to prop up this sector of the energy generation industry with subsidies to the tune of $66 billion?


Yesterday, one of my colleagues from Tasmania, Senator Singh, claimed that that money should go to supporting the 28,000 jobs that could be developed in the renewable energy sector. That's a lot of money for each of those jobs. That is $66 billion of your money, Mr Acting Deputy President, either as a power user or as a taxpayer.


We do have a plan. My friends on the other side have, as usual, wanted to go over the history of how we arrived here, rather than being constructive and positive about the future—though I note Senator Dastyari did promise there would be a positive alternative approach taken by Labor when it comes to reducing the price of power. I look forward to that coming out in the near future while this debate is on foot, because we can't consider things in isolation. They are all inextricably linked—affordability, reliability and meeting our international obligations. (Time expired)

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2017-10-18,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (17:35):  I rise to contribute to this matter of public importance discussion. The Prime Minister yesterday announced the government's new energy plan or policy. We don't have the details of it; we don't have the modelling. The Prime Minister wants us believe that perhaps this will save householders money—maybe 50c by the year 2020, if they're lucky. Of course, what we do know is that one of the best ways of reducing electricity prices is to help people put solar panels on their roofs and batteries in their backyards. If this were really about helping everyday Australians and small businesses to reduce their power bills, that's what this government would be doing. But, instead, the Turnbull government has taken the axe to the renewable energy sector.


I stand here as a very proud South Australian. Our state is the renewables state. The investment from the renewable industry into our state has been in the vicinity of billions and billions of dollars, with billions and billions to come if, indeed, the industry is able to get on with the job of providing clean, reliable and affordable renewable energy to customers, to householders and to businesses across the state. Hopefully, if we're able to have a properly built interconnector between South Australia and New South Wales, which we desperately need, we might also be able to export that green power interstate as well. But what we've had from the Turnbull government is just another attack on South Australians, on South Australian businesses, on our industry and on South Australian jobs.


Make no mistake, an ideological war within the Turnbull government—fuelled, of course, by the ghost of the former Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, lurking in the dark shadows, making problems and trouble for the Prime Minister—is why this policy is in place. This government is obsessed with doing everything it can to keep alive a dying coal industry. At a time when we are meant to be reducing pollution and cutting emissions, we have the Prime Minister of Australia, because he is scared of the antics of the former Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, wanting to prop up the coal industry. The last thing we should be doing is throwing good money after bad to fund more coal-fired power stations and even open the world's largest coalmine with Adani. Make no mistake, this policy announced by the government yesterday is more about a turf war inside the Liberal Party than it is about reducing the electricity bills of Australian households or doing anything to combat and deal with global warming and climate change and to reduce pollution.


We all know—the experts have said it time and time again—that the reason electricity prices are high in this country is that the big, old power companies have been price gouging and ripping off customers for years. They've been able to get away with it because the government have turned a blind eye. Now the government want to use taxpayers' money to give subsidies to coal power, throwing good money after bad and attacking the renewable energy industry on their way through. This will cost South Australians jobs—no doubt about it. This will cost South Australians investment money, and the Greens will do everything we can to stand up to this reckless, irresponsible and politically ridiculous plan from the government.


If you want to reduce electricity bills, help people put solar on their roofs and batteries in their backyards. That's the best way of ensuring that householders and small businesses can afford their renewable energy, and they also get to help the planet as well because it's clean, it's renewable and it's cheap. But this is an ideological war from the government, just as we've seen already today with their ideological obsession with beating up on the ABC. Today in this place the government tabled legislation from the deal they did with One Nation to take the axe to the ABC. This is a government that is obsessed with ideological warfare inside their own party room. It's Tony Abbott and the other right-wing nut jobs in the backbench of the Liberal Party—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  Point of order. Excuse me, Senator Hanson-Young.




Senator McKim:
  You can't take a point of order from the chair.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Sorry. My apologies. Resume your seat, Senator Hanson-Young. I bring your attention to the debating rules, on referring to those in the other place with respect. I have raised this many times. I ask you to take that in consideration when you speak for the duration of your time.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. There is ideological warfare going on inside the Liberal Party, and it's between the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the former Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, and his merry men, right-wing nut jobs on the backbench of the National and Liberal parties.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young, resume your seat. Under standing order 193, you can't make imputations against those in the other place or here. It would be beneficial if you withdrew that statement you just made about those in the other place.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I'm happy to not repeat those words, but I don't understand how those who were involved in ideological warfare over right-wing politics are not right-wing nut jobs.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Hanson-Young, repeating it doesn't help one bit.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Hang on. I'm speaking. I draw your attention to standing order 193, on showing respect to those in the other place as well as here. You may continue, but if you do it in future I'm going to ask you to withdraw. Is that clear? Continue.




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. What we've got is an ideological war, and it is holding this parliament to ransom. We've got the government introducing legislation to cut the ABC, demanded by One Nation, and now we've got the government wanting to give taxpayer money to keep open coalmines and coal-fired power stations. It's an ideological war, and it's holding the parliament and the future of this country to ransom.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (17:44):  The Prime Minister's capitulation to the coal industry will be an unmitigated disaster for my state of Tasmania. This, on the face of it, takes the axe to the renewable energy target, which means that a number of new renewable projects that are in the pipeline in Tasmania will now have a business case that will be compromised or at least not as promising as it would otherwise have been. It means that Hydro Tasmania, the Tasmanian government owned electricity generation business, will lose a flow of renewable energy certificate revenue from 2030, and ultimately this will mean less renewable energy in Tasmania, fewer opportunities for Tasmanians, fewer jobs in Tasmania and less capacity for Tasmania to play a significant role in displacing coal-fired power from the national grid.


So it's an unmitigated disaster for Tasmania. It's an unmitigated disaster for the renewable energy sector in this country. And that sound we can hear—there it goes!—is the corks popping in the boardrooms of coal companies in this country.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:45):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


This is the Australian Hearing report for 2016-17. Australian Hearing is, of course, the very body that the government originally wanted to flog off, to privatise, and I am particularly glad that the government have changed their mind on that. Australian Hearing has received absolutely overwhelming support from people who have accessed its services, particularly parents of children who receive the excellent services from Australian Hearing. But I want, for the short time that I've got available, to concentrate on the work that Australian Hearing has been doing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and in particular for regional and remote communities.


Australian Hearing is the service provider for many Aboriginal communities. People have heard me speak in this place very often on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' hearing. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are disproportionately impacted by their hearing. Hearing has a direct impact on people's opportunities in life, and there is a direct correlation between hearing, Aboriginal people's hearing in particular, and the justice system. One of the assessments that was done around this issue was of Aboriginal people in the Darwin Correctional Centre, and 92 per cent of the Aboriginal people in that correctional centre had a hearing impairment or were deaf.


The association there is, in particular, because people are affected by otitis media. Young children get it. Very young babies, babies around three weeks old, can get it. This is then associated with a hearing impairment, which, if left unaddressed, affects their ability, their numeracy and literacy skills. If you have a hearing impairment, it affects your learning abilities. Your brain allocates the space to something else. So if Aboriginal children in particular don't get that support, because they're not identified as having a hearing loss, they end up going to school behind, not having developed their literacy and numeracy skills to the level of those of their peers, and they fall behind in school. It's quite a well-articulated process. That is why it is so important and why I, for one, fought so hard, along with many others, to ensure that Australian Hearing continued as an entity.


Australian Hearing do vital work in Aboriginal communities. I was pleased to note, in some of the statistics that they put out for 2016-17 about what Australian Hearing do, that they provided services to 4,944 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people under the age of 26. Of course, the community service obligation is for those under the age of 26. Again, I am significantly pleased that sometimes you see progress in this place, as when the government increased that age from 21 to 26 in response to excellent work that the community affairs committee did. Yes, I am blowing the trumpet of the community affairs committee in this instance because a number of positive things in terms of hearing came out of that, and one of those was to increase that age from 21 to 26 for young Australians. That represented 14.6 per cent of the total number of children and young adults who received services from Australian Hearing. Let's point out that the percentage of Aboriginal children in the population of Australia is much less than that, showing the disproportionate number of Aboriginal children who receive support because of the particular circumstances of Aboriginal children's hearing. So I'm pleased to see that there was an overall increase of five per cent in the total number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children seen. In my book, it is very important that we are seeing an increasing number of children because that means that more children are being treated. It's very important work that Australian Hearing does. I congratulate them for the work that they do. I want to see more and more effort put in to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children's hearing, in particular, because it's so important, if we are going to address disadvantage, that we address that particular issue. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2017-10-18,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (17:57):  On behalf of Senator Sterle, I would like to present the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on the state of Australia's rail industry together with the Hansard record of proceedings and the documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator KIM CARR:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


On behalf of the committee, may I just thank the committee members and Senator Sterle, who, of course, chaired the committee. I think it's demonstrated that this is a committee that works particularly well on behalf of this parliament. This report into the Australian rail industry showed that this is an area in which we're able to gather evidence and reach a unanimous decision in support of recommendations, which are before the chamber at the moment.


I'd like to thank the witnesses for their testimony and the committee secretariat for their hard work in producing this report. Can I in particular take this opportunity to mention the former Senator Back, who participated in this inquiry, and of course Senator O'Sullivan, who stepped into his place in terms of working through the issues, which has led to us being able to bring forward a unanimous report. I would also like to acknowledge Mr Glenn Thompson from the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union for his fierce public advocacy of the industry and the need to take action on this issue.


The committee, as I said, has produced a unanimous set of recommendations, and, as I said, it's a great opportunity here in the Senate to provide advice to the parliament. I hope the major parties in this parliament are able to take up that advice and provide direction for future government programs. I trust that this will be a matter that will be discussed at the forthcoming election that happens whenever that occurs, and I am hopeful that we are able to take advantage of what's been a 17-month inquiry where we have seen very substantive numbers of submissions and very detailed public hearings.


We heard from over 30 witnesses from industry, from government and from unions. We heard from workers on the shop floor in the railway workshops across the country. Overwhelmingly, all the witnesses—no matter what different companies they represented or what aspect of the industry they represented—testified that action needed to be taken to preserve the strategic capabilities of Australian rail manufacturing.


We know that railways have been very much at the heart of our national politics for a very long time. We understand, for instance, that in colonial times the difference in the rail gauges was one of the reasons that the six colonies decided to federate as the Commonwealth of Australia. What's disappointing is that, some 116 years later, we still haven't resolved some of those big differences between the states, especially around issues of procurement.


The plight of rail manufacturing is akin, in my judgement, to the plight of shipbuilding in this country. It is absolutely essential that we build a sovereign, national capability in rail manufacturing, as we have sought to do in naval shipbuilding. Australia has 150 years of experience in design, manufacturing and maintenance of railways and rolling stock. But the railway manufacturing industry is now facing a valley of death similar to that which has loomed at various points in shipbuilding. The industry employs 5,000 workers, with some 7,000 workers tied up in the supply chain. There are 3,000 jobs that have regrettably been lost in the past decade. Job losses have been particularly severe in regional Australia, in places like Newcastle, Rockhampton, Mackay, Townsville, Maryborough in Queensland, Ballarat and Bendigo. In fact, we have also seen Maryborough in Victoria suffer as a result of the deterioration in the industry. It's essentially because there have been insubstantial numbers of contracts. Investment by the Commonwealth and states in passenger and rail projects is expected to exceed $100 billion in the next two decades. So there is absolutely no reason for this, given the scale of investment that we can anticipate will occur in this country, with regard to projects that are being undertaken both by the Commonwealth and by the states across the Commonwealth of Australia. That's actually greater than the national spend on the Naval Shipbuilding Plan, which is $90 billion over 30 years.


I notice that Senator Sterle is now in the chair. Of course, this is exactly the evidence presented to the inquiry.


The difference, of course, is that in rail manufacturing there has been a lock in on this boom-bust cycle because the procurement decisions made by state and territory governments over many years have not recognised the need to actually build a national market and a national approach to the development of our industrial capabilities. We have, in fact, a situation where the purchasing decisions are taken by state governments on the basis of a very fragmented approach—fragmented in terms of the training opportunities, fragmented with regard to the research and development that's occurring within the industry and, of course, very fragmented in terms of the purchasing. The purchasing power that comes from these various government contracts has been lost. That's not even to begin to consider what's happening in the freight area, where our major resource projects are relying very heavily upon the importation of very, very significant numbers of rail cars from imported sources. We have state governments that all too often look towards the purchase of rolling stock from overseas. They don't consider the issue of the whole-of-life costs of contract; they rather look at the very limited, narrow view. Of course, that undermines our capacity to develop a sovereign capability.


Industries like rail manufacturing just don't emerge in a vacuum. It takes a commitment from governments at all levels. It takes a commitment to plan, to ensure that we keep jobs and skills and capabilities here in this country, and that we develop the necessary supply chains, efficiencies and the skills of our people so we can actually enjoy the benefit of what is, largely, government procurement. Similar lessons apply to private procurement, especially in regard to the resources sector.


The Australian government must develop—this is the recommendation of this report, which was unanimously agreed to—a national rail manufacturing industry plan to maximise the benefit of the $100 billion investment that's expected to be seen in this country over the next two decades. The plan should include a mechanism to remove those peaks and troughs in demand to create certainty for manufacturers and to encourage the investment by companies in Australia to secure the future for employment in the industry and to secure the capacity in the industry so we can be competitive and produce the rolling stock that we actually need.



We've seen in recent times that much has been made in regard to the use of steel in railways. We've seen in cases in recent times where state governments have actually imported the very steel that's used for railways. It's simply a situation that is unnecessary and ought not continue. States and territory governments need to endorse the plan, and under the proposals advanced in this report there is an opportunity here to agree on methods of supporting and resourcing such a national approach. A national rail procurement strategy should be able to complement such a plan, and such a strategy would need to be coordinated through the procurement contracts of the states and territories consistent with our international trade obligations. It would allow for the development of the necessary capabilities, particularly for our small- and medium-sized enterprises, and it would mean that we could maximise local content in the manufacture of passenger, freight and light rail rolling stock. That includes, in my judgement, trams as well. That's consistent with the very position that's outlined in the Commonwealth Procurement Rules and to ensure that we have the whole-of-life costs and quality examined, and also questions on innovation and environmental sustainability. Such an approach would require contractors to implement proper training programs for apprentices and engineering cadets. Such a method would also see us develop the necessary management of supply chains. I seek leave to continue my remarks. (Time expired)

Senator RICE



(
Victoria
) (
18:07
):  I also stand to support this very important report. I commend the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee for the work that we've undertaken in bringing this report to fruition. I also want to commend Senator Carr for his advocacy and determination to have this really important subject put here and to have the outcomes of this report here for the Senate to consider.


The reason I think this is so important is because of the potential of the rail industry: the economic potential, the environmental potential and the social potential. We know that there is going to be a continued growth in rail across the country. There is $46 billion that's already there for rail projects that are going to occur and the $100 billion that can be mapped out over the next two decades. If you look at the direction—because of all the advantages—of rail, I would say that $100 billion is an underestimate, because we know that as part of shifting the way that we run our transport systems to a more sustainable future—in particular, decarbonising our transport systems—that rail has an incredibly important role to play.


So we can see the potential for future rail projects in suburban areas. We can see the potential of future rail projects connecting up regional centres. We can see the upgrading in systems in our interstate rail systems. We can see that there is cross-party support for the inland rail project. All of these sorts of project, whether passenger or freight, are becoming increasingly supported. There is increasing agreement across the political spectrum of the need to be having an increase in the amount of rail, both heavy rail and light rail. From the perspective of wanting to see increasing jobs, increasing employment, increasing economic activity and increasing attempts to reduce carbon pollution, rail has obviously got an incredibly healthy future. 


There's the potential, but what do we need to do to realise that potential? That's where this report has really outlined what needs to happen. In particular, it has outlined the role of the Commonwealth and the role of national governments to be able to play a coordinating role and to bring together the investments that will be made by state governments. One of the factors, when you are looking at transport across the country, is that so many the decisions get made at a state level, so they can be made in isolation from each other. But the Commonwealth can play such an important role in getting the states working together so that we can be maximising that potential. As the evidence presented to our inquiry pointed out, where we can get uniformity, where we can get some states talking to each other and agreeing on some uniform standards, we can really move forward in getting the local industry to be building up an industry that can fulfil the delivery of parts of the rail industry, whether it is rolling stock, whether it's the rails—everything to do with the rail industry. The need for a national rail plan underpins that—and from that plan, having the procurement strategy. The national procurement strategy is going to be a difficult job. It will be difficult to get all of the different players in the same room and say: 'Okay, let's nut out what this procurement strategy is, so we can really maximise the potential of the industry. How do we maximise the economic benefit, maximise the amount of local content, maximise the amount of jobs, and maximise the amount of training opportunities involved in amplifying the amount of rail that's in the country?' 


I am hopeful that—the committee having done the work and presenting this report today—it will really be a landmark that will enable us to move forward so that we can then agree that the future for rail has got so much potential that can be realised. I am hopeful about having the Commonwealth involved in a plan, in a strategy, and getting the states to endorse that strategy. I know getting the states to work together with the Commonwealth can be tricky, but it can be done. And I think that, when the benefits are there and outlined for everyone to see—the potential of having a particular state that might specialise in a particular area and then be selling to the other states, bringing the states together to actually work through this—then the difficulties will be overcome. It will be such an important part of our economic activity in the country in the future. Very sadly, this week we are seeing the very final end of the car manufacturing industry in Australia. So we are looking at the landscape and thinking, 'Where are we going to have advanced manufacturing? What is the potential part of the economy where there is a realistic chance, not just pie-in-the-sky thoughts of where it's possible?' The rail industry is where it's possible.


This is particularly so because so much of the procurement is done by state governments. Where you've got governments, they've got the control to be able to say: 'Let's work together, let's do this sensibly, let's make sure we have really high-skilled local manufacturing here that will bring the jobs with it, that will bring the economic activity with it and that will enable us to meet our sustainability outcomes that we know will enable us to have that homegrown industry. The expansion of the rail industry for passenger and freight will enable us to shift our transport system to a 100 per cent renewable energy powered transport system that's based on a really thriving rail industry here in the country. 


I really do commend this report to the Senate and I look forward to its recommendations being enacted. I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

There is $46 billion that's already there for rail projects that are going to occur and the $100 billion that can be mapped out over the next two decades. If you look at the direction—because of all the advantages—of rail, I would say that $100 billion is an underestimate, because we know that as part of shifting the way that we run our transport systems to a more sustainable future—in particular, decarbonising our transport systems—that rail has an incredibly important role to play.


So we can see the potential for future rail projects in suburban areas. We can see the potential of future rail projects connecting up regional centres. We can see the upgrading in systems in our interstate rail systems. We can see that there is cross-party support for the inland rail project. All of these sorts of project, whether passenger or freight, are becoming increasingly supported. There is increasing agreement across the political spectrum of the need to be having an increase in the amount of rail, both heavy rail and light rail. From the perspective of wanting to see increasing jobs, increasing employment, increasing economic activity and increasing attempts to reduce carbon pollution, rail has obviously got an incredibly healthy future. 


There's the potential, but what do we need to do to realise that potential? That's where this report has really outlined what needs to happen. In particular, it has outlined the role of the Commonwealth and the role of national governments to be able to play a coordinating role and to bring together the investments that will be made by state governments. One of the factors, when you are looking at transport across the country, is that so many the decisions get made at a state level, so they can be made in isolation from each other. But the Commonwealth can play such an important role in getting the states working together so that we can be maximising that potential. As the evidence presented to our inquiry pointed out, where we can get uniformity, where we can get some states talking to each other and agreeing on some uniform standards, we can really move forward in getting the local industry to be building up an industry that can fulfil the delivery of parts of the rail industry, whether it is rolling stock, whether it's the rails—everything to do with the rail industry. The need for a national rail plan underpins that—and from that plan, having the procurement strategy. The national procurement strategy is going to be a difficult job. It will be difficult to get all of the different players in the same room and say: 'Okay, let's nut out what this procurement strategy is, so we can really maximise the potential of the industry. How do we maximise the economic benefit, maximise the amount of local content, maximise the amount of jobs, and maximise the amount of training opportunities involved in amplifying the amount of rail that's in the country?' 


I am hopeful that—the committee having done the work and presenting this report today—it will really be a landmark that will enable us to move forward so that we can then agree that the future for rail has got so much potential that can be realised. I am hopeful about having the Commonwealth involved in a plan, in a strategy, and getting the states to endorse that strategy. I know getting the states to work together with the Commonwealth can be tricky, but it can be done. And I think that, when the benefits are there and outlined for everyone to see—the potential of having a particular state that might specialise in a particular area and then be selling to the other states, bringing the states together to actually work through this—then the difficulties will be overcome. It will be such an important part of our economic activity in the country in the future. Very sadly, this week we are seeing the very final end of the car manufacturing industry in Australia. So we are looking at the landscape and thinking, 'Where are we going to have advanced manufacturing? What is the potential part of the economy where there is a realistic chance, not just pie-in-the-sky thoughts of where it's possible?' The rail industry is where it's possible.


This is particularly so because so much of the procurement is done by state governments. Where you've got governments, they've got the control to be able to say: 'Let's work together, let's do this sensibly, let's make sure we have really high-skilled local manufacturing here that will bring the jobs with it, that will bring the economic activity with it and that will enable us to meet our sustainability outcomes that we know will enable us to have that homegrown industry. The expansion of the rail industry for passenger and freight will enable us to shift our transport system to a 100 per cent renewable energy powered transport system that's based on a really thriving rail industry here in the country. 


I really do commend this report to the Senate and I look forward to its recommendations being enacted. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:16):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


In particular, I wish to take note of the particular area of recommendations on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Cashless Debit Card) Bill 2017. The human rights committee has reported on previous bills that relate to the cashless debit card or, as other people call it, the cashless welfare card. I will go to the committee's response first, and then I'll go over some of the issues that they raise.


First off, the committee thank the minister for the response and say that they have concluded the examination of the proposed legislation. What they say in their response is:


2.276 The preceding analysis indicates that concerns remain as to whether the trial is effective to achieve its stated objectives.


2.277 The analysis further indicates that, based on the information provided, the measures may not be a reasonable and proportionate limitation on human rights.


2.278 Accordingly, noting concerns raised by previous human rights assessments of the trial and related concerns regarding income management identified in the committee's 2016 Review of Stronger Future measures, the measures may not be compatible with the right to social security …


I really emphasise 'the right to social security'. At the hearing we had into this bill in Kalgoorlie last week, some of our committee members—or, I should say, people who were participating in that inquiry; they were not members of the committee itself but they were members of this chamber—didn't even understand that there is a right to social services. It goes on to say:


… the right to privacy and family and the right to equality and non-discrimination. If the bill is passed, the committee will consider the human rights implications of the legislative instruments once they are received.


Of course, I hope that that bill does not pass this chamber, because I agree with the committee. In fact, I go further than the committee, but I agree that the bill is not a reasonable and proportionate limitation on people's human rights. This bill is draconian. It is top-down. It has negatively impacted on people who are affected by the card. The committee's report outlines the concerns that the committee has with this bill and also its previous assessments. It says:


The previous human rights assessments of the cashless welfare trial measures raised concerns in relation to the compulsory quarantining of a person's welfare payments and the restriction of a person's agency and ability to spend their welfare payments at businesses including supermarkets. These concerns related to the right to social security, the right to privacy and family and the right to equality and non-discrimination.


It says these bills 'engage' and 'limits these rights'. It also says:


While the committee previously accepted that the cashless welfare trial measures may pursue a legitimate objective, it raised concerns as to whether the measures are rationally connected to (that is, effective to achieve) and proportionate to their objective.


They then go on to their previous reports to look at the wave 1 interim evaluation of the card. They then look at what this bill proposes to do, which is, of course, to extend the cashless welfare card so-called trials in Kununurra and Ceduna to basically be limitless—so you can stop calling them trials, folks. This is the government implementing the cashless welfare card.


They are also proposing it for two other sites. One is Kalgoorlie and one is Hinkler. What they propose to do, of course, is to put people on income management. The human rights committee bells the cat and says it's income quarantining. The government keeps denying that it's income quarantining, but it is income quarantining. The government has other trials proposed for drug testing of people that are applying for income support. Given that this relates to our human rights committee, it's very interesting to note that the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights just today denounced Australia's plans to drug-test benefit claimants as a 'cheap shot at our most vulnerable'. Of course, what the government wants to do with drug testing is apply, as they first said, the cashless welfare card, but now they're being more general and saying the BasicsCard or income management. But this is what we're talking about here, folks. We are talking about income management, which the human rights committee is saying may not be compatible with the right to social security, the right to privacy and family and the right to equality and nondiscrimination. Here we have the special rapporteur saying:


If the real goal is to reduce the use of illegal drugs, why start with the poorest members of society?


As I said, it basically condemns this as a cheap shot at our most vulnerable.


It also comes at a time when our government has just got itself a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council. At a time when we are also being assessed about whether we are being discriminatory against our first nations, here we have our human rights committee—the parliament's joint human rights committee—having a go at the cashless welfare card, which is a blatant go at our first nations peoples. That's where the card was rolled out in my home state—our home state, I should say, Acting Deputy President Sterle—of Western Australia in the East Kimberly and then, of course, in South Australia in Ceduna.


The government keeps saying they have proof of concept of this particular card. They wave around the wave 2 analysis of the cashless welfare card, or the debit card as it's also named. That report has so many holes you could drive a truck through it. For a start, the survey that they took to do this so-called analysis is push polling at its worst. Even the report itself acknowledges that the data in it is skewed. They conveniently leave out information on impacts on crime and impact on family violence and domestic violence. It's been unavailable.


Quite frankly, you need to be an expert on statistics to be able to look at the way they have manipulated some of the statistical data to try to prove their concept. If you look for the domestic violence figures, they're not there. Some of the people who had been trying to do the analysis of the ORIMA report had to resort to FOI to try to get access to those figures. They still haven't got them. Last week the superintendent of the police in the Kimberley, who was giving us evidence, talked about those figures, so we asked him for them. He said that he would provide them. If, in fact, they are provided, that will allow us to do some further analysis.


Yet here we have government saying: 'Here is proof of concept. We want to expand this trial.' They basically want an open ticket here, folks. Make no mistake about it. This legislation is an open ticket, quite frankly, to continue the program ad infinitum in Kununurra, the Kimberley, Ceduna and in the new areas the government wants to roll out the cashless welfare card to. Here we have government waving around this report—a report that is flawed and uses push polling, and where they managed to manipulate the numbers.


Minderoo Foundation gets those numbers and then gives them to members in this place, who blithely repeat them, ad infinitum again, doing exactly what the government wants them to do—on flawed data that does not show a drop in alcohol used across the trial areas. I think the government is trying to say there has been a 41 per cent drop in alcohol use. I think that's the latest figure that they're quoting. Quite frankly, that is absolute complete nonsense—to say that that's how much people have stopped drinking in the Kimberley and in Ceduna. That data is absolutely flawed, and the government know it. The government know they have a cooked-up analysis to try to encourage people to vote for their discriminatory, paternalistic, flawed legislation. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted.

Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights Senate Tabling Statement - Wednesday 18 October 2017



I rise to speak to the tabling of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights' Human Rights Scrutiny Report 11 of 2017.


The role of the committee is to examine recent bills and legislative instruments for compatibility with Australia's obligations under international human rights law. In doing so, the committee aims to enhance understanding of, and respect for, human rights in Australia and ensure that human rights issues are appropriately considered in legislative and policy development.


I note that a number of the bills examined in this report are scheduled for debate this week, including bills in relation to:


Anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing;


Crimes legislation (sexual crimes against children and community protection);


Customs anti-dumping;


Social services (welfare reform); and


Treasury amendments – including housing tax integrity, foreign acquisitions vacancy fees, and an Australian Financial Complaints Authority.


A number of the bills scheduled for debate were assessed from the outset as not raising human rights concerns, and others have been examined in more detail to assess compatibility.


More generally, in the current report, the majority of new bills considered – twenty – were assessed as either promoting human rights, permissibly limiting human rights or not engaging human rights. The committee is also seeking further information in relation to four bills, and has provided a further four 'advice only' comments to legislation proponents.


This report also contains the committee's concluded examination of nine bills and instruments. Following correspondence with the relevant minister, the committee has concluded that three of these bills and instruments are likely to be compatible with international human rights law.


This process of liaising with the legislation proponent to identify relevant information is an example of the benefit of the inclusive human rights scrutiny dialogue model. I encourage all legislation proponents when drafting statements of compatibility to draw upon any previous dialogue to ensure that the information that accompanies proposed legislation is comprehensive. Statements of compatibility accompany each piece of legislation that is tabled in parliament and contain the relevant minister's consideration of any human rights issues that may arise. These statements are critical to the work of the committee in its scrutiny task.


Finally, I note that the committee's work is one mechanism to encourage ongoing consideration of human rights in the development and passage of legislation. As announced today, Australia has been appointed to the UN Human Rights Council and will take its seat from


January 2018. I am sure that this will be another important space for Australia to engage with human rights issues at a global level.


I encourage my fellow Senators and others to examine the committee's report to better inform their consideration of proposed legislation.


With these comments, I commend the committee's Report 11 of 2017 to the Senate.

The speeches read as follows—



CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (SAFTA AMENDMENT IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 2017


The Customs Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017 amends the Customs Act1901 to implement Australia's obligations under new Chapter 3 of the Singapore-Australian Free Trade Agreement as inserted by the Agreement to Amend the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement, or SAFTA.


In June 2015, the Prime Ministers of Australia and Singapore announced the launch of the Singapore-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), an initiative to strengthen and deepen our two countries' strategic, trade, economic, defence, and people-to-people, links. 


The amendments in SAFTA are the key economic plank of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. 


It reflects Australia and Singapore's unwavering commitment to the principles of free and open trade.


The conclusion of yet another high-quality trade deal demonstrates the Coalition's commitment to pursuing new and expanded opportunities for Australian exporters and small businesses. 


Our FTAs are delivering significant economic benefits and driving strong growth in the value of Australia's exports. 


Opening up export markets is at the core of the Government's economic strategy and we're focused on delivering even greater access to global markets for Australian businesses. 


I had the honour of signing the Agreement to Amend the SAFTA with my Singaporean counterpart, Minister for Trade and Investment Mr Lim Hng Kiang, on 13 October 2016 in Canberra.


I acknowledge the work of my predecessor, the Honourable Andrew Robb, and his commitment to taking our economic relationship with Singapore to the next level. 


This is our most comprehensive update to a Free Trade Agreement to date, and a demonstration of the Government's commitment to a modern and agile trade agenda in the face of global headwinds. 


As the makeup of our economy and the needs of business change, so too must the rules that govern our international trade. 


Australia requires modern trade agreements, which create opportunity across our diverse and largely service-driven economy. 


SAFTA makes it easier for Australian businesses to export into Singapore – a natural gateway to South East Asia. 


Under these changes, a new Chapter 3 sets out new rules of origin criteria and related documentary requirements for determining the eligibility of goods to obtain preferential tariff entry into Australia under the amended Agreement.


The new rules of origin will operate as an alternative to the existing framework for a transitional period of three years. After this period, the old framework will be repealed and only goods eligible under the new rules of origin shall be subject to a preferential rate of customs duty.


The complementary Customs Tariff Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017 will amend the Customs Tariff Act1995 to set out Australia's tariff commitments under the Agreement.


These amendments demonstrate the Coalition's commitment to Australia's economic relationship with Singapore. 


Since Entry into Force under the Howard Government in 2003, the SAFTA has provided a strong platform for the expansion of our economic and trade relationship with Singapore, a 21st-century economy, and a gateway to the rest of Asia. 


SAFTA is a great example of how modern FTAs can boost trade. Since this deal was first signed in 2003:


- our bilateral trade relationship has grown by over 80 per cent; and


- bilateral investment has grown by more than 350 per cent.


This puts Australian suppliers on an even footing with foreign competitors, with a framework for mutual recognition of qualifications – particularly for engineers and accountants.


Singapore is now our fourth-largest export market for services.


Complementing existing tariff-free entry for goods, the updated rules of origin will simplify administration and reduce the compliance costs for traders. 


The amended Agreement contains simplified and trade facilitative rules of origin, updated product specific rules, and related documentary requirements. 


Goods imported into Australia that meet the new rules of origin, implemented through this Bill, will be entitled to claim preferential tariff treatment in accordance with the amended Agreement.


The amended Agreement also includes relevant record keeping and related obligations on Australian exporters and producers who wish to export Australian goods to Singapore under the Agreement and obtain preferential treatment for those goods in Singapore.


When the amended Agreement enters into force, it will deliver significant benefits for Australian service providers with greater access and certainty in sectors such as education, law, financial and professional services.


Singapore has given Australia the most favourable treatment, putting our exporters on an equal or better footing than our foreign competitors in the Singapore market. 


Singapore has also agreed to recognise the Juris Doctor degrees of Australian universities currently listed in the amended Agreement, providing access for those universities that have moved to a graduate model of legal education. 


Australia and Singapore will also establish a framework under the amended Agreement to support mutual recognition of professional qualifications. 


Priority will be given to arrangements for engineers and accountants, with Singapore and Australia agreeing to commence negotiations on mutual recognition arrangements. 


Australian lawyers and financial service providers will enjoy improved access to Singapore's legal and financial services markets.


The amended Agreement will create new opportunities for businesses to bid for high-value government procurement contracts in Singapore, including in sectors such as road transport, construction and engineering. 


The amended Agreement will improve mobility and lengths of stay for Australian business people and their spouses and dependents. 


It will include modern outcomes on telecommunications services and e-commerce, and harmonise trade rules in goods, services and investment, thereby reducing red tape for businesses.


The amended Agreement will also extend to investors from Singapore – our fifth-highest source of foreign investment – the same Foreign Investment Review Board screening thresholds applicable to our other Free Trade Agreement partners. 


We are also supporting innovation exchange between Australia and Singapore by establishing a Landing Pad for Australian entrepreneurs and start-ups – which I visited just two weeks ago while in Singapore. 


The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, under the chairmanship of the Member for Fadden, has finalised its report on the Agreement to Amend the SAFTA, recommending binding treaty action. 


In view of the sitting schedule, the benefits to Australian businesses, and the importance to the Parliament and the community of seeing the limited changes that are required to be made, we are introducing the implementing legislation at this time. 


Some amendments to subordinate legislation, as set out in the National Interest Analysis, will also be required in due course.


I commend this legislation to the House.


CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (SINGAPORE-AUSTRALIA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT AMENDMENT IMPLEMENTATION) BILL 2017


The Customs Tariff Amendment (Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement Amendment Implementation) Bill 2017 is the second Bill relating to the Agreement to Amend the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement.


This Bill contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act1995 (Customs Tariff Act) to implement the amended Agreement by:


- providing duty-free access on entry into force of the amended Agreement for most eligible goods determined in accordance with new Division 1BA of Part VIII of the Customs Act.

Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (19:03):  Before the debate was interrupted, I was pointing out that it is some three months since the Referendum Council placed its report and its recommendations in the hands of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. It is nearly five months since the historic Uluru summit put a proposal to the Australian nation that went to the issues of constitutional change and the place of the first peoples in our nation state. It also recommended legislation to be developed to set up a Makarata Commission and to deal with truth telling and agreement making. The silence on the other side of the House has been deafening. While the government ponders the issue in silent confusion, the first nations of Australia and their supporters in mainstream society continue to be frustrated at having these longstanding issues ignored and sent to the bottom of the pile. The first nations are no doubt wondering whether truth telling about our intertwined history, with its hurtful aspects, is now being shut down by the government. While the government at the federal level declines to indicate any view or position on these issues, our communities are continuously feeling very frustrated, marginalised and driven almost to the sad outlook that we do not matter.


These issues require leadership, vision and a preparedness to engage in dialogue that seeks resolution, not to be left to fester and die on the vine in resentment. It's neither appropriate nor right for the national parliament to overrule a local council discussing and deciding on issues such as this. Community debate is central to a healthy democracy. On the Labor side, we have put our weight behind the idea of holding a national conversation on the role of the first nations people in our national identity, in our polity and in our society, asking what the place of the first nations people in our collective national identity is. Should they be recognised properly in our foundation document as the first nations of a young nation of immigrants? Should our nation find the courage to face our truth as a separate state established over the top of the first nations peoples? The idea of holding a national conversation about truth-telling, agreement-making and a makarrata commission in a formal legislation framework should be welcomed and not feared. Until the federal government really works at creating this makarrata commission as a truth-telling and agreement-making instrument, again we will see this as a backyard churn rather than rebuilding relationships. We should discuss such things.


We know that makarrata, the Yolngu concept of a cultural and ceremonial symbol of true reconciliation after a long struggle, is something first nation people have been striving for over generations. The Prime Minister heard this firsthand at Garma this year and yet he remains inert. As a consequence, the nation has stalled on the healing process of reconciliation. Look around our parliament, see the Mabo notebooks, the Yolngu bark painting and the Barunga Statement and know that we as legislators have been called upon again and again to talk through these issues, to come to terms with our national identity and to agree a way forward.


The Mabo decision led to an eruption of controversy and alarm in much of mainstream Australia. Mabo was an affront to the security provided by the lie of terra nullius. The same thing is happening right now as people ask themselves whether we should change our national day, whether we should open up the discussion around truth-telling in this country.


On the last Australia Day, I received an unsigned letter to my office which said that my people should 'stop crying, move on and stop complaining about the crap that happened 200 years ago.' The letter was a reminder that the contest of interpretations of our history is not in the spirit of reconciliation, of relationships based on understanding and respect. The heat of this debate is rising because we still don't have an agreement in Australia which sets out the fundamentals of how the colonists came to be here and the basis of their settlement. Surely, as leaders of our nation, we are mature enough to discuss such things and potentially—I say potentially—agree positive outcomes. Or are we?


Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, yesterday you said in this chamber:


Australia's history is what it is. Like every country, there are imperfections in it.


You went on to say:


We cannot erase that history. It's not about atoning for it; it is about getting on and making sure we can move forward together.


I say to Senator Bernardi, respectfully, that we cannot move forward together by simply asking the first nations people to get over it. We must contemplate the how of moving forward.


Senator Roberts yesterday stated:


We need to go further, though. We need to stop funding all councils that interfere with Australian icons, heritage and statues, and any local government that wants to rewrite history …


First nations are calling for their histories to be heard and considered and for their perspective to be respected. Our communities are saying: 'If you don't do it at the federal level, we'll try to do it through other tiers of government. We'll have conversations about treaties in South Australia and Victoria. We'll talk about the date of citizenship ceremonies at our local council meetings in Yarra and Darebin and other places.'


These discussions of repositioning at a local council level are important signals. They are an indication of a healthy democracy. We should be looking to pick up sentiments on all sides of this debate for the sake of rebuilding a better relationship at the national level. We should not be singling out individual councils and denying them their rights to make decisions within their own communities. I see these local council decisions as a sign of our nation maturing in its understanding of our intertwined but, as yet, unreconciled history.


Ultimately, the federal parliament will have to face up to such challenging and contentious issues. Our national and international reputation will depend upon our response to the first nation peoples. We, in Labor, support first nation peoples who are working with their local and regional communities to develop their own agreements on such issues. We, in Labor, support the decision of the ACT government to hold a reconciliation public holiday on 28 May. This is the decision of that community. It is an anniversary of significance for events such as the Mabo decision and the 1967 referendum.


In the future, we will continue to ensure that local governments and regional communities are empowered to make decisions about managing their issues, defining priorities for government programs and handling local issues. We do not support an overreach by the Commonwealth into local community government. We do support the disallowance motion. This is an issue for local governments, not for the federal parliament. We should focus on engaging the community on national challenges to build a truly reconciled nation through dialogue, mutual respect and common agreement. The time of this parliament should be focused on the major issues that affect our nation, like progress towards first nation peoples' recognition and reconciliation of our legacy issues, as well as the growing distrust of the government's intentions regarding the future of the first nation peoples' concerns.

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (19:12):  I rise to speak in support of this disallowance motion from Senators McKim and Siewert for the disallowance of legislative instruments made under the Australian Citizenship Act.


The story of local government in Australia is a critical story to remember in this decision. The history of local government is about decision-making at a local level, the third tier of democracy in our country, to allow and enable local people at local levels to make decisions and to believe that those decisions will be respected. When we look at the history in the 1800s leading up to Federation, we can see the strength of local government. It may not have been called that at the time but most of our first federal parliamentarians were local councillors. They were the ones who represented our country. They were the ones who drew up the Constitution—which we now decide is going to determine the fate of those who make decisions at local government levels. We need to remember that as lawmakers. We need to remember what we're doing when we decide, as a federal parliament, to overreach, to overstep, to crush, to diminish or to demolish the voices of those who believe they have a right to be heard. We need to reflect on why it is that we do it. We need to ask ourselves, as members in the federal parliament, how would we feel? How would we feel about that when we rightly represent our constituencies and stand up to fight for the issues that we know are incredibly important, and when we are incredibly passionate in fighting for those values and beliefs?


It's this Australian parliament that tried to get the first referendum up on local government, and it was Gough Whitlam, the former Labor Prime Minister, who was passionate about wanting to see the strength of the regions have a voice and have a future. That referendum was in 1974, and the 'yes' vote was 46.85 per cent. But Labor didn't give up on the local voices. Labor continued to push for the reality that those grassroots voices deserved to be heard and respected. They needed to be enabled to continue to make their own mistakes and to listen to their own constituents at the grassroots level.


It was Bob Hawke, another Labor Prime Minister, who took the country to a second referendum on local government. It was in 1988, the bicentenary year, a year when our country almost tore itself up, strangling itself on the history of first nations people. What did the 1988 bicentenary mean to the first nations people of this country, and what did it mean to all Australians? The arm wrestling and the soul searching continue today. That 1988 referendum saw the local government vote by Australians go down again, with the 'yes' vote at 33.61 per cent.


But Labor still believed in the voice of local government. It was former Prime Minister Paul Keating who first invited the Australian Local Government Association president, along with the states and territories, to the 1992 initiative of the Keating Labor government, a new forum called the Council of Australian Governments—as we all know, COAG. It was a seat at that table where Australian local governments across this country would be heard and their voices respected. In 2008, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd established the Council of Australian Local Governments which met for the first time in November 2008. That council represented 565 local councils and shires right across Australia.


The voices of people at local government level are just as important as the voices of federal politicians in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. None of us should take lightly the removal and the disallowance of those voices at that local level with simply a tick of the paper, a flick of the pen: 'I don't like what you're doing. I don't like what you're saying. I'm going to remove your ability to do it, just because I can.' That's what's happened here. People may say, 'It's about Australia Day; don't make it political. Well, hello, senators. Let me tell you: it has to be one of the most political aspects of our country, because our country still has the unresolved issue of the relationship between black and white Australians. But don't let us diminish this parliament by removing the rights of those in local government to have the opportunity to talk about it. It's important that we uphold, as political leaders in this country, the right for those in the third tier of government to be respected, to be enabled and to make the decisions that they have a right, as elected members, to make on behalf of their constituents. And guess what? If they're not happy, they will vote them out, just like they will vote us out. Isn't that what a democracy is all about? Why are we so afraid?

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals, Minister for Regional Development, Minister for Local Government and Territories and Minister for Regional Communications) (19:20):  I rise tonight to pay tribute to a remarkable Australian, Graham 'Butch' Lenton, who, very sadly, passed away recently after a rather lengthy battle with cancer. 


Butch Lenton was the mayor of Winton, which is how I met him a couple of years ago. He really was the most extraordinary community-minded man I think I've ever met. He lived in the town of Winton, lived all his life there, was born there, was raised there, went to school there, got married there, worked there, represented his community there and died there in this wonderful little town of about 800 people in Queensland. I first met Butch a couple of years ago. I was heading up to Winton to do a visit to the Royal Flying Doctor Service dental operation that was happening out there. I can still remember. Butch picked me up at the airport and he was larger than life. Butch was terrific. I got off the plane and met this man I hadn't met before, and we just clicked. From that point on, we got on very, very well.


The first day I was with Butch, he was driving me around his community, as all good mayors do. As it turned out, I ended up quite late for the function I was supposed to be there for, because Butch was showing me his town. He was showing me his community. It was fantastic. I loved every minute of it. He showed me everything in his town. I mean everything—absolutely everything! I think we even went to the tip. But it just—




Senator Gallacher:
  You always go to the tip!




Senator NASH:
  I will take that interjection; thank you, Senator Gallacher. Always go to the tip! It really showed how proud Butch was of his community, his people and everything in it. We went down to the racecourse—I think he was testing out the new minister—and of course it's a dirt track and he was trying to tell me that they would have it turfed by race day. I did manage to point out to him pretty quickly I wasn't falling for that one. He was a terrific fellow. It was the start of a long—over the last couple of years—relationship with Butch, who was such a wonderful member of his local community.


I ended up going back a year later to do a number of things there, one of which was to go with Butch and inspect a proposed dam site. As we were going out to this proposed dam site—there had been a bit of rain, after a long period of drought—we were heading out on a road, which turned into a dirt road, which then turned into a track, which turned into a piece of land where the track disappeared altogether and we were just driving across this random piece of grassed area. There was no track and nothing at all. Butch knew exactly where he was going. It didn't matter that there wasn't a road. We pulled up on the edge of this escarpment. We looked out across this massive, massive area, and he was standing there talking to me about his vision for this dam and what it was going to do for the region and what it was going to do for the people who lived there. Again, he just struck me as a remarkable man that had such a vision for the future of his community and his region. As we were standing there, it just really made me think that he encapsulated everything that we look for in leaders, particularly in our regional communities. As we were driving back—as I said, it had been raining—it was also a chance to witness the most remarkable piece of driving I have ever seen in my life. I don't know how we didn't get bogged. His ability to drive through that very, very wet piece of land was quite extraordinary. 


We went back not long after. When I was first there, in 2015, the Waltzing Matilda Centre, which was there in the community, had burnt down—and it was absolutely devastating for the community. At the time, Butch said, 'It was, unfortunately, a bit of a kick in the guts, but we'll tough it out and keep going with it.' That was such an example of him being so relentlessly positive in the face of adversity. Every time some difficulty came up, every time some challenge came in front of that community, Butch was always so positive and so determined just to make things right. He was a true leader. He ending up being absolutely pivotal in making sure that the Waltzing Matilda Centre would be rebuilt, which it now is. It will be concluded, I think, in March or April next year. A $22 million rebuild is being done of this fabulous centre, $8 million of which came from funding from the coalition government. If it hadn't been for Butch and his work in making sure that that funding became a reality, it would never have happened.


When I was there in this wonderful little community at the end of 2016, with the Prime Minister, talking about the $8 million that was going towards this community centre, I thought: 'This is what really matters about being in government. This is about working in partnership with rural communities and working with local leaders to make sure that these rural communities have the best future they possibly can have.' That was Butch to a T. His whole life was about his family: his wife, Ros, and his daughter, Carly—my heart goes out to you and all of the family. It was such an embodiment of everything that he did and strove for to make his community a better place.


The funeral, just recently, was such a testament to this man. There were over 1,000 people there. The tributes that have been pouring through for him since he passed away have been nothing short of amazing—and very fitting. It's not surprising that so many people held him in such high regard, because, as I keep saying, he truly was an extraordinary man.


I was in Winton in June to do a number of things, and I went to the local show. Butch, while being quite unwell, was still so incredibly positive. It was never about him. I think that's one of the lessons we really learn from people like Butch—when you love your community, when you put your community first and when things are not about you but about the people around you and what you can do for them. I think it is a really good lesson to all of us in this place, on all sides of both chambers, to make sure that we continue to put our communities first in the same way that Butch Lenton did. There are not too many people in this world who really get to leave their footprints on the planet, and Butch will be one of those people who actually did that. He was so positive. He was a true leader. He really made sure that every day counted and he was always looking to the next thing. He was always thinking: 'What can we do next? What is the next great thing we can do?'


This tiny little town of Winton, of 800 people, pretty much in the middle of nowhere, is absolutely thriving, and so much of that is due to the fact that Butch Lenton cared so much about that community and invested so much of his life into making sure it was as good as it could possibly be, and that it would be going into the future. He was always looking to the future. The leadership that he showed was just extraordinary. He always had a smile. He was always thinking about the people around him. Being there at the funeral and seeing all of these people from all walks of life turn up and pay their respects to Butch, it was just so fitting. Somebody made the comment that day that he could walk and talk with anybody. He dealt with politicians from all walks of life, from Commonwealth, state and local government, and Butch just treated everybody the same. He was incredibly respectful and he managed to make sure that everybody who needed to know what was important to Winton knew it and that they knew how important it was to him. He made sure that the people who needed to know about everything Winton needed for the future knew about it.


Butch will be a tremendous loss. He will leave enormous shoes to fill. As I said, he walked this planet and he's going to leave such a mark behind him of all the wonderful things that he's done. To Ros and to Carly and to all of the family: he made such a difference. He changed people's lives. He changed the future of that community. He changed the future of that region. There are not very many people who get to say that they've done that. I say thanks to Butch for everything he has done. He will be always remembered. He came into my life a couple of years ago as the mayor, but he left it as a very good friend.
