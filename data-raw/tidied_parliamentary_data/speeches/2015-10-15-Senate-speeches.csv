Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (09:31):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator FIFIELD:
  I think there might be a process issue here. I do not think the rationale or detail of this particular proposition has been circulated. I am not aware that it has been circulated. It makes it difficult to form a view as to whether or not something should happen if details and context about the particular proposition have not been circulated.



The PRESIDENT:  I think that is a fair proposition. My understanding is that these matters are discussed informally at whips meetings.




Senator FIFIELD:
  At the time of the whips meeting last night I do not think this had yet been a proposition. When something happens overnight and it has not been circulated to senators, it makes it extremely difficult to form a view as to whether something should happen or not. That is a bit of an ongoing problem with this particular procedure, which has been in place for a relatively short period of time. These things come up first thing in the morning—although not always—with advice to senators about the reason or the rationale.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Siewert, do you want to make some comments on this matter?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:33):  by leave—I have just been consulting with a member of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, and it is my understanding that an email has been circulated to the committee members about a regular private meeting, if that is what we are talking about.



The PRESIDENT:  I think the minister is saying that that might be okay for the committee, but the Senate does not understand that.




Senator SIEWERT:
  This is a regular practice now. This does not happen for all the other meetings. There have been dozens of these meetings since this process started, and it is only Legal and Cons that this happens with. I have not heard Senator Fifield ask about the other meetings that have come up for agreement in this place.

Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Chief Government Whip in the Senate) (09:34):  by leave—My understanding, and I have just received advice from the clerks, is that normally the advices of these proposals to meet are circulated, appropriately, to the whips. The first we knew about it yesterday was that it was on the draft red. We indicated at the cross-whips meeting last night that we did not have a position. The reason we did not have a position was that we had not received the circulated notice. The advice I have received is that that was an oversight. They normally are circulated; this one was not. The reason why we could not form a position as to whether we should proceed was that it was not circulated to our office.



The PRESIDENT:  The situation is this: the Senate now has the opportunity to vote on this. That is why these proposals are raised in the manner that they are raised. The Senate now has an opportunity to deliberate. If senators are uncomfortable, they can vote accordingly. I think you are trying to circumvent this going to a vote, Minister?

The purpose of circulation is so that the various groupings in the Senate can consult internally to determine their position. That opportunity has not been afforded.



The PRESIDENT:  The question before the chair at the moment is that this committee be given authority to meet or not. If there are problems with the procedure that we currently have, can I suggest that the matter be raised at the Procedure Committee.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Minister for Communications, Minister for the Arts and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Digital Government) (09:36):  by leave—The laws of physics dictate that I cannot occupy two places at the same time. I cannot be in this chamber talking, as I am at the moment, and at the same time consulting with my relevant colleagues on this issue. So it is not reasonable to expect a vote to take place on something which has not been circulated. It is not my fault and it is not the fault of anyone sitting in this chamber, so I do not think it is reasonable that we be expected to vote upon something that we have not had the opportunity to reflect on and to consult on.



The PRESIDENT:  Well, that is the only course of action that we have open to us. Either we grant permission by resolution for this committee to meet or the motion does not go through as it usually automatically does. I gather from the debate we are having that it is desirable now to have this matter put to a vote.

  there are two things here. I did not take it as a reflection, Senator Fifield, so that is fine.

However, overall, Senator Fifield's comments earlier could have been interpreted as a reflection on the whole of this process not working, and I want to put that to bed; I think it is working. There has been a breakdown in this particular case, I think, rather than it being a reflection on the way that we are seeking approval for these meetings.

Senator FIFIELD:
  I also think that there are some issues with the timeliness with which these matters are circulated. There is a very short gap between when they are circulated and this point of the day, which makes it more difficult—not impossible but more difficult—to consult with colleagues than it previously was under the former arrangements.



The PRESIDENT:  In summary, then, we have deferred this matter until the placing of business later today. I also encourage the whips to have a discussion about this and, if there is deemed to be a flaw in the procedure, to formally write to me in relation to having this matter examined by the Procedure Committee.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2015-10-15,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (09:40):  I hate racism and bigotry. I cannot understand how someone can look at the colour of someone's skin, their gender or their ethnic background and make broad, sweeping assumptions about their moral virtue, their suitability for a role or whether they should be part of an organisation or grouping. But, unfortunately, the reality is that racism and bigotry have been part of the world in which we live for a very long time. That said, I also know that one of the great things about modern Australia is that, while these kinds of attitudes are still around, they have become increasingly isolated and rare.


There were certainly challenges in growing up here in Canberra for me, coming from a non-English-speaking background and with a name like Zdenko Seselja, but for the most part I did not feel too different. The isolated incidences of bigotry I experienced did hurt, but in a significant way they are memorable because they did not happen all that often. I will come back to that. Mostly what I saw was that my neighbourhood and school community were relatively cohesive, with people of many different backgrounds working hard and getting along pretty well. 


I remember growing up with people both like me and unlike me. There were people from southern Europe, such as the Croatians, Greeks, Italians and Macedonians, and there were my best friends through the years, who came from Malaysia, the US, Sri Lanka and New Zealand. I got to know a refugee family from El Salvador, whom my family welcomed and assisted. I even remember the half-Zambian kid who grew up around the corner and went on to captain the Wallabies. Through growing up with these people, I formed the view as a young boy and then a young man that people should be judged by who they are—the content of their character, if you will—rather than judging them based on where they or their parents might have been born or on the colour of their skin. 


Of course, it was not perfect, and there were times that I experienced bigotry. I still clearly remember going off to Croatian lessons and being ridiculed for being different. I remember being called 'wog' or 'dago'. I had much darker skin then, compared to now, and I vividly remember being called 'black' as a derogatory term. Most of these instances were just kids being kids, though it did not make them hurt any less.


In considering the merits of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, I have reflected on my experiences as well as the experiences of many others who have gone through much worse than I did. It struck me that this section of the act came into force when I was a teenager. I cannot help but wonder: would it have made any difference to my experience growing up? Could or should the act have been used to help schoolkids like me, who were dealing with bigotry? My answer to these questions is no. 


There are a number of reasons for this. Above all, I passionately believe in free speech, even speech which I find offensive. That is central to our democracy. I believe it is an absolutely fundamental right, and it is from the right to life and free speech that all other freedoms flow. And, if free speech really is a fundamental right, then the bar needs to be set very high before a law can outlaw any form of speech. Section 18C in its current form sets the bar too low. 


In my maiden speech, I talked about the experiences of my family, particularly of my uncle, who came from the former Yugoslavia where he was imprisoned for exercising his right to freedom of speech and freedom of religion—things that we have to work very hard to guard.


There are some who argue in the context of section 18C, 'Well, what about defamation? What is the difference between a defamation action and an action under the Racial Discrimination Act?' In my opinion, the line is clear and significant. A defamation action needs to show that an individual has been damaged by the speech. A person must clearly show that the defamatory statement, to be actionable, has resulted in them being viewed in a lesser light by a reasonable person and that the statement was not true. However, under the Racial Discrimination Act, we have a completely subjective test applying to anyone identifying with a particular ethnicity or nationality—a 'hurt feelings' test. This can and does have a particularly chilling effect on free speech. In looking at this issue, I have also considered how different ethnic groups in the past responded to prejudice—not through the law but with humour. Wogs Out of Work and Acropolis Now were some of the responses of southern Europeans to the negative labels that they sometimes received. Well-known Australian comedian Vince Sorrenti has often used, to great effect, this type of humour. 


I also make the point in passing that much of the ethnic ribbing that was part of my life growing up was a good natured two-way dig—part of a longstanding Australian irreverent character which most immigrants to this country have adopted and embraced. But, again, sometimes the labels did hurt. But when I consider the question of whether a law like 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act could have been used for me or others growing up—even if I had wanted to—my answer again is no, and that is because, like with many laws of this type, you have to have significant means and ability to bring such a matter to court. That means you get laws being used by activist organisations and lobby groups to score political points, rather than helping real day-to-day vulnerable people. Also, it seems to me that, by encouraging individuals and groups to settle their differences in court over this issue of offensive speech, we further entrench divisions in our community between ethnic and racial groups, rather than creating an atmosphere where we settle our differences with open debate, goodwill and even humour. A law designed to unite, can in fact divide.


History and experience show that you only get meaningful, long-lasting cultural change when it comes through evolving community standards rather than the threat of legal action. Outlawing speech does not stop the bigotry in people's hearts; it simply pushes it underground. It is better to bring such thoughts to light and have them discredited by rational debate. We only have to look at recent examples in the United States, where free speech is protected in the constitution yet community standards often do the job of dealing with offensive speech. We saw this in the case of Donald Sterling, then owner of the NBA team the LA Clippers, who made highly offensive racially-based comments. The sanction by the public and the other NBA owners was swift and brutal. There was no need for a lawsuit against the behaviour—the community spoke out, and the issue was dealt with. More importantly, in that case the Racial Discrimination Act would not have even applied, as his comments were made privately and were recorded.


Another crucial reason why 18C, as it stands, is an unreasonable restraint to free speech is that it does not deal with the more subtle forms of racism and bigotry that we see. In my opinion, it is this sort of racism that is far more pernicious. Who could forget the South Australian Labor Party running election ads against Liberal candidate Carolyn Habib? The ads simply asked 'Can you trust Habib?' Blind Freddy could see that the ad was designed to appeal to an anti-Arab sentiment, but it is subtle enough to never attract the sanction of the law. It is better, in my opinion, to speak out and call this what it is—bigoted—and condemn it and highlight the hypocrisy of those who are putting out bigoted ads while arguing against amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act, rather than to draft a new law to try and deal with a more subtle form of racism.


This was a reform I publicly supported, and, in my maiden speech, I commended the efforts of Senator Brandis and his commitment to free speech. Indeed, for some time the coalition has been making the case for this reform. In August 2012, a year before the election of the coalition government, Tony Abbott said:


Let's be clear: insulting, humiliating or intimidating others on any grounds, racial or otherwise, is deplorable. It should be everyone's goal to elevate the standards of public debate, not lower them, and to demonstrate respect rather than disdain for the various components of our community. Still, a ""hurt feelings"" test is impossible to comply with while maintaining the fearless pursuit of truth which should be the hallmark of a society such as ours. 


Then, after the election, the Attorney-General said:



… 
never again in Australia will


we have a situation in which a person may be taken to court for expressing a political opinion.

But we know that the government made the decision to put this reform to the side. Through that, I remained consistent in my views believing that this was an important reform to continue to pursue. Then, when Senator Day proposed an alternative compromise for reform of the act that simply struck out the words 'insult' and 'offend' the then Communications Minister, now Prime Minister Turnbull, said he was 'very comfortable' with the proposal and did not foresee 'any negative impact'. 


So it is clear there has been substantial support in this parliament for this reform over the last few years, but we haven't matched those words with deeds. As the now Prime Minister went on to say about Senator Day's proposal … the reality is with change like this you've got to do it very delicately and you've got to bring people along with you.


Well I believe the time to bring people along is now. Section 18C does not unite us; in my opinion, it has the tendency to do just the opposite.


It has been less than a year since the tragic massacre of cartoonists and writers at Charlie Hebdo in France—a massacre that took place because of cartoons and words. The response of many at the time was to lament the horrible murders as part of a physical attack on free speech. As Human Rights Commissioner Tim Wilson made clear at the time, while Charlie Hebdo would likely have been a legal publication in Australia, there is no doubt it would have faced constant legal challenges under the Racial Discrimination Act. Wilson argued: 


18C would have been used against Charlie Hebdo because it sets a low bar to restrict free speech. Administratively, 18C also makes it easy to take action; all you need is an aggrieved party and an arguable case.


Wilson went on to say:


The Charlie Hebdo massacre is a tragedy, and it should be a reminder that we need to defend free speech even when speech offends and insults.


Offence and insult are subjective, emotional responses to the actions of others. Individuals can be offended and insulted by just about anything, even when it is not intended. For that reason, a law that prohibits speech that merely offends and insults sets the bar too low. Instilling these principles in law ultimately leads to self-censorship.


So this is not a trivial bit of policy; this matters, and we have seen recently how much it matters.


Reform of Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act is a policy that we advocated for before the last election. It is a policy that we took to the election. It is a policy the leadership of the government has spoken about and clearly supported, and it is a policy that I believe should be supported. I support this bill because I believe freedom of speech is one of the centrepieces of our democracy. Without it, we do not have real freedom. I support this bill because I have lived a life where I have occasionally experienced bigotry firsthand, but I know that punitive legal action ultimately will not result in the real lasting cultural change which leads to greater respect. I support this bill because this is what I said I would do when I was elected and it is what the coalition said we would do in opposition and in government. I commend it to the Senate.

The last time an amendment to the act raised its ugly head I received many emails from concerned Australians about the watering down of the act. We saw community organisations across the country come out and speak against the watering down of the act. Many were community organisations who, unfortunately, deal with racism every day—the experts, if you like; those at community level who hear the offence and witness the pain it causes. 


This is a time in Australia when tolerance should be at its highest, following the tragic and horrific shooting of Mr Curtis Cheng. There has been an outpouring of grief by thousands of Australians who did not know him but who were moved by his death to act in a kind and tolerant way. Tolerance should be at the forefront of our actions when we confront the fact that his death was carried out by a 15-year-old boy and when we are told by law enforcement agencies that children as young as 12 are being groomed by adults. Of course, we need strong law enforcement. Of course, we need vigilance and new strategies. What we do not need is an amendment to the Racial Discrimination Act which allows people to be bigots, to offend and to insult. This is exactly what the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 2014 seeks to do. It is not about free speech; it is about offending and insulting.


This is an amendment that the Turnbull government wants—only this time it is using the backdoor, through a private senator's bill. Of course, the bill is co-sponsored by two Liberal senators—one a former minister and one a deputy whip. They are two liberals who have held and continue to hold senior positions within the Liberal Party. This is Prime Minister Turnbull pandering again to the wishes of the bigots in his own party, who want to push through these changes under the guise of a private member's bill. Make no mistake: nobody is fooled by this action. 


In June of this year the act celebrated its 40th anniversary. It was introduced under the Whitlam government in 1975, but from its inception right up until now a long succession of Liberal governments have tried to water it down, and this backdoor attempt by the Turnbull government follows that legacy. It is useful to reflect once again on the words of Kep Enderby, who, when he moved the bill, said: 'This bill was a significant step in the development of policy and the promotion of human rights in Australia' and also on the words of the great Gough Whitlam when he said in relation to the bill: 


There is a need to spell out in an enduring form the founding principles of our civilisation, and in particular the principle that all Australians, whatever their colour, race or creed, are equal before the law and have the same basic rights and opportunities. 


This amendment, like all previous Liberal government amendments, seeks to radically change that meaning and that intention of the Racial Discrimination Act. Last year, when the Attorney-General tried to move a very similar amendment to water down the Racial Discrimination Act, we saw thousands of submissions flood in in response to government consultation that almost universally panned the Attorney-General's exposure draft for a watered down 18C. There were rallies. There were petitions. There were delegations of community leaders to this place. Australians of all backgrounds spoke out against the government's divisive proposal. Australians from many organisations who would not normally agree with each other on a number of significant matters agreed that the watering down of 18C was not in anybody's interest. They showed that their principles were based on tolerance—tolerance that they can accept one another's positions and tolerance that they can disagree. They all came out supporting the original intention of the act. 


Mr Abbott—as we know, the old management—eventually abandoned the government's attack. He humiliated the Attorney-General by making him backflip on his signature policy. So now they are trying the backdoor approach. Now the Turnbull government is trying to hide what it really wants by co-sponsoring a private senator's bill. We will see Liberal senator after Liberal senator stand up and say that they do not support racist comments, they do not support bigotry—and maybe that is true—but they cannot stand in this place and make those comments and also support this bill. So there is something else going on here, because they are mutually exclusive points of view. 


I do not stand for racism. I do not stand for bigotry. I am a feminist; some over there think that is a dirty word. I do not stand for the watering down of the Racial Discrimination Act, to take out the words 'insult' and 'offend' and to say that it is okay in this country to insult and offend people. Australians do not stand for that. Last year, when the Liberals tried to water down 18C, we saw a very, very strong reaction from Australians. A private senator's bill is a sneaky way to try and achieve exactly the same thing, because it does not have the currency of a bill that the government is promoting. But we all know on this side, Labor senators know, that it is the Liberal government, the Turnbull government, that is really promoting this bill. You would not see the Labor Party—the Labor senators or Labor members of parliament—co-sponsoring this bill, because, yes, we stand for free speech, but we do not stand for insults and offence. That is not what the Labor party stands for. We are proud that in 1975 Gough Whitlam had the foresight to introduce such a bill to say that Australians are inclusive, to say that we support free speech but not speech which insults and offends. 


This year we saw the outrageous reaction to a dance that Adam Goodes performed on the football ground. Who would want to make all of those insults and offences that Adam Goodes received legal? Who would want to say that is okay? Let me tell you, as an Australian, I say that is not okay. I do not stand for insults and offence. I stand with Adam Goodes and other people who demonstrate their culture or their beliefs in a way that is not offensive, who should not have to stand and cop the sorts of racist comments that he has copped almost throughout his football career. You can stand here and say, 'Yes, I've been bullied. Yes, people have made racial taunts to me.' This is not okay, because those comments are painful and they leave a scar. Anyone who thinks they do not is kidding themselves.


The last time I defended this act I told the story of my granddaughter, and I think it is worth telling again. She is 11. She is Gidja. She lives in Geraldton. She went into a shop and she told me that the shopkeeper followed her and her mother around. When I asked Charlee why that happened, she responded by saying, 'Because I'm Aboriginal.' That is offensive. Who wants to make that legal? What happened to Charlee and the lesson she has learnt at the tender age of 11 she learnt many years ago.


I am often appalled when my fellow senator Nova Peris shares with me some of the emails that she receives. They are disgraceful. They use terms that went out in the 1960s—terms that I would not even repeat in this place because they are so offensive. This is because of the colour of her skin. What a disgrace! She is an Olympic hero and she puts up with that. If Nova Peris cops that, imagine what ordinary people cop on the street if they look a little different to me. It is a shame that my 11-year-old granddaughter has learnt that lesson at such a tender age—that the colour of her skin somehow makes her different to other people and causes other people to be suspicious that she might steal something from a shop. Well, I do not stand for that. I certainly do not stand for this Liberal Party amendment wrapped up in a private senator's bill.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-10-15,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:02):  If Senator Lines is interested, and I am sure she is not, I am offended and insulted by her comment that all Liberals are bigots and racists. Does that mean that I should sue Senator Lines in a court of law for her view—inaccurate though it might be—of what members of the Liberal Party are? That was an appalling speech, I have to say, from Senator Lines. She is talking about free speech but she just runs out the mantra of the Labor Party that is dictated to her by the union movement, which represents no more than 17 per cent of all Australians. The Labor Party do not have free speech here or anywhere because if they cross the party line, as a number of government senators do regularly, and may well do in relation to this bill, they are expelled from the Labor Party. How is that for free speech, which Senator Lines so loudly claims she is in favour of?


I want to commence my contribution by congratulating Senator Day on bringing forward a bill which I thought my party was going to bring forward. It is something that we flagged prior to the last election as being an important issue that we would address following the election. The people of Australia still voted for us in large majorities right across the nation. Clearly, our indication to the Australian public that we supported this approach or this policy was not something that caused people to vote against us. I would assume, from the majority that we got, that most people supported all of our policies, which included that.


I am pleased that Senator Day had the courage to bring forward this bill. As a result of that, and I heard Senator Day speaking yesterday, he has been vilified by members of the Labor Party simply for doing what parliamentarians are supposed to do—that is, bringing forward legislation that they believe the people they represent support. And yet Senator Day's thanks for doing that was the sort of vilification we got from Labor senators yesterday. So I congratulate Senator Day on having the courage. I suspect he knew that he would be subjected to abuse and vile language. I can only guess at the number of horrendously vile emails that Senator Day would have received.


Senator Lines was suggesting that people get vile, hateful email. Gee whiz! I get them all the time. Should I be suing Senator Ludlam and his nasty little band of people called GetUp! for the emails they orchestrate to send me? Perhaps I do not have Senator Ludlam's great knowledge of Twitter. Perhaps I did not have Senator Ludlam's or Labor Party senators' advantage or privilege of attending expensive private schools and going full time to university and perhaps occasionally I get things wrong. That then leads Senator Ludlam and his nasty little band of GetUp! people to fill my email with what you could call hate mail—only I do not like to use that term. It is just insults, which says more about the people who are not only sending them but organising people to send them.


Australia has always been a very egalitarian and a very laid-back country. In fact, with the coming of modern Australia, one would think—and genealogists would perhaps give a better explanation of this—that a lot of the psyche, and a lot of the way we are as Australians, comes from the fact that we were established as a penal colony. The people who made our country, who pioneered our country—the modern Australia—had been subjected to transportation from European countries. Part of our psyche is that we are laid-back, we can roll with the punches, we can laugh at ourselves, we can deal with issues and we do not need governments to legislate to tell us when we can be offended and insulted.


Senator Day's amendment bill is very carefully and, I think, wisely drawn to remove the words 'offend' and 'insult' but to leave the act so that it would read:


(1)  It is unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if:


(a)  the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people; and


(b)  the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group.


The law as it would stand, should this bill be adopted, would still make it illegal to humiliate and intimidate anyone by making racist comments. I think that is fair, and I think most parliamentarians, indeed, most Australians would probably agree with that.


As it now stands if you offend or insult someone, which is a very subjective test, you can be subjected to quite substantial criminal penalties. Although it is not always based on race, if offending and insulting becomes a criminal act in Australia, we have lost one of those very valuable icons that define the Australian people. We are that laid-back group, we are that group that accepts everybody into the country. We are a group that has been made up, over a long period of time, of people from all nationalities, races, different colours and ethnic origins. That is what is so wonderful about the Australian psyche. To make it a criminal offence to offend and insult, as I said, is a very subjective thing and is, in my mind, just nonsensical.


Senator Cameron once said to me—and I am not quoting him exactly—'You're not fit to be a Scotsman's shoelace,' or something like that. Well, there is a racial comment against me, and perhaps I should have been offended and insulted by that. When I told Senator Cameron the other day that he should learn to speak English properly, he did not worry too much about that. I do not think he was offended and insulted. He certainly was not humiliated or intimidated by it but, of course, some people in his party thought they could make a little bit of an issue about it and got on their high horses. I am sure that Senator Cameron was not offended or insulted by that comment. If he was, well, so what? That is what Australia is about. If he was humiliated or, if me saying that to him had, in some way, intimidated him and made him want to resign from parliament or cut his wrists or something, then perhaps that is another issue. I am sure saying that would not be classed as humiliating or intimidating.


I find that the furore created by this bill difficult to understand. The subjective test of 'offend and insult' is not something that should attract criminal penalties in whatever way the offence or insult is given, whether it be in relation to race, political beliefs or age. I get a bit of comment because of my age from people who say that they are not bigoted, racist, ageist or gender critical. They say that, and you then see how things come out. Nevertheless, if people want to offend and insult me, that is fine; I am not going to slit my wrists. That is how I have found people right across Australia to have been in what has now turned out to be a long life.


I grew up in the immediate post-war period in a place called Stanthorpe where there was a big cohort of principally Italians who had been there for some time. During the war they had sided with the Germans and they were a bit ostracised. I can still remember people who may have been treated a little bit differently in those days. They were part of Australia. They had come to Australia, as most people do, because of the way we are as Australians, because we can have a go at each other. When I was starting school, people who may have been singled out because they were Italians are people who are now leaders of the community. They have worked hard and have built up their assets, and they are now leaders in every aspect of our community.


I remember my good friend Senator John Panizza was one of them. I might say, the Labor Party in this chamber used to laugh at him when his English was not quite as good as it should have been. I was always absolutely disgusted at the way Labor Party senators used to do that. Senator Panizza is a great example of the types of people who would have had a difficult life when they first came to Australia. They wore different clothes, they did not quite speak the ocker language, but they worked hard and they succeeded and ended up very wealthy, as Senator Panizza did. He became a leader of his community. Where I live now, in Ayr in North Queensland, the Italian, Spanish, Greek and Southern European cohort of third and fourth generation is the group that, as I say, have worked very hard and have done very well. They are now, absolutely, community leaders. They are in that situation because they came to Australia because of what we were. They have contributed to what Australia now is.


This idea of trying to legislate against offence and insult is just not what Australia is about. Sure, if it goes further and humiliates and intimidates, perhaps that is something that a parliament should legislate about. But this amending bill, of course, continues the criminality of humiliation and intimidation. I support free speech in Australia and that is something that this country should be very interested in.


I have heard much better prepared and much more intellectual speeches from some of my colleagues here. I particularly noted Senator Seselja's fine contribution to this debate earlier. I agree entirely with nearly all of what he said. I think the furore that has been raised by the Labor Party, for whatever political purposes they might think are appropriate, is just ridiculous. Again, in itself it is un-Australian. I again congratulate Senator Day and those other senators who co-sponsored the bill. I am not a co-sponsor but I have indicated all along that I believe that the bill is the right way to go. It will receive my support. As I say, it is what my party took to the last election. Most Australians were aware of our party's position on this, and it certainly did not impact upon the very large majority that my party received at the last election.


This idea that government should legislate to prevent people being offended or insulted is, quite frankly, ridiculous. I repeat, as others have said, offence and insult is a very subjective test. What people say to one person may offend and insult, but they may say exactly the same thing to another person and it will not offend or insult. Government should not be legislating to define or to make criminal words that offend and insult people on the grounds of race, colour, national or ethnic origin or anything else. Why not have a law in case I am offended or insulted because someone says I am old? Why don't we make that a criminal offence? It would not worry me, I might say; I do not care if people offend and insult me because I am old. But are we going to legislate to stop that? Perhaps as an older person I am in a minority. Are we going to legislate to protect this minority, of which I am part, because I might be offended by what someone says about that?


I think this is a most uncontentious bill. I think it could almost be passed as a non-controversial bill, if people were thinking clearly about it and not following the party line. Perhaps some in the Labor Party see some political merit in making an issue of this. Australia is a wonderful country. We cherish our free speech. We cherish each other. We cherish people from all nationalities who have made Australia what it is today. We, as a nation, do not need government legislation to prevent us from offending and insulting one another. I strongly support the bill and again congratulate Senator Day for bringing it forward.

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2015-10-15,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (10:19):  This is really quite exquisite timing because on 31 October this year we will mark 40 years since the Racial Discrimination Act came into effect. We should be commemorating what was one of Whitlam's most enduring achievements. Instead, we have to defend it. It is a shame that some in the Liberal Party think it necessary to water down the race hate protections in the act. We hope that the new Prime Minister shows the strength necessary to stare down the less tolerant parts of his party. But we do not have much reason to hope because the Prime Minister himself has said to Andrew Bolt that he is 'very comfortable' with the measures in the bill. I am not comfortable with the measures in this bill, and neither are the Australians of all backgrounds who spoke out against the government's divisive proposal—Indigenous Australians and the most recent of migrants, Jewish people and Arabic people, and people of all political persuasions. 


It might be that some opposite need a history lesson on why it is that we have the Racial Discrimination Act in the first place to understand why it is that we should not be watering it down. It is true to say that Australia has long struggled with racism, but it is probably fairer to say that Australia's minorities have long struggled against racism because it is they who have borne the consequences of prejudice. Unhappily, it is the case that the White Australia policy was one of the first pieces of legislation passed by this parliament after Federation. Prime Minister Edmund Barton argued in support of the bill, saying:


The doctrine of the equality of man was never intended to apply to the equality of the Englishman and the Chinaman.


And for the next 60 years, the doctrine of equality was not applied in Australia. All sides of politics share the blame for the discrimination that was entrenched in Australian life. Racism was not a minority view, nor was it a quiet one. In 1948, for instance, 57 per cent of respondents to a Morgan Gallup poll thought that the immigration of 'coloured peoples' should be stopped. These 57 per cent were not all bad people. They simply grew up in a time when racist beliefs were not just acceptable but could be passed off as a mark of civilisation. Nor was Australia alone in housing these beliefs. Racism has been and still is a global struggle.


None of this, however, made racial discrimination any easier to bear for those who suffered it. We will never know the cost of having turned away people because of their race. We do not know how many brilliant minds we turned away nor how many humble people who would have lived honest lives. What we do know, however, is the indignity and harm wrought on those of different backgrounds who made it to Australia, people who were denied jobs or education because of the colour of their skin, immigrants and their children who would hear families just like their own vilified on TV or in the papers simply because of where they had come from—the national shame of the stolen generation.


Forty years ago, this parliament looked at this past and said 'no more'. It was not a unitary effort; Australia's racist policies had required the connivance of both sides of politics, and dismantling it likewise required their cooperation. The Racial Discrimination Act was passed with bipartisan support. This did not mean universal support, however, far from it. Paul Keating later described the act as a 'very brave piece of legislation'. Only as brave a Prime Minister as Whitlam could have made it law.


It is instructive to recall what was said in this chamber when the bill was debated. One popular view was expressed by the senator who remarked:


Sometimes people have an aversion to others either because of personality, race, creed or whatever it might be. Does that mean it is such a bad thing? ... The fact of somebody having a racial attitude towards a person should not worry that person.


Or, to give it a more modern phrasing, people have the right to be bigots. I guess that, 40 years on, some things have not changed. But other things have changed and that is why it is so important to oppose this bill.


We are truly a multicultural nation today. The last census revealed that almost one in four Australians was born overseas and more than 43 per cent of us have at least one parent who was born overseas. The bill that is before us today is a product of a mindset that cannot even countenance tolerating difference let alone celebrating it. What I think we need to do, however, is value this diversity for what it is: our country's greatest competitive advantage in a global market place.


We are a successful, multicultural country with an educated multicultural people. This is something that the old economies of Europe do not have. They remain largely a monoculture and their migrant populations have very different educational and community profiles from ours. We cannot rest on our laurels in this respect. There is much to be done in ensuring that people from different ethnic backgrounds are able to enjoy the success they deserve. 


There has been much discussion recently about a bamboo ceiling that prevents people from Asian backgrounds from reaching the management and leadership positions that people with similar or even lesser qualifications and experience are able to reach. It is a huge mistake if we do not capitalise on the raw human talent that we have.


This is the century of the south. We have heard from the government ad nauseam recently about the importance of trade linkages with China and other countries in the Pacific. Well, the people in Australia who are in the best position to help us take advantage of these opportunities are the well educated people with cultural understanding and links to these nations—in other words, the very people that this government slaps in the face. 


It is difficult to conceive of this bill as anything other than an insult to ethnic communities in Australia. What is startling is the urgency with which it has been brought on. This is a government, we should remember, that thought that it was too busy with other matters to debate same-sex marriage and would not let that private member's bill onto the floor—no time for love, but when it comes to people's right to be bigots, this government clears a smooth passage onto the floor of the chamber.


The question we need to really ask is: why is this so important? Why is it so important to allow people to offend or insult people of other backgrounds? What are the situations where people have a legitimate debate fouled because of these provisions? That is what I think we should hear from the other side—a list of the types of racist and insulting statements the supporters of this bill have in mind that currently cannot be said because of the bill as it stands. It is all well and good to talk in esoteric terms about the freedom of speech, but what we are really talking about here is speech that is on the margins, speech that has the ability to poison the tenor of public debate, speech that is toxic to our community.


It is worth remembering why the original bill, the government's bill, was withdrawn by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott in the first place. He thought that the divisiveness of the government's attack on race-hate protections was distracting from national security issues. You do not need to make an instrumental argument against race hate and divisiveness. You can oppose it on its face. And you should.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-10-15,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (10:28):  I rise to support Senator Day and his co-sponsors' Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 2014. I commence with a quotation from the French philosopher Voltaire:


I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.


The principles of the French republic, the three pillars—liberty, equality and fraternity—go to the absolute essence of what we are discussing in this chamber today. Voltaire ,1694 to 1778, a writer, historian and, of course,  philosopher wrote:


I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.


If I can stay with the historic quote for a further moment and that of the first president of the United States of America, George Washington. I quote Washington's comment because it is relevant to our discussion in this place today. He said:


If freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter.


Washington was acclaimed as probably the most famous and influential of the presidents of the United States, which of course he led into independence.


I have heard a lot of debate and discussion but I have not heard too many definitions. I propose now to place on the record the commonly accepted and indeed dictionary definitions of some of the words that we are debating here today. The bill proposes to remove the words 'offend' and 'insult' from section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, which currently makes it unlawful to 'offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group' on the basis of their 'race, colour or national or ethnic origin'. That is what we are addressing today.


I applaud Senator Day for his initiative in bringing this bill before this chamber, which surely must rest at the base and the root of Australia's democratic system. Because if we cannot debate it, if we cannot come to the conclusion as to what is free and what can be said in this country then the courts have got no basis upon which to make their statement, so I do now want to put onto the record the definitions. The first word is 'humiliate'. The definition of humiliate: to humiliate is to injure the dignity of self respect of a person or a group, to embarrass or to put them down. As I understand from Senator Day's bill, there is no intention to remove the word 'humiliate' from section 18C as amended. The second is the word 'intimidate'. It is defined as to frighten or to overawe, especially in order to subdue or influence. A further definition: to threaten. And, again, unless I am mistaken, there is no intention within Senator Day's amendment to section 18C to have any effect, to leave 'humiliate' and 'intimidate' in the amended bill.


I now want to go to the definition of the two terms that are proposed in this bill to be deleted or to be limited and they are 'offend' and 'insult'. The definition of the term 'to offend': firstly, to cause offence to or resentment in, to upset; secondly, to displease or to cause anger; thirdly, to do wrong or to transgress. And that is one of the two words that are proposed in the Day bill to be removed. The second is the term 'insult', which refers to speaking to or treating a person with scornful abuse, to make an insulting remark or an insulting action or something that is so worthless or contemptible as to be offensive.


Whilst we are on the topic, since it has been thrown around—although it is not included in the words of 18C now and not included in the intended amendment by Senator Day and his cosponsors—I will introduce the term 'bigot'. A bigot, by definition, is an obstinate believer in religion, a political theory or similar who is intolerant of others and who tries to impose his or her views on others, a person who is prejudiced. That is what the definition of a bigot is. I would venture the opinion that on many of the occasions when we are speaking in this chamber, when we are countering the views of others who have spoken before us, we certainly express a level of intolerance to the view of others. We certainly in the words that we use would, in the view of the listener or an observer, be considered to be trying to impose our views on others. That is what the term 'bigot' means.


I turn, as indeed others have, as indeed Acting Deputy President Bernardi has, to the comments of many people in this debate in terms of where they stand on freedom of speech and the words 'offend' and 'insult'. If we take the commentary of Mr David Marr, a person who, as you said, I believe, in your contribution, Acting Deputy President Bernardi, and—I will repeat—a person who would not agree with most areas or positions that we would take. He said:


…in a free and energetic society, giving offence is necessary.


'Offending' and 'insulting' are the two terms that are proposed to be deleted. Marr goes on to say 'offence and insults are the everyday reality of free discourse' in a free and open and democratic society.


I imagine even some of the young people looking down on us today would certainly in their conversation in the classroom or the playground on occasion have said things of offence to others or, indeed, may have insulted a classmate or friend. Should they, in their maturity beyond the age of 18 years, be dragged before a court and be the subject of an action under the Racial Discrimination Act? Of course they should not. In fact, as Marr said:


Hurt feelings should never attract the law as they do now under section 18C.


I wonder if the young people who are listening to what is being said today are aware that, once they reach the age of 18 years and possibly even younger, if they do hurt the feelings of another, they may in fact attract the law under section 18C.


Professor James Spigelman, a former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and Chairman of the ABC, made this comment:


I am not aware of any international human rights instrument or national anti-discrimination statute in another liberal democracy that extends to conduct which is merely offensive.


He goes on to say:


The freedom to offend is an integral component of freedom of speech. There is no right not to be offended.


I was very impressed with the first speech of our Western Australian Labor Senate colleague Senator Bullock. He said:


To be tolerant of your views I do not need to pretend that you are just as right as I am but rather to accept that you have a perfect right to hold a view I believe to be wrong, even if I find your view offensive.


I look forward to robust discussions with Senator Bullock at different times on different topics in which we will be in disagreement and indeed as we have been. If he finds my words offensive or insulting, he has the perfect opportunity to retort and to come back to me in the way in which he wants to.


I will defend strongly the continuation of the words 'humiliate' and 'intimidate' to be held within 18C. They are deeply offensive to anybody. The fact that somebody tries to injure the dignity and self-respect of others, to put others down as either an individual or a group—the concept of someone trying to frighten, subdue, influence or threaten a person or a group of people—is deeply offensive in Australia. It is absolutely counter to the fundamental that created the essential Australian system of mateship. It is the absolute anathema of mateship that one would attempt to humiliate or intimidate.


Since mateship probably had its origins in the battlefields of Gallipoli and other places, you had better believe that there would have been plenty of rejoinders that somebody listening from the outside indeed may have seen to be offensive or insulting. The term 'bastard', as we know as Australians, will have many different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. Somebody from another country may think that a person is being deeply insulting or offensive to use that term when indeed they may actually be using it as a term of endearment. But of course we would never relate that term to humiliation and intimidation in the context of mateship as I speak.


In considering my contribution to the amendment proposed by Senator Day I reflected on some of the feedback I get to some of the contributions I make in this place and outside it. I have spoken at different times, for example, in terms of hormonal balance within the foetus. I have indeed made the observation that maleness is suppressed femaleness in the embryo and the foetus. I have drawn attention to you, Acting Deputy President Bernardi. I remember in one contribution making the point that, foetally and embryologically, you in fact were female before you became male. I received a lot of emails at that time which I would certainly regard as having been offensive. Indeed, I don't know if they might not have been from some members of your family! Or they may have been insulting.


I have made other comments about embryologic development in the animal species and the human species and I have incurred the wrath of people who have emailed me. I can assure you that those terms were deeply insulting to me. I am known to be a person who very strongly endorses and promotes the live export of production animals from this country. You would understand and had better believe that over time there have been and will be more communications to me, to my family and to my staff which any reasonable person would say are offensive and insulting—sometimes, of course, as you know, beyond that. Section 18C as it stands at the moment would allow me to drag such a person before the courts because they have expressed their democratic view that what I have said, in their view, is insulting or offensive.


Certainly there has been no attempt in those circumstances to intimidate. If there were, they would have to expect a different response from me. But, as a public person, as we all are, if we express our views openly and freely then we must be the subject of communication from others who would disagree with us. That person must know that they are free of the possibility of being dragged before a court.


I conclude my contribution with the words of the Attorney-General and now our leader in this place:


By making the reasonable likelihood of causing offence or insult the test of unacceptable behaviour … section 18C is a grotesque limitation on ordinary political discourse.


Surely this country was born on the principle of the freedom of political and related discourse. I commend Senator Day for his initiative in proposing this amendment bill. It is reasonable. It leaves those offensive words 'intimidation' and 'humiliation' in, and it removes the words 'offend' and 'insult', which have no place in a modern democracy

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-10-15,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (10:44):  I rise to speak against the amendments put forward by Senator Day in the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 2014 to weaken our racial discrimination laws in this country. I do so because I see these amendments as anathema to the social inclusion and national unity that this country, at this point in time particularly, is so crying out to achieve. In fact, I was very pleased to join with so many faith leaders this week here in Parliament House for the National Day of Unity. Representatives from the Muslim, Sikh, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Baha'i—so many different faiths—came here to Parliament House to stand with us, leaders in our own community and members of parliament, to say: 'We stand together against hate speech. We stand together against bigotry. We stand together to celebrate the diversity and mutual respect that we engender amongst each other to foster positive relationships between all faiths and all ethnicities.' Why would anyone want to reduce and weaken that bond that we have? That is how I see an attack on our racial discrimination laws—laws that have served this country for the last 20 years very, very well, laws that provide for freedom of speech. 


We have freedom of speech in this country, and it is provided for within the very piece of legislation that this senator is trying to weaken. As he would be very well aware, it is provided for in section 18D of the legislation. We have gone through this debate. We have gone through this debate tirelessly under the Abbott government. We saw very clearly that, after an immense amount of community pressure and pressure from the opposition, the Abbott government and, embarrassingly, the then Prime Minister Tony Abbott himself, had to tell the Attorney-General that his ideals in trying to reduce our racial discrimination laws in this country were a bad step and he had to withdraw them. Of course, that was welcomed. It was very much welcomed by all of the faith leaders and the community at large, but little did we know that it was going to be temporary. Little did we know that, if a senator from another party were to introduce amendments—changes which look very similar to those that were introduced by the Abbott government—the new Turnbull government would not come out and say: 'No, we dealt with that. We said that we were not going to weaken our racial discrimination laws in this country, and we will not support Senator Day's bill.' That is not what we have had from the new Turnbull government.


Everyone thought that, with a new broom at the top, it was all going to be different. Why doesn't Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister of this country, show that he is different? Why doesn't he show that his government is different and say that the coalition government in this country will not support Senator Day's weakening of our racial discrimination laws? We have had absolute silence from the Prime Minister. Instead, we have had the contributions of a number of his backbench and a number of individuals in this place, particularly, such as Senator Back's contribution just now. Acting Deputy President Bernardi, you have also made clear your support for the weakening of the racial discrimination laws. So who is to know where this government stands? You are completely divided on this—completely divided. You have some who are still standing firm on the previous government's complete rejection of the Attorney's attempt to weaken these laws, and then you have others who are very much in support of the attempt.


That is not good enough. That is not good enough for this country to go forward with. That is not good enough to tell to faith leaders, who need more than ever at this time to know that their government is standing strong and firm with them in support against hate speech. That is what our Racial Discrimination Act provides. It provides very strong and robust provisions, particularly in 18C, that give this multicultural country of ours something to feel strong and proud about. We know that all of those rallies, petitions and delegations of community leaders who came to this place meant something. Those of us on this side listened, but it seems that those in government are now willing to turn a blind eye to all of that support for our racial discrimination laws and to all of that opposition against what the coalition government was trying to do. They are completely ignoring all of those leaders—Indigenous leaders, Jewish leaders, Arab leaders—and trying to bring these awful amendments back through this place. 


That is not what you will find from the Labor Party. We stand very firm with all of those faith leaders and those community leaders. We do not want to see racism and bigotry in this country. We do not want to see the likes of Frederick Tobin back preaching his anti-Holocaust rhetoric. We want to ensure that we have decent and fair laws in this country that deal with hate speech. That is what our Racial Discrimination Act has provided for a very, very long time. What on earth is the motivation behind this particular senator and behind those senators who want to weaken these laws? What is your motivation? That is what I ask you. You cannot say your motivation is to have freedom of speech in Australia, because we have freedom of speech in Australia under this particular law, and you all know it—in section 18D, we have it. Of course, all freedom of speech has to have some limits. Do you really want to live in a country where hate speech is on your doorstep, where it is okay to have the likes of Frederick Tobin go out there and preach his Holocaust-denying, awful speech? No, we do not. We do have some limits. But I can tell you: the bow is pretty long when it comes to freedom of speech in relation to race in this country and those provisions are in this law, the Racial Discrimination Act.


I think it is important to remember the reason given by the then Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, for his change of policy. It was in August last year when, in the wake of the emerging crisis in Syria and Iraq, Prime Minister Abbott admitted that the divisiveness that his government had created, the divisiveness of his government's attack on race hate protections, was a distraction from national security issues. That was the excuse he gave for abandoning the weakening of our racial hate laws. In doing so he threw the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak, and that was the end of the weakening of these laws. We now find ourselves in a very similar position. More than ever, we need unity in this country, and the episodes that have occurred in the last week or so in Victoria and in New South Wales prove that more than ever. So why would anyone come into this place right now and try to weaken the national unity that we have in this law, the social cohesion that is provided in this law? Why would anyone come in here and open the gates to hate speech at this point in time? It is beyond me in any circumstances but it is particularly beyond me at this point in time.


Labor stands very firmly against extreme hate speech, which section 18C has covered. The Australian people made very clear their opposition to the coalition government's attack on racial hate speech, so my message to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is: show that you are different from the previous Prime Minister, Tony Abbott. One way you can show that is by rejecting this amendment and standing firm with our faith leaders and our multicultural communities and ensure that this law remains as strong and robust as it has for the last 20 years.

"Seselja, Sen Zed",LP,2015-10-15,"



Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (09:40):  I hate racism and bigotry. I cannot understand how someone can look at the colour of someone's skin, their gender or their ethnic background and make broad, sweeping assumptions about their moral virtue, their suitability for a role or whether they should be part of an organisation or grouping. But, unfortunately, the reality is that racism and bigotry have been part of the world in which we live for a very long time. That said, I also know that one of the great things about modern Australia is that, while these kinds of attitudes are still around, they have become increasingly isolated and rare.


There were certainly challenges in growing up here in Canberra for me, coming from a non-English-speaking background and with a name like Zdenko Seselja, but for the most part I did not feel too different. The isolated incidences of bigotry I experienced did hurt, but in a significant way they are memorable because they did not happen all that often. I will come back to that. Mostly what I saw was that my neighbourhood and school community were relatively cohesive, with people of many different backgrounds working hard and getting along pretty well. 


I remember growing up with people both like me and unlike me. There were people from southern Europe, such as the Croatians, Greeks, Italians and Macedonians, and there were my best friends through the years, who came from Malaysia, the US, Sri Lanka and New Zealand. I got to know a refugee family from El Salvador, whom my family welcomed and assisted. I even remember the half-Zambian kid who grew up around the corner and went on to captain the Wallabies. Through growing up with these people, I formed the view as a young boy and then a young man that people should be judged by who they are—the content of their character, if you will—rather than judging them based on where they or their parents might have been born or on the colour of their skin. 


Of course, it was not perfect, and there were times that I experienced bigotry. I still clearly remember going off to Croatian lessons and being ridiculed for being different. I remember being called 'wog' or 'dago'. I had much darker skin then, compared to now, and I vividly remember being called 'black' as a derogatory term. Most of these instances were just kids being kids, though it did not make them hurt any less.


In considering the merits of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, I have reflected on my experiences as well as the experiences of many others who have gone through much worse than I did. It struck me that this section of the act came into force when I was a teenager. I cannot help but wonder: would it have made any difference to my experience growing up? Could or should the act have been used to help schoolkids like me, who were dealing with bigotry? My answer to these questions is no. 


There are a number of reasons for this. Above all, I passionately believe in free speech, even speech which I find offensive. That is central to our democracy. I believe it is an absolutely fundamental right, and it is from the right to life and free speech that all other freedoms flow. And, if free speech really is a fundamental right, then the bar needs to be set very high before a law can outlaw any form of speech. Section 18C in its current form sets the bar too low. 


In my maiden speech, I talked about the experiences of my family, particularly of my uncle, who came from the former Yugoslavia where he was imprisoned for exercising his right to freedom of speech and freedom of religion—things that we have to work very hard to guard.


There are some who argue in the context of section 18C, 'Well, what about defamation? What is the difference between a defamation action and an action under the Racial Discrimination Act?' In my opinion, the line is clear and significant. A defamation action needs to show that an individual has been damaged by the speech. A person must clearly show that the defamatory statement, to be actionable, has resulted in them being viewed in a lesser light by a reasonable person and that the statement was not true. However, under the Racial Discrimination Act, we have a completely subjective test applying to anyone identifying with a particular ethnicity or nationality—a 'hurt feelings' test. This can and does have a particularly chilling effect on free speech. In looking at this issue, I have also considered how different ethnic groups in the past responded to prejudice—not through the law but with humour. Wogs Out of Work and Acropolis Now were some of the responses of southern Europeans to the negative labels that they sometimes received. Well-known Australian comedian Vince Sorrenti has often used, to great effect, this type of humour. 


I also make the point in passing that much of the ethnic ribbing that was part of my life growing up was a good natured two-way dig—part of a longstanding Australian irreverent character which most immigrants to this country have adopted and embraced. But, again, sometimes the labels did hurt. But when I consider the question of whether a law like 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act could have been used for me or others growing up—even if I had wanted to—my answer again is no, and that is because, like with many laws of this type, you have to have significant means and ability to bring such a matter to court. That means you get laws being used by activist organisations and lobby groups to score political points, rather than helping real day-to-day vulnerable people. Also, it seems to me that, by encouraging individuals and groups to settle their differences in court over this issue of offensive speech, we further entrench divisions in our community between ethnic and racial groups, rather than creating an atmosphere where we settle our differences with open debate, goodwill and even humour. A law designed to unite, can in fact divide.


History and experience show that you only get meaningful, long-lasting cultural change when it comes through evolving community standards rather than the threat of legal action. Outlawing speech does not stop the bigotry in people's hearts; it simply pushes it underground. It is better to bring such thoughts to light and have them discredited by rational debate. We only have to look at recent examples in the United States, where free speech is protected in the constitution yet community standards often do the job of dealing with offensive speech. We saw this in the case of Donald Sterling, then owner of the NBA team the LA Clippers, who made highly offensive racially-based comments. The sanction by the public and the other NBA owners was swift and brutal. There was no need for a lawsuit against the behaviour—the community spoke out, and the issue was dealt with. More importantly, in that case the Racial Discrimination Act would not have even applied, as his comments were made privately and were recorded.


Another crucial reason why 18C, as it stands, is an unreasonable restraint to free speech is that it does not deal with the more subtle forms of racism and bigotry that we see. In my opinion, it is this sort of racism that is far more pernicious. Who could forget the South Australian Labor Party running election ads against Liberal candidate Carolyn Habib? The ads simply asked 'Can you trust Habib?' Blind Freddy could see that the ad was designed to appeal to an anti-Arab sentiment, but it is subtle enough to never attract the sanction of the law. It is better, in my opinion, to speak out and call this what it is—bigoted—and condemn it and highlight the hypocrisy of those who are putting out bigoted ads while arguing against amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act, rather than to draft a new law to try and deal with a more subtle form of racism.


This was a reform I publicly supported, and, in my maiden speech, I commended the efforts of Senator Brandis and his commitment to free speech. Indeed, for some time the coalition has been making the case for this reform. In August 2012, a year before the election of the coalition government, Tony Abbott said:


Let's be clear: insulting, humiliating or intimidating others on any grounds, racial or otherwise, is deplorable. It should be everyone's goal to elevate the standards of public debate, not lower them, and to demonstrate respect rather than disdain for the various components of our community. Still, a ""hurt feelings"" test is impossible to comply with while maintaining the fearless pursuit of truth which should be the hallmark of a society such as ours. 


Then, after the election, the Attorney-General said:



… 
never again in Australia will


we have a situation in which a person may be taken to court for expressing a political opinion.

But we know that the government made the decision to put this reform to the side. Through that, I remained consistent in my views believing that this was an important reform to continue to pursue. Then, when Senator Day proposed an alternative compromise for reform of the act that simply struck out the words 'insult' and 'offend' the then Communications Minister, now Prime Minister Turnbull, said he was 'very comfortable' with the proposal and did not foresee 'any negative impact'. 


So it is clear there has been substantial support in this parliament for this reform over the last few years, but we haven't matched those words with deeds. As the now Prime Minister went on to say about Senator Day's proposal … the reality is with change like this you've got to do it very delicately and you've got to bring people along with you.


Well I believe the time to bring people along is now. Section 18C does not unite us; in my opinion, it has the tendency to do just the opposite.


It has been less than a year since the tragic massacre of cartoonists and writers at Charlie Hebdo in France—a massacre that took place because of cartoons and words. The response of many at the time was to lament the horrible murders as part of a physical attack on free speech. As Human Rights Commissioner Tim Wilson made clear at the time, while Charlie Hebdo would likely have been a legal publication in Australia, there is no doubt it would have faced constant legal challenges under the Racial Discrimination Act. Wilson argued: 


18C would have been used against Charlie Hebdo because it sets a low bar to restrict free speech. Administratively, 18C also makes it easy to take action; all you need is an aggrieved party and an arguable case.


Wilson went on to say:


The Charlie Hebdo massacre is a tragedy, and it should be a reminder that we need to defend free speech even when speech offends and insults.


Offence and insult are subjective, emotional responses to the actions of others. Individuals can be offended and insulted by just about anything, even when it is not intended. For that reason, a law that prohibits speech that merely offends and insults sets the bar too low. Instilling these principles in law ultimately leads to self-censorship.


So this is not a trivial bit of policy; this matters, and we have seen recently how much it matters.


Reform of Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act is a policy that we advocated for before the last election. It is a policy that we took to the election. It is a policy the leadership of the government has spoken about and clearly supported, and it is a policy that I believe should be supported. I support this bill because I believe freedom of speech is one of the centrepieces of our democracy. Without it, we do not have real freedom. I support this bill because I have lived a life where I have occasionally experienced bigotry firsthand, but I know that punitive legal action ultimately will not result in the real lasting cultural change which leads to greater respect. I support this bill because this is what I said I would do when I was elected and it is what the coalition said we would do in opposition and in government. I commend it to the Senate.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2015-10-15,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (09:51):  I do not know how someone can stand in this place and say that they are opposed to vilification and then try to water down the Racial Discrimination Act: the two are mutually exclusive concepts. The last time an amendment to the act raised its ugly head I received many emails from concerned Australians about the watering down of the act. We saw community organisations across the country come out and speak against the watering down of the act. Many were community organisations who, unfortunately, deal with racism every day—the experts, if you like; those at community level who hear the offence and witness the pain it causes. 


This is a time in Australia when tolerance should be at its highest, following the tragic and horrific shooting of Mr Curtis Cheng. There has been an outpouring of grief by thousands of Australians who did not know him but who were moved by his death to act in a kind and tolerant way. Tolerance should be at the forefront of our actions when we confront the fact that his death was carried out by a 15-year-old boy and when we are told by law enforcement agencies that children as young as 12 are being groomed by adults. Of course, we need strong law enforcement. Of course, we need vigilance and new strategies. What we do not need is an amendment to the Racial Discrimination Act which allows people to be bigots, to offend and to insult. This is exactly what the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 2014 seeks to do. It is not about free speech; it is about offending and insulting.


This is an amendment that the Turnbull government wants—only this time it is using the backdoor, through a private senator's bill. Of course, the bill is co-sponsored by two Liberal senators—one a former minister and one a deputy whip. They are two liberals who have held and continue to hold senior positions within the Liberal Party. This is Prime Minister Turnbull pandering again to the wishes of the bigots in his own party, who want to push through these changes under the guise of a private member's bill. Make no mistake: nobody is fooled by this action. 


In June of this year the act celebrated its 40th anniversary. It was introduced under the Whitlam government in 1975, but from its inception right up until now a long succession of Liberal governments have tried to water it down, and this backdoor attempt by the Turnbull government follows that legacy. It is useful to reflect once again on the words of Kep Enderby, who, when he moved the bill, said: 'This bill was a significant step in the development of policy and the promotion of human rights in Australia' and also on the words of the great Gough Whitlam when he said in relation to the bill: 


There is a need to spell out in an enduring form the founding principles of our civilisation, and in particular the principle that all Australians, whatever their colour, race or creed, are equal before the law and have the same basic rights and opportunities. 


This amendment, like all previous Liberal government amendments, seeks to radically change that meaning and that intention of the Racial Discrimination Act. Last year, when the Attorney-General tried to move a very similar amendment to water down the Racial Discrimination Act, we saw thousands of submissions flood in in response to government consultation that almost universally panned the Attorney-General's exposure draft for a watered down 18C. There were rallies. There were petitions. There were delegations of community leaders to this place. Australians of all backgrounds spoke out against the government's divisive proposal. Australians from many organisations who would not normally agree with each other on a number of significant matters agreed that the watering down of 18C was not in anybody's interest. They showed that their principles were based on tolerance—tolerance that they can accept one another's positions and tolerance that they can disagree. They all came out supporting the original intention of the act. 


Mr Abbott—as we know, the old management—eventually abandoned the government's attack. He humiliated the Attorney-General by making him backflip on his signature policy. So now they are trying the backdoor approach. Now the Turnbull government is trying to hide what it really wants by co-sponsoring a private senator's bill. We will see Liberal senator after Liberal senator stand up and say that they do not support racist comments, they do not support bigotry—and maybe that is true—but they cannot stand in this place and make those comments and also support this bill. So there is something else going on here, because they are mutually exclusive points of view. 


I do not stand for racism. I do not stand for bigotry. I am a feminist; some over there think that is a dirty word. I do not stand for the watering down of the Racial Discrimination Act, to take out the words 'insult' and 'offend' and to say that it is okay in this country to insult and offend people. Australians do not stand for that. Last year, when the Liberals tried to water down 18C, we saw a very, very strong reaction from Australians. A private senator's bill is a sneaky way to try and achieve exactly the same thing, because it does not have the currency of a bill that the government is promoting. But we all know on this side, Labor senators know, that it is the Liberal government, the Turnbull government, that is really promoting this bill. You would not see the Labor Party—the Labor senators or Labor members of parliament—co-sponsoring this bill, because, yes, we stand for free speech, but we do not stand for insults and offence. That is not what the Labor party stands for. We are proud that in 1975 Gough Whitlam had the foresight to introduce such a bill to say that Australians are inclusive, to say that we support free speech but not speech which insults and offends. 


This year we saw the outrageous reaction to a dance that Adam Goodes performed on the football ground. Who would want to make all of those insults and offences that Adam Goodes received legal? Who would want to say that is okay? Let me tell you, as an Australian, I say that is not okay. I do not stand for insults and offence. I stand with Adam Goodes and other people who demonstrate their culture or their beliefs in a way that is not offensive, who should not have to stand and cop the sorts of racist comments that he has copped almost throughout his football career. You can stand here and say, 'Yes, I've been bullied. Yes, people have made racial taunts to me.' This is not okay, because those comments are painful and they leave a scar. Anyone who thinks they do not is kidding themselves.


The last time I defended this act I told the story of my granddaughter, and I think it is worth telling again. She is 11. She is Gidja. She lives in Geraldton. She went into a shop and she told me that the shopkeeper followed her and her mother around. When I asked Charlee why that happened, she responded by saying, 'Because I'm Aboriginal.' That is offensive. Who wants to make that legal? What happened to Charlee and the lesson she has learnt at the tender age of 11 she learnt many years ago.


I am often appalled when my fellow senator Nova Peris shares with me some of the emails that she receives. They are disgraceful. They use terms that went out in the 1960s—terms that I would not even repeat in this place because they are so offensive. This is because of the colour of her skin. What a disgrace! She is an Olympic hero and she puts up with that. If Nova Peris cops that, imagine what ordinary people cop on the street if they look a little different to me. It is a shame that my 11-year-old granddaughter has learnt that lesson at such a tender age—that the colour of her skin somehow makes her different to other people and causes other people to be suspicious that she might steal something from a shop. Well, I do not stand for that. I certainly do not stand for this Liberal Party amendment wrapped up in a private senator's bill.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-10-15,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:02):  If Senator Lines is interested, and I am sure she is not, I am offended and insulted by her comment that all Liberals are bigots and racists. Does that mean that I should sue Senator Lines in a court of law for her view—inaccurate though it might be—of what members of the Liberal Party are? That was an appalling speech, I have to say, from Senator Lines. She is talking about free speech but she just runs out the mantra of the Labor Party that is dictated to her by the union movement, which represents no more than 17 per cent of all Australians. The Labor Party do not have free speech here or anywhere because if they cross the party line, as a number of government senators do regularly, and may well do in relation to this bill, they are expelled from the Labor Party. How is that for free speech, which Senator Lines so loudly claims she is in favour of?


I want to commence my contribution by congratulating Senator Day on bringing forward a bill which I thought my party was going to bring forward. It is something that we flagged prior to the last election as being an important issue that we would address following the election. The people of Australia still voted for us in large majorities right across the nation. Clearly, our indication to the Australian public that we supported this approach or this policy was not something that caused people to vote against us. I would assume, from the majority that we got, that most people supported all of our policies, which included that.


I am pleased that Senator Day had the courage to bring forward this bill. As a result of that, and I heard Senator Day speaking yesterday, he has been vilified by members of the Labor Party simply for doing what parliamentarians are supposed to do—that is, bringing forward legislation that they believe the people they represent support. And yet Senator Day's thanks for doing that was the sort of vilification we got from Labor senators yesterday. So I congratulate Senator Day on having the courage. I suspect he knew that he would be subjected to abuse and vile language. I can only guess at the number of horrendously vile emails that Senator Day would have received.


Senator Lines was suggesting that people get vile, hateful email. Gee whiz! I get them all the time. Should I be suing Senator Ludlam and his nasty little band of people called GetUp! for the emails they orchestrate to send me? Perhaps I do not have Senator Ludlam's great knowledge of Twitter. Perhaps I did not have Senator Ludlam's or Labor Party senators' advantage or privilege of attending expensive private schools and going full time to university and perhaps occasionally I get things wrong. That then leads Senator Ludlam and his nasty little band of GetUp! people to fill my email with what you could call hate mail—only I do not like to use that term. It is just insults, which says more about the people who are not only sending them but organising people to send them.


Australia has always been a very egalitarian and a very laid-back country. In fact, with the coming of modern Australia, one would think—and genealogists would perhaps give a better explanation of this—that a lot of the psyche, and a lot of the way we are as Australians, comes from the fact that we were established as a penal colony. The people who made our country, who pioneered our country—the modern Australia—had been subjected to transportation from European countries. Part of our psyche is that we are laid-back, we can roll with the punches, we can laugh at ourselves, we can deal with issues and we do not need governments to legislate to tell us when we can be offended and insulted.


Senator Day's amendment bill is very carefully and, I think, wisely drawn to remove the words 'offend' and 'insult' but to leave the act so that it would read:


(1)  It is unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if:


(a)  the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people; and


(b)  the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group.


The law as it would stand, should this bill be adopted, would still make it illegal to humiliate and intimidate anyone by making racist comments. I think that is fair, and I think most parliamentarians, indeed, most Australians would probably agree with that.


As it now stands if you offend or insult someone, which is a very subjective test, you can be subjected to quite substantial criminal penalties. Although it is not always based on race, if offending and insulting becomes a criminal act in Australia, we have lost one of those very valuable icons that define the Australian people. We are that laid-back group, we are that group that accepts everybody into the country. We are a group that has been made up, over a long period of time, of people from all nationalities, races, different colours and ethnic origins. That is what is so wonderful about the Australian psyche. To make it a criminal offence to offend and insult, as I said, is a very subjective thing and is, in my mind, just nonsensical.


Senator Cameron once said to me—and I am not quoting him exactly—'You're not fit to be a Scotsman's shoelace,' or something like that. Well, there is a racial comment against me, and perhaps I should have been offended and insulted by that. When I told Senator Cameron the other day that he should learn to speak English properly, he did not worry too much about that. I do not think he was offended and insulted. He certainly was not humiliated or intimidated by it but, of course, some people in his party thought they could make a little bit of an issue about it and got on their high horses. I am sure that Senator Cameron was not offended or insulted by that comment. If he was, well, so what? That is what Australia is about. If he was humiliated or, if me saying that to him had, in some way, intimidated him and made him want to resign from parliament or cut his wrists or something, then perhaps that is another issue. I am sure saying that would not be classed as humiliating or intimidating.


I find that the furore created by this bill difficult to understand. The subjective test of 'offend and insult' is not something that should attract criminal penalties in whatever way the offence or insult is given, whether it be in relation to race, political beliefs or age. I get a bit of comment because of my age from people who say that they are not bigoted, racist, ageist or gender critical. They say that, and you then see how things come out. Nevertheless, if people want to offend and insult me, that is fine; I am not going to slit my wrists. That is how I have found people right across Australia to have been in what has now turned out to be a long life.


I grew up in the immediate post-war period in a place called Stanthorpe where there was a big cohort of principally Italians who had been there for some time. During the war they had sided with the Germans and they were a bit ostracised. I can still remember people who may have been treated a little bit differently in those days. They were part of Australia. They had come to Australia, as most people do, because of the way we are as Australians, because we can have a go at each other. When I was starting school, people who may have been singled out because they were Italians are people who are now leaders of the community. They have worked hard and have built up their assets, and they are now leaders in every aspect of our community.


I remember my good friend Senator John Panizza was one of them. I might say, the Labor Party in this chamber used to laugh at him when his English was not quite as good as it should have been. I was always absolutely disgusted at the way Labor Party senators used to do that. Senator Panizza is a great example of the types of people who would have had a difficult life when they first came to Australia. They wore different clothes, they did not quite speak the ocker language, but they worked hard and they succeeded and ended up very wealthy, as Senator Panizza did. He became a leader of his community. Where I live now, in Ayr in North Queensland, the Italian, Spanish, Greek and Southern European cohort of third and fourth generation is the group that, as I say, have worked very hard and have done very well. They are now, absolutely, community leaders. They are in that situation because they came to Australia because of what we were. They have contributed to what Australia now is.


This idea of trying to legislate against offence and insult is just not what Australia is about. Sure, if it goes further and humiliates and intimidates, perhaps that is something that a parliament should legislate about. But this amending bill, of course, continues the criminality of humiliation and intimidation. I support free speech in Australia and that is something that this country should be very interested in.


I have heard much better prepared and much more intellectual speeches from some of my colleagues here. I particularly noted Senator Seselja's fine contribution to this debate earlier. I agree entirely with nearly all of what he said. I think the furore that has been raised by the Labor Party, for whatever political purposes they might think are appropriate, is just ridiculous. Again, in itself it is un-Australian. I again congratulate Senator Day and those other senators who co-sponsored the bill. I am not a co-sponsor but I have indicated all along that I believe that the bill is the right way to go. It will receive my support. As I say, it is what my party took to the last election. Most Australians were aware of our party's position on this, and it certainly did not impact upon the very large majority that my party received at the last election.


This idea that government should legislate to prevent people being offended or insulted is, quite frankly, ridiculous. I repeat, as others have said, offence and insult is a very subjective test. What people say to one person may offend and insult, but they may say exactly the same thing to another person and it will not offend or insult. Government should not be legislating to define or to make criminal words that offend and insult people on the grounds of race, colour, national or ethnic origin or anything else. Why not have a law in case I am offended or insulted because someone says I am old? Why don't we make that a criminal offence? It would not worry me, I might say; I do not care if people offend and insult me because I am old. But are we going to legislate to stop that? Perhaps as an older person I am in a minority. Are we going to legislate to protect this minority, of which I am part, because I might be offended by what someone says about that?


I think this is a most uncontentious bill. I think it could almost be passed as a non-controversial bill, if people were thinking clearly about it and not following the party line. Perhaps some in the Labor Party see some political merit in making an issue of this. Australia is a wonderful country. We cherish our free speech. We cherish each other. We cherish people from all nationalities who have made Australia what it is today. We, as a nation, do not need government legislation to prevent us from offending and insulting one another. I strongly support the bill and again congratulate Senator Day for bringing it forward.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (10:19):  This is really quite exquisite timing because on 31 October this year we will mark 40 years since the Racial Discrimination Act came into effect. We should be commemorating what was one of Whitlam's most enduring achievements. Instead, we have to defend it. It is a shame that some in the Liberal Party think it necessary to water down the race hate protections in the act. We hope that the new Prime Minister shows the strength necessary to stare down the less tolerant parts of his party. But we do not have much reason to hope because the Prime Minister himself has said to Andrew Bolt that he is 'very comfortable' with the measures in the bill. I am not comfortable with the measures in this bill, and neither are the Australians of all backgrounds who spoke out against the government's divisive proposal—Indigenous Australians and the most recent of migrants, Jewish people and Arabic people, and people of all political persuasions. 


It might be that some opposite need a history lesson on why it is that we have the Racial Discrimination Act in the first place to understand why it is that we should not be watering it down. It is true to say that Australia has long struggled with racism, but it is probably fairer to say that Australia's minorities have long struggled against racism because it is they who have borne the consequences of prejudice. Unhappily, it is the case that the White Australia policy was one of the first pieces of legislation passed by this parliament after Federation. Prime Minister Edmund Barton argued in support of the bill, saying:


The doctrine of the equality of man was never intended to apply to the equality of the Englishman and the Chinaman.


And for the next 60 years, the doctrine of equality was not applied in Australia. All sides of politics share the blame for the discrimination that was entrenched in Australian life. Racism was not a minority view, nor was it a quiet one. In 1948, for instance, 57 per cent of respondents to a Morgan Gallup poll thought that the immigration of 'coloured peoples' should be stopped. These 57 per cent were not all bad people. They simply grew up in a time when racist beliefs were not just acceptable but could be passed off as a mark of civilisation. Nor was Australia alone in housing these beliefs. Racism has been and still is a global struggle.


None of this, however, made racial discrimination any easier to bear for those who suffered it. We will never know the cost of having turned away people because of their race. We do not know how many brilliant minds we turned away nor how many humble people who would have lived honest lives. What we do know, however, is the indignity and harm wrought on those of different backgrounds who made it to Australia, people who were denied jobs or education because of the colour of their skin, immigrants and their children who would hear families just like their own vilified on TV or in the papers simply because of where they had come from—the national shame of the stolen generation.


Forty years ago, this parliament looked at this past and said 'no more'. It was not a unitary effort; Australia's racist policies had required the connivance of both sides of politics, and dismantling it likewise required their cooperation. The Racial Discrimination Act was passed with bipartisan support. This did not mean universal support, however, far from it. Paul Keating later described the act as a 'very brave piece of legislation'. Only as brave a Prime Minister as Whitlam could have made it law.


It is instructive to recall what was said in this chamber when the bill was debated. One popular view was expressed by the senator who remarked:


Sometimes people have an aversion to others either because of personality, race, creed or whatever it might be. Does that mean it is such a bad thing? ... The fact of somebody having a racial attitude towards a person should not worry that person.


Or, to give it a more modern phrasing, people have the right to be bigots. I guess that, 40 years on, some things have not changed. But other things have changed and that is why it is so important to oppose this bill.


We are truly a multicultural nation today. The last census revealed that almost one in four Australians was born overseas and more than 43 per cent of us have at least one parent who was born overseas. The bill that is before us today is a product of a mindset that cannot even countenance tolerating difference let alone celebrating it. What I think we need to do, however, is value this diversity for what it is: our country's greatest competitive advantage in a global market place.


We are a successful, multicultural country with an educated multicultural people. This is something that the old economies of Europe do not have. They remain largely a monoculture and their migrant populations have very different educational and community profiles from ours. We cannot rest on our laurels in this respect. There is much to be done in ensuring that people from different ethnic backgrounds are able to enjoy the success they deserve. 


There has been much discussion recently about a bamboo ceiling that prevents people from Asian backgrounds from reaching the management and leadership positions that people with similar or even lesser qualifications and experience are able to reach. It is a huge mistake if we do not capitalise on the raw human talent that we have.


This is the century of the south. We have heard from the government ad nauseam recently about the importance of trade linkages with China and other countries in the Pacific. Well, the people in Australia who are in the best position to help us take advantage of these opportunities are the well educated people with cultural understanding and links to these nations—in other words, the very people that this government slaps in the face. 


It is difficult to conceive of this bill as anything other than an insult to ethnic communities in Australia. What is startling is the urgency with which it has been brought on. This is a government, we should remember, that thought that it was too busy with other matters to debate same-sex marriage and would not let that private member's bill onto the floor—no time for love, but when it comes to people's right to be bigots, this government clears a smooth passage onto the floor of the chamber.


The question we need to really ask is: why is this so important? Why is it so important to allow people to offend or insult people of other backgrounds? What are the situations where people have a legitimate debate fouled because of these provisions? That is what I think we should hear from the other side—a list of the types of racist and insulting statements the supporters of this bill have in mind that currently cannot be said because of the bill as it stands. It is all well and good to talk in esoteric terms about the freedom of speech, but what we are really talking about here is speech that is on the margins, speech that has the ability to poison the tenor of public debate, speech that is toxic to our community.


It is worth remembering why the original bill, the government's bill, was withdrawn by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott in the first place. He thought that the divisiveness of the government's attack on race-hate protections was distracting from national security issues. You do not need to make an instrumental argument against race hate and divisiveness. You can oppose it on its face. And you should.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-10-15,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (10:28):  I rise to support Senator Day and his co-sponsors' Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 2014. I commence with a quotation from the French philosopher Voltaire:


I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.


The principles of the French republic, the three pillars—liberty, equality and fraternity—go to the absolute essence of what we are discussing in this chamber today. Voltaire ,1694 to 1778, a writer, historian and, of course,  philosopher wrote:


I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.


If I can stay with the historic quote for a further moment and that of the first president of the United States of America, George Washington. I quote Washington's comment because it is relevant to our discussion in this place today. He said:


If freedom of speech is taken away, then dumb and silent we may be led, like sheep to the slaughter.


Washington was acclaimed as probably the most famous and influential of the presidents of the United States, which of course he led into independence.


I have heard a lot of debate and discussion but I have not heard too many definitions. I propose now to place on the record the commonly accepted and indeed dictionary definitions of some of the words that we are debating here today. The bill proposes to remove the words 'offend' and 'insult' from section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, which currently makes it unlawful to 'offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group' on the basis of their 'race, colour or national or ethnic origin'. That is what we are addressing today.


I applaud Senator Day for his initiative in bringing this bill before this chamber, which surely must rest at the base and the root of Australia's democratic system. Because if we cannot debate it, if we cannot come to the conclusion as to what is free and what can be said in this country then the courts have got no basis upon which to make their statement, so I do now want to put onto the record the definitions. The first word is 'humiliate'. The definition of humiliate: to humiliate is to injure the dignity of self respect of a person or a group, to embarrass or to put them down. As I understand from Senator Day's bill, there is no intention to remove the word 'humiliate' from section 18C as amended. The second is the word 'intimidate'. It is defined as to frighten or to overawe, especially in order to subdue or influence. A further definition: to threaten. And, again, unless I am mistaken, there is no intention within Senator Day's amendment to section 18C to have any effect, to leave 'humiliate' and 'intimidate' in the amended bill.


I now want to go to the definition of the two terms that are proposed in this bill to be deleted or to be limited and they are 'offend' and 'insult'. The definition of the term 'to offend': firstly, to cause offence to or resentment in, to upset; secondly, to displease or to cause anger; thirdly, to do wrong or to transgress. And that is one of the two words that are proposed in the Day bill to be removed. The second is the term 'insult', which refers to speaking to or treating a person with scornful abuse, to make an insulting remark or an insulting action or something that is so worthless or contemptible as to be offensive.


Whilst we are on the topic, since it has been thrown around—although it is not included in the words of 18C now and not included in the intended amendment by Senator Day and his cosponsors—I will introduce the term 'bigot'. A bigot, by definition, is an obstinate believer in religion, a political theory or similar who is intolerant of others and who tries to impose his or her views on others, a person who is prejudiced. That is what the definition of a bigot is. I would venture the opinion that on many of the occasions when we are speaking in this chamber, when we are countering the views of others who have spoken before us, we certainly express a level of intolerance to the view of others. We certainly in the words that we use would, in the view of the listener or an observer, be considered to be trying to impose our views on others. That is what the term 'bigot' means.


I turn, as indeed others have, as indeed Acting Deputy President Bernardi has, to the comments of many people in this debate in terms of where they stand on freedom of speech and the words 'offend' and 'insult'. If we take the commentary of Mr David Marr, a person who, as you said, I believe, in your contribution, Acting Deputy President Bernardi, and—I will repeat—a person who would not agree with most areas or positions that we would take. He said:


…in a free and energetic society, giving offence is necessary.


'Offending' and 'insulting' are the two terms that are proposed to be deleted. Marr goes on to say 'offence and insults are the everyday reality of free discourse' in a free and open and democratic society.


I imagine even some of the young people looking down on us today would certainly in their conversation in the classroom or the playground on occasion have said things of offence to others or, indeed, may have insulted a classmate or friend. Should they, in their maturity beyond the age of 18 years, be dragged before a court and be the subject of an action under the Racial Discrimination Act? Of course they should not. In fact, as Marr said:


Hurt feelings should never attract the law as they do now under section 18C.


I wonder if the young people who are listening to what is being said today are aware that, once they reach the age of 18 years and possibly even younger, if they do hurt the feelings of another, they may in fact attract the law under section 18C.


Professor James Spigelman, a former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and Chairman of the ABC, made this comment:


I am not aware of any international human rights instrument or national anti-discrimination statute in another liberal democracy that extends to conduct which is merely offensive.


He goes on to say:


The freedom to offend is an integral component of freedom of speech. There is no right not to be offended.


I was very impressed with the first speech of our Western Australian Labor Senate colleague Senator Bullock. He said:


To be tolerant of your views I do not need to pretend that you are just as right as I am but rather to accept that you have a perfect right to hold a view I believe to be wrong, even if I find your view offensive.


I look forward to robust discussions with Senator Bullock at different times on different topics in which we will be in disagreement and indeed as we have been. If he finds my words offensive or insulting, he has the perfect opportunity to retort and to come back to me in the way in which he wants to.


I will defend strongly the continuation of the words 'humiliate' and 'intimidate' to be held within 18C. They are deeply offensive to anybody. The fact that somebody tries to injure the dignity and self-respect of others, to put others down as either an individual or a group—the concept of someone trying to frighten, subdue, influence or threaten a person or a group of people—is deeply offensive in Australia. It is absolutely counter to the fundamental that created the essential Australian system of mateship. It is the absolute anathema of mateship that one would attempt to humiliate or intimidate.


Since mateship probably had its origins in the battlefields of Gallipoli and other places, you had better believe that there would have been plenty of rejoinders that somebody listening from the outside indeed may have seen to be offensive or insulting. The term 'bastard', as we know as Australians, will have many different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. Somebody from another country may think that a person is being deeply insulting or offensive to use that term when indeed they may actually be using it as a term of endearment. But of course we would never relate that term to humiliation and intimidation in the context of mateship as I speak.


In considering my contribution to the amendment proposed by Senator Day I reflected on some of the feedback I get to some of the contributions I make in this place and outside it. I have spoken at different times, for example, in terms of hormonal balance within the foetus. I have indeed made the observation that maleness is suppressed femaleness in the embryo and the foetus. I have drawn attention to you, Acting Deputy President Bernardi. I remember in one contribution making the point that, foetally and embryologically, you in fact were female before you became male. I received a lot of emails at that time which I would certainly regard as having been offensive. Indeed, I don't know if they might not have been from some members of your family! Or they may have been insulting.


I have made other comments about embryologic development in the animal species and the human species and I have incurred the wrath of people who have emailed me. I can assure you that those terms were deeply insulting to me. I am known to be a person who very strongly endorses and promotes the live export of production animals from this country. You would understand and had better believe that over time there have been and will be more communications to me, to my family and to my staff which any reasonable person would say are offensive and insulting—sometimes, of course, as you know, beyond that. Section 18C as it stands at the moment would allow me to drag such a person before the courts because they have expressed their democratic view that what I have said, in their view, is insulting or offensive.


Certainly there has been no attempt in those circumstances to intimidate. If there were, they would have to expect a different response from me. But, as a public person, as we all are, if we express our views openly and freely then we must be the subject of communication from others who would disagree with us. That person must know that they are free of the possibility of being dragged before a court.


I conclude my contribution with the words of the Attorney-General and now our leader in this place:


By making the reasonable likelihood of causing offence or insult the test of unacceptable behaviour … section 18C is a grotesque limitation on ordinary political discourse.


Surely this country was born on the principle of the freedom of political and related discourse. I commend Senator Day for his initiative in proposing this amendment bill. It is reasonable. It leaves those offensive words 'intimidation' and 'humiliation' in, and it removes the words 'offend' and 'insult', which have no place in a modern democracy

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-10-15,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (10:44):  I rise to speak against the amendments put forward by Senator Day in the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 2014 to weaken our racial discrimination laws in this country. I do so because I see these amendments as anathema to the social inclusion and national unity that this country, at this point in time particularly, is so crying out to achieve. In fact, I was very pleased to join with so many faith leaders this week here in Parliament House for the National Day of Unity. Representatives from the Muslim, Sikh, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Baha'i—so many different faiths—came here to Parliament House to stand with us, leaders in our own community and members of parliament, to say: 'We stand together against hate speech. We stand together against bigotry. We stand together to celebrate the diversity and mutual respect that we engender amongst each other to foster positive relationships between all faiths and all ethnicities.' Why would anyone want to reduce and weaken that bond that we have? That is how I see an attack on our racial discrimination laws—laws that have served this country for the last 20 years very, very well, laws that provide for freedom of speech. 


We have freedom of speech in this country, and it is provided for within the very piece of legislation that this senator is trying to weaken. As he would be very well aware, it is provided for in section 18D of the legislation. We have gone through this debate. We have gone through this debate tirelessly under the Abbott government. We saw very clearly that, after an immense amount of community pressure and pressure from the opposition, the Abbott government and, embarrassingly, the then Prime Minister Tony Abbott himself, had to tell the Attorney-General that his ideals in trying to reduce our racial discrimination laws in this country were a bad step and he had to withdraw them. Of course, that was welcomed. It was very much welcomed by all of the faith leaders and the community at large, but little did we know that it was going to be temporary. Little did we know that, if a senator from another party were to introduce amendments—changes which look very similar to those that were introduced by the Abbott government—the new Turnbull government would not come out and say: 'No, we dealt with that. We said that we were not going to weaken our racial discrimination laws in this country, and we will not support Senator Day's bill.' That is not what we have had from the new Turnbull government.


Everyone thought that, with a new broom at the top, it was all going to be different. Why doesn't Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister of this country, show that he is different? Why doesn't he show that his government is different and say that the coalition government in this country will not support Senator Day's weakening of our racial discrimination laws? We have had absolute silence from the Prime Minister. Instead, we have had the contributions of a number of his backbench and a number of individuals in this place, particularly, such as Senator Back's contribution just now. Acting Deputy President Bernardi, you have also made clear your support for the weakening of the racial discrimination laws. So who is to know where this government stands? You are completely divided on this—completely divided. You have some who are still standing firm on the previous government's complete rejection of the Attorney's attempt to weaken these laws, and then you have others who are very much in support of the attempt.


That is not good enough. That is not good enough for this country to go forward with. That is not good enough to tell to faith leaders, who need more than ever at this time to know that their government is standing strong and firm with them in support against hate speech. That is what our Racial Discrimination Act provides. It provides very strong and robust provisions, particularly in 18C, that give this multicultural country of ours something to feel strong and proud about. We know that all of those rallies, petitions and delegations of community leaders who came to this place meant something. Those of us on this side listened, but it seems that those in government are now willing to turn a blind eye to all of that support for our racial discrimination laws and to all of that opposition against what the coalition government was trying to do. They are completely ignoring all of those leaders—Indigenous leaders, Jewish leaders, Arab leaders—and trying to bring these awful amendments back through this place. 


That is not what you will find from the Labor Party. We stand very firm with all of those faith leaders and those community leaders. We do not want to see racism and bigotry in this country. We do not want to see the likes of Frederick Tobin back preaching his anti-Holocaust rhetoric. We want to ensure that we have decent and fair laws in this country that deal with hate speech. That is what our Racial Discrimination Act has provided for a very, very long time. What on earth is the motivation behind this particular senator and behind those senators who want to weaken these laws? What is your motivation? That is what I ask you. You cannot say your motivation is to have freedom of speech in Australia, because we have freedom of speech in Australia under this particular law, and you all know it—in section 18D, we have it. Of course, all freedom of speech has to have some limits. Do you really want to live in a country where hate speech is on your doorstep, where it is okay to have the likes of Frederick Tobin go out there and preach his Holocaust-denying, awful speech? No, we do not. We do have some limits. But I can tell you: the bow is pretty long when it comes to freedom of speech in relation to race in this country and those provisions are in this law, the Racial Discrimination Act.


I think it is important to remember the reason given by the then Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, for his change of policy. It was in August last year when, in the wake of the emerging crisis in Syria and Iraq, Prime Minister Abbott admitted that the divisiveness that his government had created, the divisiveness of his government's attack on race hate protections, was a distraction from national security issues. That was the excuse he gave for abandoning the weakening of our racial hate laws. In doing so he threw the baby out with the bathwater, so to speak, and that was the end of the weakening of these laws. We now find ourselves in a very similar position. More than ever, we need unity in this country, and the episodes that have occurred in the last week or so in Victoria and in New South Wales prove that more than ever. So why would anyone come into this place right now and try to weaken the national unity that we have in this law, the social cohesion that is provided in this law? Why would anyone come in here and open the gates to hate speech at this point in time? It is beyond me in any circumstances but it is particularly beyond me at this point in time.


Labor stands very firmly against extreme hate speech, which section 18C has covered. The Australian people made very clear their opposition to the coalition government's attack on racial hate speech, so my message to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is: show that you are different from the previous Prime Minister, Tony Abbott. One way you can show that is by rejecting this amendment and standing firm with our faith leaders and our multicultural communities and ensure that this law remains as strong and robust as it has for the last 20 years.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:02):  I present the explanatory memorandum and I move:


That the bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted. 




The speech read as follows—



The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Harming Australians) Bill will amend Division 115 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 to provide for the retrospective application of offences of murder and manslaughter of an Australian citizen or resident overseas.


The Bill will enable prosecution of these offences in Australia, under Australian law, in certain circumstances. The Bill will also include safeguards for the retrospective application of these offences. 




Existing Harming Australians offences



Division 115 of the Criminal Code currently provides for four offences resulting in harm to Australians, including murder, manslaughter, recklessly causing serious harm, or intentionally causing serious harm to Australians. 


These offences have extra-territorial application and were enacted following the 2002 Bali bombings. The existing offences were given retrospective commencement of 45 days to apply from 1 October 2002.



Purpose



These amendments will extend operation of the offences of murder and manslaughter of an Australian citizen and resident of Australia overseas to crimes committed prior to 1 October 2002. 


The maximum penalty under the new laws will be life imprisonment for murder and twenty-five years for manslaughter. 


While there are a range of tools at the disposal of Australia's law enforcement agencies, these amendments will clarify that crimes of murder and manslaughter of Australians can be prosecuted, wherever and whenever they occur.




Safeguards



Due to their retrospective operation, the new offences include safeguards to ensure their compatibility with Australia's obligations under international law. 


Conduct constituting the offence must be an offence at the time of commission under the law of the country in which the conduct occurred. This is known as the 'dual criminality' requirement. 


A person convicted of the new offences will also have the benefit of the lowest applicable penalty for the offence as between the laws of Australia and the country in which the conduct occurred. This is known as the 'benefit of the lowest penalty' requirement.


These two requirements ensure that Australia's criminal laws operate consistently with Australia's obligations under international law on the use of retrospective criminal offences.


As a further safeguard, and consistent with all other offences in Division 115 of the Criminal Code, the Attorney-General's written consent is required to commence proceedings under these provisions.


This is an important safeguard which enables the Attorney‑General to consider the circumstances of a case prior to commencing prosecutions.




Conclusion



Tragically Australians have been victims of violent crimes like murder and manslaughter overseas. These amendments provide a further avenue to seek justice for Australian victims of the most serious crimes by applying Australian criminal law to those responsible for these offences when they occurred before 1 October 2002. 


This bill demonstrates the Government's commitment to ensuring that Australia has every legal tool it needs to prosecute those who commit heinous crimes on Australian citizens and residents overseas wherever and whenever they may occur.


I commend this bill to the Senate.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Mr President, I seek leave to make a short statement in relation to the bill.

  This bill had its genesis in a very tragic event—that is, the killing of Anthea Bradshaw Hall in Brunei in 1994. It was a crime that has not been prosecuted and, but for this bill, could not have been pursued by Australian police. This bill will correct that gap in our law.


I want to acknowledge the presence in the gallery this afternoon of members of Anthea Bradshaw-Hall's family: her father, Martin; her mother, Roslyn; and her brothers Craig and Paul Bradshaw. I also acknowledge the presence in the gallery of Mr Michael O'Connell, the Commissioner for Victims' Rights from the government of South Australia. Might I finally acknowledge the work of two of our parliamentary colleagues who have been instrumental in correcting this injustice and bringing this bill before this chamber: our colleague Senator Nick Xenophon, who introduced his own version of the bill in 2013 and whom I join in co-sponsoring the bill; and the honourable Christopher Pyne, the member for Sturt, who will soon be introducing the bill in the House of Representatives and who represents the federal electorate in which the Bradshaw family lives. 


This, as I said at the start, had its genesis in a tragedy. As I said to members of the Bradshaw family a little while ago, this is nevertheless an example of the political and parliamentary system working to respond to a community need across party lines and to correct a gap in our law.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing orders 111.

The evaluation identified areas for improvement, in particular the administrative requirements of the DSP pose a significant administrative burden for universities.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (12:45):  I rise to speak on the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Amendment Bill 2015, the Customs Amendment (Fees and Charges) Bill 2015 and the Import Processing Charges Amendment Bill 2015. Labor supports this package of bills which implement measures in the 2015-16 budget responding to recommendations by the Joint Review of Border Fees, Charges and Taxes. The fees review covered major charges imposed at Australia's border entry points, including import-processing and passenger movement charges levied by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection; import-related fees and charges recovered by the Department of Agriculture; visa application charges; and cost recovery for services, especially those resulting from industry requirements. The measures implemented by these bills, which are projected to generate $107.6 million in revenue across the forward estimates, are consistent with Labor's commitment to maintaining a robust and efficient customs authority.


The Department of Immigration and Border Protection assesses and processes applications, issues licences and oversees compliance by warehouse and depot licence holders and by customs brokers. Cost-recovery charges are imposed on individuals and businesses holding or applying for licences. Licensing fees have mostly remained unchanged since they were introduced in 1997, resulting in declining revenue. The fees were originally imposed to recover the full cost of licensing, but the fees review uncovered a shortfall in the recovery of costs within some programs, amounting to about 30 per cent of customs broker charges.


The Customs Amendment (Fees and Charges) Bill and the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Amendment Bill will consolidate all licensing charges under a single act to simplify the legislation and introduce new charges that are better aligned with costs to be recovered. The new charges include a warehouse licence application charge, from $3000 to $4,500; a warehouse licence variation charge, from $300 to $450; and a customs broker licence application charge of $130 to $195 for individuals and $1,300 to $1,950 for businesses. It is hoped that these charges will reduce the cost of administering the licensing program by encouraging applicants to be better prepared. The Customs Amendment (Fees and Charges) Amendment Bill imposes a small fee for a declaration on imported goods, and the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Amendment Bill will increase warehouse, custom broker and licensing charges to allow cost recovery.


Existing import-processing charges have also resulted in a revenue gap. In 2013-14, for example, the department spent $252.7 million administering these charges but received only $242.4 million in revenue. The Import Processing Charges Amendment Bill makes three main changes. The same charge will be imposed regardless of the method of importation—that is, whether it is sea cargo, air cargo, or by postal import and warehouse declarations. A standard higher fee will be imposed for documentary import and warehouse declarations, because of the extra work in processing these declarations. The cost base for import and warehouse declaration charges will be broadened, by recovering the cost of the department's cargo and trade-related reforms. The charges increased or introduced by these bills are necessary and appropriate revenue measures, and Labor is pleased to support them.

These bills will give effect to the changes proposed as part of the Joint Review of Border Fees, Charges and Taxes. The review focused on identifying whether the government's border charges could be consolidated and improved to better support Australia's future border operations.


The bills increase and restructure import processing charges and introduce new charges in the warehouse and customs broker licensing regimes. The increase in new charges will provide critical funding for improvements in trade and travel facilitation and will support improved security at Australia's border. The changes strike the right balance between supporting Australia's international competitiveness and ensuring the costs of maintaining the integrity of our border are appropriately shared with those who use it. I commend the bills to the Senate.

It is a critical principle in a responsible system of government that the parliament on behalf of the people can ask questions of the executive and that such questions be answered in a reasonable time frame, and, in accordance with standing order 74, I have moved this motion. 


A number of questions have been asked since July of this year about the competitive evaluation process for the SEA 1000 system in relation to combat systems and technical commands and control systems. Questions have been asked about competitive evaluation process for the submarine project, the defence white paper and the way the CEP—the competitive evaluation process—is operating. Questions have been asked of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, DSTO, in relation to the Advanced Processor Build Program. Questions have also been asked in relation to the SEA 1000 program for the Future Submarines; visits of officers to France, Germany and Japan in the past 24 months; the Rizzo review; shipbuilding budgets here in Australia; the competitive evaluation process; and replacement combat systems. These are matters that ought to be answered under standing order 74.


I know it was short notice, but I did give advance notice to the acting minister's office in respect of this. The issue is that we have Senate estimates coming up. As a courtesy, I did write to the Minister for Defence's office and the Prime Minister office yesterday to give notice of this situation so that this motion could be obviated. If there is some undertaking from the government to give an answer or answers prior to Senate estimates commencing, that would be very helpful in the context of what this standing order is meant to enforce.

You would be aware, of course, Senator Xenophon, that about four weeks ago there was a reconstruction of the government, with the election of Mr Turnbull as the leader of the parliamentary Liberal Party. And a new defence minister, Senator Payne, was sworn in on 21 September. Now, Senator Xenophon, you did not indicate in your question, or in the short speech that you just gave, the date on which those questions were placed on notice—nor would I expect you to. But it may very well be—




Senator Xenophon:
  It was 20 July.




Senator BRANDIS:
  It was 20 July—sorry, Senator Xenophon. If the questions were placed on notice on 20 July then, plainly, they were placed on notice during the incumbency of the previous defence minister, Mr Andrews. As I said, some four weeks and three days ago there was a transfer of responsibilities for that portfolio. But in any event I will examine the matter, as I ought to do under standing order 74, and get back to you.


The defence department does endeavour to respond to these questions promptly, and I am told that it will be responding to outstanding questions as soon as practicable. Of course, Senator Payne has been away all week at AUSMIN, as you know. These answers have to be cleared by the minister, and Senator Payne has not been available this week to do so.


Given the level of detail and complexity involved in your questions, Senator Xenophon, I note finally that Senate estimates is an appropriate forum—probably the more appropriate forum—to raise these matters, and that you will have the chance to do that next week. I would also like to point out that all portfolio responses to Senate estimates questions taken on notice have been lodged.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:10):  I move:




That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.



What a complete disaster the mismanagement of the nbn by this government has been. It is not just limited to the multibillion dollar cost blow-out. So desperate has Mr Turnbull's position been to distract from his mismanagement of nbn that in April this year he asked nbn co to cook up this fictitious cost for Labor's nbn, to give him something else to hide behind. This is not just cowardly; this is incredibly appalling governance and completely at odds with the government's oversight guidelines for Commonwealth companies. That is exactly what I asked Senator Cormann to address—the fact that the Commonwealth Government Business Enterprise Governance and Oversight Guidelines requires GBEs to avoid activities that could give rise to questions about their political impartiality.


Clearly, the minister did not answer this question and, clearly, Mr Turnbull's promise that his so-called 'multitechnology mix' version of the nbn would be rolled out faster and cheaper has not happened. In fact, what we have had is an incredible doubling of the cost, an incredible blow-out from some $29.5 billion to the cost now of some $56 billion.


What I am particularly concerned about are the good governance issues surrounding this. Those are particularly what I asked about. Particularly what I am concerned about is how the Senate requested today that the government come clean about whether the inclusion of a political counterfactual, which ministers knew would not replicate the rigour of nbn co's business plan, is consistent with section 1.7 of the Commonwealth GBE guidelines. The guidelines do require GBEs to maintain the highest standards of integrity, accountability and responsibility.


I cannot see how they have done that. In fact, I think they have done the opposite of that, wherein lie the credibility of this government, the integrity of this government and the good governance arrangements of this government and of this Prime Minister. It was under this Prime Minister's watch as Minister for Communications—as he was in April—that this has occurred. After two years as Minister for Communications all that Mr Turnbull has left behind is a version of the nbn best described as 'Malcolm Turnbull's mess'. He has no-one else to blame for this failure but himself.


Of course, he has been obsessed with connecting Australians to the nbn by using 20th century copper. Then he went ahead with his second-rate nbn on the basis of a dodgy policy and some very bad advice. The financial return to taxpayers from the coalition's second-rate nbn has completely crashed. In December 2013 we were assured that the rate of return would be up to 5.3 per cent. Now, it will be 3.5 per cent at best. This has been a complete shemozzle and a complete embarrassment for this Prime Minister, who was the Minister the Communications. It has been a complete mismanagement of nbn and, as I said, not just limited to the multibillion dollar cost blow-out that we have seen and listened to today through Minister Cormann's answer.


Distracting people from that mismanagement has been the key for this government. 'Let's distract them from the mismanagement by cooking up a fictitious cost for Labor's nbn.' This was to give them something to hide behind. That really is what has happened here, and it beggars belief how they would cook the books to cover up their own incompetence instead of actually addressing the multibillion dollar nbn blow-out that they have now put forward.


The irony with all of this is that it is not just a multibillion-dollar blow-out so that we have a better NBN—we still end up with the same second-rate NBN, the same second-rate version, rolling out slower than he promised and costing up to a whopping $26.5 billion more than he promised. That is Mr Turnbull's legacy as Minister for Communications. It has been an absolute disaster and I do not see it getting better under his Prime Ministership. (Time expired)

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2015-10-15,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources) (15:15):  Can I just say that I think that the NBN is a fantastic infrastructure project and I think that the majority of Australians think that it is a great project. What I find extraordinarily disappointing in the questions that were asked today and in the contribution that we just heard from Senator Singh is that, for some strange and wondrous reason, despite the fact that the Labor Party when they were in government were the architects of the original idea of the NBN, they are now in the process of trying to tear it down. I would have thought that two years on from the change of government, with the rollout of the NBN starting to accelerate—we are starting to see some real results out there, with over a million people able to get access to the NBN, with the first satellite going up last week, which covers an area that is very close to my heart: the rural and regional areas of Australia—they would actually be starting to look at some of the more positive aspects of it and they would be starting to prosecute the best and most cost-effective way of delivering the NBN into the future. But, no, no, no; they are still sitting here two years after this government was elected and they are still trying to defend a legacy of the previous Minister for Communications; they are still here trying to defend the indefensible. It is very disappointing because, as I said, I am a great supporter of the NBN. I know that many people who live in South Australia are looking forward to being able to get access to the NBN—and yet it seems that all the opposition want to do here is to drag down what I think is a fabulous infrastructure project.


The issue on which those opposite were questioning today was in relation to a letter sent by the shareholder ministers to the nbn co asking them if they would undertake a comparison of the different technologies that are proposed for the NBN. As we know, when the coalition came into government, it was realised that there was a shortfall in the budget and something needed to be done about making sure that the NBN was affordable and could be delivered on time. For those opposite to stand here today and to make comments like 'cooked up', 'fictitious costs', 'politically motivated', 'counterfactual', 'distorted'—where are the facts? Where is the evidence to substantiate these comments? It is absolutely outrageous.




Senator Kim Carr:
  That is what the letter says. Read the letter.




Senator RUSTON:
  I would suggest that Senator Carr, who is happily interjecting, because he does not seem to be able to make any other contribution apart from interjections, would have been standing here and criticising the government if they had not undertaken a comparison. I am sure he would have been asking, 'How on earth does the government actually know that the most cost-effective method of delivering the NBN isn't fibre-to-the-premise?' if we had not undertaken an investigation or an analysis of that particular model.


So we need to stop being hypocritical and we need to stop carrying on prosecuting something that is dead and buried now. Let's get on with looking at what is going to be positive for Australians into the future. As I said, I can see this is a great project. I congratulate Senator Conroy for coming up with the idea of the NBN. Just because we do not necessarily agree about how some of the delivery has taken place, and we may still disagree on the methods and the mix of technologies that are about to be rolled out, that does not mean that we do not all think this is a fabulous project. I would ask those opposite to step back from their political carry-on and let all of us work together to deliver this fantastic project for Australia.


I want to briefly make a comment in relation to another question that was asked, in relation to water buybacks. I am really disappointed at the level of scaremongering that is going on in the context of water about where the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder sits, who has primary carriage of the water, what is my delegated responsibility in the water space et cetera. All we are doing by carrying on like this is causing great concern, upset and uncertainty for the irrigators and the communities that live in the Murray-Darling Basin.


So I would ask those opposite to please consider, before you start carrying on with this kind of behaviour, the people who are most likely to be affected by it. I draw to your attention a press release by the National Irrigators' Council, who made the comment that they are 'sick and tired of being used as political pawns as politicians try to whip up fear to wedge each other for electoral gain in marginal Adelaide seats'. Both Minister Joyce and I live in the Murray-Darling Basin. This is a first. This should be a good thing. I think we are in a better position than before to know what is possibly in the best interests of not just the basin but the basin communities. I am very much looking forward to working with Minister Joyce to deliver good environmental, economic and social outcomes for the entire Murray-Darling Basin.

"Gallagher, Sen Katy",ALP,2015-10-15,"



Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:20):  I rise to make some comments in relation to the question I asked around the Public Service enterprise bargaining that is going on at the moment and the answers provided by Senator Cash, particularly her comments where she said she valued the role of public servants and believes that they should be well paid but that this should be within reasonable community standards. She then went on to make a whole range of statements about 'in the real world where real Australians live'—I think again trying to perpetuate the myth that public servants are not real Australians and do not live in the real world. I am sure it will come as no surprise to the Minister for Employment that the vast majority of public servants are living on average wages. The vast majority of the Commonwealth's employees earn average wage incomes. These people, these public servants, people who turn up and provide services to the community as part of their work, have been denied a fair pay offer and denied any pay increase for more than two years now. So I do not think it is fair for those statements to be made about real Australians living in the real world only getting a real pay rise if they show real productivity. The Public Service show productivity improvements all the time. It is a constant in the work they do, because they are always asked to do more to implement government policy and agenda, often without any additional resourcing. The fact that under this government the Public Service are now probably being asked to produce a higher amount of work, with 17,700 fewer staff than a couple of years ago, is a testament to the productivity gains that are being made across the service simply as a result of the job cuts that have been viciously pursued by this government.


With the pay offer as it stands, and the bargaining framework that the government has put in place, we all understand the conservative drive to reduce wages, conditions and working standards for ordinary workers. We can see that with the attacks on penalty rates and in other areas, and we are seeing it enforced in the Australian Government Public Sector Workplace Bargaining Policy. It is exactly this policy that is stopping the resolution of bargaining across the APS. We know that the executives within agencies have no ability to resolve these EBAs, the enterprise agreements, with their staff, because of the constraints that have been put on them by this framework. The constraints around the 1½ per cent, the productivity savings and the reduction of conditions being sought by the government are stopping the agencies having any capacity to bargain or to fix any problems that relate to the individual agencies. That is why, after 18 months of bargaining and some two years without a wage increase, we see that 96 per cent of public servants still do not have a new agreement in place.


When you look at those agreements that have gone to a vote, you see that 91 per cent in Immigration and Border Protection, 83 per cent in Human Services and 81 per cent in the Productivity Commission have voted no to the offer. These staff are making a decision that it is actually better to have a wage freeze—or, essentially, a real wage cut—than it is to settle for what the Commonwealth government is offering its employees. I note that in DHS, a big employer where the majority of the staff are at the APS 3 or APS 4 level—primarily because they work in Centrelink or Medicare—the main reasons that people have voted no are (1) the pay offer; (2) that the streamlining of their enterprise agreements, as mandated by the bargaining policy, will cost them some of their entitlements; (3) that they do not think that they will get salary advancement; and (4) that the family-friendly conditions were threatened. These are the reasons that your staff are saying they cannot settle for 1½ per cent, because of all the strings attached.


There are 152,000 public servants who need a pay rise and deserve a pay rise, and this government should prioritise the settling of these agreements now.

"Lindgren, Sen Joanna",LP,2015-10-15,"



Senator LINDGREN
 (Queensland) (15:25):  I rise to take note of answers to questions and give a response. Labor has had no plan, cost analysis, business analysis or risk analysis around the NBN. Unlike the Labor Party, the government stakeholders have a plan that includes good governance and transparency. The coalition's plan is a rigorous one, and it delivers a scheme that is the best value for money. We want to make sure all Australians get the best in a timely manner.


The coalition has asked the GBEs to properly assess all options. This is because we have high standards of accountability and transparency, and there are definitely no conspiracies as suggested by the other side. We know that under Labor there were cost blow-outs. The Financial Review states:


Labor has no credibility in this area … It went from $4.7 billion in 2007, to $42 billion in 2009 and is to cost at least $56 billion today.


Labor's announcement says that 'it will reinvigorate the National Broadband fibre-optic-cable-to-every-home Network', but it does not—let me repeat: it does not—share any details. As we know on this side of the chamber, having no plan means cost blow-outs.


As usual, Labor like to fling mud, but the fact is that Labor's announcements always lack the important details. Their policies are often expensive jokes, and under Labor the NBN rollout was a slow-moving train wreck. Under the coalition, the NBN will be fully complete by 2020. Labor need to explain how they will pay for it and how long they will keep Australians waiting for superfast broadband.


All Australians should have access to high-speed broadband. Under the coalition, every household and business in Australia—a total of about 12 million premises by the time the rollout finishes—will be connected and directly affected. The coalition is committed to delivering fast broadband to all Australians sooner and at least cost to taxpayers. Under Labor, a miserable 51,000 users were on the network two years ago. Today there are more than 570,000 subscribers. The NBN Corporate Plan shows that by the end of June 2016 around one in four premises will have access to the NBN, and by the end of June 2018 around three-quarters of homes and businesses will have access.


Under the coalition, the NBN is now meeting its financial and deployment targets, a far cry from under Labor, when it only met 17 per cent of its deployment forecasts. Labor has a history of mismanagement. The history includes some of the most mismanaged projects in the history of the government. Under the previous government, around $6.5 billion was spent to deliver broadband to two per cent of premises. A government cost-benefit analysis of the NBN found that the coalition government's project would deliver $18 billion of economic benefits to Australia, compared to $2 billion of benefits that were being facilitated through Labor. An analysis of Labor's model shows that it would not be finished until 2026 at the earliest, and as late as 2028. This is disastrous for Australia's competitiveness in the digital economy and would leave millions stranded with very poor or no broadband for more than a decade. This is an unacceptable trade-off.


The coalition government's project remains on track and is to be completed by 2020. The Burdekin cost-benefit analysis found that our approach will deliver $6 billion of extra benefits and around $10 billion lower cost due do its earlier deployment. Under our watch, the company is now acting in a reliable and businesslike manner, delivering fibre to premises on time and on cost.


Labor has announced today that a future Labor government would scrap the multitechnology approach. The NBN rollout under Labor was slow and costly compared to that of the coalition, where the NBN will be fully complete by 2020. The NBN now has end-users to prove it. For the vast majority of households across Australia, the coalition's NBN will provide the same high-speed and high-quality service no matter what underlying broadband technology is used. The Labor Party is also ignoring incredibly valuable HFC networks that currently pass four million homes. A technology infrastructure mix is the best way forward.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2015-10-15,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (15:30):  The evidence is now in that Mr Turnbull was a failure as a communications minister. What is more, it is clear that he is aware of the fact that he was a failure as a communications minister and that his tenure in that role has been a disaster for our country. We know that Mr Turnbull promised that his second-rate NBN would be built for $29.5 billion. That cost has doubled. It has gone up to $56 billion. Why else would Mr Turnbull seek to get information about costing on the fibre-to-the-premises model from nbn co?


We know that Mr Turnbull previously ruled out fibre to the premises as an option. In fact, in August 2013, Mr Turnbull went so far—and it was seen as quite controversial at the time—as to say that fibre to the premises was 'largely superseded' by the coalition's preferred model. Why would the communications minister and the finance minister write to nbn co to ask them to spend precious taxpayer resources on examining a technology which Mr Turnbull previously said has been largely superseded? We know that his second-rate version of the NBN is rolling out slower than what was promised. As I indicated, it will cost up to a whopping $26.5 billion more than what was promised.


I am interested in a recent article published by the Business Insider on 9 September 2015 which talks about the fact that:


… with the release in August of the 2016 NBN corporate plan and in the light of overseas developments, it is clear that the Coalition’s broadband network will not provide adequate bandwidth, will be no more affordable than Labor’s FTTP network and will take almost as long to roll out.


This is quite a damning assessment. This is not a Labor Party assessment of the government's approach to the NBN. This is from the Business Insider website. The Business Insider looked at affordability and identified that Labor's funding estimates ended up being about $44.9 billion. The article went on to say:


By comparison, the Coalition’s funding estimates … have fluctuated wildly.  


Before the 2013 election, the coalition claimed that its technology mix network would cost less than one-third, or 30 per cent, of Labor's FTTP based NBN. It is quite clear that they have not taken into account the cost of repairing and maintaining Telstra's ageing copper network. This was underestimated, as was the cost of retraining and maintaining a workforce with the wider range of skills needed to install and maintain the so-called multitechnology mix network. These costs are unique to the MTN. In the space of two years, the lower-cost deal the coalition spruiked to Australian voters has turned out to be not so affordable after all. 


The financial return to taxpayers from the coalition's second-rate NBN has also crashed. We were assured that it would be up to 5.3 per cent; now, it will be 3.5 per cent at best. Mr Turnbull's mismanagement of the NBN is not just limited to the multibillion dollar tax blow-outs. As I said, he is so determined to distract from his mismanagement of the NBN that in April he asked the nbn co to cook up a fictitious cost for Labor's NBN to give them something to hide behind. This is not just cowardly; it is appalling governance, completely at odds with the governance and oversight guidelines for Commonwealth companies. 


Malcolm Turnbull promised that his so-called multitechnology mix version of the NBN would be rolled out faster and cheaper. Mr Turnbull has no-one to blame for this failure but himself. Obsessed with connecting Australians to the NBN using 20th century copper, he went ahead with a second-rate NBN on the basis of a dodgy policy and some very bad advice.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (15:42):  I seek leave to make a short statement in relation to the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Better Targeting the Income Tax Transparency Laws) Bill.


Leave granted.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  In the last parliament, laws were passed to come into effect on 1 July 2015 for companies with revenue over $100 million to publish five things: their company name, ABN, total revenue, total taxable income and tax paid. The ATO has not yet published this information despite the legal requirement to do so. Now, through this amendment bill, the government wants to exempt private Australian companies from disclosing these details on the basis that private company owners will be at heightened risk of kidnap and the disclosure of their commercially sensitive information. 


The Greens would like to put on record, and we would have spoken strongly against this at length had we had the opportunity to do so, that we would have voted against this amendment and we certainly would have called a division. The reason for our opposition is there is no evidence to back up this amendment. This was looked at extensively and these private companies that the government want to exempt through this bill possess the key hallmarks of tax avoidance structures. They do not have to publicly disclose information, many are part of global groups of companies with varying levels of ownership and they do not have to turn a huge profit in Australia compared to their overseas operations.


The key weapon we have in our arsenal, the key weapon we have to prevent or at least disincentivise or discourage tax avoidance, is reputational risk. It would have been simple to at least have a register of companies, where they put up how much tax they are paying, and it is a significant matter of public interest that this has now been withdrawn. 


Lastly, I would like to state a thankyou to the Tax Justice Network, who were tireless in coming into this building to meet with most of us and push for this exact kind of legislation to try to make this available. We regret, once again, that we were not able to speak at length about this bill and register our strong protest at this amendment being passed.

 (South Australia) (15:44):  I seek leave to make a short statement in relation to the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Better Targeting the Income Tax Transparency Laws) Bill 2015, which passed earlier today in the chamber.


Leave granted.




Senator XENOPHON:
  I did not get an opportunity to speak at that time during the debate on this bill. I regret that and I am grateful to be given leave to make a short statement of two or three minutes. Can I indicate that my position was to support the government's bill with some reservations and some concerns. I felt it was reasonable to exempt private family companies in this country, notwithstanding that they could have a significant turnover, to be exempt from the reporting requirements of this bill.


The principal concern I had was not of kidnapping, which I think was one of the arguments put—conjures up images of Robert Louis Stevenson and the like. I thought that was perhaps fanciful or at the very least overstated. The principal concern I had was that the publication of sensitive tax and income information to the market would put those firms that decide that they want to remain as private companies at a competitive disadvantage, especially in dealing with much larger corporations. An example that was put to me, which I believe is a very credible example, is that those firms that deal with, say, Coles and Woolworths that are food processors. They may have the requisite threshold of $100 million. I do not think it is fair for those companies to be put at that competitive disadvantage in dealing with companies like Coles and Woolworths, who are many times bigger, and put them in a more difficult position.


The Commissioner of Taxation furthermore made clear in comments at a conference in March this year that this law should be 'focused on multinationals as opposed to Australian private companies'. I think that no-one could accuse Chris Jordan, the tax commissioner, of being a soft touch when it comes to pursuing tax avoidance and taking a very active approach in relation to this.


I look forward to examining the details of the government's details of the government's upcoming multinational tax avoidance bill. I also want to flag that I will raise with the Assistant Treasurer and the Treasurer, issues of transparency. I still believe we need to have amendments that target those companies, those subsidiaries of multinational corporations which provide very little information at the moment. I am concerned that many multinationals that operate in Australia with multibillion dollar turnovers do not abide by what many considered to be the Australian legal requirement to produce general-purpose financial statements each year, which is a standard that larger Australian listed companies follow and is information that can be readily available.


As reported by Michael West of Fairfax Media this year, ASIC appears unwilling or unable to compel the likes of Google, Microsoft and Apple as well as big pharmaceutical companies to produce anything like transparent financial statements on their Australian operations so that is an issue that is a live one. That is an issue that when the government's very welcome bill of multinational tax avoidance comes up, I believe there ought to be some amendments at that stage and I look forward to working constructively with all of my colleagues to remedy what many consider to be in an anomaly in relation to these multinational subsidiaries and general-purpose accounts.

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



I am pleased to introduce the Health Legislation Amendment (eHealth) Bill 2015, which implements the Government's recent $485m Budget announcement on eHealth. These changes are just one small aspect of the Government's broader Digital health agenda.


This Bill takes the first important steps to reboot our national electronic health records system to deliver an effective system that will help improve the health of all Australians, as well as realising the benefits that instant access to and sharing of electronic health records can provide.


A review of the personally controlled electronic health record in 2013 found that there was overwhelming support to continue implementing a national and consistent shared electronic health record system for all Australians, but that a change in approach was needed to correct a number of early implementation issues, and a lack of confidence in the system from clinicians and consumers due to these issues. 


The Healthcare Identifiers Service, a key foundation of the electronic health record system, was also the subject of a review in 2013. This review found that some adjustments are required to improve its operation to better support access to and sharing of information in the electronic health record system.


This Bill implements the recommendations from both of these reviews which are aimed at facilitating increased participation in the system and improvements in the usability and clinical content available in the system for individuals and their healthcare providers.


Firstly, the Personally Controlled Electronic Health Record will be renamed My Health Record – which is a simpler, more meaningful and clearer name for individuals to relate to. 


The system is currently an opt-in system – where you have to actively apply to have your electronic health record created, and as it stands only around one-in-ten Australians have an electronic health record set up. The review concluded that this is not a large enough population to make it an effective national system, nor is it worth the time for doctors to use it


Healthcare providers have overwhelmingly indicated through the review process that, if the majority of their patients have a My Health Record, they would be much more willing to use it. This means more doctors would add their patients' health information to it, and this will improve the overall value of the system for both patients and the healthcare providers who care for them.


To increase uptake by individuals, the Government will be conducting trials of different participation arrangements in 2016 to identify the optimal approaches for maximising participation in the system. This will include trials of opt-out participation arrangements.


Individuals in opt-out trials will automatically have a My Health Record created for them unless they opt-out, which they will be able to do in a number of ways. Extensive communication will be undertaken in the trials before trials begin to allow individuals to make an informed decision about whether or not to opt-out. The process and criteria for selecting locations to conduct the trials will be made publicly available before the trial sites are selected, and this Bill provides that I, as the responsible Minister, in consultation with the states and territories, will be able to make Rules under the Act to apply opt-out participation arrangements to a particular geographic area allowing these trials to occur.


Importantly, Individuals will continue to be able to control access to their My Health Record through a range of existing access control settings in the system. This includes the ability to instruct healthcare providers not to upload certain information into their health record.


Outside the opt-out trials, the My Health Record system will continue to operate on an opt-in basis.


If the trials provide evidence that an opt-out system is a better approach for improving participation in the My Health Record system, the Bill provides the ability for the Government to extend opt-out arrangements nationally, in consultation with states and territories. 


Given the nature of information that may be contained in a My Health Record, the Bill will increase the range of enforcement and penalty options available if someone intentionally or deliberately misuses the information or commits an act that may compromise the security or integrity of the system. This is an important protection for consumers who have their health information contained within their health record. Criminal penalties will now be available, in addition to the existing civil penalties and other sanctions, such as enforceable undertakings and injunctions. However, neither civil nor criminal penalties are triggered if someone simply makes a mistake.


Additionally, the enforcement and penalty options available for the Healthcare Identifiers Service will be aligned with those for the My Health Record system. 


The bill also provides for a number of consequential amendments and additional clarifications. The scope of what is considered to be a health service and health information has long been subject to some ambiguity, and in 2008 the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended changes to the Commonwealth Privacy Act to remove uncertainty.


This Bill implements those recommendations, amending the Privacy Act to make it clear that a health-related disability, palliative care or aged care service is considered to be a health service, and information about an illness or injury, and medical information about a genetic relative, is considered to be health information.


These clarifications reflect current practice in the health sector and will facilitate integration of health information and health-related services to support improved continuity of care for patients.


The Bill will make way for forthcoming changes to the governance of digital health in Australia.


The Australian Commission for eHealth will be established in coming months to oversee the operation and evolution of national ehealth systems. Among other things this Commission will become the system operator of the My Health Record. This Commission is intended to remove the complexities associated with the current governance arrangements, strengthen accountability, and improve transparency and stakeholder involvement, and was another key recommendation of the PCEHR review.


An implementation taskforce is currently being established to design, establish and transition to the new governance arrangements. The taskforce will oversee the transition of functions from the Department of Health and the National E-Health Transition Authority to the new organisation. The National E-Health Transition Authority will be disbanded.


The Department of Health will continue to be responsible for the policy underlying national digital health programs, and for the supporting legislation. 


In line with Government's Cutting Red Tape strategy, the Bill will reduce burden by making amendments that will mean healthcare organisations will no longer need to enter into a participation agreement with the System Operator. Entering into these agreements can be complex, and time consuming for organisations, and it is simply another barrier, and more paperwork that needs to be completed before organisations can participate in the My Health Record system.


We just don't know what kinds of new and innovative digital health services are just around the corner. The way in which services are provided, and who provides them may become important to the efficient delivery of healthcare. If we don't anticipate innovation, our current processes and protections may prohibit new services and the providers of these services from becoming part of the My Health Record system.


Having said that – it's equally important that we continue to protect the integrity of the My Health Record system and the Healthcare Identifiers Service and exercising effective controls over who is able to become a service provider in the digital health system.


For these reasons, the Bill will establish a mechanism that will allow the Government to make regulations to authorise new entities to handle healthcare identifiers and other protected information. This power will be limited to circumstances that relate directly to providing or facilitating healthcare or assisting individuals who require support for health reasons. 


As part of measures to simplify and streamline the My Health Record system, the Bill will establish new copyright arrangements. At present, healthcare organisations participating in the My Health Record system, and the System Operator, rely on copyright licenses to use information in the system without infringing anyone's copyright.


In place of licenses, the Bill will establish new copyright exceptions in the Copyright Act. These will ensure that upload, download and use of works in the My Health Record system does not infringe copyright.


The Bill will make a range of other amendments intended to clarify and improve the My Health Record system and Healthcare Identifiers Service.


The My Health Record system has the potential to change the nature of healthcare in Australia and become a widely accepted everyday part of good healthcare management. This improvements we are making gets us closer to reaching that goal.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (16:30):  At the request of Senator Moore, I move:


That the Senate notes the 20 per cent fall in public sector infrastructure spending under the Coalition Federal Government, and the Turnbull Government's need to catch-up on 2 lost years of support for public transport projects.


I rise to speak in support of this motion. The 20 per cent fall in public sector infrastructure spending that has occurred over the last two years and the complete absence of support for public transport projects will be the legacy of the former and self-appointed 'infrastructure Prime Minister', Mr Abbott.


It is now incumbent upon Mr Turnbull to take action to address his government's appalling track record on infrastructure investment. Instead of travelling across the country re-announcing and opening projects funded under the previous Labor government, it is time for Mr Truss and the coalition government to start to make a real investment in the public sector infrastructure that is critical to the future of our cities and regions. Instead of treating public transport as a selfie opportunity, it is time that Mr Turnbull and his government recognised public transport investment for the transformative opportunity it provides.


We on this side are determined to stop the old fights about roads versus public transport. Unlike those opposite, we are equally committed to both forms of transport. Critical infrastructure projects have been neglected for the last two years, with billions of dollars of government investment stripped away. These cuts to investment have come at a significant cost to our nation. Infrastructure investment is not simply about building roads, railways and ports; infrastructure investment is about building our nation, about boosting productivity and about generating economic activity. An important part of the economic activity generated by investment in infrastructure is, of course, the creation of jobs—not simply construction and engineering jobs for those involved in major projects but also jobs for generations to come in the industries and business that become more productive because of the existence of better roads, railways and ports.


Unlike those opposite, Labor understands that investment in critical infrastructure projects is at the cornerstone of the ambitious plans we must have for the cities and regions of our nation. Labor has articulated a plan for infrastructure that would transform the way we fund investment, which would shape the liveable cities and communities of the future. This plan stems from Labor's understanding of the need for investment in all forms of infrastructure to deliver jobs and productivity across our country.


Labor's infrastructure plan is in stark contrast this Liberal government's record on infrastructure. The most recent quarterly figures, released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on 30 September  2015, have confirmed exactly what Labor has been saying. They have confirmed that infrastructure investment under the coalition government is in freefall. These latest figures show that public sector infrastructure work—that is, works funded by federal, state and local governments—fell by 20.1 per cent in the June quarter 2015 compared with the last quarter of the Labor government in 2013. These figures expose as farcical Mr Abbott's claim that he was the 'infrastructure Prime Minister'. These figures should also send a clear message to Mr Turnbull that it is time to stop talking and tweeting about infrastructure and get on with the job of actually doing something. I am even happy to give Mr Turnbull a hand by pointing him in the right direction.


The first thing that Mr Turnbull should do is reverse the coalition government's cuts to critical infrastructure projects from around the country. He should start by immediately restoring the $4.5 billion cut from public transport projects—projects like the Melbourne Metro, Brisbane's Cross River Rail Link, Adelaide's Gawler line electrification and the $500 million that had been allocated by the former Labor government for heavy and light rail projects in Perth. All these projects were funded in Labor's 2013 federal budget.


When Labor left office, Infrastructure Australia had completed positive assessments of the Melbourne Metro and Cross River Rail projects and they were ready to get moving. I will just repeat that: when we left government, Infrastructure Australia had completed positive assessments of both those projects—the Melbourne Metro and the Cross River Rail projects—and they were ready. On being elected in September 2013, the Abbott government cancelled these projects.


We on this side know that the only reason these projects were cancelled was that Mr Abbott is ideologically opposed to federal funding for public transport projects. For two years federal funding of public transport ground to a halt. However, now Mr Turnbull has an opportunity to reverse these cuts and to show that there is actually some difference between him and Mr Abbott, the former Prime Minister. This is the opportunity for Mr Turnbull to show that there is a difference between him and Mr Abbott. It is an opportunity to show that changing the leader of the Liberal Party might actually change something.


We cannot help but know of Mr Turnbull's purported love of public transport, but it is time that Mr Turnbull put his money where his tweets are and invested in the public transport that is so critical to the future of our cities. We have long known that this type of public sector investment in infrastructure will be critical for our economy going forward, and yet those opposite have failed to take action—instead, moving us backwards.


Particularly in the last year, it has become blatantly clear that Australia needs to increase government investment in roads, railways and ports to drive economic activity, create jobs and lift economic productivity. This government investment is necessary as a result of the decline in construction activity in the resources sector as it moves from the construction to the production stage of its cycle. Good infrastructure will deliver tens of thousands of jobs. It will make life safer and communities more livable. It will connect our regions to our cities. This infrastructure investment is critical both to driving the national economy and to easing the traffic congestion that acts as a handbrake on productivity growth and reduces quality of life for millions of Australians.


We know that carefully planned and targeted investment in public transport and better roads in our nation's cities will ease congestion and assist those Australians living in drive-in, drive-out suburbs in outer metropolitan areas. And we know that investment in our critical road and rail projects will connect our regions and get our regional economies moving.


Apparently, however, these facts are something that those opposite do not know. Despite the grand and outlandish claims made by the then Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, and by Mr Truss, those opposite have failed to break ground on any infrastructure projects, excepting those that were funded by the previous Labor government.


Labor understands that infrastructure funding is an investment, not a cost. That is why Labor has announced an innovative approach to funding more infrastructure. This approach will include funding public transport projects in our major cities. A Shorten Labor government will transform the way infrastructure is funded in Australia, strengthening Infrastructure Australia to unlock tens of billions of dollars in capital investment for key projects in every state and creating tens of thousands of jobs.


Labor will elevate Infrastructure Australia to an active participant in the infrastructure market. This plan will mobilise private sector finance, Australia's superannuation industry and international investors to bring a national pipeline of investment online. Labor established Infrastructure Australia as an independent adviser on nation-building infrastructure, and we now propose to empower it to create more jobs, boost our productivity and improve our competitiveness.


Infrastructure Australia will be backed by a $10 billion financing facility that will give Infrastructure Australia the ability, as required, to deploy a combination of guarantees, loans or equity to jumpstart new projects. Labor will establish this facility through the proven process that established the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. Labor's plan will leverage $10 billion of government-backed financing into tens of billions of dollars of private sector investment. Using a conservative analysis prepared by Public Infrastructure Partners Australia, which assumes no additional leverage, this $10 billion infrastructure investment will directly create approximately 26,000 jobs. In addition to this job creation of approximately 26,000 jobs, the analysis estimates that the infrastructure investment will add around $7.5 billion extra to our GDP every year.


Under Labor's infrastructure plan, an expert panel would also be appointed to determine a financing mandate and advise on the appropriate structure for the new facility. Labor has committed to establishing this expert panel within six months of coming to government. This will ensure that Infrastructure Australia operates to facilitate private sector investment with the strictest financial discipline, commercial rigour, credit-risk-assessment capacities and a commitment to nation building.


Unlike those opposite, who have attacked and ignored Infrastructure Australia—and I would have to say that this is contrary to the commitments that were given by the former Prime Minister—Labor believes that this organisation can play a critical role in driving major infrastructure investment.


As part of the announcement of Labor's infrastructure plan, an initial short list of 10 projects that Labor supports was identified. The initial list of projects that Labor will support includes the airport rail to Badgerys Creek, connecting the western and south lines; the Melbourne Metro; the Cross River Rail project in Brisbane; the G:link light rail on the Gold Coast; planning work on the Ipswich Motorway, Darra to Rocklea; Tasmania's Midland Highway; Perth public transport; the Gawler line electrification in Adelaide; and the Pacific and Bruce Highway packages—projects that have been underway for several years but need to be fast-tracked to completion.


These are projects that Infrastructure Australia have either assessed or projects that Labor will work with state governments to fast-track assessments for. These are critical projects for our nation, projects which have faced cuts and delays under the coalition government. This list of projects is our priority list, and it is just the start. Beyond these immediate priorities announced by Labor, Labor have also committed to working with state governments to encourage the development of an ongoing infrastructure project pipeline. Labor will develop a long-term pipeline for projects and ensure the steady movement of projects through the assessment, development and financing phases. By establishing an independent, funded project broker, Labor will provide new and greater certainty to investors as well as creating a powerful incentive for state governments to propose and approve projects. Infrastructure Australia will be at the centre of capital investment, driving results that are in the national interest. Labor's plan proposes an exciting breakthrough in the way in which we fund infrastructure in Australia.


I am particularly elated that the Midland Highway in my home state of Tasmania is included in the list of priority projects, as I am sure you would be that the South Australian project is included, Mr Acting Deputy President Gallacher. The Midland Highway is a 176-kilometre road which connects Hobart and Launceston. Labor's commitment to restoring the full $500 million to the upgrade of the Midland Highway will have significant benefits to the many towns and communities along the highway and those who travel across the state. This is exactly the type of critical infrastructure our nation must be investing in. This infrastructure will improve the quality of life for Tasmanians and will improve the opportunity for businesses to conduct their activities more efficiently and generate much-needed jobs.


In government, Labor committed $500 million to the Midland Highway updates and signed a partnership agreement with every council in the Midlands to progressively upgrade the highway. The Tasmanian Liberal senators, and the three amigos—Mr Whiteley, Mr Nikolic and Mr Hutchinson—in the other place have made much of their investment in the upgrade of the Midland Highway; however, you will never hear them admit that they cut funding from the upgrade. The Liberals announced a $400 million funding commitment, promising to duplicate the entire 176-kilometre highway, which of course they then had to scale back, finally admitting that $400 million was nowhere near enough for a duplication of the highway. So they finally scaled back that commitment to a series of safety upgrades and, in doing so, with their commitment of $400 million, tried to slide away from the fact that there was a commitment there already for $500 million. So they cut $100 million from the project—$100 million that Labor will now restore. You do not hear Mr Whiteley, Mr Nikolic, Mr Hutchinson or the Tasmanian Liberal senators here talk about the fact that they cut $100 million or that they walked away from their promise to duplicate the entire 176-kilometre highway. No, you will not hear that here and you will not hear it in the other house from the Tasmanian Liberal representatives.


This funding is for much-needed safety work for the Midlands. Those opposite, as I have said, cut it, with no-one from the Liberal Party in the House of Representatives or the Senate putting up any fight to keep that $100 million for the project. The fact that they cut $100 million from the project to improve safety for Tasmanian motorists and their families is something they seem to miss out when they grandstand about their investment on the Midland Highway. There is a lot of grandstanding but also a lot of very convenient memory lapses when it comes down to what they have done. 


The Labor Party absolutely condemn what the federal government have done in their funding of public transport and the fact that 20 per cent of investment in public transport has— (Time expired)

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2015-10-15,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:51):  I would like to canvass three things in my brief contribution to the debate on this motion about public sector infrastructure spending—and this is an important discussion about infrastructure in our nation. I would like to revisit the quote that Mark Twain attributed to Benjamin Disraeli about 'lies, damned lies and statistics', just to correct the record on a few things that the honourable senator opposite said in her contribution. I would like to talk about some of the facts about funding and particularly touch on a few projects in South Australia, my home state. She is correct: Mr Albanese did come out, draw on the June 2013 quarter figures and compare those to show a 20.1 per cent decrease. But that was very selective, because if you actually look at the overall funding—particularly if you compare the September quarter, the last quarter of the Labor government, with the latest quarter results for this government—there is actually a 4.7 per cent increase in transport infrastructure work done for the public sector and a 14½ per cent increase in roads, highways and bridges done for the public sector. Almost anyone with enough diligence can cherry-pick two specific periods, compare them and say, like Chicken Little, 'The sky's falling in; funding has decreased,' but you need to look at the overall allocation of funding and particularly at the trends of those last quarters, rather than specific quarters plucked to highlight that difference. Prime Minister Disraeli was correct indeed when he said that there are lies, damned lies and statistics. Statistics can be manipulated, and I think it is to the shame of members on that side of the chamber that they would resort to misleading the Australian public by that approach.


In fact, according to the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics, if you look at what the coalition government has done, it has had an 18.6 per cent increase, to $27.4 billion, in engineering construction work compared to the previous quarter; a 6.9 per cent increase, to $6.1 billion, in transport infrastructure work done; and a 12.4 per cent increase, to $6.6 billion, for engineering construction work done for the public sector. So, across a range of sectors over time, we see that there is actually an increase. That is why the coalition government can rightly say we are investing a record $50 billion to get vital infrastructure projects underway across the country.


You can look all around this country, and in different states, particularly where there are projects of national significance, you see the federal government not only contributing money but looking to encourage the states to find innovative ways to raise the capital to invest in their own productive capacity so that the states and the states' economies can grow. In my own state of South Australia, some $2.9 billion has been allocated by this government to infrastructure projects. The North-South Corridor is one that is well known, and just recently the Northern Connector was announced in South Australia.


As well as those major projects, it is important to realise that there is additional funding on top of the normal allocation: some $200 million for the Black Spot Program. In South Australia that is a particularly important program because the state government is not providing the funding that is required for our country roads. Accidents on country roads account for 70 per cent of the fatalities in South Australia. If you look at fatalities per 100,000 for the east coast states, the figure is 4.2 in Victoria, 4.5 in New South Wales and 4.8 in Queensland. It is 6.4 in South Australia. So, if South Australia even just funded its roads to bring us back to the national average, that is 30 lives that we would save and 250-odd serious injuries that we would prevent every year. So that federal government money to top up and encourage the rectification of some of those black spots is really important. There is some $350 million for the Roads to Recovery program and $230 million for the National Highway Upgrade program for safety and productivity improvements.


In addition to that, in June this year the Australian government announced that councils across Australia will receive an extra $1.1 billion over the next two years under the Roads to Recovery program, and that follows the reintroduction of the consumer price index linkage for fuel excise. It is important there to realise that there is a funding source that the government has created specifically to address infrastructure, as opposed to just increasing borrowings, which ultimately the taxpayer has to pay for, plus the interest.


So this is a government that is serious about making contributions to infrastructure, but we are also serious about getting the funding right. We should never forget that much of what Labor promised when it was in government and what it called funding commitments actually lay outside the forward estimates. If it is outside the forward estimates then it is not real money. It is not actually included in any of the calculations for the budget, in terms of whether we are going to be in surplus or not or whether we are contributing to a future deficit. Much of the promise relied on a mining tax—a mining tax that did not raise revenue and in fact cost the nation money. So, when you see promises from the other side, the public must also look at whether they are actually funded, because we have seen a lot of promises and a lot of disappointment, compared to this side, which has actually funded projects and started projects and has put in place appropriate mechanisms to make sure that that funding is available.


There are things like the $5 billion financing facility for infrastructure projects in northern Australia; concessional loan arrangements for WestConnex; grants for projects that will not have a direct financial return for an investor; plans for trialling new road pricing arrangements on things like the Northern Connector in South Australia or the Perth Freight Link; and, importantly—and this is something we have been encouraging state governments to get on board with—the Asset Recycling Initiative, which provides grants to states and territories that make further investment in infrastructure with funding they receive from asset sales. So this is a government that is serious about finding the funding so that we can not just promise but actually start delivering.


There has also been a lot of comment by members opposite that this government is opposed to rail projects, which is clearly not correct. Just recently we saw the announcement of the commitment to capped funding of $95 million to stage 2 of the Gold Coast Light Rail. The reason for that is its significance to the success of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. As I look to rail projects in my home state of South Australia, the electrification of the Adelaide-Gawler railway line has been raised a number of times, the implication being that that project has stopped because of this government. History is really important. If we do not understand history and the sequence of time frames and decisions then we will be misled. I would like to remind members of the Senate and the public who may be listening to the debate about some of the time frames. The Gawler modernisation project was announced in 2009 with a federal Labor government commitment of $293 million, which included the full electrification and resleepering of the line. The overall project started to blow out and the South Australian government threw an extra $100.2 million into it in their 2011-2012 budget. But in June 2012 works were ceased by the South Australian government. Who was in government at the time? Not the coalition. Works were ceased due to a lack of funding by the South Australian government in June 2012. 


Since this government has come to power, we have made massive investments in infrastructure projects—$2.9 billion in South Australia. We have invested in rail, as on the Gold Coast. If the South Australian government wants to come back to the federal government and make a case to show why that project is a priority for them and why it is of national significance and we should be supporting it, I will be very happy to work with them. But senators opposite should not be trying to mislead the Australian public into thinking that that project stopped because of this government. It stopped in June 2012.


Former Prime Minister Abbott declared that he wanted to be the infrastructure Prime Minister. When you look at the facts, history shows that record investment has been made, and not just record investment but sound management to make sure that the funding is available so that these projects are not just promised in the out years where there is no real commitment but are actually funded and work is starting. We have seen that in our home state of South Australia, where the North-South Corridor and the Northern Connector are either working, soon to commence or, for the Northern Connector, will start next year.


This motion touches on an important topic, but I think it is important that people listening understand the facts. The facts are that this government has made record contributions on infrastructure and the amount of contributions are increasing.

",Senate,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Infrastructure</title>,MOTIONS,26,1
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2015-10-15,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (17:02):  I rise to speak on the 20 per cent fall in public sector infrastructure spending under this coalition government and the Turnbull government's need to catch up on two lost years of support for public transport projects. What a frustrating two years it has been for commuters in this country. It does not matter whether you are in our cities, our suburbs or our regions—if you have tried to catch public transport, the chances are that you have been let down by unreliable, slow and packed services. We need to make up for lost time by focusing on the transport projects that are able to efficiently shift large numbers of people. Let us get one thing straight: this does not mean more roads, which seems to be the fallback solution for the vast majority of transport challenges under this government. Relying on cars in big cities has two big problems. They take up lots of space and this space, both roads and parking spaces, costs a lot to provide. The roads that are able to shift the most people are freeways and motorways. They are also the most expensive options, particularly if they involve tunnels. For retrofitting across our cities this is what they generally need to do to avoid having to compulsorily acquire and pay for people's houses or to avoid destroying precious natural spaces that are vital to keeping our cities liveable.


When you look at comparisons, the costs of a three-lane freeway and a new two-track rail line with stations are quite similar. It is about $1 billion per kilometre for underground tunnelling and between $50 million and $150 million per kilometre for above ground freeways and rail tracks. But the number of people they can carry is vastly different. The maximum number of cars that a three-lane freeway can carry in an hour, if it is operating super efficiently, is about 5½ thousand. Given that cars in Australia carry, on average, only 1.1 people per vehicle, that means that the maximum number of people that a super efficient freeway can carry is about 6,000 people per hour. Compare that to an efficient train line, which can carry over 1,000 people in a train running every two minutes. That is 30,000 people per hour—five times as many as a three-lane freeway, for around the same cost. That train line takes up less space and the people travelling by train do not require as many parking spaces in highly valuable real estate in the centre of cities, where it cost upwards of $20,000 to build a single parking space.


This is at the heart of why public transport projects have higher benefit-cost ratios than comparable motorway projects. They are a more efficient way of carrying people. It is not just high-capacity trains where these efficiencies exist. Allocating a road lane to fast, frequent and reliable bus services is a much more efficient and effective way of shifting people on a busy road than adding an extra lane for cars. Where you have too many people to be efficiently carried by bus but not enough to justify heavy rail, that is where light rail really comes into its own, particularly because of how light rail can integrate into and enhance city life. Then we have the most efficient transport of all, which costs the least to provide per kilometre and where each person takes up the least space, and that is pathways for walking and cycling—footpaths, bike lanes on roads, shared paths and separate bike paths. You get at least 1,000 kilometres of bike path for the same cost as a single kilometre of tollway tunnel.


If we prioritise public transport, walking and cycling, we can create a fairer Australia. Not every job seeker or pensioner can afford to run a car. A lack of viable options means that it is difficult to get to a job interview or to be able to regularly visit friends and family. Many families do not have the luxury of a second car. If you live in the outer suburbs, one parent can be left stranded at home all day with no buses or trains to connect them. Creating viable options for people without cars makes the life of these Australians easier and more fulfilling.


Transport planners know this stuff. They look at transport patterns objectively and know the benefits of investing in public transport. They know that transport is a system of systems; to make these systems work well together in our growing cities, the most effective thing to do is to shift people out of their cars wherever possible and onto public transport, walking and cycling; and, by doing this, you will free up space on our roads for the traffic that needs to be there: freight vehicles, emergency vehicles, cars needed by people because of a disability and cars for journeys that are difficult to do efficiently on public transport, whether it is a family visiting Aunty Jenny with the kids or a tradie travelling across town for a job. Roads do have their uses. They are essential. It is just that, if we can shift enough journeys onto public transport, walking and cycling, we will find we already have plenty of roads. Other than in new suburbs and towns, we genuinely do not need any more.


Transport planners know that, if you provide public transport which is fast, frequent, reliable, affordable and safe, people will use it. They know that, if you provide safe cycling facilities, people will use them; the biggest thing that puts people off cycling is not feeling safe; and the majority of journeys undertaken in Australia are of under five kilometres—very easily ridden by bike, even in the outer suburbs and in regional areas. 


Health experts know the benefits of encouraging people to walk and ride—the huge benefits and contributions that these make to tackling the obesity and diabetes epidemics we are in the midst of, to reducing heart disease and to people's mental health. Those of us concerned about pollution in our cities and the carbon pollution which causes climate change know the benefits of getting people out of their fossil fuel powered cars and onto bikes and public transport powered by renewable energy. These are the benefits that this government is currently refusing to acknowledge, but something's got to give. 


Under this government, we have heard a lot of talk about infrastructure. First we had the self-declared 'infrastructure Prime Minister', Tony Abbott, but we quickly learnt that 'infrastructure' meant nothing but tollways that were massively polluting, pushing the imbalance further in the direction of roads and doing very little to improve the lives of commuters. Even though Mr Abbott was partial to a bit of lycra, again and again the government rejected calls to fund anything that would encourage people to get on their bikes. This blinkered approach has cost us dearly. 


Now we have selfie-loving Prime Minister Turnbull, who uses every opportunity he can to try and prove that he is one of the people by taking pictures on trains, trams and buses. But then we see announcements like we saw from the Minister for the Environment earlier this week. Although it included the Melbourne Metro Rail Project, their pie-in-the-sky wish list fell back on the old 'roads, roads and more roads' agenda, including a renewed commitment to building the East West toll road, a project that would return just 45c for every dollar spent. The former Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, described last year's Victorian state election as a referendum on the East West Link, and the result was resounding. Victorians rejected the project and the ideology it stood for, sending a message to us in this place that we need the kind of congestion-busting infrastructure that you can only get by giving people viable alternatives to driving. 


The government's insistence on the East West toll road deliberately ignores the will of Victorians, and it is shameful that the current Prime Minister has continued Tony Abbott's desires. In a recent poll by Essential Research, 64 per cent of Victorians agreed that it was more important to expand public transport than to build new roads and freeways. In today's Age, Josh Gordon writes:


… the apparent attempt by Hunt to once again politicise the debate about infrastructure in a way that seems reminiscent of the Abbott era. 


Gordon points out:


It is a backward step from Turnbull's encouraging promise to consider projects on their merit.


We have to move away from this current path. 


Under the Abbott-Turnbull government, despite all their talk, public investment in infrastructure has fallen. At the same time, private investment has fallen sharply as the mining boom tapers off. We must do all we can to lift this spending, and it must be targeted to the projects that are value for money and do not simply end up increasing congestion. This means getting away from the idea that you can simply build more roads in order to ease congestion. That just encourages more people to drive. It is like putting a bucket under a dripping tap: it is not going to fix the leak and eventually the bucket will be filled to the brim. What we have to do is fix the leak. Building more fast, frequent, reliable, affordable and safe public transport options will get more cars off the roads, freeing them up for those who need them the most. If we provide safe and accessible facilities for people to ride their bikes, more people will cycle, but first we have to make a serious investment in this vital infrastructure. 


Despite the rhetoric from the government, the reality is that Australia has low debt levels and has the capacity to borrow. Economist Saul Eslake recently told a Senate committee that Australia could borrow $50 billion without affecting our triple-A credit rating. I say: let's get to it. The private sector has funds available, too, but the government either is not ready to attract them or cannot package it up and de-risk.


If we get this right, we can shape our transport systems to meet the demands of the 21st century. The old-style thinking we have come to expect from this government is completely unsustainable. The rest of the world is realising the limitations of economies based on the finite resources of coal, gas and oil. A confident Australia would look beyond the old way of thinking, it would move away from bandaid fixes like road projects that end up becoming rats' nests and it would look at doing things that work for people rather than for the big corporations that are so often pushing their own interests. This means game-changing projects like the Melbourne Metro Rail Project, but it also means a willingness to focus on the smaller projects that might not get a big space in the papers but are value for money and greatly enhance the efficiency of our communities. These projects include bus lanes and services, signalling upgrades, off-road bike paths and duplicating arterial roads in growth suburbs, where roads that were once country lanes are now carrying thousands of cars every day.


But let us not be under any illusion that simply voting the coalition out will change anything. Labor talk big on public transport, but in practice we are not currently seeing a commitment to prioritising public transport. Under the Victorian Labor government, road solutions keep rising to the surface—the widening of the Tullamarine Freeway instead of airport rail; the Western Distributor instead of the port rail shuttle. In Sydney, the Liberal government are ploughing ahead with the WestConnex motorway. But, despite the secrecy and despite all the problems identified by Infrastructure Australia, Labor plan to go ahead with their own version of the WestConnex project. Yes, Labor support spending billions on WestConnex, when the huge gap—the area most crying out for funding and the No. 1 priority—is in public transport. Every dollar that is spent on a new motorway is a dollar not being spent on the public transport that will really make a difference to congestion. 


Under both major parties, the roads always seem to come first and the public transport gets delivered decades after it is needed—if ever. Roads are easy to build and cut ribbons for. Public transport requires long-range foresight. It requires commitment and priority. This is the vision that the Greens are committed to. We have already suffered two years of this anti public transport agenda. We can put this behind us, but we must not hesitate to make up for lost time. Let us not forget the people we represent in this place. Commuters around the country are waiting—they are waiting for their bus in the morning, they are waiting for their loved ones to come home, and they are waiting for our transport system to be fixed once and for all. I call upon this government and I call upon all parties to work with the community for change so that we can finally achieve what we have all been waiting for.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2015-10-15,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (17:16):  I rise with considerable joy to speak on this motion. If my father were here, God rest him, he would be delighted that I am talking about infrastructure, because photos of my family life are very much punctuated by images of the sort of machinery that builds roads and developed this country. I love roads. I love infrastructure. I love the Harbour Bridge and what it says about a great nation's infrastructure vision. I am very proud to say that my brothers continue in the tradition of working in the construction sector. They are still building great roads right across the state of New South Wales and employing a lot of people, including themselves, in the construction industry. 


I want to comment on a couple of comments that have preceded my contribution today. The first was a comment by Senator Fawcett. He said, 'just recently,' talking about a shift in the attitude of those opposite towards public transport. There has been a change at the leadership level, and I suppose it may get rid of Tony Abbott's backward view about everything public. He tried to get rid of public education by cutting the Gonski money and $30 billion out of education. He also decided that he did not like public transport, so any investment in public transport was simply something that the government refused to have anything to do with. That leads me to comments in the closing section of Senator Rice's contribution this afternoon. I am sure that, on reflection, she that probably did not mean this, but she said that roads are easy to build. I spent one summer as I finished school doing sort of quantity management support on the construction of a road in the Campbelltown region. I can tell you for a fact and from firsthand experience that building roads is anything but easy. It takes an incredible amount of careful planning. It is a significant investment that is of great value to this country. 


I take the opportunity this afternoon to acknowledge all of those men and women who are working in the construction industry, building the infrastructure of this nation and improving our lot. I am sure that when they take their children for drives on a Sunday or when they are heading off on holidays, they will do exactly what my Irish father did when he drove us up what is now called the F3 but was, at that point in time, the Pacific Highway—marvel at the engineering, marvel at the imagination and marvel of the hard work that created those pathways. He revealed to all of us, as we drove along, the beauty of the great sandstone that is so remarked upon by visitors who take that exit out of Sydney and come to the Central Coast. I acknowledge all the workers. I acknowledge the hard work that goes into infrastructure.


I want to put on the record today, sadly, not any great championing by this government of a vision for the future but rather that this government has a miserly view of what is possible. That is why the debate that we are having this afternoon is so important. There was a 20 per cent fall in public sector infrastructure spending under the coalition federal government. The Turnbull government needs to catch up on two lost years of support for public transport projects. We have quarterly figures released on 30 September by none other than the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The figures tell the truth that this government will to try run from. The truth is that investment in infrastructure is in free fall under this government. We know that engineering work and infrastructure work being completed for the public sector was 20.1 per cent lower in the June quarter of 2015 compared to the last quarter of the Labor government in the 2013. That is because Labor was absolutely in the business of building, had a vision for the nation, and made sure that projects that for so long had been pushed to the backburners were advanced and delivered with the money and the capacity to move forward. 


I want to go to one of those particular projects that are of great importance to the people of New South Wales. I have already mentioned early work on Pacific Highway, which snakes its way north of Sydney. We know that that road's continued development has been a critical part of enabling the advancement of all of those communities up and down the coast and also of improving the capacity of this country to move product around and increase our productivity 


We know that, under the Abbott government, the Pacific Highway saw a really significant decline in investment. In Labor's last year in office, $1 billion was invested as part of a $7.6 billion commitment. But in this government's budget, they committed to spend just $672 million for the 2015-16 financial year. There is a big difference there of $400 million. It is a big difference in terms of a commitment to keeping the project of the Pacific Highway underway. 


I would like to go through a number of projects in New South Wales that have been subject to the 'Oh, just in case you weren't watching, let's see if we can get away with it' strategy of this government where they pretend that they are funding projects, that they are delivering projects and that they had a vision for projects. This is an absolutely false pretence. In New South Wales, we have the Pacific Highway where $7.9 billion was invested by the Labor government: the Tintenbar to Ewingsdale development and the Devil's Pulpit upgrade. That was a pretty good one. That was going. Things were going along well. It was already announced. But that was not good enough for this government. They re-announced that in a pretence that it was their announcement on 21 March 2014. They must have enjoyed the experience because they have continued the trend. They have continued the deception that they actually had a vision of any kind. 


Woolgoolga to Ballina was re-announced on 17 September. They really like this bit of road because they also re-announced it on 22 September and then went back for a fourth bite at the cherry on 28 April in 2015. While traveling up and down the Pacific Highway, making themselves seen in the local newspapers, no doubt, they re-announced the Sapphire to Woolgoolga upgrade. On a roll, the next one they announced was the Nambucca Heads to Urunga upgrade. It was re-announced on 26 March this year. The Warrell Creek to Nambucca Heads upgrade re-announcement was on 1 April 2014. The Frederickton to Eungai upgrade was re-announced as well. The Kundabung to Kempsey upgrade was re-announced on 26 March. And the Oxley Highway to Kundabung upgrade was re-announced on 8 January 2014. 


That is only halfway down the list of the disgraceful practice of this government of pretending that this is their vision for the country. I tell you whose vision it is. It was Labor's vision to invest in infrastructure that delivered this money. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Don't make me laugh! 




Senator O'NEILL:
  The senator on the other side there may well laugh. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Edwards
):  Order! Senator O'Neill, address your comments through the chair, please. It is disorderly to interject. 




Senator O'NEILL:
  Senator Macdonald is laughing over there. I think it is a way to try and cover his personal embarrassment. Here we are at a point in time in our economic cycle when all of the experts are saying that this is a golden opportunity. There has never been a better opportunity in my lifetime to secure government bonds to invest in infrastructure than right at this moment—a moment when mining and the production phase is kicking in after the construction phase. We are going to a very different part of our economic journey. It is an opportunity for this government to lead and to get things going; but, instead, we see them playing some facile PR game, driving up and down the Pacific Highway, which was long ago funded by Labor to the tune of $7.9 billion, and pretending that they are actually doing anything. What I am really concerned about—



Senator Canavan interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Neill, resume your seat. Senator O'Neill.




Senator O'NEILL:
  Thank you. If I can come to the rest of these projects. The M4 to M5 extension was $1.8 billion. This one did not just get a re-announcement. This one was so important that it got a new name. This one got the real PR treatment. It got turned into WestConnex on 19 September. The F3 to M2 missing link, which is one that I really do want to pay a little bit of attention to, was $405 million. It was re-announced as if it were a new project on 15 March 2014. That piece of road matters to hundreds of thousands of people who move across the northern part of Sydney and from the Central Coast—a beautiful part of the country in which I get to reside and have lived for 30 years now. It is an amazing road that connects Sydney to the north, but the connection to the other major roads in Sydney has been a very big problem for those hundreds of thousands of people who get caught in that bottleneck. It was Labor that led with this project. It was Labor that negotiated with the state O'Farrell Liberal government to get a joint commitment and for $405 million to be committed by our federal government in that last parliament, under Julia Gillard. She announced it at Kariong, at the top of the hill as you enter into Gosford, with then Minister Albanese, to make sure that the people of the Central Coast, who have long suffered the bottleneck at the end of that freeway, have into the future a wonderful, modern piece of infrastructure that will improve the productivity of all of the businesses that use that connection but also improve the lives of all of those who work in Sydney whether by choice or by design and are seeking a good run home to get back to their families. 


The re-announcements continued with the Hunter Expressway, $1.5 billion, and opened by Warren Truss on 21 March 2014. Labor delivered it. The F5 at Campbelltown was $93 million. Greater Western Highway was $300 million and re-announced by this lot on 10 July. And so it goes on and on and on. I really wanted to labour the point somewhat—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You are.




Senator O'NEILL:
  to make it understood to the people who might not be listening to the parliament every day, Senator, that the reality is that these projects that were invested in by Labor, created by Labor—happily some of them are continuing but many of them have been reduced in funding—are a vital part of our infrastructure. 


Why does all of this matter right now? I alluded in my comments to the reality that construction activity is declining in the resource sector and there is a natural fit for jobs coming out of the resource sector to move into the infrastructure sector to do the job rather than the private mining companies to help build the vision for Australia's future. I often heard about the experience and the pride with which my father spoke about the work on the Bradfield Highway approaching the Harbour Bridge. To be part of building the nation is something that all people who have worked in construction, whether it is rail or whether it is road, find an edifying dimension to their working life.


Tony Abbott's decision to call himself the 'infrastructure Prime Minister' was an absolute joke. The only thing he really constructed, I suppose, was a great big hole for  himself. He has also left a hole in the investment infrastructure that should have been going on. That hole could be attended to by the new Prime Minister. This is a challenge. He has an opportunity to do something new to reset the course. He could immediately restore the $4.5 billion cut from public transport projects. The projects that have suffered under the Liberal government are the Melbourne Metro, Brisbane's Cross River Rail link and Adelaide's Gawler line electrification. Also, another $500 million had been allocated by the former Labor government for heavy and light rail projects in Perth. That is a practical way that they could do something new and do something that would be different from the Abbott government.


Mr Turnbull loves to tweet those photos of himself—Malcolm the rider of the Sydney train network. Let us see if he has the determination for and the general appeal of rail under his belt. It is not just about Malcolm in the pictures; it is about the hard work, the resources, the materials and the people who need to build these critical rail projects in Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. All of these projects were funded in Labor's federal budget. It was a choice by this government to remove them from our vision for the country.


The role of Infrastructure Australia in the former government in determining critical projects that were to be developed in the interests of the nation was a very significant change in the way public policy was being developed and the way in which infrastructure was planned to be delivered. As Senator Rice said, whether these projects are rail, which she acknowledged took a lot of time to plan, or road, which from my experience absolutely takes a lot of time in planning, you need to have a body that can look at the value of these projects, ensure that they are great value for the country and go ahead and make them happen. I found it amazing that Minister Albanese in the former government was the first infrastructure minister for the entire country and that historically things had been developed in such a haphazard way without that oversight. Since Mr Abbott came to power, the power of Infrastructure Australia to be an independent body that could talk about vision and ensure continuity across a range of different governments has been completely undermined. I think that is a great shame. Shame on this government, shame on Tony Abbott and his ministry, in whatever form it was, for making that decision. Again, there is an opportunity for the new-look Liberals and Mr Turnbull to do something about restoring the integrity and independence of Infrastructure Australia.


It is important to put on the record the very different view that Labor has about building for our future. Recently, Labor made a very big announcement regarding federal infrastructure and financing. That included getting moving very significant public transport projects in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth and the Gold Coast. For the great state of New South Wales, that I represent in this amazing parliament of our nation, the plan to link the west and the southern lines is a very significant decision; it is a very significant vision. People who are looking to get to work from as far away as the Central Coast and Newcastle will have a massive number of job opportunities opened up to them by that infrastructure. Labor has a vision for the west of Sydney. Labor has a vision of making it possible for workers to get to where they need to go in a reasonable amount of time rather than the current gridlock that is the life of so many people who work and live in the regions where I grew up—in Blacktown, Seven Hills, Toongabbie and the west, in Campbelltown, Camden, Narellan and all of the areas in the south-west of Sydney, and in the north on the Central Coast. This is a vision about making connections between all of those communities possible with the jobs growth that will naturally grow from that investment.


Labor will elevate Infrastructure Australia to be an active participant in the infrastructure market. We will mobilise private sector finance. We have determined that a transformation of the way in which infrastructure in Australia is funded is required. Infrastructure Australia has the potential under a Labor government to unlock tens of billions of dollars in capital investment for critical projects that every single state needs and, by doing so, create tens of thousands of jobs. That money will surface into the private market from what Labor built. 


Another amazing piece of infrastructure of a different kind is the superannuation savings of this nation—an infrastructure for a dignified retirement for all Australians. With that $1.8 trillion that we have that is going to continue to grow, there is an opportunity for Australians, investing in themselves and their future, to have their superannuation funds invest in building infrastructure on the ground in this nation—rail, roads and ports. We can do that. We can do that because Labor had a vision and Labor delivered that vision. All the way those opposite resisted and said it would be impossible. They said businesses would fail across the country. They said the whole show would fall over. They said superannuation would never work. But here we are 30 years down the track with an entire capacity to build this nation on the back of Australia's savings by investing in ourselves and investing in our future.


There is a massive contrast between this government and Labor's capacity to see a vision for the future, to pull Australians together and to deliver a vision for the future that is rich, enabling and shared—advantaging all Australians. Labor absolutely is responsible for establishing of Infrastructure Australia. We need this nation-building body to make sure that we can get on with the job across periods of government—sadly, when the Liberals might be in charge. Without that independence, the future of this country is at risk from those who will just take the money and prop things up in certain spots where they want or, perhaps, do as Abbott did and completely remove funding from public rail.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-10-15,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:37):  Where oh where do Labor Party troglodyte senators live? Clearly, blindfolded, with earplugs in, in the deepest, darkest cave in Australia in a permanent midnight if they have not heard, since the advent of the coalition government, of all the plans—not just plans, but funded plans for infrastructure in Australia. They must have been completely out of this world if they were not aware—and they would be the only Australians who were not—of the massive funding and vision for infrastructure in our country.


Before Senator O'Neill leaves I want her to tell me, 'Where is this Parramatta-Epping railway line that the Labor Party's then state Labor Premier Kristina Keneally and then federal Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced with a $2.6 billion fund to build?' I understand that there was no work done on it, no plans were drawn, no engineering consideration given and certainly there was no finance obtained. But the Labor Party announced $2.6 billion for the Parramatta-Epping rail connection, which, of course, was always fantasy.


Have a look at Victoria, where the coalition government actually provided the money, billions and billions of dollars, for the East West Link to the Victorian government, which was then a Liberal government, which would have built that link using principally federal money. Then the Labor Party came along and said, 'We don't want the money for that major piece of infrastructure in Victoria.' The Labor Party is all talk and no action when it comes to infrastructure spending.


Mr Acting Deputy President Edwards, I will in my time for this contribution go through some of the projects that have been funded, including, I understand, some $41 million for the electrification of the Adelaide to Gawler railway line in your home state of South Australia. All we need is the state Labor government to provide some matching funds, but to date there is no word from the state Labor government at all. You hear people, like the former speaker, saying how keen Labor are on infrastructure, but when you come to the facts, have a look at them. There is the East West Link in Victoria, the rail project that I just mentioned in Adelaide and the Parramatta-Epping railway. They are very good on the talk and very good at making announcements. On the Parramatta-Epping railway we had then Labor Premier Keneally and Labor Prime Minister Gillard on the railway platform. There was great fanfare and TV cameras everywhere when they announced the $2.6 billion, but nothing has been done, nothing from the Labor Party.


I will take you back in a little history lesson, Mr Acting Deputy President, to the really big infrastructure projects in Australia such as the Snowy Mountains Scheme and the Ord River Dam. In more recent times there is the Adelaide to Darwin railway, or the Alice Springs to Darwin railway. Who were they funded and conceived by? Liberal-National Party governments of the past. Every single, major infrastructure investment in our country, since almost the Commonwealth was created, has been done on the vision of coalition governments.


The former speaker said that the last Labor federal government had funded infrastructure in Labor budgets. We all know, of course, that Labor funded absolutely nothing in its budgets. All they funded were additional blowouts in the deficit. They did not fund a thing. They just borrowed more money from overseas, which we are still trying to pay off. They were borrowings that would have reached $700 billion if the government had not changed in 2013. That is Labor's record of funding things in the budget. You have a thought bubble, you go overseas, borrow some money and let our grandkids and great grandkids pay for it later on. It is just ludicrous and laughable. I am afraid I could not help myself from laughing during the previous senators contribution when she said that Labor funded these things in the budget. Labor funded nothing in any budget they have ever brought down.


I will become a little more recently relevant. Just three or four days ago Prime Minister Turnbull went to my state of Queensland and announced an additional $95 million for the Gold Coast Light Rail project. What a wonderful, visionary investment in Australia in that announcement. Where was Senator Moore and where was the previous speaker when those announcements were being made? Where were those Labor senators and all the rest of their troglodyte team—and I use the word 'troglodyte' advisedly—because they must have been out of this world? Where were they when the Northern Australian white paper was announced? These were not just announcements. These were announcements supported by funding in the 2015 budget.


It will take me a long time to go through the many infrastructure projects proposed by the coalition government. It would take me hours to simply go through them, but I will mention just a few. There is $100 million for a new Beef Roads Program. Those who are as old as me may remember that during the Fraser-McEwen government—or it might have been even before that—we had a wonderful Beef Roads Scheme in Australia that fell into disrepair, or unfunding, over the years. But it has been rejuvenated with this commitment of $100 million for beef roads just in northern Australia. 


In the last budget, $600 million was announced for a priority roads program in the north. At the same time, $8.5 billion was budgeted for the Bruce Highway in my own state of Queensland. I am being a bit parochial here; I am talking about only Queensland or northern Australian road projects. But $8.5 billion has been budgeted and the Labor Party say that there is nothing being spent on public infrastructure. There is the $500 million Black Spot Program, which was first initiated by the Howard government. The Labor government put it on the backburner during those horrible six years. But it has been rejuvenated again by the Abbott and Turnbull governments with a new $500 million Black Spot Program. There is also the new $200 million heavy vehicle program and the $300 million Bridges Renewal Program, and so the list goes on. 


That is not all; there is more. There is much, much more. Can I just remind Labor senators, who must have been digging that cave so they could not hear all the good news, of the announcement in the northern Australian white paper and in the last budget of a $5 billion concessional infrastructure loan scheme under the northern Australian infrastructure fund. That is not a grant scheme; it is a concessional loan scheme. It will encourage other money, not just taxpayers' money, into major infrastructure projects. I know personally of many people, institutions and companies that have already approached the government with plans to build public infrastructure if they can access some of this $5 billion concessional loans infrastructure fund. That is a clever way of getting funding into infrastructure. 


The Labor Party will promise taxpayers' money—they will never deliver, but they will promise—whereas coalition governments actually have clever business and commercial-like ways of achieving public and private investment into infrastructure, which is all good for Australia and increases our productivity and, accordingly, increases the standard of living for all Australians. The money that the coalition government has committed has been ledgered and it is not just promises. 


I live in a place called Ayr in North Queensland and my office is in Townsville, about 100 kilometres north. I drive up the Bruce Highway for a day in the office. I got annoyed over the last six months or so because everywhere I went along the Bruce Highway between Ayr and Townsville there were stop signs and road gangs. I had to detour because there was just so much work being done on the Bruce Highway. I have to give all congratulations to the Commonwealth and the Queensland government—this was mainly funded in the time of the Newman government in Queensland—for the work they have done from Vantassel Street through to the major ring-road around Townsville. I know that section of the road well because during the road construction over the past year or so I was detoured, I was stopped and I had to wait for 10 minutes at a time. 


The ring-road around Townsville was built by the Howard government. It is a massive piece of infrastructure that now completely ring-roads the growing and expanding city of Townsville. It is a marvellous piece of engineering excellence and it is all there to make it easier to get goods and services, people, cattle and livestock between one place and another, improving our productivity. It used to take me an hour and a bit to get from Ayr to Townsville, but since these new roads have been constructed—and in the places where there are not four lanes, there are now overtaking lanes every five to 10 kilometres—it has cut my driving time from Ayr to Townsville by about 10 minutes. So even in my own situation, thanks to the Howard, Newman and most recently Abbott and Turnbull governments, my productivity has increased because I am spending less time on the road getting to work. 


The same happens right around Australia. The same would have happened in Melbourne had the state Labor government accepted the Commonwealth money and built the proposed East West Link. It would have meant huge increases in productivity and gains for the people of the city of Melbourne. But what did Labor do? They rejected it. They knocked it back. They do not want to build it. Why? I suppose it is because the Greens, as always, said to them, 'Hey, brother, you are only in government because of our preferences. We don't like this, so pull that. Otherwise, we won't support you and you won't still be in government.' That is the way it worked. That is why this country has languished when Labor governments are in power. They are simply captives of the crazy people on the left of the Greens political party.  


So far I have only been talking about roads, but infrastructure involves much more than roads. That is why in the last federal budget the coalition government announced additional funding for remote airstrips. This is very important public infrastructure in more remote parts of Australia. The coalition government also announced a major infrastructure fund of $500 million— something Labor would never be able to do because of their Greens connections—to assist with water storage and water infrastructure projects. A lot of that will go to northern Australia but it will also go right around Australia. Labor have never been game to build dams or water storages anywhere, because the Greens do not like it and Labor are always only in power thanks to the preferences of the Greens. The Greens political party know how to get the best bang for their buck in second preferences.


Under the coalition government, $200 million has been put aside to assist, first of all, with feasibility studies, with business cases, with environmental studies, with preliminary engineering work on dams right across Australia. In the northern Australia white paper, a couple of dams were mentioned only as an example—the Nullinga dam behind Cairns and extensions to the Ord River dam in the Northern Territory and Western Australia—but there are many more than those two that will be looked at. That $200 million will not go far if you start building dams, but it will provide a government incentive to those investors around the world who are keen to invest in Australia in productive assets like dams, water storages, weirs and irrigation proposals that will allow us to increase our primary production to meet the burgeoning middle-class demand from Asia that is approaching us. So it is not just roads; it is dams, airstrips and things like—I have to be careful in mentioning too many others because I am privy to some other private industry desires to start construction in two months time, once they can work with the government with this concessional loan scheme to build public infrastructure that will continue to increase Australia's productivity and increase our relevance, importance and accessibility as a tourist destination for visitors from North America and Asia.


The infrastructure that will be built will be built a lot by the budgeting expertise of the coalition government but also by the clever way the coalition will attract private investment—




Senator Ludlam:
  With a slush fund, a $5 million slush fund.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  What would you expect from the Greens political party. Here we have a wonderful proposal for Australia not only to use taxpayers' money but to encourage investment in public infrastructure from around the world and the Greens call that a slush fund. They are obviously talking about Mr Graeme Wood and the biggest ever political donation given to any political party in Australia's history—that is, the $1.6 million given to the Greens political party. That is a slush fund, Senator Ludlam. It is a slush fund particularly when it comes with no demands. But, remember that, at the same time, the Greens political party were moving to get tax exemption for online newspapers. That was being proposed by whom? It was none other than Mr Graeme Wood. What a surprise! A $1.6 million donation to the Greens and, 'Hang on, we might get some tax deductibility for this online newspaper effort we are proposing.'


I have been distracted by the interjections from the Greens political party, but in the time remaining I want to emphasise that this is a government which is serious about infrastructure, not like the Labor Party. You do not get up on a railway platform and promise $2.6 billion before an election and then do absolutely nothing with it. In fact, there was never any intention to do anything with it; it was just words. This government has actually promised, announced, identified and actually funded in the last budget and in budgets to come real infrastructure improvement in Australia, and it will be supported not just by the taxpayers but by investors very keen to come into our country and build the productivity base of this nation.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2015-10-15,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:57):  In the very brief time that is available to me, I want to put some thoughts on the record about how in Western Australia we experienced the former Prime Minister's commitment to be the infrastructure Prime Minister, because with one hand he took away and with the other he gave. That was the sort of person that he was. He took away $500 million that had been committed by the previous government after a seven-year campaign not just by the Greens, although we were certainly part of it, but by local government, public transport advocates like Professor Peter Newman and people right across the Perth metropolitan area who wanted the Perth light rail project. To his credit, Premier Colin Barnett put a small but very capable project team together and that project was known as MAX and was on the rails. 


Former Prime Minister Abbott killed it stone dead at the point when he arrived and started to call himself the infrastructure Prime Minister. So as rapidly as he stood down the half billion dollars worth of rail funding for Perth, a thought bubble suddenly appeared for $925 million being committed to the Perth Freight Link, a road that nobody wants, that does not go anywhere and that is, in fact, being fought very successfully by a spirited and growing community campaign and now has the project approvals by the Western Australian EPA tied down in the Supreme Court on a number of grounds. More than 1,100 people have signed the Save Beeliar Wetlands pledge, a direct action pledge to stand in the way, in front of machinery, if necessary, if they try to bulldoze—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Stopping infrastructure.




Senator LUDLAM:
  That is correct: stopping a four-lane freeway through a wetland. It is not all bad news, despite the campaign gaining in strength. I actually think this is one area where, maybe, I am going to set my cynicism aside and suspect that perhaps the new Prime Minister does have a different view of infrastructure. The Senate inquiry into the Perth Freight Link sat last week and, to their credit, it featured Senators Back and Reynolds from the coalition—but not the Western Australian government, who could not be bothered turning up—and, along with Senator Sterle and myself, we heard evidence that the outer harbour to the southern suburbs of Perth may, in fact, be the solution we are looking for. We can get a dedicated freight solution for Perth's growing needs. I hope that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is listening to the evidence, as his senators did, so that we can actually get a genuine freight solution for Perth.



The PRESIDENT:  It being 6pm, the time for the debate has expired.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:01):  This report on recent allegations relating to conditions and circumstances at the regional processing centre in Nauru was by a select committee. It was specifically set up in this chamber with the Labor Party and the Greens political party and one or two crossbench senators, and the Labor Party and the Greens, of course, had a majority of senators.


I was not able to get to those hearings. I would have participated because I have been involved in similar hearings in estimates and in other committees that the Greens and the Labor Party keep raising, but I could not go. They were set up on days when coalition senators in the main were not available so, by and large, there were some coalition senators there for some of the hearings, but most of the hearings proceeded without the coalition senators in attendance, which meant that the usual suspects all came along and got the usual Dorothy Dixer questions from Senator Hanson-Young and from a couple of senators in the Labor Party.


The select committee produced a report. It was a report that did not really disclose anything new. It just reconfirmed that the offshore processing centres in Nauru and at Manus Island were actually processing centres set up by the Rudd Labor government. For some reason, the Labor Party set the inquiry up—suddenly they were now very keen on inquiries—to attack these processing centres that they themselves set up. From evidence given, I assume at this inquiry—as I said, I was not there—they went through the same processes, the same inquiries, the same questions as in any number of other Senate inquiries and got all the answers. The answers were from officials who were around in Mr Rudd's time.


The reason these processing centres were set up so poorly was first of all because the Rudd government dismantled what the Howard government had set up six years previously. And then right at the death, just before the election, Mr Rudd had this thought bubble that if he wanted to try and save the election he would have to do something about that tens of thousands of people illegally coming to Australia. So he eventually, after six years of being told by the coalition what he should do, decided that he would set up these detention centres. Of course it was done in such a rush that the officials charged with setting up those processing centres had no time to do them properly or to get the right processes in place, to get the right people in place. It was all done in a rush just to try and save the Labor Party's bacon before the 2013 election.


The consequences of the way those centres were set up are what you are seeing in the headlines now. They are not consequences of what is happening now; they are consequences of the way these were set up by the Labor Party with, I might say, the support of the Greens political party—not particularly on that issue and I do take that point Senator Hanson-Young always makes. It was the Greens political party that kept the Labor Party in government for long enough to do these sorts of things. They were not set up terribly well. There were problems but that was all because this was done as a thought bubble just before the last election in a political attempt to save the political hide of the then Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government.


We have this report. Senator Gallacher, who has just come into the chamber, was the chairman of that committee. They spent a lot of taxpayers' money, a lot of senators' time. They had witnesses travelling all around the country to come in and give the same-old same-old story that we have heard so many times before. As a result of the inquiry, what were the recommendations? Nothing that made any sense. What were the new discoveries that the two or three inquiries that had been set up to be conducted by people who knew what they were doing, people who understand how to fully investigate matters could not discover? The Nauruan police looked into these matters but, no, this committee sitting in Australia thought they could do better. As their report showed, they could not and there was very little real evidence of the sorts of things they had been complaining about.


But it does not stop there. The select committee, having spent all that time and money, could not get through, did not get the answers they wanted, could not quite connect their political rhetoric with the coalition government. They could connect it with the Rudd government, but that did not suit them. Having been incompetent enough not to have an inquiry that got some results, what did they do? They moved in the chamber this week to set up yet another inquiry into exactly the same matters being investigated by the Labor Party and Greens inspired additional committee reference into this particular matter.


Some of what happens in Nauru and Manus is sad. I understand not a lot of evidence has been extracted that supports a lot of the outlandish claims that have been made, but clearly things are not all A-1 in those processing centres. Again I emphasise to those who might be listening that that is solely as a result of the Labor Party government setting those up without proper consultation, process and planning. But for the umpteenth time a Senate inquiry is going to inquire into the same issues.


Senator Gallacher will say there have not been umpteen inquiries. If he had been at the estimates committee, which he does not attend, he would see that these questions come up all the time. We go through all of these. We question the department. We question the police. We question immigration officials. We have done that each estimates committees since this coalition government came into power.


We question the Australian Human Rights Commission, who had a great concern. Remember? They had a great concern when the coalition government took over: there were 200 kids in detention. The Human Rights Commission had this great concern which the Labor Party asked all these questions about. Two hundred children in detention is 200 too many, I agree, but when the Labor Party were in charge there were 2,000 children in detention, and did the Human Rights Commission raise an objection then? Did they set up an inquiry then? No, they did not. They waited for the change of government, when the Abbott government, had got 1,800 kids out of detention that the Labor Party had in detention. There were only 200 children left and there were reasons for that which have been explained at estimates committees, and the Human Rights Commission suddenly set up this major inquiry.


It has been addressed time and time again in estimates committees, this select committee and in another committee that has looked at the same matter. The Labor Party and Greens cannot get the smoking gun they are trying to put on the coalition government; they keep hitting a mirror and it keeps bouncing back onto the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government, who were the real culprits in this.


Not satisfied with wasting taxpayers' money and the Senate's time on all those inquiries, they set up another inquiry this week, so we are going to go through the whole process again. Do you know when the reporting date is? It is in December 2016. As one of the members has said publicly, that is after the next election. What a farce it makes of the Senate committee system when you have this urgent inquiry—yet another one into Manus Island—but the reporting date for the committee is after the next election. What a farce—and what a blight these sorts of political inquiries are on the reputation of the once highly regarded Senate committee system.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2015-10-15,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (18:11):  I also rise to take note of this report. I think Senator Macdonald's contribution has officially confirmed that he has lost the plot. I think it is a great pity for a senator of his standing not to understand that the select committees and the standing committees are to review government performance. I do not resile from the fact that part of the review we encompassed touched on actions of a Labor government. In fact, I think that is absolutely part of the process that should be undertaken by the Senate and the great institution that is its committee system. If we need to be critical of a Labor minister or a Labor Prime Minister then that is what I would do as the chair of that committee if the evidence were critical of a decision made at that time and there were enough cross-examination and corroborating evidence for you to draw the conclusion. That is your job as a senator.


I absolutely reject the allegations that this was a partisan political witch hunt. I absolutely reject that we actively sought to have meetings when people were not available. That is not how the committee system works—unless it works like that on Senator Macdonald's committee. I have been on about seven committees, including a couple of joint committees, and I have found them very considered in the way they approach quorum and attendance. The only problem with the Nauru select committee and attendance was that the Senate's resolution prescribing a reporting date was taken after people had made plans. I do not want to get into the detail of those plans; there were plans on the Labor side, on the Liberal side and on the Greens side. But the cooperative people on the committee sought to address that and come up with hearing dates in Canberra. We did not fly people all around the country as Senator Macdonald has alleged. We had hearings in Canberra and we had witnesses come to Canberra of their own volition. A lot of those people paid. There were a couple of people who made the appropriate inquiries and applications for reimbursement and very modest amounts were reimbursed. But there was no flying around the country. Hearings were conducted in Canberra.


With regard to the allegations he made, I did ask you in a point of order the other week, Mr President, where I took it if he was making an allegation which I believe was totally inaccurate and approaching a lie with absolutely creative mendacity. You said I needed to take it into another forum. I presume that this is the forum I take it to, and we will have to continue to do this for the rest of the year, and perhaps into next year, until such time as we get some agreement. It is not fair to the secretariat staff—who work very hard—or to the Labor contributors, the Greens contributors or the Liberal contributors. Senator Macdonald is not a member of the committee. He seems to be a great authority on the committee, but he can only have second-hand information about how that committee operated, how it met, when it met and what costs it incurred. He was not there for any of the deliberations or the discussions. He decries the work of the committee. He says that it has all been done before and that, anyway, it was Labor's fault. It was a select committee that was set up with a very tight time frame. It did an incredible amount of work. It produced a report with a number of recommendations; the minister went from rejecting those to stating that he would consider them. It achieved some international publicity. It was even mentioned in The New York Times, and it received some media in the BBC World News in London. To be dismissed out of hand as just a bipartisan witch-hunt, cobbled together quickly and regurgitating old facts is not the way it was treated by participants in the inquiry and by news outlets.


Senator Macdonald has his view of the world, and every Thursday he will come down here and regurgitate it. Every Thursday he will regurgitate it because he has four people driving home to Townsville, or wherever, who listen to it, and he gets his regular slot of vitriol, venom, inaccuracies and mendacious behaviour—every Thursday he comes down and gives it a blast. 


As a result of the evidence received and the concerns expressed, one of the select committee's recommendations was not that there be a new inquiry but that there be a venue for the genuine matters raised and not addressed in the report. If people need to raise issues about children being in harm's way or about Australia having control over these people, who are not able to access a legal system or a health system that resembles Australia's and who are not able to access the care and protection that we afford people in our custody, then there is an avenue for those people to bring them forward. The Senate has just passed a resolution, opening the door so that, if there are continuing allegations and continuing problems, these matters can be addressed. I know that does not please Senator Macdonald, but I think it is appropriate that the standing committee, which would normally have carriage of this matter, picks it up after the select committee has finished. I think that is an appropriate process to be followed. 


I am not sure why Senator Macdonald would make the tremendous allegations that it would be a waste of taxpayers' money, that it would be regurgitating events and taking evidence all over again. Clearly, as Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, he knows that the legal and cons committee is the committee it should have been recommended to had it not gone to the select committee. I do not understand why he has so much vitriol and anger about this, because I think it is part and parcel of the normal work of the Senate. As one of the longstanding members of the Senate, I thought it would have been his bread and butter to review the government. I have seen Senator Macdonald in committee taking the finance minister to task—asking questions about legislation and how it would affect people—and doing a sterling job as a senator, in a totally non-partisan way. He took a view and he had his own finance minister there, in committee. 


I do not understand why there is so much vitriol about this particular subject. We have people in our care, in custody, who are in foreign jurisdictions, and we cannot absolve ourselves of that responsibility. Having a venue where we can be notified of problems, and having a senator of such great longstanding as Senator Macdonald on that committee I thought would have been a benefit. If there were any of the behaviour that he is alleging in this chamber, he could raise it at the committee level and perhaps do something about it rather than waiting until Thursday afternoon and spouting the same speech, the same vitriol and the same venom ad infinitum. I am busily reading all the transcripts of Senator Macdonald's contributions on this matter. I think it is incumbent on me to put a bit of thought into it and put together a considered response to his contributions over the last couple of Thursdays. 


I want to leave anybody who is listening with this impression: this is the house of review. These matters were referred to the committee by a resolution of the Senate, which means a majority of senators voted for it. The committee carried out its instructions in accordance with the Senate's resolution and made some 35 recommendations. One recommendation was that we keep an eye on this matter and provide a venue where people can raise issues.


The media reported that the Save the Children office in Nauru was raided by police the other day and that all of the computer files and all of the phones and records were confiscated. I do not know what anybody else thinks, but if any police force is raiding a not-for-profit and confiscating equipment, I think we need to know what is going on. I think that, if necessary, people need to be able to raise it with the Australian parliament so that we can all know what is going on there. I do not know if it is anything untoward, but if a police force has seized an enormous amount of file records from hard drives and the like, maybe there is something of concern that we need to be keeping an eye on.


I will fully participate—along, I hope, with Senator Macdonald—in any further activity relating to the Select Committee into the Recent Allegations relating to Conditions and Circumstances at the Regional Processing Centre in Nauru. I will participate as a full, effective senator, and I certainly hope Senator Macdonald comes to the party with the same view.



The PRESIDENT:  I would like to remind senators that any documents we do not deal with or that are not preserved will be discharged from the Notice Paper. Senator Gallacher, were you going to seek leave to continue your remarks?




Senator Gallacher:
  I seek leave to continue my remarks.

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (18:32):  I am incredibly pleased with our government's enlightened approach to innovation and look forward to contributing to facilitate a variety of policy directions for technology and regional Australia. Contrary to the belief that politicians are using the recent focus on innovation in government to define themselves as a relevant and advanced species, for a long time the Nationals and, indeed, I have been calling for coding in schools and investment in our world-leading quantum computation technology at UNSW, which is absolutely fantastic. I am so excited by the work of Michelle Simmons. If we can commercialise that and stay ahead of the pack, there will be some exciting 21st and 22nd century industries built right here in Australia and, indeed, supporting our tech start-up industries. 


I had a great visit out to Fishburners a couple of weeks ago. It is with great pleasure that I will be judging the food tech hackathon—HackFood—on 8 November 2015 at the start-up hub Fishburners, in Sydney. The challenges that will be addressed include, for instance, challenge No. 5, agribusiness. Agribusiness is a $230 billion industry—larger than mining. There has been little innovation in the digital space to solve the considerable problems agribusiness faces. Unpredictable weather, export market changes and distribution and logistical challenges are just some of the issues relying on manual or labour-intensive processes. How can we introduce 21st century reinventions of antiquated solutions within this sector? That is challenge No. 5 for the hackathon. I would like to call on all of those creative and high-tech individuals out there who want to contribute to the economic sustainability of regional Australia going forward: get involved in the hackathon on 8 November. I look forward to judging that.


Google Australia commissioned Pricewaterhouse to write up a start-up economy study, which found that high-growth technology companies constitute four per cent of our GDP and will create 540,000 jobs by 2033. I really want to make the call now that I want to see a proportion of those jobs out in regional Australia. I want to see those high-tech start-up companies dealing with some of the challenges that we face in regional Australia. 


The Crossroads 2015 report by StartupAUS, released in April 2015, proposes a number of principles underlying their action plan. They include: creating a national innovation agency, increasing the numbers of entrepreneurs, improving the quantity and quality of entrepreneurship education and increasing the number of people with ICT skills. Even at Fishburners we cannot get enough coders. We are bringing them in on 457 visas as fast as we can type the visa applications. We have to get those skills into our own education system and realise that these guys are earning a lot of money very quickly. Other principles in the report include: improving access to start-up expertise, increasing the availability of early-stage capital to start-ups, addressing the legal and regulatory impediments and increasing collaboration and international connectedness.


I want those principles, as I said before, to be implemented in regional Australia, in the agricultural industry, and to ensure that all of Australia benefits from our new focus. The growing and modernising Asian middle class means that demand for our agricultural product is going to increase exponentially. We need transformative technology, both on-farm and off-farm, and, through logistics and distribution, to ensure that we reap the benefit of that growing middle class. Australia is shoring up its status as the food bowl of Asia and the South Pacific. This will only by improved by entering into ChAFTA and the TPP agreements, as we have spoken about in question time in this place all week. What we want is the provision of high-quality products, grown and nurtured with the best and latest science in mind. Increased innovation will not only improve efficiency but rejuvenate regional industries, strengthen regional communities and attract more people, who will come to know what we all know—that to live and work in the regions is a fantastic thing and that a regional community is an excellent alternative to settle in. Not only is agricultural innovation vital in our regions; knowledge-intensive tech innovation is also vital. The coalition announced that it will team up with start-up incubator BlueChilli to organise a one-day hackathon to generate ideas about how the government can support start-ups and turn Australia's tech sector into an economic powerhouse. I have a few of my own principles that I would like to pitch to the government on the topic of what Australia's innovation should seek to champion.


Firstly, it should invest $25 million—it is a paltry amount—over five years to the Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology so that they can get to the quantum computer construction and commercialisation stage as soon as possible. I have been advocating for this project for a long period of time. It is very exciting, and I call on the government for that $25 million. It is a paltry amount given our overall budget.


Reliable high-speed internet to our region is vital if regional Australia is going to be able to participate in and use the technological innovations that we need to increase our productivity. We need to have coding taught in all schools—beginning from primary school, not year 9. I know there are some coding clubs which are exponentially increasing the number of kids who are getting involved and starting coding. There is a huge skills shortage out there.


Tech-pitching policy and management ideas about agricultural issues is something I also want to see addressed; that is, more apps that farmers can use and be consulted in the creation of, as well as start-ups basing themselves in regional areas. We know that if you are sitting together it is like an incubator—you feed off each other. On that last point, the regions can work to attract the physical footprints of start-ups and innovators for the following reasons: it is cheap to live where we live out in the regions. Not only is it beautiful, not only are you healthier, but we have cheap office space and lifestyles that are conducive to creative innovation.

  And friendly people.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Friendly people, Senator Canavan? Absolutely! And you can vote for the Nationals at every election!


Inland geographical location makes for a sensible defence positioning of many valuable technological minds and resources. However, from a current Australian tech perspective, we are not moving fast enough or growing fast enough. If you are a business owner, you will know that dealing with fast growth is one of the most challenging aspects of business success. Without it, you might look offshore, sell off or wind down. We cannot allow intellectual capital to leave our shores.


Speaking of growing pains, a metro based start-up company is desperately needing to expand but cannot physically do so as there is a sparse supply of suitable real estate options in the Sydney CBD. I would hate to see a situation arise in Australia that could have been prevented if the space, rents and overheads were right and affordable. Regional Australia can host and develop these start-up hubs and other research centres, particularly those that are working on agricultural and environmental issues that are fundamental to our economic future.


Professor Moretti of the Department of Economics at the University of California, Berkeley, observed that start-ups draw more knowledge-intensive businesses into the area that they have set up shop in, and in turn also draw other talented workers. Further, Professor Moretti observed that, for each tech or start-up job that is created, five additional jobs emerge in other sectors. That will be a real boost for our regional cities if they can attract the initial investment.


The interplay between start-ups and agriculture is now like the over-used adage—disrupt or be disrupted. Australian agriculture needs to work with booming tech start-up productions and facilitate the start-ups and scientific research to benefit farmers and regional centres. I was at Dairy Australia's dinner last night, and the key message all night was that that industry's future growth and productivity is going to come from innovation and from investing significant dollars in research and development. That is exactly what they are doing, and I commend the dairy industry for their significant work in that area.


One other important aspect of the innovation dialogue is the sharing of knowledge and teaching of innovative techniques so they are brought into practice by relevant industries. Here I go to agricultural science and the dearth of graduates we have in that area but also to point out that you do not have to study agricultural science to contribute to that particular industry. We would love to see some ICT graduates applying their knowledge to our space, and I think that is where we are going to get the real addition.


I am very excited to hear the agricultural pitches made in this area. Our national culture needs to encourage start-up development for practical outcomes such as food production and animal care, not just dating apps. So, to all those Tinderellas and Tinderfellas out there, I say: 'Instead of worrying about where your next date is coming from, why don't you start working out how we are going to get our fabulous clean, green product out into the export markets of the world a lot more easily. Help solve some of the significant environmental, social and production challenges for regional Australia in our industry.'


I could go on with some fabulous examples like drones or the use of genetics. The grains industry is using GPS-guided vehicles et cetera. There is some really cool stuff going on in ag that I would encourage Australians to get involved in. The conditions to support tech industries are present in our regions, and we only need one to start the pool. The more attention that is given to ongoing work, new farm machinery, flora and fauna breeding programs and smart logistic solutions the more likely it is that our regional industries can contribute and develop as world-class enterprises.
