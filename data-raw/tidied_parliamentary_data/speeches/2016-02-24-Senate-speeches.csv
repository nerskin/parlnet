Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (09:31):  I rise to speak in support of this bill. The opposition are supporting this legislation so that the petroleum exploration industry does not suffer from uncertainty brought about by an oversight in failing to require appropriate sign-offs under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. We have acted quickly to respond to the government's need to ensure completeness in the approvals. The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment Bill 2016 will amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to validate past joint authority decisions to grant renewals or extensions to petroleum titles which have prior usage rights.


Urgent action is now required to avoid exploration title uncertainty. Legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor indicates there is a high risk that petroleum title renewal and extension decisions made without the environment minister's consent are at risk. Importantly, this is a technical issue that has not had an impact on the environmental requirements associated with the titles or work programs consistent with the terms of the titles. Joint authorities generally comprise state, territory and Commonwealth ministers responsible for energy and resources with many decisions made by departmental officials under formal delegation arrangements.


Subsection 359(3) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, known as the EPBC Act, requires that a title—that is, a permit, lease or licence—that is a 'prior usage right' must have the written consent of the Commonwealth environment minister or the appropriate delegate before the right can be renewed or extended. A petroleum title is a 'prior usage right' under the EPBC Act if the title was in force on the date of the proclamation of a Commonwealth marine reserve that overlaps the title area. Titles that are a 'prior usage right' are exempt from having to comply with the provisions of the EPBC Act and regulations that relate to a Commonwealth reserve. They are also exempt from having to comply with any management plan for the reserve.


There have been three relevant Commonwealth marine reserve proclamations that have led to petroleum titles becoming prior-usage rights. There was the proclamation of the South-east Commonwealth Marine Reserves Network, in 2007. There was the proclamation of the Commonwealth marine reserves in the South-west, North-west, North, Coral Sea and Temperate East marine regions, November 2012. There was the re-proclamation of the Commonwealth marine reserve South-east, North-west, North, Temperate East and Coral Sea marine regions, in December 2013. It has become apparent that since 2008 an administrative oversight has led to petroleum titles that carry prior-usage rights being renewed and extended by the joint authorities without environment minister's consent, as required under the EPBC Act. The consent of the Minister for the Environment, pursuant to subsection 359(3) of the EPBC Act, was not sought as required for a number of prior-usage rights within the areas over which petroleum titles were granted, due to an administrative oversight.


The administrative error applies to the renewal or the extension of 42 petroleum titles with prior-usage rights, including 33 that are still active. The titles for all companies operating in the Great Australian Bight have not been affected by this administrative error and therefore are still valid. A company wanting to undertake offshore petroleum activities must obtain approval from the independent expert regulator, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority. This includes those who seek to undertake activity in the Great Australian Bight, such as BP. Notwithstanding the administrative oversight, all petroleum activities have continued to be subject to robust regulatory assessment by the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority against stringent safety, integrity and environmental management requirements that were set out under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and the various associated regulations.


Affected titleholders that have undertaken offshore petroleum activities have obtained approval from the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority in accordance with the requirements of the environmental, safety and well-integrity regime. All current offshore activities continue uninterrupted and are regulated. The amendments made by this bill will validate past joint authority decisions to grant renewals or extensions of prior-usage-rights titles where the consent of the Minister for the Environment was neither sought nor given under subsection 359(3) of the EPBC Act. Amendments to validate affected decisions are the only way to satisfactorily eliminate the risk that affected decisions pose for titleholders. The Commonwealth minister has advised affected titleholders, together with all state and territory ministers, of the flaw and this particular remedy. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2016-02-24,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:38):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment Bill 2016, which is being rushed through this place. I would also like to indicate that I have a range of questions I would like to ask, so I will be requesting we go into Committee of the Whole on this bill. Because it is being dealt with so quickly, we do not have an opportunity to send it to committee. Therefore, I think it is only right that we ask some questions in Committee of the Whole. Here we have Labor siding with the government to rush this piece of legislation through to deal with an administrative oversight. It is not explained how the administrative oversight occurred. How can Australians be satisfied that this is not the only administrative oversight that has occurred with environmental assessments.


Although Senator Carr talked about NOPSEMA, when this process of administrative oversight started NOPSEMA was not even in existence. It did not exist then, so we have had a period of time where we had these leases overseen by inadequate assessment processes. Also, questions are now raised over the functioning of NOPSEMA and whether they can have administrative oversight where they just happened not to have environmental tick-off on these leases—and that is under the best minister in the world, Mr Hunt, as the environment minister! This started, I will acknowledge, under the previous government, so I do not think you have to look very far to realise why Labor is rushing so much to support the government in driving this legislation through the parliament—it does not want to have too much scrutiny over how this problem occurred in the first place. 


People should be extremely concerned that some of our key laws that are meant to protect our environment have basically been ignored. Section 359 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act specifies that if someone has rights immediately before a Commonwealth reserve is declared then those 'prior usage rights', as they are called, continue. That means that where there was already a right for exploration or extraction that continues to exist. I will point out that one of our concerns has always been that the environmental assessment process and review process does not kick in early enough, so this problem of exploration and production in environmentally sensitive areas actually starts when they start this process of the release of acreage. 'Acreage' is what they call it when they release areas of the marine environment for bidding for exploration by petroleum companies, and that has always been a fundamental concern of mine and the Greens. 


However, let me go back to this specific issue. Subsection 359(3) of the EPBC Act also specifies that the prior usage right can only be extended with the approval of the Minister for the Environment and only under the conditions that the minister sets. This is an important point. It means that even if a prior usage right exist when a Commonwealth reserve is declared, the Minister for the Environment has to review it and, if necessary, apply conditions. The Minister for the Environment—and, in this case, at the moment, the best minister in the world—has not been doing his job, the department has not been doing its job and, obviously, the procedures have fallen down, and I want to ask a whole lot of questions about how those procedures managed to fall down in this particular example. 


We now have legislation being pushed through to validate these leases that have not been subject to due process, and the obvious question is: what else has not been subject to due process? Are there other administrative oversights that have occurred and that we do not know about? What we know is that petroleum activity in Commonwealth reserves is going on that has not been subject to this process. We need a better explanation than 'administrative oversight'. The explanatory memorandum to this bill says:


… an administrative oversight has recently been discovered, whereby the consent of the Minister for the Environment was not sought as required for decisions to renew or extend the term of 'prior usage rights' titles…


As we have just heard, this apparently applies to 42 renewals or extensions that have been affected. 


I remember when we were debating the NOPSEMA legislation and the changes to the NOPSEMA legislation that handed far more environmental control over to the department that is also responsible for the exploitation—it is an exploitation of resources department—that a lot of people in the community were very concerned that this would reduce environmental assessment and environmental controls. I raised concerns in this place, and what do we see now? We see this administrative oversight where leases have not had consent from the Minister for the Environment and no-one has explained how it occurred. Just some of the questions that I will be asking are: how did the department discovered the mistake; when did the department discover the mistake; when did the minister know; when did the environment minister know; when did the coalition notify Labor on the issue; what are the renewals that have occurred; and, in detail, which marine parks are affected?


These questions all remain unanswered. There is so much we do not know. That is why I will be asking for a Committee of the Whole process. We do not know what other mistakes have been made. The government has announced this fix, but what other mistakes have been made through our environmental assessment process? As Michelle Grady from Pew said in the media when this mistake was first announced:


Mining in marine parks is a concession, which must have the highest scrutiny given the impact on marine life, fishing and local communities that can occur as a result of seismic exploration, drilling operations and oil spills.


We know the devastation that spills from petroleum activity can have on our marine life. We know there is not a lot of support in the community for exploration and production in national parks, on a terrestrial basis, or in marine parks. These, as Michelle pointed out in her comments, are concessions that are given. We expect the highest level of scrutiny regarding activity in our environmentally sensitive marine areas. We have to remember that these marine parks and marine reserves that we are talking about are in particularly environmentally sensitive areas. They are areas that we have said are so important that we need to put them in to marine reserves.


The government, and the departments, know that these are highly sensitive marine protected areas, that the reason they are protected is that they have particular environmental values—they are unique. In some places we have marine biodiversity that is found nowhere else in the world. We know the impact of things like global warming and coral bleaching on our marine life. We know the impact of overfishing. We know the impact from other oil and gas activity and accidents from around the world. Knowing all that, the department overlooked and made an administrative oversight regarding exploration and production leases in marine protected areas. How can our community be confident that the rest of the leases in our marine protected areas and proposed marine protected areas do not have further administrative oversights associated with them? And let's not forget the leases that are still being granted over areas that are supposed to be in marine protected areas. We have not heard from the government an adequate explanation about how this occurred, and I look forward to the government explaining how this occurred and reassuring the community that in fact we are not continuing to have this problem.


This is a very serious issue and I am just astounded that it can have gone on for so long without somebody picking it up earlier, particularly given the focus we have had in this country on our bioregional marine planning process and establishing what was the world-leading system of marine protected areas, which this government of course sidelined when they dropped the management plans and are still reviewing. And we still have not seen the results of that review. It is getting later and later into this election cycle and still the review process has not been announced, nor when we are going to see the management plans back in place that will mean that the boundaries in our marine parks are not just a series of boundaries with no adequate management—bearing in mind that the vast majority of Australians support our bioregional marine planning process.


Deeply concerned that this administrative oversight has occurred, we do not support the rapidity with which this process is being pushed through by Labor and the government. The government talks—and so does Labor—about the need for certainty for these leases. I would put to you that there is a social licence that these exploration and production leases rely on and that you have stretched thin that social licence by doing this. Oil and gas companies are on notice with oil and gas activity in our marine parks, which are environmentally sensitive and are going to be increasingly important in an environment where the planet is warming, where coral bleaching is going to likely happen more and more, where we continue to see overfishing around the world and where we continue to see the degradation of the marine environment. They are more and more important, and these companies' social licence is running out in our marine protected areas. When you talk about certainty, they are on notice that we do not want them in our marine protected areas. We do not support the process that the government takes in allowing that sort of activity in large areas of our marine protected reserves and our absolutely essential system of marine parks and bioregional marine parks.


We do not support this legislation. It is a tragedy that this has occurred. It should not have happened, and companies are on notice: we do not want them in those marine protected areas. They have been on notice for a long time, and you would have thought that governments of both persuasions would have been paying attention. In particular, bear in mind that when Montara occurred we had that big focus on regulation, and in fact that led to regulatory change, which was a good thing because we tightened it up. We saw that the mistakes that happened led to the Montara accident that spilt millions of litres of oil into our marine environment and led to the spraying of dispersants. And, if you are paying attention and listening to the people in West Timor, they are saying it is continuing to have an impact on their marine environment. It has impacted on their fish and seaweed production, and this government is not paying attention to the calls for even a study into that impact. But this regulatory oversight occurred during that process, when the government was supposed to be paying strict attention to these measures. This is a fail; it is not just an administrative oversight, because it has larger ramifications. We do not support this bill, and I will be asking a series of questions about how this occurred.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2016-02-24,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate and Minister for Northern Australia) (09:53):  I thank the senators who have contributed to this debate. The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment Bill 2016 will validate certain title extension and renewal decisions made under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006.


In Australia, offshore petroleum exploration and development is regulated by a title system authorising titleholders to carry out petroleum operations in Commonwealth waters. A petroleum title granted under the OPGGS Act is defined as a prior usage right for the purposes of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. If the title is in force immediately before the proclamation of a Commonwealth reserve that overlaps the title area, under the EPBC Act it is stipulated that such a usage right may only be extended or have its term renewed with the consent of the Minister for the Environment. A recently identified administrative oversight extending back to 2008 led to certain petroleum titles being renewed or extended under the OPGGS Act without the Minister for the Environment's consent being sought, as is required under the EPBC Act. Without legislative amendment there is a question as to the validity of the relevant extension and renewal decisions made under the OPGGS Act. The amendments proposed in this bill are therefore curative measures designed to validate the affected title decisions. Amendments to validate affected decisions are the only way to satisfactorily eliminate the risk affected decisions posed for title holders.


Despite the aforementioned administrative oversight on affected title decisions, the government is confident that all petroleum titleholders have undertaken their activities in good faith. They have continued to be subject to, and compliant with, the stringent environmental management requirements set out under the OPGGS Act and environment regulations. The government is committed to applying international leading practice in the regulation and the management of environmental safety and integrity risks associated with offshore petroleum operations.


I do also note the questions that Senator Siewert has foreshadowed, and I, of course, will be happy to answer those at the time, but I would like to just stress that this is a technical administrative oversight. It is something that came up due to a lack of process between the Department of the Environment and the department of industry, or its various predecessors responsible for the OPGGS Act. In this time the senator did mention changes that were made in response to Montara. Some of those amendments at the time did confuse this issue. There was a loss of staff, apparently, and these errors occurred. Senator Siewert, I am sure you are not suggesting errors are not made by all of us at different times. This is unfortunate and regrettable, but the best way to deal with something that has gone wrong is to fix it as soon as you can. We are confident that these changes in this bill will help fix that issue, while still maintaining our world-leading environmental standards and regulations, including those on Commonwealth reserve areas.


Question agreed to.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate and Minister for Northern Australia) (09:57):  Senator Siewert, I am advised that this issue first came to the attention of departmental officials in a meeting on 16 December 2015. That was a meeting with the Department of the Environment to discuss petroleum titles and Commonwealth marine reserves. Obviously, on becoming aware of this issue, the department sought legal advice on the status of renewed or extended petroleum titles. The department informally briefed the minister's office in the lead-up to Christmas and a formal brief was sent to the minister's office on 19 January 2016 once the final legal advice and the necessary work had been undertaken to identify the scope of the issue.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:58):  I have just had an opportunity to read Mr Gary Gray's second reading debate speech on this bill. In that he talks about it being first exposed in the government in 2011.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate and Minister for Northern Australia) (09:58):  I obviously have no knowledge, and the government cannot have any knowledge, about advice provided to a previous government. I have not spoken to Mr Gray about that particular issue. I did mention in my earlier comments that there were amendments proposed in 2011 in response to the Montara issue which, apparently, at the time, if those amendments had proceeded, would have removed this requirement and removed this issue. That is one reason why there was some confusion in the department, and how this error arose. But I cannot have any knowledge about advice that department officials gave to a minister from a previous government.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:59):  Was there no handover? Were no records kept? Mr Gray said in his speech during the second reading debate:


I apologise because this oversight, this shortfall, this lack of consistent dealing consistent with the act's fine requirements, was first exposed to the government in 2011 and we, and I, did nothing to attend to it then, placing an onerous obligation on the current government to act in a legislative way … 


So quite clearly the department knew about it in 2011. Does this happen frequently?

 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate and Minister for Northern Australia) (10:00):  Once again I must stress that I or the government cannot have knowledge about the advice provided to a previous minister in a previous government from a different side of politics. I am advised though that the issue here arose because of staff turnover in this particular area, so that corporate knowledge—and I have no knowledge of what was provided to the previous government—may have been lost to the department. In this government for this minister the issue first came to departmental officials' attention just before Christmas and the minister was only formally briefed that there was an issue on 19 January 2016.

There has been a legislative requirement to seek the Minister for the Environment's approval for renewal or extension of these petroleum titles. That has not happened. We have been as open as we can be about why that has happened, due to the issues in the department. Obviously, as I said in my summing-up speech, we all make errors from time to time, including me. The best thing we can do is make sure we fix those errors when they are exposed. We have the expert legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor about the best way to fix these problems while still maintaining our strong environmental protections.

This is a very long mistake and it is about the implementation of Commonwealth legislation and environmental protections. How can the community be confident that there are no other oversights? I will add a supplementary question to that. Have you done a review to ensure that the legislation is now adequately being implemented? If you have, can that be made public?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment Bill 2016</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2016-02-24,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate and Minister for Northern Australia) (10:02):  On the first question—can the Australian people be confident?—I certainly think they can be confident about our environmental protections and I think that is demonstrated by our strong environmental record as a country and as a nation, including in the protection of our offshore areas. That is the ultimate test obviously of whether our environmental protections are working.


This particular issue was an administrative requirement in the sense that we needed to receive approval from another minister for certain decisions to be renewed or extended. Those renewals and extensions were still assessed based on the requirements that go to the more substantive issues of protecting the environment in the act. That particular administrative check was not received in this case. We have discovered that and are seeking to fix it through this bill.


I am advised that the department is conducting a further comprehensive review to ensure that any other legislative requirements are adhered to. Of course I am confident that if any other issues are discovered through that process that the government will act quickly to rectify those issues, as it has in this instance where within a matter of months processes have changed and this legislation is here. I should add that I am advised that the Department of the Environment has established a new process to ensure that any further renewals or extensions of petroleum titles do receive approval by the Minister for the Environment or his or her delegate. Of course, this legislation affects only those decisions made before 1 January 2016. Decisions to renew or extend licences after that date will need to accord with the legislative requirement that exists to receive the Minister for the Environment's approval.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment Bill 2016</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-02-24,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:04):  This bill obviously corrects a mistake made by the previous government, but there is nothing—I do not attribute any blame in that. I am grateful that Mr Gary Gray, who was the relevant minister at the time, is, as always, very frank and open about this. This is fixing an administrative error. As the minister has mentioned here, we all make mistakes. The important thing is to fix them as soon as possible. The minister in the other place clearly indicated that this was an oversight. There were reserves granted without ministerial approval, and this legislation, according to the minister's speech in the other place, is simply to backdate what would have been ministerial approval at the time.


I want to ask the minister a question generally about this area. Senator Siewert, in her speech, spoke often about marine protected areas, and I agree with most of what she said. Marine protected areas were introduced by a Liberal government, something the Greens political party have never acknowledged.




Senator Siewert:
  That's not true!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Okay, you do acknowledge it. I simply want to make the point that any serious environmental legislation in this parliament has always been introduced by Liberal-National party coalition governments. Fraser Island, the environment department—I could go back for hours. We are never given credit for it, but then we are not here to get credit; we are here to do the right thing by the Australian environment.




Senator Kim Carr:
  You are hilarious!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  One of the reasons I am speaking today is because I am very proud of the record of Liberal-National party federal governments in the environment area. You can go back: Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Fraser Island, setting up the first environment department, the first environment minister—all Liberal government initiatives. Nothing has ever come from the Labor Party—very little, with respect, in the Labor Party, encouraged by the Greens. You can laugh all you like, but the facts are there. Unfortunately, we do not get the credit for it. If you talk about the environment, you think it is the Greens that do it, but every serious piece of environmental legislation that has come through this parliament has been an initiative of Liberal governments—not of the Greens and certainly not of the Labor Party. I want to make that point, as I often do, because we have a very proud record of environmental legislation and regulation. Unfortunately, the listening public—I notice we are on broadcast today—never appreciate that. We do not want thanks; we just want to do what is right, and marine protected areas are an example of that.


In fact, it was a Liberal government and a Liberal minister that first introduced an oceans policy. The first oceans policy anywhere in the world was done by a Liberal-National government—Senator Hill, in fact. That was a world first. And as a result of the oceans policy, we introduced a series of marine protected areas. Some people were a bit upset about that at the time, but we did it because it was right for the Australian environment. It is a proud record that we have. But in relation to marine protected areas, the basis upon which they were introduced is that they be multipurpose, that they address all of the issues that might happen in our ocean. Some of them are petroleum exploration. The plans of management that come under these marine protected areas are the important issues. Setting up the marine protected area is fine; it is the management plans that come under it.


I remember that the first one was in the southern seas between Victoria and Tasmania. It took a long time to get the management plans right, but eventually—and I have said this many a time in this place—all sides of the argument were 80 per cent happy; no-one was 100 per cent happy, but all sides were 80 per cent happy. So, we had marine protected areas, but we allowed controlled fishing; we allowed exploration provided that it was done the right way and was very strictly controlled. That is why I wanted to say just a few words today, engendered by Senator Siewert's comments on marine protected areas. We have to make sure that the plans of management in marine protected areas do look after the oceans, as was the original intention of the Liberal and Nationals governments when this was introduced. But we have to make sure it is done sensibly. And as you would expect, as a Queensland senator living on the coast near the Great Barrier Reef and the Coral Sea I am particularly interested that the plans of management, particularly for the Coral Sea marine protected areas, are sensible—not doing what the Pew foundation would want.


You may know, but in case you do not, the Pew foundation is an American environment group, funded, I might say, by the oil industry in America, which apparently has a bad conscience about what the oil industry did in America earlier in the last century. So, the Pew group has now put a lot of money into this organisation. It is not too keen, it seems, about looking after the United States' problems but comes out here and tries to tell Australians how to look after our natural resources. I might say, just in passing, that I have as much respect for President Obama's entry into the environment debate in Australia as I do for the Pew foundation's entry into the debate! I will never forgive the American president for blowing into Australia and starting to lecture us about control and protection of the Great Barrier Reef when, again, Australia has a wonderful record in protection of one of the seven wonders of the world—the Great Barrier Reef. I wish the American president would look after his own backyard and not bother about giving us a lecture about our environmental control and management of some of the wonderful natural assets we have in Australia. In fact, as was mentioned earlier, it was the Liberal and Nationals governments that first set up the protections of the Great Barrier Reef—at a time, I might say, when there were also Liberal and Nationals state governments in Queensland, and of course they were very much involved in this.


So, I just want to emphasise that in dealing with marine protected areas—and this bill before us relates to that—we have to make sure that the management plans are right, and we have to make sure that we properly manage those marine protected areas. That means, particularly in relation to the Coral Sea, that fishing must be allowed, but in a controlled way. Fishermen more than anyone understand the importance of the ecology and of sustainable use of the environment. And it is very important that the department and the advisers and those who deal with these areas do not overlook the fact that you can have controlled and managed fishing operations in marine protected areas. Again, I am aware that in the marine protected areas and in the Coral Sea there are wonderful new initiatives for fishing—sustainable initiatives. Fishermen would be the first ones to say that they do not want to overfish, that they do not want to destroy the fish stock, because that is their livelihood.


And we have to get through to the Greens political party, to the Pew foundation and hopefully to the bureaucrats who administer these acts that it is important to have these marine protected areas in a multifaceted, multipurpose arrangement, and the management plans need to address that. I am particularly passionate about the fishing industry everywhere, but specifically in the north. As we all know in this chamber, most of the fish that Australians eat these days is imported, and very often we are not very sure what its origin is, how it has been grown or how it has been caught. We do know about that in relation to the small amount of fish that we do catch or grow because we have a very strict regime of fisheries management in Australia. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority is a wonderful organisation made up of professional fish managers and scientists who look into these things. They determine the sustainability of any fishing in those areas, and they are far better placed to do it than the Pew foundation and some of the Greens political party.


I say 'some of the Greens political party' because I know that Senator Siewert was part of the Joint Select Committee on Northern Australia that has just tabled a report on aquaculture. It was a unanimous report, and I thank Senator Siewert for her contributions to that report, the same as I thanked, yesterday when I tabled that report, Ms MacTiernan, Mr Gray and Mr Snowdon, for their positive contributions to that report on aquaculture. I know that some in the Greens political party understand that you can have fishing, you can have aquaculture, providing it is properly controlled and managed.


In this committee stage of the debate my question to the minister, which is almost a rhetorical question, is: does this amendment act in any way impact on the other uses of marine protected areas, particularly in fishing? As I say, it is important that we have marine protected areas, but it is important that we, as a nation, manage them properly and do allow controlled exploitation of those areas that is done in a way that will not impact upon the ecology or on Australia's wealth.


I will leave that there. I obviously support the bill. It is an administrative bill correcting an oversight of the previous government and needs to be done. I just want to ensure that nothing in the bill, in any way, impacts upon the proper management and use of marine protected areas for other purposes.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate and Minister for Northern Australia) (10:17):  I thank the senator for his contribution and I share his particular interest and concern for our fishing industry. I can confirm that this bill only relates to petroleum titles and, indeed, only to the renewal or extension of petroleum titles and not to their original designation. It only relates to an issue where petroleum titles existed in an area before a Commonwealth marine reserve came into force or overlapped with an area when a Commonwealth marine reserve area came into force. As you would have seen in other contributions in this debate, any renewal or extension of those originally designated petroleum titles does require the approval of the Minister for the Environment. That has not happened over the period from 2008 until late last year, and this bill seeks to rectify the issues with those renewals and extensions, but only for petroleum titles. It does not affect other activities that may occur in Commonwealth waters or our offshore waters including those relating to fishing.


If I can respond a little to the senator's contribution about the proud record of the coalition government in protecting the environment. As Senator Macdonald would know, it was a coalition government that introduced the EPBC Act and, of course, the requirement in section 359 for the Minister for the Environment to approve extensions or renewals for the petroleum titles is a requirement introduced by a coalition government. It is regrettable that that particular requirement has not been adhered to in these cases over this period of time involving both Labor and coalition governments, but we are committed to fixing it and, of course, we are committed to the proper environmental management of our offshore waters, including making sure that we support environmentally sustainable activities such as fishing, that any newly designated marine reserves—I know the senator's interest in the review of Commonwealth marine reserves in his area—are properly assessed, and that we allow economic activities that are in concord with the protection of a strong environment and a protected Great Barrier Reef, in the case near Senator Macdonald's territory.

But the review that is being conducted is an internal review, as of course was the process which has led to these particular changes. That internal review is not expected to be made public, because it is a review of departmental operations and procedures. However, I am sure, as I said earlier, that any particular issues that arise from that review will be rectified by the government. If any of those issues lead to a need to change regulations or otherwise, they will, of course, be brought to this chamber for review and, of course, through the normal practices the senator and any other interested senators will be free to question the department and the government about these issues further in other committees and other avenues.

I just want to go back to the issue of how this oversight was identified and how it occurred. Was there a process of review? I understand you cannot answer the question around 2011.

 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate and Minister for Northern Australia) (10:22):  I obviously did indicate earlier that it arose in a meeting between departmental officials. I am advised that that meeting was part of our due diligence process to ensure systems were working properly. Obviously it arose at that meeting. I was not at that meeting myself, and neither were any ministerial officials; it was a departmental meeting. But this issue arose. As soon as it did arise and came to the attention of departmental officials, they immediately sought to investigate further, including through expert legal advice in that process and that review of these issues. That legal advice has led to these particular changes we are proposing today.

Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate and Minister for Northern Australia) (10:23):  I do not quite agree with the premise of that question. My understanding is that, while the issue was raised at the meeting and identified, there was no agreement at that meeting that this particular legislation, for example, had to be introduced. They obviously felt that there was something worth investigating. As the senator might appreciate, some of these renewals and extensions go on a rolling basis, so they affect titles differently. So there were questions about whether the titles themselves will continue to be valid, regardless of the particular requirements in the act. So there was not necessarily an agreement by one set of officials or otherwise that this was going to be a problem that needed legislative correction. It was raised, in my understanding, as a matter of concern, and further work was done to decide exactly what needed to be done in response to that concern. That is why we are proposing this legislation now.

My understanding is that the delegate for the Minister for the Environment at the moment is the Director of National Parks. So they would need that approval going forward. Obviously this piece of legislation will make those renewals and extensions that occurred prior to 2016 valid, so the Director of National Parks will not need to formally extend or renew those titles. However, I can advise that the Director of National Parks has written to the minister and advised that, in his view, there would have been no barrier and he would have approved these renewals and extensions even if consent had been sought over this period from 2008 to 2015.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2016-02-24,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (09:31):  I rise to speak in support of this bill. The opposition are supporting this legislation so that the petroleum exploration industry does not suffer from uncertainty brought about by an oversight in failing to require appropriate sign-offs under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. We have acted quickly to respond to the government's need to ensure completeness in the approvals. The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment Bill 2016 will amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to validate past joint authority decisions to grant renewals or extensions to petroleum titles which have prior usage rights.


Urgent action is now required to avoid exploration title uncertainty. Legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor indicates there is a high risk that petroleum title renewal and extension decisions made without the environment minister's consent are at risk. Importantly, this is a technical issue that has not had an impact on the environmental requirements associated with the titles or work programs consistent with the terms of the titles. Joint authorities generally comprise state, territory and Commonwealth ministers responsible for energy and resources with many decisions made by departmental officials under formal delegation arrangements.


Subsection 359(3) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, known as the EPBC Act, requires that a title—that is, a permit, lease or licence—that is a 'prior usage right' must have the written consent of the Commonwealth environment minister or the appropriate delegate before the right can be renewed or extended. A petroleum title is a 'prior usage right' under the EPBC Act if the title was in force on the date of the proclamation of a Commonwealth marine reserve that overlaps the title area. Titles that are a 'prior usage right' are exempt from having to comply with the provisions of the EPBC Act and regulations that relate to a Commonwealth reserve. They are also exempt from having to comply with any management plan for the reserve.


There have been three relevant Commonwealth marine reserve proclamations that have led to petroleum titles becoming prior-usage rights. There was the proclamation of the South-east Commonwealth Marine Reserves Network, in 2007. There was the proclamation of the Commonwealth marine reserves in the South-west, North-west, North, Coral Sea and Temperate East marine regions, November 2012. There was the re-proclamation of the Commonwealth marine reserve South-east, North-west, North, Temperate East and Coral Sea marine regions, in December 2013. It has become apparent that since 2008 an administrative oversight has led to petroleum titles that carry prior-usage rights being renewed and extended by the joint authorities without environment minister's consent, as required under the EPBC Act. The consent of the Minister for the Environment, pursuant to subsection 359(3) of the EPBC Act, was not sought as required for a number of prior-usage rights within the areas over which petroleum titles were granted, due to an administrative oversight.


The administrative error applies to the renewal or the extension of 42 petroleum titles with prior-usage rights, including 33 that are still active. The titles for all companies operating in the Great Australian Bight have not been affected by this administrative error and therefore are still valid. A company wanting to undertake offshore petroleum activities must obtain approval from the independent expert regulator, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority. This includes those who seek to undertake activity in the Great Australian Bight, such as BP. Notwithstanding the administrative oversight, all petroleum activities have continued to be subject to robust regulatory assessment by the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority against stringent safety, integrity and environmental management requirements that were set out under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and the various associated regulations.


Affected titleholders that have undertaken offshore petroleum activities have obtained approval from the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority in accordance with the requirements of the environmental, safety and well-integrity regime. All current offshore activities continue uninterrupted and are regulated. The amendments made by this bill will validate past joint authority decisions to grant renewals or extensions of prior-usage-rights titles where the consent of the Minister for the Environment was neither sought nor given under subsection 359(3) of the EPBC Act. Amendments to validate affected decisions are the only way to satisfactorily eliminate the risk that affected decisions pose for titleholders. The Commonwealth minister has advised affected titleholders, together with all state and territory ministers, of the flaw and this particular remedy. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2016-02-24,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:38):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment Bill 2016, which is being rushed through this place. I would also like to indicate that I have a range of questions I would like to ask, so I will be requesting we go into Committee of the Whole on this bill. Because it is being dealt with so quickly, we do not have an opportunity to send it to committee. Therefore, I think it is only right that we ask some questions in Committee of the Whole. Here we have Labor siding with the government to rush this piece of legislation through to deal with an administrative oversight. It is not explained how the administrative oversight occurred. How can Australians be satisfied that this is not the only administrative oversight that has occurred with environmental assessments.


Although Senator Carr talked about NOPSEMA, when this process of administrative oversight started NOPSEMA was not even in existence. It did not exist then, so we have had a period of time where we had these leases overseen by inadequate assessment processes. Also, questions are now raised over the functioning of NOPSEMA and whether they can have administrative oversight where they just happened not to have environmental tick-off on these leases—and that is under the best minister in the world, Mr Hunt, as the environment minister! This started, I will acknowledge, under the previous government, so I do not think you have to look very far to realise why Labor is rushing so much to support the government in driving this legislation through the parliament—it does not want to have too much scrutiny over how this problem occurred in the first place. 


People should be extremely concerned that some of our key laws that are meant to protect our environment have basically been ignored. Section 359 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act specifies that if someone has rights immediately before a Commonwealth reserve is declared then those 'prior usage rights', as they are called, continue. That means that where there was already a right for exploration or extraction that continues to exist. I will point out that one of our concerns has always been that the environmental assessment process and review process does not kick in early enough, so this problem of exploration and production in environmentally sensitive areas actually starts when they start this process of the release of acreage. 'Acreage' is what they call it when they release areas of the marine environment for bidding for exploration by petroleum companies, and that has always been a fundamental concern of mine and the Greens. 


However, let me go back to this specific issue. Subsection 359(3) of the EPBC Act also specifies that the prior usage right can only be extended with the approval of the Minister for the Environment and only under the conditions that the minister sets. This is an important point. It means that even if a prior usage right exist when a Commonwealth reserve is declared, the Minister for the Environment has to review it and, if necessary, apply conditions. The Minister for the Environment—and, in this case, at the moment, the best minister in the world—has not been doing his job, the department has not been doing its job and, obviously, the procedures have fallen down, and I want to ask a whole lot of questions about how those procedures managed to fall down in this particular example. 


We now have legislation being pushed through to validate these leases that have not been subject to due process, and the obvious question is: what else has not been subject to due process? Are there other administrative oversights that have occurred and that we do not know about? What we know is that petroleum activity in Commonwealth reserves is going on that has not been subject to this process. We need a better explanation than 'administrative oversight'. The explanatory memorandum to this bill says:


… an administrative oversight has recently been discovered, whereby the consent of the Minister for the Environment was not sought as required for decisions to renew or extend the term of 'prior usage rights' titles…


As we have just heard, this apparently applies to 42 renewals or extensions that have been affected. 


I remember when we were debating the NOPSEMA legislation and the changes to the NOPSEMA legislation that handed far more environmental control over to the department that is also responsible for the exploitation—it is an exploitation of resources department—that a lot of people in the community were very concerned that this would reduce environmental assessment and environmental controls. I raised concerns in this place, and what do we see now? We see this administrative oversight where leases have not had consent from the Minister for the Environment and no-one has explained how it occurred. Just some of the questions that I will be asking are: how did the department discovered the mistake; when did the department discover the mistake; when did the minister know; when did the environment minister know; when did the coalition notify Labor on the issue; what are the renewals that have occurred; and, in detail, which marine parks are affected?


These questions all remain unanswered. There is so much we do not know. That is why I will be asking for a Committee of the Whole process. We do not know what other mistakes have been made. The government has announced this fix, but what other mistakes have been made through our environmental assessment process? As Michelle Grady from Pew said in the media when this mistake was first announced:


Mining in marine parks is a concession, which must have the highest scrutiny given the impact on marine life, fishing and local communities that can occur as a result of seismic exploration, drilling operations and oil spills.


We know the devastation that spills from petroleum activity can have on our marine life. We know there is not a lot of support in the community for exploration and production in national parks, on a terrestrial basis, or in marine parks. These, as Michelle pointed out in her comments, are concessions that are given. We expect the highest level of scrutiny regarding activity in our environmentally sensitive marine areas. We have to remember that these marine parks and marine reserves that we are talking about are in particularly environmentally sensitive areas. They are areas that we have said are so important that we need to put them in to marine reserves.


The government, and the departments, know that these are highly sensitive marine protected areas, that the reason they are protected is that they have particular environmental values—they are unique. In some places we have marine biodiversity that is found nowhere else in the world. We know the impact of things like global warming and coral bleaching on our marine life. We know the impact of overfishing. We know the impact from other oil and gas activity and accidents from around the world. Knowing all that, the department overlooked and made an administrative oversight regarding exploration and production leases in marine protected areas. How can our community be confident that the rest of the leases in our marine protected areas and proposed marine protected areas do not have further administrative oversights associated with them? And let's not forget the leases that are still being granted over areas that are supposed to be in marine protected areas. We have not heard from the government an adequate explanation about how this occurred, and I look forward to the government explaining how this occurred and reassuring the community that in fact we are not continuing to have this problem.


This is a very serious issue and I am just astounded that it can have gone on for so long without somebody picking it up earlier, particularly given the focus we have had in this country on our bioregional marine planning process and establishing what was the world-leading system of marine protected areas, which this government of course sidelined when they dropped the management plans and are still reviewing. And we still have not seen the results of that review. It is getting later and later into this election cycle and still the review process has not been announced, nor when we are going to see the management plans back in place that will mean that the boundaries in our marine parks are not just a series of boundaries with no adequate management—bearing in mind that the vast majority of Australians support our bioregional marine planning process.


Deeply concerned that this administrative oversight has occurred, we do not support the rapidity with which this process is being pushed through by Labor and the government. The government talks—and so does Labor—about the need for certainty for these leases. I would put to you that there is a social licence that these exploration and production leases rely on and that you have stretched thin that social licence by doing this. Oil and gas companies are on notice with oil and gas activity in our marine parks, which are environmentally sensitive and are going to be increasingly important in an environment where the planet is warming, where coral bleaching is going to likely happen more and more, where we continue to see overfishing around the world and where we continue to see the degradation of the marine environment. They are more and more important, and these companies' social licence is running out in our marine protected areas. When you talk about certainty, they are on notice that we do not want them in our marine protected areas. We do not support the process that the government takes in allowing that sort of activity in large areas of our marine protected reserves and our absolutely essential system of marine parks and bioregional marine parks.


We do not support this legislation. It is a tragedy that this has occurred. It should not have happened, and companies are on notice: we do not want them in those marine protected areas. They have been on notice for a long time, and you would have thought that governments of both persuasions would have been paying attention. In particular, bear in mind that when Montara occurred we had that big focus on regulation, and in fact that led to regulatory change, which was a good thing because we tightened it up. We saw that the mistakes that happened led to the Montara accident that spilt millions of litres of oil into our marine environment and led to the spraying of dispersants. And, if you are paying attention and listening to the people in West Timor, they are saying it is continuing to have an impact on their marine environment. It has impacted on their fish and seaweed production, and this government is not paying attention to the calls for even a study into that impact. But this regulatory oversight occurred during that process, when the government was supposed to be paying strict attention to these measures. This is a fail; it is not just an administrative oversight, because it has larger ramifications. We do not support this bill, and I will be asking a series of questions about how this occurred.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2016-02-24,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate and Minister for Northern Australia) (09:53):  I thank the senators who have contributed to this debate. The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment Bill 2016 will validate certain title extension and renewal decisions made under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006.


In Australia, offshore petroleum exploration and development is regulated by a title system authorising titleholders to carry out petroleum operations in Commonwealth waters. A petroleum title granted under the OPGGS Act is defined as a prior usage right for the purposes of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. If the title is in force immediately before the proclamation of a Commonwealth reserve that overlaps the title area, under the EPBC Act it is stipulated that such a usage right may only be extended or have its term renewed with the consent of the Minister for the Environment. A recently identified administrative oversight extending back to 2008 led to certain petroleum titles being renewed or extended under the OPGGS Act without the Minister for the Environment's consent being sought, as is required under the EPBC Act. Without legislative amendment there is a question as to the validity of the relevant extension and renewal decisions made under the OPGGS Act. The amendments proposed in this bill are therefore curative measures designed to validate the affected title decisions. Amendments to validate affected decisions are the only way to satisfactorily eliminate the risk affected decisions posed for title holders.


Despite the aforementioned administrative oversight on affected title decisions, the government is confident that all petroleum titleholders have undertaken their activities in good faith. They have continued to be subject to, and compliant with, the stringent environmental management requirements set out under the OPGGS Act and environment regulations. The government is committed to applying international leading practice in the regulation and the management of environmental safety and integrity risks associated with offshore petroleum operations.


I do also note the questions that Senator Siewert has foreshadowed, and I, of course, will be happy to answer those at the time, but I would like to just stress that this is a technical administrative oversight. It is something that came up due to a lack of process between the Department of the Environment and the department of industry, or its various predecessors responsible for the OPGGS Act. In this time the senator did mention changes that were made in response to Montara. Some of those amendments at the time did confuse this issue. There was a loss of staff, apparently, and these errors occurred. Senator Siewert, I am sure you are not suggesting errors are not made by all of us at different times. This is unfortunate and regrettable, but the best way to deal with something that has gone wrong is to fix it as soon as you can. We are confident that these changes in this bill will help fix that issue, while still maintaining our world-leading environmental standards and regulations, including those on Commonwealth reserve areas.


Question agreed to.

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2016-02-24,"



Senator HEFFERNAN
 (New South Wales) (12:45):  I rise today for chapter 1 of what will take many hours. I recently have been given an order to produce documents to the McClellan Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse to justify my making a case to the royal commission, which is doing excellent work and is discovering things on the public record about the treatment of and behaviour towards children in our institutions—which a lot of us have known about for 50 years; most people have chosen to look the other way and ignore—that we have the same problem, I think, in the institution of the law as well as in the institutions of our churches et cetera. 


I was given an order to produce, and I produced, documents to justify my case to the McClellan royal commission. I have some of those documents here. The notations from the royal commissioner are on the documents. This one I am holding up here, for instance, asks, about boys picked up by judge so-and-so, 'Were they Marcellin College students?' This is a police intelligence document that says, 'A certain judge used to pick up boys in the toilets opposite Marcellin College.' That particular judge, by the way, gave a sentence of 'found guilty till the rising of the court' to a person who was charged with serious sexual offences. He also allowed a father who was abusing his foster children and whom he found guilty in a closed court, with names suppressed, to go back to the family home. That is that particular judge.


I want to make the case that there is clearly a need—and I intend to get a senior legal opinion—for the inclusion in the terms of reference for the royal commission, under 'institution', the institution of the law. We also need a federal judicial commission. In estimates the other day, the Attorney-General said we do not need a federal judicial commission because there is no endemic corruption in the federal law system. I said to him, 'Well, does that mean there is in New South Wales,' because New South Wales does have the very, very successful Judicial Commission of New South Wales, which does everything from educating judges on sentencing to being a speed camera in the system for this behaviour. Of course, I did not get a sensible response to that: 'It's a different jurisdiction,' et cetera.


Within the federal jurisdiction, I have pointed out the behaviour of one Dr Rikard-Bell, who has given 2,000 opinions as an expert to the Family Court. The Family Court system in Australia is broken. There are a lot of things that go on in there, with partners dividing and accusations of sexual misbehaviour within the family, especially the fathers. This guy, who has given 2,000 opinions as an expert to the court, says in an interview with the ABC, which I would like to table, that he has no real expertise. In fact, he was instructed by a man, Dr Richard Gardner—who has since suicided, by the way—that Dr Rikard-Bell recommends as an opinion maker, and who said: 


… the child has to be helped to appreciate that we have in our society an exaggeratedly punitive and moralistic attitude about adult-child sexual encounters …


This is the guy giving advice to Dr Rikard-Bell. This Dr Rikard-Bell insists on interviewing children in front of the offending fathers. How is that for intimidation? And so it goes on.


So there is a serious problem in the Family Court. I now have on my desk in my office a pile which is nearly a foot thick of correspondence from parents, especially mothers, who have been mistreated, as they see it, in the Family Court. I just think the Family Court needs sorting out, but I do not have time to go through the particular detail. 


I have here also police documents that every Attorney-General, from Philip Ruddock to now, has seen. The present Attorney-General has not been delivered these documents; he saw some of them in a Senate hearing in Melbourne, where I was not allowed to table them. This goes to why we need a federal judicial commission and why we should include the institution of the law in the terms of reference of the royal commission. This is a police document, from the Child Protection Enforcement Agency—I will not name anyone—to the Commissioner of Police New South Wales, with a date: 'The attached report relates to Justice'—the name is deleted—'who has emerged prominently during my investigations to date. Much of the information is hearsay and not capable of being sustained, but collectively it paints a disturbing picture of a senior member of the legal profession who may or may not have committed criminal offences but who certainly, in my view, is open to compromise,' which is the serious issue. It goes on: 'In the circumstances, I feel no alternative but to seek your permission to carry out a sustained surveillance operation against this target. I do not take this decision lightly in view of Justice'—deleted name's—'high profile, but I feel that based on similar evidence I would have little hesitation in carrying out such an operation against any other member of the public. For such reasons, I do not think that this particular person should be treated any differently, though I recognise the matter must be handled with acute sensitivity. I am of the view that such an investigation would serve a dual purpose. Primarily, it may provide evidence of criminal offences committed against young boys aged under 18. There is certainly strong suspicion of such activity. Secondly, it may yield evidence of inappropriate behaviour which, whether or not it constitutes a criminal offence, would leave the judge open to compromise and ought to be reported to the appropriate legal body'—very important words. It continues: 'Such consideration was singularly absent from the suspicion surrounding Justice Yeldham,' and I will name him, 'which consequently did not show either the police or the legal profession in a good light. I believe this action is defensible on those grounds alone. Subject to your approval, I intend to take personal command of the operation under the auspices of Strike Force Cori.'


I also raised in estimates the other day another police document, with a list of people. I am not going to name anyone on this list. I note that royal commissioner Justice Wood said he does not recall this document at the time, even though it is his document, signed off by Gary Crooke QC. It is addressed to the New South Wales Police Service and it is a list of alleged paedophiles. A person known to the commission compiled the list involving paedophilia. The list details his knowledge of activities—these are only allegations—and at the back there are surveillance issues.


To give an idea of the intensity of this: the first person on the list is a former Prime Minister; the second person is a political party heavyweight; the next person is a very senior business person; the next person is a senior judge; the next person is a Supreme Court master; the next person is Justice Yeldham, who, sadly, has passed away. He should not have suicided. Everyone knew what he was up to. The next guy on the list is a local court magistrate; the next guy is a former president of the Law Society; the next one is John Marsden, who has passed away; the next one is a judge, the guy who used to go to Marcellin College; the next guy is a QC; the next guy is a barrister; the next guy is a barrister; the next guy is a barrister; the next guy is a barrister; the next guy is a QC; the next guy is a barrister; the next guy is a QC; the next guy is a senior partner of a law firm; the next guy is a senior solicitor of a law firm; the next guy is a barrister's clerk—and so it goes on.


These are police documents. The Wood royal commission, in volume 4, said they were disturbed at the way files were mismanaged and the contents were lost. Sadly, I have a lot of the contents from the lost files and I have had them for some time. They were delivered to me on a bench in the botanic gardens. I think it is absolutely essential that we, the Australian people, give serious consideration to why we should have a judicial commission and why we should get the royal commission, which is doing a fantastic job, to include this in its terms of reference.


I have talked about Costello's, the boy brothel, and Porky's. Some of the people who attended those are noted here. The police were on the payroll. They would ring up Costello's, the boy brothel, and say, 'We're coming to raid you.' They were being paid. I can name the coppers that were getting the money. The police are seriously compromised. For someone like me, who has all this knowledge, even though you could get smashed for talking about—it would be derogatory—I do not think it would be responsible to not try and do something about it.


I have a police letter here saying that there was a guy who represented Philip Bell, a notorious paedophile, under a false name in court. I wrote to the police and said, 'Why haven't you arrested him?' They said: 'It's only evidence from the royal commission. We would have to have another investigation. Evidence from the royal commission may not be admissible in a prosecution. We would have to have our own investigation.' I am advised the prosecution always retains a discretionary power not to proceed—in other words, a cover-up. This is a lawyer who represented—

The question was around shipments of radioactive waste from France that have since returned to Lucas Heights in Sydney.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the minister's failure to provide either answers or an explanation.


I would like to briefly take note of Senator Canavan's response. I thank him for that. I also understand that there has been a bit of churn in that portfolio, and maybe Mr Frydenberg has taken time to get his head across the issues. Nonetheless, these are immensely serious issues regarding the return of Australian obligated nuclear fuel or reprocessing wastes from nuclear reactor and research reactor operations here in Sydney from reprocessing plants in Europe and elsewhere. I do not propose to detain the chamber for long, but I think it does go to the bigger picture of what is occurring here. And Mr Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, apparently, rather than outright condemning and putting to rest propositions not just to import Australian obligated nuclear materials from overseas but also to turn outback South Australia into the world's radioactive waste dump—rather than putting Premier Weatherill in his box, in the public interest, and ruling out any proposition to do such a thing—is in fact entertaining the notion.




Senator Edwards:
  Absolute nonsense!




Senator LUDLAM:
  It is good that Senator Edwards is still here, because in some ways Senator Edwards has been leading the debate, and I acknowledge Senator Edwards's longstanding interest in this issue and the fact that he is leading the debate and has put quite a detailed submission to the South Australian royal commission led by Mr Scarce. I will make a couple of remarks on that basis before I close this afternoon. The fact is that Australia has for decades been unable to figure out how to handle the relatively small by international standards inventory of radioactive waste from our research reactor operations at Lucas Heights. I am not attempting to minimise the sheer volume or activity of the waste that is being generated in Australia, but compared to that which is produced by commercial nuclear reactor operations in countries around the world who went down the nuclear power path, Australia has a relatively small inventory of waste. It has waste from the 10 megawatt and then 20 megawatt research reactors that have operated in Sydney. Yet, look at the multi-decade rolling debacle of attempting to site this radioactive waste at some remote location in Australia. And compare that with the remarkable consistency of the Australian experience of trying to find somewhere to dump radioactive waste in jurisdictions overseas. Just to give one example—what is consistent between the Australian experience and the experience in the United States? It is that remote Aboriginal communities have been asked to bear the brunt of the world's and the nation's most dangerous categories of waste. And you have to wonder why it is. I asked ANSTO couple of years ago and their answers were surprisingly consistent with those contained in a promotional video by Pangea Resources that provoked debate in 1999 about the importing of radioactive spent fuel from overseas for dumping in Australia.


In fact Mr Scarce's royal commission uses very similar language as well. Why is it that the nuclear industry here and globally looks for high-isolation sites, stable geology, very deep groundwater with low movements, low seismic activity, distance from agricultural areas, distance from mineral resources and, most importantly, distance from population centres? Why is it that they seek such sites and then shortlist places like south-west South Africa, Mongolia or inland South Australia? Why is it that the nuclear industry looks for these remote high-isolation sites? The Scarce royal commission gives it away in one sense. For each facility, hypothetical facilities in this case, they propose, 'In these facilities the risk of the radionuclides migrating into the environment is managed by the geology in which the facility is situated, as well as its engineered barriers.' A little bit later, and I am reading from the executive summary here, it says, 'Each facility is sited in geological conditions that naturally limit the potential pathways for migration.' What is that code for, colleagues? It is that the engineered containment will fail, and when the engineered containment fails and the facility begins to leak they want to be as far from it as possible. They want that stable geology so that when their radioactive waste dump leaks it is a long way from them. That was in the Pangea video, and I thought that was a remarkable moment of honesty.


I had a similar moment of honesty from ANSTO at a Senate committee hearing a couple of years ago. Here it is again in the royal commission's findings—'Geological containment: when our waste dump leaks we want it to be out there in the middle of nowhere.' As those proponents from the Howard government and then Minister Martin Ferguson and more recently, Mr Ian Macfarlane, discovered when they prosecuted their case, going back to Senator Minchin, but particularly from the Muckaty experience, when you try to dump this material in the middle of nowhere you find people speaking up for that country. You find people who have occupied that country for tens of thousands of years, who put very strongly that they are not in 'the middle of nowhere'. In fact, if it is so dangerous that it needs to be moved as far from human habitation as possible then dumping it on an Aboriginal outstation or a cattle station in the Barkly region is in fact totally inappropriate. No wonder the people at the six sites around the country are discovering, now responsibility for this issue has passed to Minister Frydenberg, that people do not want this stuff. And it is very easy to understand why not. If it is so urgent to move the stuff from Lucas Heights because it is unsafe, how can you then make the case to the local people who you are asking to host this material that it is suddenly safe?


Senator Edwards has upped the ante on the debate somewhat by going even further than Mr Scarce has done in his South Australian royal commission—which, by the way, effectively pronounced the uranium industry moribund, correctly. It pronounced the global nuclear power industry moribund, correctly, and it correctly acknowledged that there were simply no possibility of a commercial nuclear power industry getting on its feet any time soon in Australia. It pronounced correctly that the reprocessing market is overdone and that there is no market for fuel enrichment in this country. Nevertheless, it left the door open for the import of spent fuel.


Is there a market for spent fuel that would allow you to adequately figure out what kind of price we could get for importing this poisonous material from jurisdictions overseas? No, there is not, so in the absence of a market and in the absence of any kind of international experience around price they have just made up some numbers. They made numbers up, and they have no idea what kind of revenues you could get from hosting international nuclear waste. They ended up with half a trillion dollars. How on earth do you arrive at a figure like half a trillion dollars, from various other countries putting this stuff on ships and it somehow magically arriving in outback South Australia? How do you get a number like that? The way that they did it was by saying you get $5 billion in annual revenues every year for the first 30 years. They just made that figure up by inventing a per tonne figure and then rounding up. And with 390,000 tonnes of spent fuel around the world, you end up with 60-odd thousand tonnes of the material landing in outback South Australia. Then you put the profit in a sovereign wealth fund, and over 120 years or so you will end up with this imaginary half trillion dollar figure. Senator Edwards has then leveraged these ideas and gone even further and said, 'What if we took 4,000 tonnes of that material and fed it into imaginary prism reactors that do not exist, and will not exist until at the earliest 2040?'




Senator Edwards:
  That's not true.




Senator LUDLAM:
  Senator Edwards might want to enlighten us either now or at another time on what he proposes happen to the other 56,000 tonnes, because we have no idea. Apparently it is just left in some kind of outdoor car park in remote South Australia, sitting on the surface. The costs of a secure, dedicated port are not included. The costs of a dedicated rail corridor to inland South Australia are not included. The costs of the radical increases in security that you would need to safeguard this material from mishandling or misadventure are not included. The cost of safeguarding it for 300,000 years is not included. The costs of dropping it a mile below the desert in South Australia in 100 years time are not included.


How on earth has the debate come to this, where the best the major parties appear to be able to offer up for the people of South Australia as the economy slowly caves in is hosting the world's radiotoxic waste? How on earth has it come to this?


This parliament and the South Australian parliament should have ruled this out. Mr Scarce has done us something of a favour. I must admit that I was a sceptic. I did not think that using a royal commission for something like this was the right vehicle to do some taxpayer funded industry research. Nonetheless, they have come back and said: 'The industry is stuffed. It's barely viable, but why don't we—on the basis of completely imaginary fabricated economics—take the world's most lethal garbage and stick it in a parking lot out the back of South Australia?' Instead of repudiating that proposal, Mr Shorten is entertaining it. Mr Weatherill is entertaining it. Mr Turnbull is entertaining it. This debate should have been closed at the point at which the industry admitted that the reason it wants remote sites is that its engineered containment barriers will leak.


Surely we can do better than that for the people of South Australia. I look forward to getting some answers from the minister on the questions that I have raised.

Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (15:16):  I rise to speak on the motion of Senator Ludlam, and of course it behoves me to refute most of the issues which Senator Ludlam has raised. I understand that Senator Ludlam is ideologically opposed to this industry. It is what his brand is built on. It is what his trademark is. And his very small percentage of followers in the world who subscribe to his beatnik politics would subscribe to it. I do not know where you have been locked into, Senator Ludlam, but there is no higher inquiring authority in this land than a royal commission. To completely denigrate the findings of a royal commission, with the resources it has, in the way you have in the 12 minutes that I heard you speak is somewhat abusing the whole way in which our democracy and this government are run. You tell me a higher authority than a royal commission. I would be very interested.




Senator Brandis:
  The parliament.




Senator EDWARDS:
  There is the parliament. You can come to the parliament and you can debate this, which you are.


I will put what I know on the record. The suggestion and your inflammatory language, which is flowery and purposeful, about 'putting waste in a car park out the back of South Australia' just put your intellectual rigour which you have applied to this in perspective. You have not applied it. Have you actually read—and I would love an indication; I will take your interjection—my submission to the royal commission from cover to cover?




Senator Ludlam:
  Yes, you provided me a copy not that long ago.




Senator EDWARDS:
  Yes. Have you read it, Senator?




Senator Ludlam:
  No, not cover to cover.




Senator EDWARDS:
  So you have not read it. Through you, Deputy President, I would inquire whether Senator Ludlam read the full findings of the royal commission before his contribution today.




Senator Ludlam:
  I've read their summaries that they provided.




Senator EDWARDS:
  Oh, you have read the summary. I have read every word of the royal commission preliminary findings, and I found them to be quite encouraging. What we have now is a report on the table. Senator Ludlam and his assertions—the Greens political party can make a submission to the royal commission and put their contentions, and they can refute the facts of that royal commission that they believe are non-factual. They can tear down the findings of the royal commission, like Senator Ludlam has attempted to do in this chamber today.


He can do his own economic modelling. Senator Ludlam can do his. I have done mine. Mine also is vindicated by the findings of the royal commission. I had my paper peer reviewed around the world by a dozen different groups, scientific and economic. I am wondering whether Senator Ludlam has brought the same intellectual rigour to his submission here today in this chamber. I suspect not. I suspect the royal commission have also had their findings tested by eminent scientists and by people who have a background in economics, unlike what he has here today.


Also, there is this whole sense of fearmongering that goes with the contribution that was made by Senator Ludlam, whose trademark is opposing any progression in this area. He is now conflating the issues of low-level medical waste—medical waste which will come about as a result of one in two people in this country having an interaction with oncology services in this country. What we are doing by pulling these two together is subscribing to the Greens' fear and loathing of this whole policy position, which I suspect that in their heart of hearts they do not really believe, but they are so entrenched in this policy now that they cannot step away from it. They are so entrenched in it that they cannot stop it. Even the eight per cent of people who might vote for them around this country—



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator EDWARDS:
  They are just dogmatists in this whole debate. They just cannot move, because they think that if they do they will give up part of their branding.


What do we do then with all of the nuclear medical waste which is stored in 100 sites around this country? Just leave it in the basements of hospitals, shall we? Shall we not take it into a managed, controlled space where we can responsibly handle this? Your inflammatory language of, 'Oh, we'll put it in a car park out the back of South Australia,' demeans you, and it demeans the mentality of the debate which we are supposed to be having.


We are talking about a world-class arrangement, and Australia has been rated No. 1 in terms of regulation and governance of its nuclear facility. You heard that yourself, Senator Ludlam, at the last estimates. We are No. 1—ANSTO, our facility; in regulation; and the way in which we operate our nuclear science technology. That is no mean feat. I want to let anybody listening to this contribution know that, of the G20 countries, Australia is only one of two that are not nuclear nations—us and Italy, and Italy will be going down that path very soon.




Senator Ludlam:
  No, they got out. They closed theirs down.




Senator EDWARDS:
  And now they are buying coal fired power. You failed to embrace the imperative in this. You claim to stand for zero carbon emissions. I ask the Greens political party: what is the only power source that will provide baseload energy to this country at an internationally competitive rate? There is only one answer, and it is nuclear power generation. I repeat: zero carbon emissions and the only thing that will provide the baseload energy. My home state of South Australia has the third highest power costs in the world. We are trying to invigorate that state. How on earth can we do that when we are competing with other countries that are nuclear countries? How are we ever going to be able to contemplate doing that?


The royal commission could not have been more unequivocal in leaving the door open. The royal commission was not an entrepreneurial vehicle. That is my job. My job is to provide government with an option to provide nuclear power and to speak to the countries that will become customers of this country. We are geographically placed on an island in a part of the world that is geologically stable and geopolitically stable. That combination, Senator Ludlam, puts us in the best position in the world to take advantage of this most lucrative opportunity. You deny the people of South Australia through your scaremongering, your fear and loathing, your politics of envy or whatever you want to call it. It is scientific bluster because you have not put one bit of evidence on the table that suggests that the royal commission is wrong in saying that the risks are manageable. With the record that we have, Senator Ludlam, you are doing this country a great disservice when you denigrate our science capacity—CSIRO, ANSTO and everything like that. I cannot wait to see the scientists front up at the next budget estimates to take your questions. 


You are out of your depth. You should spend some time in this place. You should go around the world. You should go into these places. These facilities are pristine in every respect—the way they are governed, the way they are regulated and the way they are operated. But you have not, Senator Ludlam, because you will not. Lucas Heights will accept a visit from any of you at any point in time. What do you have against saving people's lives? What do you want to sustain? There are 100 sites around this country holding medical waste, and all we want to do is put that in a safe container.


Senator Ludlam said that we are going to put nuclear waste in canisters that are going to leak. That implies to everybody listening that nuclear waste has leaked. I ask Senator Ludlam to come up with proof that nuclear waste storage around the world has at any time ever leaked. You provide that information to the royal commission. You flesh out your scientific evidence for why your contribution previous to mine is credible in any way, shape or form. It is not. We just heard scaremongering in that contribution. That was the most profoundly irresponsible contribution I have ever heard Senator Ludlam make in this debate.


There are no voices of science or of economics that have come out since those royal commission preliminary findings. This has suffered scrutiny all over the world. Everybody in the science world and in the nuclear science world is interested in this. If there were one flaw in the science or one flaw in the economics, don't you think we would have heard about it already? All we have is the Australia Institute, who are employed by the South Australian Conservation Foundation, saying, 'Maybe this was a stitch up from the start.' That was the only voice we had heard until today when we have had this. I encourage every scientist and every person involved in nuclear science that understands the economics of nuclear science and what it can do for this country to take Senator Ludlam's contribution, pick it apart and copy me in on the email of where he has gone wrong, where he is not right and why he should come back into this chamber and address the contentions he has made.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2016-02-24,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:28):  What a wonderful speech by a serious adult and effective senator from South Australia. Senator Edwards, I congratulate you on that and thank you for putting some clarity into a debate that I and I suspect other senators might have needed. I will not keep the Senate long. For as long as the Greens continue this process of having a debate other than taking note of answers I intend to contribute as well.


I want to alert the Greens political party to what is happening in Europe. You would probably be aware that after Fukushima the German government, quite curiously I thought, started cutting down on their nuclear power. Instead, they just brought it across the border from France. Nevertheless, it gave the Greens equivalents in Germany some comfort that Germany was no longer using nuclear power—they were just buying it from France across the border!


So I am sure Senator Ludlam would have been happy about that.


But, of course, the hypocrisy of the Greens political party again comes to the fore, because Senator Ludlam would probably be aware—and if he is not he should look into this—that Germany is now building one of the biggest coal-fired power stations anywhere in the world. So here are the Greens. They do not want nuclear power, but what is replacing it? The largest coal-fired power station in the world, being constructed in Germany. So where is the Greens policy consistency on that? Yes, get rid of uranium and nuclear power but encourage coal-fired power stations. I am glad that Germany is going that way.


Similarly with China, I was at a presentation earlier today where it was stated that there are literally hundreds and hundreds of coal-fired power stations being constructed in China at the moment. They are mostly using the cleaner coal that Australia produces, and because of that the lessening of the CO2 emissions from these coal-fired power stations is very considerable. I might add—and I will give Senator Ludlam the statistics shortly—that the amount of reduction in CO2 from all the European emissions trading schemes is infinitesimal compared to the reduction in CO2 emissions from these clean coal power stations in China and elsewhere in Asia.


So again I thank Senator Edwards for clarifying that. I add to the debate again just to highlight—if any highlighting is necessary—the Greens' complete hypocrisy in their approach to issues of energy.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2016-02-24,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (15:32):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators Wong and Dastyari today relating to negative gearing and to the Safe Schools program.


What an incredible time to be alive! What an exciting time to be alive! We had the Assistant Treasurer this morning appear on the Sunrise program. Boy, what a performance that was! With this government, you get it all. Property prices are apparently going to both go up and go down as part of the government's new scare campaign about Labor's negative gearing policy. It is bring your own scare campaign day at the Australian parliament. Anything goes. Any plan goes. Any fear goes. Any scaremongering will work. At the same time, simultaneously, we are going to have a policy that is going to both make houses unaffordable and make everyone poorer by reducing the value of their home.


Frankly, if you want to run a scare campaign—I do not know if I should be telling the government how to do this—pick a side. Make one decision. Clearly the Assistant Treasurer was not at the meeting at the Liberal Party head office when they decided which scare campaign they were going to run, or she had an earlier memo. But you have to pick a side. You have to pick one scare campaign and just stick with it.


I have to say I was wrong about the Prime Minister. I have been wrong about Mr Turnbull. I thought Mr Turnbull was this brilliant Bond villain and was going to be some kind of evil genius. It turns out the Prime Minister is Dr Evil. We all thought he was this genius with this secret plan. It turns out the Prime Minister has no idea what he is doing and that he is just making it up as he goes along.


The fact is that Australians already have spent a long time watching a group of out-of-town, born-to-rule types lounge around without any real idea of what they are doing next. At least Downton Abbey had a plotline. This government does not even have a plotline. It does not have an agenda. It does not have a point. What you have is a government running around in circles. There is no policy. There is no initiative. There is only a handful of tactics, and even the tactics are not very good. It is a scare campaign a week. It is bring your own scare campaign day. It is a government that is already falling apart at the seams, and its internals are ripping it apart.


You have seen the chaos where you have the education minister and the VET minister talk about this fantastic program, the Safe Schools Coalition, and then you turn around and you have the Prime Minister getting browbeaten by Senator Bernardi into starting to abandon it. It is chaos. It is madness. It is government in disarray. This is a government that is more chaotic than Kanye West's Twitter feed. This government has descended into an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. It is a bunch of super-rich people—all of whom, I may add, seem to think they are more attractive than they actually are—sitting around doing nothing and pretending that somehow that is a real job. It is not. They have a responsibility. They are not meeting it. The only thing we need to top off the insanity that has become this government is Scott Morrison tweeting Mark Zuckerberg and asking for a billion dollars so that he can produce a budget. It has gone mad. It has gone crazy. This government has started to all apart.


Frankly, when you have a good policy proposal and you put up a good idea, a big idea, like the idea around negative gearing, what you get is a scare campaign. Let's be clear. What is going on here is that this is a desperate government. It is a lost government. It is a hopeless government, and it does not actually have a solution to what is going on in the housing market. A Saturday morning in Sydney is like The Hunger Games. A bunch of young families are going out there, battling each other, trying to get into the housing market and buy their first home, and it is becoming harder and harder for them to do that. And why is it harder? Because you have government incentives that are about the investors. An investor getting their seventh property should not have more incentives or financial benefits to do it than someone trying to buy their first home. You have the Prime Minister sitting in the Capitol like President Snow in The Hunger Games, just saying: 'Oh, all hell will break loose. There will be havoc. There will be madness if we address some of these problems.' It is a joke. It is a fraud. This government is falling apart. (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2016-02-24,"



Senator ABETZ

 (Tasmania) (15:37):  The simple fact is the Labor Party chewed off far more than it could swallow in relation to its so-called negative gearing policy. Just a few facts: 840,000 Australians earning less than $80,000 per annum invest and negatively gear. They are not the filthy rich to whom Senator Dastyari refers. Indeed, 73 per cent of Australians who negatively gear have only one house investment. Another 18 per cent have only two houses. In other words, 91 per cent of our fellow Australians who negatively gear have a maximum of two houses. So where is this assertion of seven properties being owned? That might be by a very small proportion of nine per cent.


What the Australian Labor Party will not tell you is that out of the people who negatively gear 39,500 are nurses, 53,800 are teachers and 52,000 are retail workers. Why doesn't the trade union movement support these workers? No wonder the trade union movement is losing numbers and supporters day after day, because the Labor Party and the trade union movement simply cannot understand that there are good, hardworking Australians who are aspirational and who are willing to take short-term pain for longer-term gain for themselves. What this is by Labor is a mad rush for tax revenue today on the basis of greater welfare payments in the future and less tax revenue in the future, because the construction sector will not be as vibrant. This is typical of Labor's short-term politics: trying to rake in the money today and forget about tomorrow. Exactly what they did with Gonski. Exactly what they did in their previous term of government. They have no memory of the disaster that they left behind. It is as though they did no wrong in the last six years when they were in government.


In my home state of Tasmania, a state with some of the lowest incomes in the country, 18,000 of our fellow Tasmanians are involved in negative gearing. They are not the filthy rich. They are just hardworking decent Australians who are saying: 'We will forego lifestyle today for the benefit of self-reliance and self-sufficiency in the future. We will take the burden off the next generation when we get to retirement.' Let's not forget that the Australian Labor Party fiddled with this in the past. In the Hawke/Keating era they thought this was a bright idea and they abolished negative gearing. This has been part of our taxation regime for over 100 years but for that little hiatus when Labor experimented, and what did they find? If people could not negatively gear and have their gain later on, then what did the property owners do? They immediately jacked up rents, and what did that do? The low-income earners who rely on rental properties were confronted by huge rental hikes and as a result the Labor Party, quite properly, retreated, as they should have done.


They learnt their lesson in the Hawke/Keating era but what does Mr Shorten do but dust off a failed policy. Having promised us that 2015 would be the year of ideas for Labor, they came up with nought. He starts off 2016 with the dusted-off, old Labor policy that was absolutely repudiated by the real experience of getting rid of negative gearing. This is the politics of class envy. This is the politics of class warfare. This is the politics of division. This is the politics of seeking to ensure that the aspirational are stifled. We as a coalition support the aspirational.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2016-02-24,"



Senator SINGH

 (Tasmania) (15:42):  We know that the far-right of the government are the ones who are in control today. We know that Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister, has no control over the government that he leads. In fact, it is the Cory Bernardis of this world who are running the show, because the Prime Minister, in requesting an investigation into a program helping LGBTI students, is showing his true colours. They are not the colours of tolerance, they are not the colours of inclusiveness and they are not the colours of diversity. They are the colours of supporting right-wing ideology—that of Cory Bernard, which we know is incredibly homophobic because he has made that very clear on so many fronts before.


Yet when my colleague Senator Dastyari asked Senator Brandis, the Leader of the Government in this place, whether he agreed that the Safe Schools program has perfectly reasonable objectives, as Senator Birmingham has said, he said yes. When again he was asked if he agreed with Senator Ryan, who said when launching the Safe Schools Coalition that 'every student has a right to feel safe at school', he also agreed. On the one hand you have the Leader of Government here in the Senate agreeing to the basis of the Safe Schools program and the Prime Minister of the day doing something completely different and completely undermining it.


Where are we at? Who are we to believe? Are we to believe Senator Brandis or are we to believe the Prime Minister? Are we to believe Senator Bernardi or are we to believe Senator Scott Ryan? They are all over the place. Who is to know who and is to believe what? The Australian people are completely confused on what this government is about and it is not just in the space of looking at this particular program; however, I highlight this program because it is an absolute disgrace what this government and this Prime Minister has done by wanting to have an investigation. If you want to have an investigation, why not have it on something that actually needs it and on something important?


This program is doing its job effectively. The Safe Schools Coalition Australia's government website makes that very clear. It says that almost 500 schools have opted into the program and more than 15,000 teachers have accessed its tools and resources. It is doing its job. It is the only program of its kind in this country. Yes, it was set up by a Labor government. It is doing its job to break down intolerance of diversity in our schools and provide support to end bullying and victimisation as needed.



Senator Bushby interjecting—




Senator SINGH:
  What is needed, if we are going to have investigations—and Senator Bushby would be well aware of this as a motion on this went through this place this week having been moved by me and Senator Nick McKim—is an investigation into Tasmania's wilderness World Heritage area. That is something that this government did not oppose. That is an investigation worth having—looking at the effects of climate change and global warming on wildfires in our wilderness World Heritage area. Why not invest your resources where they are needed rather than attacking an important program that is doing its job so effectively and so well? And, as I said, it was made very clear by Senator Ryan that every student has the right to feel safe at school and that is exactly what this program addresses. That is what he said at the launch of the Safe Schools Coalition back in 2014.


It is clear to me that the only reason why the Prime Minister would want to have an investigation into a very successful taxpayer funded program that is supporting LGBTI school students is to appease one person—or maybe a couple who are part of his cabal—and that is Senator Bernardi. Who is running this government? Is it the far right of the Liberal Party? Is it the Senator Bernardis of this world? Or is it the Prime Minister? No-one has any faith at the moment in the Prime Minister's ability to run this country. Everything that this government is doing is a shemozzle. It is all over the place. This investigation into the Safe Schools program is just another example of that. Labor will stand by this program. We will stand by the right of children to go to school and not be bullied and not be intimidated like this by Senator Bernardi. (Time expired)

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:47):  Labor members find it impossible to comprehend that in the coalition we actually have policy debates. We have meaningful discussions. We are not told by the union movement and the factional bosses, 'This is what you will do.' What did Senator Cameron famously say a few years ago? He talked about 'lobotomised zombies'. He said those opposite were not allowed to have any discussions in their party room, according to their bosses—which I take to be the union movements that run the Labor Party. If the leading unions say, 'This is the issue,' according to Senator Cameron, the lobotomised zombies are just not able to put a view or an argument that is in any way contrary.


Today we had in question time questions about capital gains tax. It is a bit like how for three or four weeks Labor and the ABC ran—I have to say, very cleverly—this 15 per cent GST campaign. As I always suspected, there was nothing in it from the government side, as Senator Cormann and others have said time and time again. In the coalition, we look at a broad policy range. We look at all aspects of areas on taxation matters—as we should. Some you land on and some you discard. That is what we do. We consult and we have these policy discussions both within the coalition parties themselves and with relevant and interested stakeholders. The capital gains tax furphy that Labor are now embarking upon, having lost the 15 per cent GST debate, is just like the GST debate. It is a figment of the Labor Party's imagination. They work on the basis that if you say it often enough and keep repeating it someone out there might actually think for a moment that the Labor Party are telling the truth. But as these things always show, as with the GST, these are just furphies and figments of the Labor Party's fertile mind.


The Labor Party have been looking seriously at a 15 per cent GST so that they can pay for some of their unfunded promises they have already announced for the next election I did not get the figures. Senator Cormann, was it $50 million—




Senator Cormann:
  Fifty billion dollars!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  There has been $50 billion worth of unfunded promises suggested by the Labor Party so far. One can only imagine that perhaps the Labor Party are looking at a 15 per cent GST to fund these $50 billion worth of unfunded promises already made. We have a few months to go until the election.


On the other issue that the previous senator was talking about, as I say, these are matters that are discussed maturely, in an adult fashion, by the coalition party room. When all people's views have been heard—the views of many others besides Senator Bernardi and from both sides of the equation—decisions will be made by an adult, mature government taking into account everything.


As Senator Brandis rightly said at question time, there would not be a person in this chamber who would in any way countenance anything but a campaign against bullying children or, indeed, anyone. Like Senator Ronaldson said, there is bullying of older people too. I think that is equally important. I declare an interest in that. Bullying in any form and in any category should not be encouraged. In fact, it should be stamped out as best it can. I am sorry that the Labor senators who have spoken do not seem to understand the real issues. I am pleased to be a member of a government that discusses these particular problems and issues in a mature way. (Time expired)

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2016-02-24,"



Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:52):  I too want to take note of the answer given by Senator Brandis to the question asked by Senator Dastyari about the Safe Schools program. That was an attempt by Senator Dastyari to find out the position of the Turnbull government on this really important program in our schools for our children—in particular, our children who are gender diverse. It is a program that is well accepted, has been running, has been successful and, until this week, had the support of the whole of this parliament. We know that Senators Birmingham and Ryan supported the program, but this week we have seen that the ultra right-wing cohort of the Turnbull government—especially Senator Bernardi and, today, Senator O'Sullivan—want to defund this program so that it ceases to exist. They have managed to convince the weak and pathetic Prime Minister Turnbull to exercise yet another backflip on policy. We are used to it in taxation and other issues like that, but in the matter of a social policy such as this one, which is so important to some of our children in our schools, you would think that Mr Turnbull would have shown some spine and stood up to those ultra right-wing homophobes in this place—as my leader, Bill Shorten, said this morning—who use every opportunity to denigrate and marginalise children, and Australians generally, who are gender diverse.


It is a very sad thing to come into this chamber and this parliament to hear this relentless attack against people. By doing this, all we do is contribute to the bullying of LGBTI persons in Australia and, in particular, children, who we know suffer terribly from bullying because they are not attracted to persons of the other sex. We have seen the Turnbull government kowtow to the hard right when it comes to marriage equality and insist on having a ridiculous plebiscite which is not even going to be binding. That is one thing, but this particular program—the Safe Schools program—is directed at young people. We know that, from a university survey of over 3,000 Australian LGBTIQ young people aged between 14 and 21, more than 60 per cent reported having experienced homophobic abuse. Over 18 per cent reported physical homophobic abuse, and a further 26 per cent reported being victims of other homophobic abuse, including rumours, graffiti and cyberbullying. We also know that 80 per cent of this abuse of our children occurs at school.


When the Labor government introduced the Safe Schools program, it was to target that unrelenting attack on our children. We know that these children are the ones who are most likely to suffer from anxiety and depression and who are three times more likely to attempt suicide. Surely, all of us in this place must do everything we can to prevent that happening to our children. It is a good initiative. It is implemented in schools by agreement of the schools. Parents are consulted about what is in this program. It is rolled out in schools with the sole purpose of making a school safe and free from bullying for all children. There are 495 government and private schools, including Christian schools, across the country educating 400,000 of our children. This particular program has a very strong track record.


I am very tired of what goes on in this chamber with regard to the abuse of people who are gender diverse or same-sex attracted. I am tired of the people who send me emails which are vile and homophobic as well. I can tell these people that I am harvesting all of your email addresses, and I will go back to you every time a gender diverse or same-sex attracted student in our schools harms themselves because of your attitude towards them. I am going to send you an email and tell you about it because I am fed up with having to put up with your abuse of our young people. (Time expired)

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2016-02-24,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:40):  At the request of Senator Siewert, I move:


That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:


The need for immediate action on political donations reform, to address the corrupting influence of political donations, including from property developers and fossil fuel companies.


There is systematic failure in the electoral funding system in Australia today. It breeds corruption and it must change. Electoral funding laws are broken. They are broken because they do not work. They do not work for the community and they are deeply damaging to our democracy. They do not work because large donations can be disguised. They can be disguised by a whole range of methods that further undermine the public's confidence. They are also not working because of inconsistencies in disclosure. Transparency is not working. You cannot say that there is transparency when there is such deep inconsistency, often in the order of hundreds of thousands of dollars, between the disclosure of companies and the disclosure of the parties and the candidates who received the money. The result is that the big donors—powerful players—are perceived to buy influence. Sometimes they appear to buy influence, and that perception is damaging our democracy. It certainly encourages the notion that politicians are for sale.


The public deserve honesty. They deserve honesty in terms of how our funding laws work. Again, the culture is one of dishonesty. It is dishonest because so much is not disclosed, and what is disclosed barely helps inform the public and those who are trying to understand how the current system works. This has been identified very clearly by Transparency International. In a very important report into political funding that they released in 2015, they found:


Australia’s high disclosure threshold on financial contributions to political campaigns means that loopholes can be easily abused.


Those loopholes exist because of a number of factors. One very big one is that, at the moment, you do not have to disclose that you are giving money at a federal level if your donation is under $12,800. But you can give that $12,800 in every state and territory. Multiply that amount eight times and it comes to about $100,000 that you can give without disclosing it. 


Our system is also broken because there really is no comeback for people who do the wrong thing. The AEC has not prosecuted anyone under the AEC laws on electoral funding over the past seven years. We can also see how serious this is from a lot of the incidents that were exposed in New South Wales at the Independent Commission Against Corruption, our New South Wales corruption watchdog. Often when I have spoken on this issue people say: 'That is a New South Wales problem. We do not have it at a federal level.' We do not know what we have at a federal level because we do not have a commission to expose it. That is the essence of it, and that is why the New South Wales ICAC has done such an outstanding job. 


It is worth sharing some of the examples. They are very worrying. There was a sham company called Eightbyfive. It was run by Tim Koelma, a former staffer of Liberal Party minister Chris Hartcher. He issued false invoices for consulting services to disguise donations. In that period about $400,000 came to the Liberal Party. The Free Enterprise Foundation launders—




Senator Heffernan:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: the Liberal Party pinged him.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Williams
):  There is no point of order.




Senator RHIANNON:
  Then there is the Free Enterprise Foundation—and I do not think this one has been pinged—where we again have the laundering of illegal donations. It has been reported that Paul Nicolaou, the former New South Wales Liberal chief fundraiser, appears to have come up with the idea of exploiting a loophole so that banned developer donations could be accepted by funnelling them through the federal branch. Westfield gives $150,000; Brickworks, $125,000; and the Walker Group, $100,000. Again, this is exploiting loopholes when we had worked to really clean up the laws in New South Wales with regard to electoral funding. There are so many ways in which this deeply undermines the confidence that people have in the political process. It damages not just those who are involved in these scams but all political parties—the very institutions that we work in and all members of parliament, because people become deeply cynical about how the political process works. 


I would like to refer senators to a very important High Court case—it is very relevant to this debate—where the court identified how serious the problem of political donations was. They talk about corruption and that there are two forms of corruption. There is the quid pro quo corruption, as they refer to it, where money is directly handed over for a result—maybe a special development or a mining application. Then they talk about the more subtle kind of corruption where a culture develops whereby those who receive the money feel they need to accommodate that industry, and over time one finds that there is a weakening of the laws. So there is an urgent need to address the whole issue of the corrupting influence of political donations. It is deeply damaging to our political process, to our democracy, and it needs to change. 

",Senate,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Donations to Political Parties</title>,MATTERS OF URGENCY,16,1
"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2016-02-24,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:46):  I rise to address this matter of public importance because a lot of the assertions that have just been put forward by Senator Rhiannon are not actually borne out in fact. I would like to address this at a number of levels: firstly, why people make donations; secondly, the mechanisms put in place to provide transparency and accountability around those donations; and, thirdly, the practical outcome in terms of the decisions that are made, particularly at a federal level. I accept that there have been examples. In fact, in Sydney at the moment, with the Auburn council some very clear examples of a conflict of interest with property developments and the decision makers. That accusation has been made, and it appears as though there is a body of evidence to support it. But many of the decisions that are made by federal government do not go directly to property developers. So the three areas I would like to cover are those. 


In terms of the motivation, I have been involved with politics as a member of parliament and now as a senator since 2004. One of the things that struck me is that, whilst there are many people in the Australian community who do not get engaged in politics or, indeed, in the workings of the parliament—and I would have to say that I was one of those before I joined the Liberal Party in 2004 and became a member of parliament—there are some people who care deeply about the direction of this country. It is not about their personal interest. Many people who donate do not have business interests. Many people who have large business interests do not donate or seek to influence outcomes specifically for themselves, but they care about the philosophy of the people who are running the country. So, in this year, an election year, it should be no surprise that there are people in our country who are saying, 'Do we want more of the socialist compact between the Labor Party and the Greens that looks at having big government and that seeks to diminish individual responsibility and reward for effort and to be the nanny state dictating the distribution of other people's money, or do we want a government that actually provides incentive and opportunity and that encourages people and, indeed, allows people to be rewarded for innovation and excellence and hard work?' They are too quite distinct approaches to providing government. 


Many people say that there is not a lot of difference between the coalition and the Labor Party when it comes to politics, but at its heart the difference between the coalition and those on the opposite side is the view about the role of government in people's lives as opposed to individuals. And there are many people—businesses, corporations and private individuals—who feel passionately enough about wanting to see government in the flavour and character that suits their own ideology, but it is not about their individual interests; it is about the interests of the nation—and that is not just true for the coalition. If we have a look at the CFMEU and the donations they have made to both the Labor and the Greens, we see large amounts of money being donated—for example, here in the ACT, $50,000 from the CFMEU to the Greens party; and, in Victoria, $1.6 million from the unions to the state Labor Party. Why? Because clearly people on the left of politics—and many people in the unions are in that position—want to see a government run by the Labor Party. That is their right. They have every right to raise money to increase the opportunity of people from that political party getting their message out. Unlike the accusation from Senator Rhiannon, that is not corruption; it is actually about engaging in the political process and trying to provide the opportunity for political parties to make their point. 


So my first rebuttal of the urgency motion that has been put forward by Senator Rhiannon today is around the issue of motivation. I would argue that certainly in my experience people who provide donations to political parties, whether they be unions, individuals or corporations, do so because they believe in the values of the party that they are donating to. There are others whom I have seen donate to both major political parties and, in fact, to the Greens sometimes. This is because they believe that the system of government we have here is worth supporting. They recognise that it is expensive to run campaigns, it is expensive to communicate with people, and they provide that funding. 


Australia rates very well on any international scale in terms of transparency and lack of corruption. Part of the reason for that is that we have good governance in place and the Australian Electoral Commission has very clear procedures around people who have donated. They need to disclose names, who it was donated to and amounts. So we see that there are procedures in place for that. In fact, one of the things that Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters looks at often is this very issue around funding for electoral campaigns and whether or not there should be more federal funding or there should be bans on fundraising. It has even been proposed previously that there should be bans on fundraising so that people do not have to pay for TV advertising. In fact, once there was a proposal put forward in legislation to ban TV advertising in the lead-up to, and through, the election. That was struck down by the High Court. Why was that struck down? Because the High Court recognised that, constitutionally, there is an implied freedom of speech that says that as we approach an election the people who are seeking to stand for election must be free to communicate with the public, put forward their ideology and their policies, and build the case as to why people should be voting for them. 


We do not only have the transparency of the Australian Electoral Commission and all of the reporting and disclosure that goes with that. We also have decisions of people like the High Court and reports from people like the electoral matters committee, who have looked at electoral funding and decided that not only do we have systems to keep it transparent and to keep corruption out of it but that, importantly, constitutionally it is an essential part of our democratic system, for our people to have free speech and to put forward the case to the elector as to why they should be in public office and help form the government. 


So my first and foremost rebuttal is motivation, and we see that that is above the board for people who donate. Second is around the fact that any donations that are given are part of a transparent system. The third part I come to is in the order of influence. There is an accusation when you talk about corruption that decisions are being bought. I certainly know that people supported my campaign when I was running as the member for Wakefield. But, as a back-bench member, I was not directly making decisions. Those decisions were made by ministers, with all the probity of departments that goes into that. 


One of the things that I have often advocated to people who want to talk to the government is that the committee system of the parliament is the place to come and make their case if they want to see changes in policy. The committee system is open, it is on the public record and it is transparent. On any given policy area, as legislation comes through—particularly in the Senate with the legislation committees or the references committees—the committees are the place where they can come and make their case and there is absolutely no way that you can make accusations of things like corruption. 


So I completely refute the basis of the urgency motion that has come forward today. No matter which way you look at it, at a federal level people like property developers just do not come into the equation of our decision making. In terms of the transparency and the system, there are mechanisms in place that have been upheld through multiple reviews as well as by the AEC, a completely independent commission who look after our electoral system. As I said, there are people, corporations, and organisations such as unions who want to see people elected who will govern the country in the way that they believe is good for the country's interest, and they are prepared to donate money to allow them to communicate. That basic premise has been upheld by the High Court, who said that the implied freedom of speech required through the Constitution means that that kind of funding needs to be able to continue.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:56):  What a great opportunity it is to speak today to demonstrate the complete hypocrisy and the complete cowardice of the Greens party. They have gone from being a claimed party of principle to a party that is more interested in maximising the number of Green bums on Senate seats. That is what is going on in this chamber today. The Greens are so embarrassed by their filthy deal with the government to eradicate all voices on the cross benches of the chamber other than their own. They have entered into a filthy deal with the government. 


Let me read to you from the constitutional reform and democracy platform of the Greens. Under 'Principles' it states:


4. The Constitution should express our aspirations as a community and define our rights and responsibilities …


5. Parliament is the central authority of representative and responsible government.


And here is the cracker:


6. The composition of Parliament should reflect the diversity of opinion within society.


Well, tell me this: how can you live up to that principle of your policy when you are introducing a system that you know is absolutely about eliminating the votes of 25 per cent of Australian voters, who did not vote for us, who did not vote for the coalition and who did not vote for you or Senator Xenophon? Twenty-five per cent of voters are going to be excluded. 


I want to thank my colleague Gary Gray for circulating this document, because if any document circulated by Gary Gray recently demonstrates what is really going on in this debate, this document does it. Tragically, it does not support Gary's own arguments, but I suspect he did not bother to read too much of it. It says 'Australian voters have spent over 30 years voting 1 above the line, and it does seem reasonable to assume that many people will continue to do so.' What you are introducing is a first-past-the-post voting system, and you are legalising it. You may be happy with that, but let us go to why. This document is the analysis from the Parliamentary Library circulated by Gary Gray, who thinks it supports his arguments. It goes on to say: 'The obvious way to approximate the new system is to first look at how many quotas are achieved by each party as a primary vote. This will indicate how many seats the party is guaranteed to win and may account for four or five of the six vacancies at a normal half Senate election. The remaining seats will be determined either by preference flows or by whichever party has the largest remainder after the full quota is allocated to elected candidates.' Here is the scam: according to the Parliamentary Library, the only parties that could be reasonably expected to transfer preferences at sufficient numbers to elect another candidate are the larger parties—the Liberals, the Nationals, the Labor Party and those down in that corner, the Greens.


The Parliamentary Library has belled the cat. The Greens have done a deal to breach their own constitution, their own principles that they set out. The only parties that could reasonably be expected to transfer their preferences in sufficient numbers to elect another candidate are the larger parties. It goes on to discuss 'the limitations of this approach,' because he has been asked to model this by Gary Gray: 'Whilst the 2013 Senate election is the most recent guide to the will of the voters it was unusual in a number of ways, which will not likely be replicated in future elections.' This is the Parliamentary Library's analysis—




Senator Rhiannon:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, a point of order on relevance: I certainly want the senator to expand on his current subject but also be relevant to the issue of donations.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  You are debating, Senator Rhiannon. At the moment I am happy with Senator Conroy's presentation.




Senator CONROY:
  I can understand why you don't want this read in the parliament. He says of the 2013 election: 'Most apparently the Palmer United Party and the Liberal Democrats won substantial votes and won Senate seats that they are not likely to be able to replicate in future elections'—my apologies, Senator Leyonhjelm; he does not realise the impact you have made, but that is what the Parliamentary Library said—'due to lost electoral support evident in recent polls and by-elections.'


He goes on to model it and, believe it or not, comes up with: 'The Palmer United Party are going to win a quota again.' Nobody on the planet believes that; even he does not believe that. He actually writes earlier that that is not the case. So what will happen to those votes in this system? We know what will happen. They will go back where they came from, mostly from the Liberal Party. If he is right about Senator Leyonhjelm they will probably return to the pretence of the Liberal Party called the Liberal Party. That is what this debate has always been about—Greens bums on seats. (Time expired)

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (17:01):  I thank the Greens Party for today's opportunity to talk about the need for urgent action on political donations. You ought to be congratulated, just like Goodman Fielder, the producers of my favourite margarine, MeadowLea. I enjoyed my MeadowLea on toast this morning, so allow me to also acknowledge George Weston Foods—good on you mum, Tip Top's the one.


The Liberal Democrats agree there needs to be urgent action on political donations. This can be achieved by sending cheques made out to us directly to PO Box 636, Drummoyne NSW 1470 or through our web page at ldp.org.au.


While enjoying my Nescafe coffee this morning—thank you, Nestle—I reflected upon the fact that at the last election Australians were forced to hand over $58 million to the greedy major parties. This paid for wasteful advertisements that drove us all crazy. Even the Greens produced enough junk mail to create a bare patch in the Amazon rainforest about the size of the ACT. That is why long-suffering taxpayers should welcome anything to ease this burden—donations given willingly by individuals and corporations. So long as this process is transparent it is something to be encouraged. The Liberal Democrats certainly encourage it, which is why we regularly check on the contents of PO Box 636 at Drummoyne NSW in the postcode 1470.


Speaking of transparency, the Liberal Democrats were proud to receive our first major corporate donation from Philip Morris International, in 2013. I do not recommend smoking but I do support the right of people to choose to smoke. I would like to thank Philip Morris for their generosity to my party and remind other tobacco companies, chop-chop merchants and smokers that we are still waiting for a donation from them. We also welcome all donations from developers and alcohol, gambling and mining companies.


As the Greens rightly point out, this is now a matter for urgent action. It can be addressed by sending a cheque made out to the Liberal Democrats at PO Box 636, Drummoyne NSW 1470. I must leave now to quench my hard earned thirst, for which I thank Carlton and United Breweries, a subsidiary of the Foster's Group.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2016-02-24,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:04):  I am pleased also to rise and speak to this motion which concerns itself with the allegedly corrupting influence of political donations. It seems that, in the eyes of some in this place, when it comes to political donations some donations are more corrupting than others. What is most interesting about this motion is what is not in it.


The motion appears to suggest that the 'corrupting influence' of donations pertains only to those 'from property developers and fossil fuel companies'. That is a ridiculous assertion. This government does not believe it is appropriate to create particular classes of citizens or professions and ban them from participating in the political process. So long as the rules are clear, the process is transparent and the rules are consistently applied, then our present regime for the disclosure of donations represents an appropriate balance between transparency and enabling Australians to participate in the political process.


I understand that some in this place have a certain world view—namely, that property developers and fossil fuel companies are engaged in some sort of Dickensian villainy on a massive scale. Clearly that is not a view I share, nor is it one shared by most sane Australians. But I would just mention, most especially to the Labor Party senators here this afternoon, whose Senate representatives have also been making contributions on this subject today, that if you want to have an ounce of credibility on this subject, it is important to start in your own backyard or, more accurately, in your own bank accounts. I would venture to suggest that if you spoke with most ordinary Australians and did a word association test putting to them the word 'corruption', the most likely response just now would not be 'developer' or 'fossil fuel company'; it would be 'union'. Eight weeks ago, we had the release—




Senator Lines:
  What an outrageous statement to make! What about the 500 Club in WA?




Senator SMITH:
  The best is yet to come, Senator Lines. The best is yet to come. Eight weeks ago, we had the release of the final report of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption. The report found a pattern of widespread pattern of corrupt and disturbing behaviour across Australia's trade union movement, with some of the most egregious examples occurring in my own state of Western Australia. I know that Senator Lines is here in the chamber.


The Labor Party and ACTU leadership have been at pains to suggest that what has been uncovered represents just a few bad apples. Well, the royal commissioner dismisses the notion in the introduction to his report.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  For those Labor senators who have not laboured over it, let me read what the royal commissioner had to say:


You can look at any unionised industry. You can look at any type of industrial union. You can select any period of time. You can take any rank of officeholder, from Secretaries down to very junior employees. You can search for any type of misbehaviour. You will find rich examples over the last 23 years in the Australian trade union movement.


He went on to say:


These aberrations cannot be regarded as isolated. They are not the work of a few rogue unions, or a few rogue officials. The misconduct exhibits great variety. It is widespread. It is deep-seated.


Yet when we look at the text of this particular motion, which is supposedly about the corrupting influence of political donations, do we find any reference to the corrupting influence of union donations? Of course we don't.


If debates such as these are going to have any credibility, we cannot just cherry pick particular types of donors. In particular, we can hardly leave out the unions, given what emerged during the Royal Commission. Bear in mind also that the royal commissioner said that what had been found through that process in relation to corruption was 'the small tip of an enormous iceberg'. The final report paints a picture of a disturbing culture. Let me quote again:


Whistleblowers are unlikely to be found for various reasons including a well-founded fear of reprisals. The same is true of misconduct on building sites and other aspects of the misbehaviour that has been revealed. The very existence of a Royal Commission tends to cause a temporary reduction in misconduct. But it is clear that in many parts of the world constituted by Australian trade union officials, there is room for louts, thugs, bullies, thieves, perjurers, those who threaten violence, errant fiduciaries and organisers of boycotts.


It is worth recalling that the movement being characterised here is the chief source of both funding and personnel for the Australian Labor Party—a party that paints itself as the alternative government in Australia. The movement funnelled almost $6.5 million to the Australian Labor Party in 2013-14. In fact it has been estimated that, over the last 10 years, union contributions to the Labor Party have been over $98 million. Two of the worst offenders when it comes to the corruption uncovered by the royal commission were the Construction, Forestry Mining and Energy Union and the Maritime Union of Australia. Of course, it is also proposed that those two unions, the CFMEU and the MUA, soon merge. They are to be joined together in unholy matrimony, two like-minded souls joining together to wreak havoc on the nation's industrial landscape. I just hope there are no awkward scenes or battles ahead between Labor parliamentarians about which one of them gets to serve in the wedding party. Certainly the Leader of the Opposition would hate to be included, but there are some Labor senators who faithfully troop into this chamber and earnestly read union authored talking points. I just hope they have not forgotten where those invitations have been issued.


Let's not forget that the royal commission also found multiple instances where the Australian Labor Party had failed to declare donations from trade unions, including an instance where the Leader of the Opposition himself failed to declare such a donation. So if we want to have a discussion about the corrupting influence of political donations, maybe we should start by looking at donations from unions which are themselves engaged in corrupt behaviour. Just this week we have seen more trouble with the CFMEU. The national secretary of that union, Michael O'Connor, was one of 13 officials who allegedly ran an illegal blockage campaign last year—that is, trying to prevent workers from going onto a site to do their job. The union officials are accused of obstructing trucks and subcontractors from going onto construction sites and calling them a variety of foul names—charming behaviour. But, again, as the final report of the royal commission says, these are not isolated instances. In fact, there are currently around 73 CFMEU representatives and officials before the courts around Australia.


What makes this week's report of particular concern, of course, is that Michael O'Connor is the brother of the opposition's industrial relations spokesperson in the other place, the member for Gorton. I am not one to get personal, but given all the hysteria we heard from those opposite about Commissioner Dyson Heydon's alleged conflicts, I would have thought that it was a much greater concern that, if those opposite win the election this year, the person in charge of dealing with union corruption will be the brother of someone who now stands accused of it. It is difficult to conceive of a greater conflict of interest, and I cannot understand why the Leader of the Opposition has not taken steps to deal with it.


The government believes that our present disclosure laws are working well. They are overseen by an independent body, the Australian Electoral Commission, and the details of donations are reported and accessible to members of the general public. Yes, the system relies on people and entities making honest disclosures about the donations they receive. Yet the most troubling evidence we have seen of noncompliance in recent times did not come from the property developers or from fossil fuel companies; it came from the Leader of the Australian Labor Party, who failed to disclose a $40,000 donation from his union mates. If we are going to have this debate, we need to start with those areas where the problem actually exists.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (17:13):  It is interesting to note that Senator Smith could not even get through his allocated time because his speaking notes from head office ran out. I want to deal with this urgency motion about the corrupting influence of political donations. This is a pretty typical of the Greens. A lot of public grandstanding, but political incompetence, is what we are seeing here from the Greens. They do a backroom deal with the Liberals and completely disenfranchise millions of Australian voters. They are denying individuals—that is, potential senators—the opportunity to do what Bob Brown did years ago, and that is actually get into parliament. That is what they are doing. They are denying people an opportunity to get into parliament. They have put their own narrow self-interest before democracy.


The Greens in this place are a real political soft touch. They are so naive when it comes to negotiating with this government. On carbon pricing, they gave the Libs what the Libs wanted. On multinational taxation, they gave the Liberal Party what they wanted. On electoral reform, they have given the Libs exactly what they want.



Senator Rhiannon interjecting—




Senator CAMERON:
  If you were actually serious, Senator Rhiannon, about dealing with a corrupt system, you would have said to the Liberal Party, 'Unless you deal with corruption in the system, we are not going to cave in to your agenda on electoral reform.' You would have actually stood up for what you claim is your principal position, and that is dealing with electoral donations. But you did not. You just caved in in an amateurish, naive way. You have disenfranchised millions of Australians.


What we heard from Senator Smith here was just pathetic. At least Senator Fawcett tried to deal with the issue in an intellectual way and did not just run the spin line and the lines that were put out by head office. If you want to know what is going on with any of their policies, you have to look at the Liberals' political donations. When it comes to the GST, they are from big business. That is where they get their donations. A lower corporations tax and higher executive salaries are being paid for every time an Australian goes to the supermarket. Where was that driven from? It was political donations to the Liberal Party from big business.


There have been political donations from developers and construction companies to drive out the right for workers to be able to collectively bargain effectively in the building and construction industry. On penalty rates, again, it is about big business transferring workers' wages to more profit. That is what you have to look at. You simply have to look at where the donations come from to the Liberal Party to understand what their political agenda is. On climate change, it was the miners driving the Liberal Party's political agenda. On negative gearing, it is the Property Council. We know exactly what is going on. On capital gains tax, it is the Property Council making donations to the Liberal Party. That is where the money is coming from, and that is where the Liberal Party's interests are. If you want to know what they are doing on policy, follow the money. That is how you will know what the Liberal Party are doing.


They run the argument that it is just about these bad unions putting money into the Labor Party. What about the Enterprise Foundation? What about the brown paper bag in the front of the Bentley up in Newcastle where there were party members picking up $10,000 in cash off property developers? Do not tell me there is no corruption coming through in the Liberal Party from property developers. What about the Platinum forum? What about Parakeelia Pty Ltd? What about the Liberal 500 Club?


When we win this next election—and we will—the first thing I will be doing in the Labor caucus is arguing for a royal commission into the corrupt behaviour of the Liberal Party and their donations. That would be the first cab off the rank.

"Madigan, Sen John",Ind.,2016-02-24,"



Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (17:18):  Last year I moved a motion to establish an inquiry into political donations. I did this because the current regulatory framework is profoundly inadequate. As it stands, there is no limit on the amount private donors can give to politicians. Nor are there restrictions on who can donate, leaving it open to gaming operators, alcohol and cigarette companies, property developers, miners, banks, environmental groups and anyone else interested in influencing the political system to throw money at politicians in the hope they will do possibly do their bidding.


I will state that the vast majority of donors—individuals, companies, unions et cetera—are ethical and reputable, but some may not be. Although we have disclosure laws, the current threshold of around $13,000 is absurdly high and the timing over which disclosures must be made is way too slow. Furthermore, there are numerous loopholes allowing political parties and their benefactors to avoid disclosure. The outcome is a political system in which almost all players are funded by a combination of big business, unions, activist groups and a few wealthy Australians—that is, by sectional interests.


To think major donors may expect nothing in return is possibly naive. At the very least, they expect to have the ear of politicians. Ultimately, they are seeking influence over political decision making. This is plainly undemocratic. It renders what should be government for the people and by the people something else. Australians deserve transparency, not trials by innuendo about alleged behaviour. As the High Court observed recently, it compromises the expectation fundamental to representative democracy that public power will be exercised in the public interest. It is corruption of the political process, pure and simple.


As a result, the people we represent are rapidly losing confidence in our capacity to improve their lives. They think we have been bought. In 2014, the Lowy Institute found less than two-thirds of Australians and less than half of 18- to 29 year-olds thought democracy was 'preferable to any other form of government'. Furthermore, nearly a quarter of young people thought that 'in some circumstances, a non-democratic government can be preferable'. When asked why they did not see democracy as the preferable form of government, more than two-fifths said this was because 'democracy only serves the interests of a few and not the majority of society'. In a system that derives its legitimacy from the will of the people, this trend, if left unchecked, is an existential threat. Despite this, federal politicians have repeatedly failed to put a stop to this cancer on our democracy. Unfortunately, here, the fox is in charge of the hen house.


There is some hope for change. Sufficient numbers of my fellow senators voted to pass the motion I moved last year establishing an inquiry into political donations. The inquiry was referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, where it remains. However, to date, JSCEM has failed to call for submissions on the critical aspects of the inquiry it was commissioned to undertake. I have sought answers as to why this is the case but have been frozen out of the process. The terms of reference are clear. Their proper examination requires the committee to call for submissions and hold public hearings. Anything less would be a betrayal of the will of the Senate and, ultimately, of the people we all purport to represent.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (17:23):  It was really interesting to listen to Senator Smith talk about corruption today. He did not mention his friend from the Liberal Party Mr Damien Mantach pleading guilty to massive amounts of stealing. Let's not forget that.


Let's look at what the Labor Party have done. Our policy states that we want to regulate political donations. Our policy states that we want to reduce the cap in the donations disclosure law. When last in government, we put up electoral reform that included looking at political donations. What happened? The Liberal-National Party, along with some of the crossbench senators, knocked that on the head. So do not come to us talking about corruption and political donations.


Let's look at where we are up to with this grubby little deal and what the Greens have traded away. Recent history demonstrates that, when it comes to deal making and economic credentials, the Greens party has well and truly got its L-plates on. They dipped their toes in murky water in a grubby deal with the government to disenfranchise around 330,000 part-pensioners. The Greens changed the asset test for these pensioners, cutting their household budgets, meaning they have less to live on.


On the last day of sitting in 2015, another dirty deal was done on the cheap with the government on company tax. Despite their rhetoric of being tough on tax, the Greens failed to gain any tangible transparency in their deal. It increases the threshold for companies, allowing them to continue to trade behind closed doors and avoid paying their fair share of tax. The explanation from the Greens leader was interesting. He said it was the best deal they could do at the time. The government was desperate to get that bill through, but the Greens failed to take advantage of that and settled for an inadequate deal. I would like to hear from the Greens about when they think the Australian parliament might have a better chance of getting a fair and transparent deal, in fact, the deal that Labor wanted to hold out for. Surely, that time is when the government is desperate to get a bill through. Quite frankly, I think a two-year-old having a tantrum would be a better negotiator than the Greens.


This latest dirty deal enables the government to pull the DD trigger and wipe out the crossbench. This deal will actually disadvantage the millions of Australians who choose to vote for Independents and small parties. There is nothing honourable in this bill, which has incorrectly been titled 'electoral reform'. There is only one change in this bill, and that is to gerrymander Senate voting.


Once again, the Greens have shown themselves to be either inept negotiators or so drunk on power that they missed the obvious opportunity for real electoral reform in the bill of the same name. Today they have the gall to front the Senate with their matter of public importance, and, guess what, it is about electoral reform! Suddenly, after the Greens had done their dirty deal with the government to wipe out crossbench senators, they come into this very place with an urgency motion calling for immediate action on political donations. I do not know how they can lie straight in bed at night! Perhaps not all of the Greens were in on the dirty deal with the government, but, however they played it with the government, they should have included this alleged urgent action on political donation reform in their dirty deal in return for supporting a move to wipe out the crossbench.


This stunt today by the Greens party, trying to salvage some political capital after they sold their souls to the devil on a bill which locks out any minority view other than their own, will be seen by the Australian public for what it is. It is a grab for power and a dirty deal done with a government that are clearly frustrated with the crossbench and Labor. It is much harder to get rid of us. It is easy to get rid of the crossbench in a dirty deal with the Greens, who cannot even negotiate to put political donations reform into the package they did with a government desperate to do a deal. Once again, they fail. They get a little way along, and then they just cave in. Well done to the government! They will not love you in the morning; they do not even love you now! I say to the Greens: you have been hoodwinked once again on major reform. You simply caved in. You sold your soul to the devil, and Australians will see straight through it.

"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2016-02-24,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:28):  I have been in this place for almost five years. I was an environmental lawyer for almost 10 years before coming here. The commonality between both of those roles has been what I think of as the corrupting influence of the big mining sector. I have often pondered why that is. When you look at the actual contribution that that sector makes to our employment, it is about two per cent, if that. The contribution it makes to GDP is minuscule. Why do these people have so much influence? I ponder that.


Every year, of course, we get the donations disclosure. We have heard that, in the last three years, both big parties have received $3.7 million from the fossil fuel sector—the big miners, the coal seam gas companies, you name it. That is only federally. There are more donations at the state level. We know that, at the federal level, Labor has received about $1.1 million over the last three years, the Liberals have got $3.3 million and the Nationals have got about $200,000. As I say, it does not include the $200,000 given by Santos to the Nationals in South Australia. What do the mining companies get for these generous donations? Well, they get their approvals, don't they? I have been tracking this. There has not been a coalmine refused under our federal laws in history. That has not been a coal seam gas project refused under our federal laws in history. You have to wonder why, given that the science is perfectly clear: we are in an age of global warming. These industries are damaging our land and our water. They are ripping apart our communities and they are threatening communities' health. Yet we have fantastic clean energy alternatives that are job-rich and do not trash the place. So why? Well, those donations speaks volumes. You have to wonder, if the renewable energy sector donated half as much, whether we would have seen the renewable energy target slashed in this place, with both parties ganging up to vote for that.


What else do they get for their donations? They get a massive pay-off. They get billions in fossil fuel subsidies. They get taxpayer handouts to the tune of about $14 billion over four years. They get cheap fuel. You and I do not get that; the big miners get that. They get accelerated depreciation on their assets and they get a tax break to do production and exploration. If you tally that up, you get about $14 billion over four years. That means that, for every dollar they are donating to the big parties, they are getting more than $2,000 back from the taxpayer purse. What a lark!


Of course, we want to abolish those fossil fuel subsidies and use that money for something useful, like health, like education and like acting on global warming. But it begs the question: what do the political parties get out of this cushy arrangement? Well, they get their multimillion-dollar war chests that they can use to fight elections to try to pretend they have some values or some principles, and of course they get the cushy jobs once they leave this place. I have a depressingly long list here of jobs held by former politicians who now work for the big mining sector. John Anderson, former Nationals leader and in fact Deputy Prime Minister, went to be Chairman of Eastern Star Gas. Mark Vaile became a director and Chairman of Whitehaven Coal. Martin Ferguson is now on the APPEA Advisory Board—that is the coal seam gas lobby group. Craig Emerson now works for Santos, another big coal seam gas company. Greg Combet went to be a consultant to AGL. Sadly, I am running out of time, but the list goes on. 


What are we going to do about this? Ban political donations. They are corrupting the system. We have a bill before this place that I hope to bring on and debate very soon—and I hope we get some support, but I am not holding my breath—to ban donations from the mining sector, from property developers, from the alcohol industry, from the tobacco industry and from the gambling industry. Our democracy needs to be beyond reproach and, sadly, these donations are corrupting the system and leading to an absolute lack of faith amongst the public. That is why the vote for the major parties is so down.

I will be really clear: I support reforms that make our political donations system fairer, that give voice to ordinary Australians and to the groups that represent them, and that lead to decision making that preferences the interests of the nation over sectional interests. That is not what the Greens stand for, however. It pays to remember during this debate what the Greens did the last time they had a hand in redesigning a system around donations, and that was the time they did another deal, on that occasion with the O'Farrell Liberal government in New South Wales. 


In 2011 the Greens supported the Election Funding, Expenditure and Disclosures Amendment Bill in the New South Wales parliament. This legislation would have allowed only individuals to make donations, not organisations. The Greens like to talk up the fact that the consequence of this legislation was that it limited corporations' donations. However, everybody should understand that it also had hidden provisions that stopped not-for-profit organisations, member based organisations and sporting groups from participating in the political process. It meant that organisations like Unions New South Wales, like the Council of Social Service in New South Wales and like the Australian Industry Group were unable to allow their members to express a view in the context of a political debate.


One really wonders about the motivation of the Greens in signing on to legislation of that kind. What this legislation was really about was preventing organisations from running political campaigns against the government. The legislation would have hampered campaigns exactly like the Your Rights at Work campaign, where the union movement stepped up to protect workers' wages and conditions from an ideological attack by an arrogant government, an arrogant Liberal government. The legislation would have made it more difficult for nurses groups, for instance, to wage a campaign about the government's plans to cut health funding. 


We need to understand the context of this, because we should be concerned about the influence of money on Australian politics, but collective action and collective campaigns are some of the only ways available for ordinary people to make their voices heard. The Greens New South Wales legislation would have allowed individuals to make donations of $2,000. Well, that is terrific—it is great for those individuals that have $2,000 sitting around. But let us be very clear: the nurses, the firefighters, the ordinary Australians that choose to take part in Australian trade unions do not have that amount of money sitting around—a lazy $2,000—waiting to donate it to politics. Instead, they pool what little money they have, what little they can spare, and they use unions and their member organisations to amplify their voices, to make sure the voices of the small people are heard in a very big national debate. The High Court recognised this and it struck down the Greens supported legislation as being an impermissible burden on the constitutional right to political communication. 


I want to reiterate in closing that of course people on this side of the chamber are committed to a political system that is fair, transparent and modern and that gives people a chance to make themselves heard on the issues that impact on them. In my home state of New South Wales, our leader, Luke Foley, has taken decisive action, and New South Wales Labor will become the first Australian political party to disclose political donations as they come in, with that system to be up and running in 2017. There have been many problems in New South Wales—people on both sides of the aisle have compromised themselves—and that action is urgent and necessary. Corruption and influence-peddling is always unacceptable, but we should not forget that, when the Greens last looked at this issue, their answer was an unconstitutional attempt to deny— (Time expired)

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (17:37):  I am encouraged by the fact that ordinary Australians are now just starting to understand how thoroughly corrupt politics in Australia has become.


I recently met the Prime Minister and when I raised the issue of establishing a federal commission against corruption, a federal ICAC, he dismissed the idea by trying to tell me that a federal ICAC was not warranted because there were not many opportunities in federal politics, compared with state politics, for corruption to occur. I almost believed that nice story from our PM—and I mean who wouldn't? As I looked deeply in the PM's eyes, he said with that low deep voice with that nice smile repeat after me : 'There's no corruption in federal politics—only in state politics. There's no corruption in federal politics—only in state politics. I was left with that fuzzywuzzy feeling of hope for a few days after my meeting with the PM that 'there's no corruption in federal politics— only in state politics.'


And then—what do you know?—Veterans Affairs Minister Stuart Roberts was forced to resign; we found out about the rich Chinese businessman having drinks with Liberal Party members and the $10,000 watches that were given out as gifts.


The same sort of thing happened after I wrote to former Liberal PM Abbott asking him effectively whether any people associated with the Liberal Party and mentioned in the Heydon Royal Commission secret reports were corrupt. And PM Tony Abbott wrote back to me, essentially saying that no-one in the Liberal Party was corrupt; and then seven days later we found out the Liberal Party President in Victoria had defrauded their members to the tune of about $1.5 million.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  And that was the second time!




Senator LAMBIE:
  The Liberal Party of Australia is treating the people like fools on a whole range of issues, including corruption. They think that, because we did not go to their private clubs and do not wear the same school ties, we are not qualified—that we are idiots to be exploited, to be stolen from, spoken down to and ignored. I may not have the same qualifications that Senator Cash has, but I have every right to be in this place and I can spot and smell corruption a mile off and the stench which comes from those opposite, as Kenny would say, outlasts religion.


It is a well-known fact that the Liberals have taken millions of dollars from people closely connected with the Chinese communist government in election funding. The sale of iconic Tasmanian Dairy Company VDL to the Chinese company linked to the Chinese government shows a corrupt and negligent government process. When it comes to offshore corruption, the Liberal government have made the FIRB blind. Everyone knows after an ABC Four Corners report that our FIRB has failed to do its job properly and turns a blind eye to corrupt money.


I am calling on Labor to act in a principled manner and preference independents, including the JLN, before the Greens. That way, Labor, you will not only be talking the talk, you will finally be walking the walk.

DAIRY PRODUCE AMENDMENT (DAIRY SERVICE LEVY POLL) BILL 2016


As requested by the Australian dairy industry, this Bill amends the Dairy ProduceAct 1986 to remove the requirement to conduct a dairy levy poll every five years. 


In 2015, Australian Dairy Farmers, the industry representative body, and Dairy Australia, the industry research and development corporation, conducted an independent review of the dairy levy poll process. This review followed concerns raised by dairy levy payers about the cost of conducting a levy poll every five years which is estimated to be up to $1 million. 


Under the current legislation, the dairy industry must hold a poll every five years to seek the views of levy payers on whether changes should be made to the rate of the dairy services levy. This levy is used to fund the activities of Dairy Australia. 


Dairy Australia's role is to help farmers adapt to a changing operating environment, and strive for a profitable and sustainable dairy industry. This is achieved through investment in research, development and extension activities, and provision of services such as farm accounting systems, dairy industry forecasts, and information on farm management practices.


The recommendations of the review supported a flexible, streamlined poll process where a dairy levy poll would only be held if a change in levy rate is being considered. The amendments in the Bill will provide industry with more flexibility around the levy poll. 


In September 2015, Australian Dairy Farmers with the support of Dairy Australia and the state dairy farming organisations, embarked on a program of national consultation with dairy levy payers regarding the proposed changes to the dairy levy poll process. 


Every Australian dairy levy payer was contacted at least once through the consultation period and provided with opportunities to provide feedback on the proposed changes, including by formal vote. 


Consultation with dairy levy payers has demonstrated support to simplify the levy process.


The Bill complements the government's commitment to creating a stronger business environment for the agricultural sector by reducing unnecessary regulatory costs imposed on individuals, businesses and community organisations. 


Subordinate legislation will be developed which removes the five year timing of the dairy levy poll; establishes an advisory committee to consider the dairy levy rate every five years; and includes a mechanism for Group A members of Dairy Australia to request a poll if they disagree with the levy poll advisory committee's decision not to convene a levy poll. This proposal must be supported by at least 15 per cent of levies paid by Group A members.


Dairy Australia has two categories of membership. Group A members are dairy farmers, who pay the dairy levy. Membership is voluntary and entitles members to vote at Dairy Australia annual general meetings. Group B membership covers the peak dairy organisations. Australian Dairy Farmers and the Australian Dairy Products Federation are Group B members of Dairy Australia.


This approach is deregulatory, reduces red tape and focuses levy funds on growing an even more productive and profitable dairy industry. 


The issue of levy payer polls has also been investigated by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee in the report of its inquiry into agricultural levies. The government will provide a response to the Committee's report in due course.


The dairy industry has been in a structural transition since deregulation in 2000. The number of farms has more than halved from 12,896 in 1999-2000 to around 6,100 in 2014–2015 and volatility in the international market and a weaker Australian dollar have challenged the industry.


Despite these challenges, the dairy industry has improved productivity and has demonstrated a willingness to embrace new technologies and implement new farming practices.


The Bill will enable the dairy industry to redirect investment into research and development priorities to allow the industry to progress its goals of profitability, productivity and sustainability. 


PARLIAMENTARY ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (INJURY COMPENSATION SCHEME) BILL 2016


For 14 years federal parliamentarians have had no cover for injuries and illnesses suffered in the course of activities as a parliamentarian. Our profession remains one of the few in this country that offers no protection for workplace accidents.


In the 2015-16 Budget, the Government announced that it would address this lack of coverage by establishing an injury compensation scheme for parliamentarians. The Parliamentary Entitlements Amendment (Injury Compensation Scheme) Bill 2016 establishes such a scheme.


The bill establishes the parliamentary injury compensation scheme by inserting provisions into the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990. The bill provides authority to the Minister to determine the scheme's benefits in a legislative instrument, which as much as possible will match the compensation entitlements of Commonwealth employees by incorporating the provisions of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. The scheme will provide coverage for injuries or illnesses which occur on or after 1 January 2016.


The bill and subordinate legislative instrument will also provide compensation coverage for the spouse of the Prime Minister for injuries or illnesses arising out of the spouse's official activities.


Determining the scheme's benefits in a legislative instrument, which either house of the Parliament may disallow, will allow the parliamentary injury compensation scheme to keep pace with any changes to Commonwealth employees' compensation. At the same time, it will ensure there is appropriate oversight of the scheme's benefits.


Functions and powers to administer the scheme are conferred on Comcare under the Bill and necessary changes are made to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 to enable Comcare to undertake this administration.


In addition to compensation, the scheme will provide parliamentarians and the spouse of the Prime Minister with work health and safety services, facilities and equipment intended to eliminate or minimise health and safety risks that arise in the workplace. This element of the scheme will be administered by the Department of Finance.


This is a necessary measure that is long overdue.


Debate adjourned.

"Lindgren, Sen Joanna",LP,2016-02-24,"



Senator LINDGREN
 (Queensland) (19:19):  In 1964 and 1965, Charlie Perkins and students from the University of Sydney organised a series of freedom rides inspired by the American freedom rides to end segregation. Segregation of Aboriginals from other Australians included divided movie theatres, bans at some swimming pools and Indigenous ex-service personnel being unable to enter some RSLs—the list goes on. Today, Australians would be horrified if those restrictions were reintroduced, yet over 50 years after the freedom rides we see segregation of another form. We still see races being kept apart for so-called do-gooder reasons supported by intellectual elites. To those who support this new form of segregation, I support your right to speak about it but I do not support any kind of segregation whether it is at university, in classrooms or in any other forum, for that matter, and nor do I support the constant hiding behind section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act and the constant use of racist tags against those who oppose your ideals.


Fifty years ago, there was much to do and it was being done by visionary people on both sides of politics. Those who instigated the reforms should be remembered proudly. It was a time that many in this chamber are too young to remember or to have been involved in. I was not even born when the coalition made changes in 1962 to the Commonwealth Electoral Act cementing Indigenous voting rights and the 1967 referendum. These were great reforms and those who fought for them and those who introduced them have much to be proud about. We are lucky to live in a country that is the product of those reforms. But it seems to me that there are those who have heard the stories of those heady days and seen the successes and now want to emulate them. They want the euphoria that went with those successes. The problem is there are fewer and fewer reforms needed so they have to invent new ones, many that are quite frankly not needed. Are some reforms being pushed for real reasons or because of someone's ego and their desire to be seen as a reformer?


One of the most insidious mantras to support segregation was the catchcry 'equal but separate.' This catchcry is now being seen, despite it not being obvious to you and me, on the surface. Some universities appear to be now promoting segregation albeit for different reasons. When I attended university I identified as an Aboriginal and I was proud to do so. I sought no special treatment from my university. I used the same library, the same computers and the same lecture theatres. Like other university students, I accessed the university's tutors for guidance as I was the first one of my immediate family to go to university.


Yes, there was an Indigenous unit at the university that I accessed, but my non-Indigenous friends were also welcome there. It was not only for Indigenous students to use, despite the Indigenous name. The Aboriginal unit was inclusive and supportive of all of those who sought its assistance. I ask: how do we break down racial barriers when some modern institutes are keeping people apart? For every non-Indigenous student who interacted with me and other Indigenous students, it became harder for them to accept any negative views of Indigenous people that may have been held by previous generations.


There may be good or at least some well-meaning reasons behind some forms of new-age segregation such as support services and computer rooms specifically for Indigenous students at universities, but when any criticism or debate is stifled by screams of racism and section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act is held up as a shield, we will never be able to promote the positives of this support. Imagine the surprise of a young man who went into a computer room only to find out that it was segregated and now finds himself embroiled in a legal saga because he voiced his opinion. I have to ask the question: if computers were not being used, why couldn't any student wander in and use them? How do Indigenous and non-Indigenous students form study groups and potential friendship groups when sitting apart? How do we build on the great work of those who have paved the way to end segregation?


Fifty years ago many non-Indigenous Australians supported the need for reforms, so much so, there was overwhelming support for the coalition's 1967 referendum, because they saw the need, and they voted for change. They made those changes without the onerous restrictions of freedom of speech. I would say that unfettered freedom of speech brought about the changes.


What was once held up as quite acceptable is now seen as unacceptable. Hopefully today's attacks on freedom of speech under the guise of being enlightened will one day been seen as unacceptable. Today, many younger and new Australians may see these Indigenous support systems as contentious or difficult to understand. We will not change that understanding if we keep people apart and stifle debate, and that is what the current wording and use of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act does. We will create battle lines when people do not have the opportunity to debate freely and feel that they have valid grounds to complain.


The insidious nature of these university sponsored attitudes to race issues was displayed by the banning of Country Liberal, Bess Price MP of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from visiting an Indigenous support unit of a Queensland university for having different views to them. She has expressed the view that many urban Aboriginal people do not fully comprehend the situation of outback Aboriginals. Without debating the rights or wrongs of her views it was simply absurd that she could not speak to students and educators at a leading innovative university. It was even more insidious that someone who was closer to the subject—in this case an Aboriginal woman born and raised on a remote community—was banned as she challenged the views of those who had little direct knowledge or experience. I am left wondering who section 18C would have protected in this case. I will add that I was responsible for organising the visit of Bess Price MP, so I can speak with some authority on that issue.


It is now the case that some universities want to promote and retain a particular view of race issues and will avoid the authoritative real-life experiences of the situation. They wish to continue to believe that Indigenous people lack the skills and intellect to manage university life without their benevolence. One of the consequences of this excessive paternalism is that it can and does devalue the achievements of Indigenous people. I know this first hand. I earned my degree like many other students by study, part-time employment and sacrifice, yet I have heard it being referred to as a 'tick-in-the-box degree'. I do acknowledge that some students need support and a computer room may be part of that support, but labels are not needed.


For those who harbour internal guilt due to past injustices or those who think they are doing good, let me say this: you are creating division and resentment. The gaining of my degree, my appointment to the Senate, did not remove any past injustices to my forebears and it never will. They exist as a reminder of past injustices. What it did prove was that Aboriginal Australians are more capable of taking their place in all parts of Australian society. We need to remember that most Australians of today are not responsible for the past. Yes, they live in its shadow and there is a definite need to be aware of it, so we do not repeat past mistakes. I back realistic, proactive support for Indigenous students but not enforced segregation, and I scorn the constant hiding behind section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act with chants of racism.
