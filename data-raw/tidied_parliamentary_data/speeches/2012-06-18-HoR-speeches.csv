Mr BYRNE
 (Holt) (10:09):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the committee's report entitled Review of administration and expenditure: No. 9 (2009-2010)—Australian intelligence agencies. 


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr BYRNE:
  The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's oversight of the Australian intelligence community is a key element of our national security architecture. I am therefore pleased to present the ninth review of the administration and expenditure of the AIC by the PJCIS.


This review examined a wide range of aspects of the administration and expenditure of the six intelligence and security agencies, including the financial statements for each agency and their human resource management, training, recruitment and accommodation. In addition the review looked at issues of interoperability between members of the AIC. Submissions were sought from each of the six intelligence and security agencies, from the Australian National Audit Office and from the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security.


The submissions from ANAO and the six intelligence agencies were all classified confidential, restricted or secret and were therefore not made available to the public. As has been its practice for previous reviews, ASIO provided the committee with both a classified and an unclassified submission. The unclassified version was made available on the committee's website. Each of the Defence intelligence agencies provided the committee with a classified submission. The agencies marked each paragraph with its relevant national security classification. This has enabled the committee for its 2009-10 review to directly refer in this report to unclassified information provided in the Defence agencies' submissions.


The committee also received five submissions from members of the public or public organisations, which included: the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre; the Brigidine Asylum Seekers Project; Refugees, Survivors and Ex-Detainees, or RISE; and the Refugee Council of Australia. These submissions all dealt with ASIO security assessments of refugees. On 25 March 2011 the committee held a private hearing at which ASIO, ASIS, DSD, DIGO, ONA and DIO appeared. On 16 June the committee held a public hearing—its first since July 2006—and heard from representatives of the Refugee Council of Australia, RISE, the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre and ASIO in relation to visa security assessments. The committee thanks all attendees, particularly those from organisations providing support to refugees, for the time and effort they took to put their views to the committee. Given the public interest and importance of the topic of visa security assessments in this report it is this issue that I intend to speak to at great length.


The committee notes the request from some advocacy groups for ASIO to declare its non-statutory criteria for making visa security assessments. The committee believes that making non-statutory criteria publicly available could compromise national security because applications from potentially hostile individuals could be tailored to meet these criteria. The committee therefore does not support this suggestion, and notes that since its previous administration and expenditure inquiry ASIO's visa security assessment workload has increased significantly. Processes for undertaking visa security assessments have been placed under considerable strain and, in some cases, assessments have taken longer than is desirable.


The committee takes very seriously the concerns put before it by various refugee and asylum seeker advocacy groups, but it also recognises that the job ASIO has is a very difficult one. Therefore, the committee welcomes the efforts introduced by ASIO in March 2011 to streamline the process of security assessments in an attempt to clear the backlog and to process future assessments in less time. The committee is satisfied that the current regime for visa security assessments is the correct one. The committee notes that IGIS has stated that ASIO is doing its job in a 'proper and legal manner'. Overall, on the basis of information provided, the committee is satisfied that the administration and expenditure of the six intelligence and security agencies is sound.


However, I note that concerns raised on the efficiency dividend's impact on agencies during the committee's Review of administration and expenditure: No. 8 (2008-2009)—Australian intelligence organisations were specifically raised in the evidence the committee took for the current review. This is extremely concerning to the committee. The committee will continue to monitor the impact of the efficiency dividend on the Australian intelligence community.


The committee was pleased with the level of information given to it on interoperability and will continue to monitor this area to ensure that interoperability management and budgetary structures are in place across the AIC. The committee thanks the heads of the AIC agencies and all those who contributed to this review. I want to thank the secretariat staff: Dr Margot Kerley and Dr John Carter who are no longer with us, Jerome Brown, Robert Little, Cathryn Olive, Jessica Butler and Gillian Drew. I commend the report to the House.

Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra) (10:14):  I endorse the comments of the chair and thank him for his acknowledgement of the professional staff and the assistance they give to us. I have always found our intelligence agencies professional, and they act with great probity. The Australian public might find that difficult to understand because of the nature of the work that these agencies have to undertake. The work is often covert, and it is extremely difficult to independently review those matters. It is equally difficult for a committee to comment on matters that might compromise their operations but which it would be helpful for the government to be aware of. These are matters of potential concern.


In discussing this report, I take the opportunity to identify some of the difficulties under which the agencies are operating. You will find these in the report if you look closely. For instance, under human resources, agencies have been growing to meet needs. One of the difficulties they have in ensuring their professionalism and their probity is to recruit people who are sufficiently talented and appropriate for those tasks. One of the comments made in the report is that ASIO had aimed for growth but did not meet ambitious recruitment targets while recruitment remains a high priority. I think there is a signal there for the government. 


If you look at security issues, the agencies are having to address a wider range of issues. We always thought they only dealt with counterespionage. In fact, the broadening of their activities to include counterterrorism and more recently cybersecurity have put the organisations very much at the focus of protecting our national interest under enormous pressure. Coupled with that is pressure they really do not need: the security assessments that have to be undertaken on people who come to Australia. While refugee and asylum seeker advocacy groups have raised issues, let me say that it is absolutely essential that these inquiries are undertaken. We know that there have been adverse security assessments. Look at the increase in the numbers of people who have to be seen. In terms of Christmas Island, from 2008-09 there were 200 assessments needed. In 2009-10 nearly 3,000 assessments had to be made. This is having very significant impact on the re-allocation of resources to a function we should not have to be doing, away from those that are absolutely essential.


There is difficulty undertaking this task when the people that you have to see actually dispose of documents that might help even understanding where they are from and who they are. Yet all of our agencies, including IGIS, the independent security intelligence review agency, have seen a significant increase in their workload. The complaints that IGIS receives have gone from 153 in 2008-09 to 1,015. We have the advocacy group saying that there ought to be a whole lot of new procedures put in place for review. Where is this going to lead to in terms of the ability and the capacity of these organisations to do their essential work?


Then we come to the unforeseen elephant in the room that my colleague mentioned: the impact of efficiency dividends. We are not able to talk about the potential of the impact of efficiency dividends but we know that the impact on small agencies—and these are relatively small agencies—can be extraordinarily significant. The committee has recommended the government review the potential adverse impact on the efficiency dividend on intelligence agencies. It would be very reprehensible if their activities were to be compromised because of the unforeseen impact of a measure of that type.

Mr GRIFFIN
 (Bruce) (10:20):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the committee's report entitled Report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Indonesia and Tonga: 24September—1 October 2011. During September 2011 members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters visited Indonesia and Tonga as part of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Committee Exchange program. Indonesia, with its population of over 200 million, and Tonga, with a little over 100,000 people, are demographically very different countries in the Asia-Pacific region. One thing they have in common is that both are making the important transition to democratic governance, with Indonesia starting its democratic journey in 1999 and Tonga holding its first democratic election in 2010.


The delegation greatly appreciated the time and effort of the many individuals and organisations in Indonesia and Tonga that met with us during our visit. The program included a combination of high-level meetings and opportunities for delegates to hear firsthand the experiences of individuals of their country's democratic progress and their aspirations for a democratic future. This greatly assisted delegates to better appreciate the democratic transition underway in these still relatively new democracies.


Through its governance and electoral support programs, Australia is playing a role in assisting these countries to make practical democratic improvements. This visit provided a valuable opportunity for delegates to gain an appreciation of the strong relationships that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, AusAID and the Australian Electoral Commission are building with electoral authorities and key stakeholders in the Asia-Pacific. The effective conduct of elections is an important component of good governance and viable democracies, and was of particular interest to the delegation. It is important for Australia to remain engaged in Indonesia and Tonga and the broader Asia-Pacific region, and to provide the governance and electoral support needed to help our neighbours realise their democratic aspirations. On behalf of the delegation I thank the organisations and individuals who met with and assisted us during our visit to Indonesia and Tonga. I also thank my fellow delegates for their participation and commitment to the demanding program and their contribution to a productive and informative delegation visit. I also certainly want to put on the record my thanks to the secretary of the delegation, Ms Samantha Mannette, for the excellent work that she did, and to the other staff who assist her in the secretariat of the electoral matters committee.


I commend the delegation report to the House.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (10:22):  I joined the delegation and rise to speak in support of the remarks by the leader of the delegation.


I attended the Indonesian part only, and I believe it was an important part of the ongoing relationship between Australia and Indonesia. The delegation had the opportunity for high-level meetings, including with the vice-president, and opportunities to meet with Indonesian people to learn of their experience of their country's move to democracy.


It is interesting in a country which of course does not have compulsory voting, that 62 per cent turned out for this mayoral election which we visited. Of the 322,000-odd eligible voters some 200,000 of them turned out to vote. This was a rise in participation compared to the 2006 poll, where only 53 per cent of registered voters cast a vote. Generally in Indonesia voter turnout has been exceptionally high in recent years, but is now appearing to drop. It was suggested to the delegation that this could be an indication of voter fatigue due to the high number of elections in the country. For example, in 2010 there were more than 240 local elections conducted.


There was an expectation that it would be an outright win for the pair who eventually won. That was the pair supported by Golkar and the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, but they only achieved 48.3 per cent of the vote on polling day. Rather than have a run-off there was a subdistrict approach applied. This means that the total votes of the subdistrict are examined and the candidate to win the most subdistrict elections are declared the winners—that is, for mayor and deputy mayor. So the final winners of the election, declared some 10 days after the election was held, were in fact the pair supported by Golkar and the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle.


It was interesting to watch the people line up to cast their votes. They were obviously very keen to be part of the process. It is interesting that the mark that you have voted is that your little pinky finger is dipped in ink, and that is to ensure that you are not voting a second time. It might be something that we could look at here; we do have a few people who vote more than once.


The AEC noted that their permanent presence in Jakarta has been a very positive presence. We now have an Australian Electoral Commission director and local staff, and they work together with AusAID representatives. They accompanied us around the polling stations during the voting, and at the close of the polling booths and the beginning of the count. It was interesting to see them hold up the ballot boxes. There was obviously pride taken in making sure that there was not double voting and that there was no tampering with those ballot boxes.


The AEC, in partnership with AusAID, have been working hard to build strong relationships with electoral authorities in Indonesia. Observing the Yogyakarta mayoral election was a valuable opportunity to see Australia's continuing electoral support being given to Indonesia, which was begun by the Howard government, and why it is so important. Australia provides direct support, and through international partnerships, to develop the capacity of Indonesia's electoral authorities.


I, too, would like to thank Samantha Mannette, who acted as the secretary to the committee during the visit. Her attention to detail and organising of the trip was exemplary. I think it was a useful part in continuing the important relationship between Australia and Indonesia.

Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (10:27):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry, I present the committee's advisory report on the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. 


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr ADAMS:
  by leave—On 22 March 2012, the selection committee referred the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012 to the Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry for inquiry. Introduction of the bill followed a report by the Productivity Commission, released in 2010, which recommended: abolition of the Wheat Export Accreditation Scheme 2008; abolition of Wheat Exports Australia and the wheat export charge; and discontinuation of the 'access test', instead relying upon general competition law and a voluntary code of conduct. The bill aims to facilitate a transition of the bulk wheat export industry into a deregulated market in line with the Productivity Commission's recommendations.


From the 20 submissions received and two days of public hearings, a divergent range of views was presented to the committee both in favour and against the bill. Some issues were identified as requiring further consideration, including by stakeholders who supported deregulation. In particular, these questions related to quality assurance, access to supply chain infrastructure and the availability of wheat stocks information.


However, there is no clear link between the current arrangements and quality assurance. In reality, quality is currently only assured through market competitiveness, not export accreditation rules or some other form of government process. Industry should manage quality and, in fact, the current law reflects this situation. I would think that the customer would let you know what he would want. The committee is aware that the current supply chain infrastructure is divided into regional monopolies developed through historical circumstances. However, delaying deregulation will not necessarily improve these trading conditions; indeed, the entrance of new players into the market may be aided by deregulation and the abolition of accreditation.


In relation to market information, the committee agreed with evidence that information relating to wheat stocks should be improved and be freely available. A number of submissions and witnesses explained that wheat stocks information currently available would be insufficient for a deregulated wheat market to function properly.


The committee has therefore recommended:


That an industry-funded entity be developed to deliver services to the industry, in the areas of quality, standards and stock information;


That the government consider appointing an industry-funded grains industry ombudsmen for a five year period;—


The ombudsman would be paid for by industry and by those that need to use an ombudsman—there are several models in Australia along these lines—


That the government support improving the sharing of wheat stocks information; and


That this process might be initiated through using funds from the Wheat Industry Special Account.


Finally, the committee recommends that the House pass the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012. I would like to take the opportunity of thanking the committee's secretariat, Thomas, Nathan and David, for their strong and professional work. We have achieved a lot in a short time and we have brought down a very good report. I commend the report to the House.

Mr SCHULTZ
 (Hume) (10:31):  As Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry, can I compliment the committee as a whole on reinforcing its reputation for working together in a bipartisan way on issues related to agriculture, forestry and fisheries. I endorse the opening remarks made by the committee chairman about the recommendations of the committee on this particular issue of wheat exporting.


Some of us in this place can well remember the issues centred around the Australian Wheat Board at a time when there was significant activity which indicated some graft in the marketing of wheat, particularly export wheat. It is also true to say that, at that time, the behaviour of some individual senior officials within that organisation verged on criminal activity. These are the things that I am reminded of as I make my contribution within the committee process. Whilst we do not like to think about those things, the point I am making is that there has always been controversy in wheat marketing, whether it is at the local level or at the export marketing level. Some people in this place, including myself, were criticised by elements of the wheat growing community in this country because we believed that we should be protecting people in Western Australia and South Australia who were growing export wheat from being ripped off to the extent of $60 to $100 per tonne of their export wheat just to satisfy the A and B class shareholders within the Australian Wheat Board organisation.


In closing, I would like to thank the committee for the wonderful way in which we worked together to come to the recommendations that the chairman has outlined here in the House today. To the chairman, can I say that it is always a pleasure to work with him, because politics are put aside and we as a committee make our decisions on the basis of the open and transparent evidence that is taken within the committee process and on the basis of what we believe to be in the best interests of the people that we are representing. The outcome of this hearing—this recommendation that the House pass the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012—has been based on the independent evidence that we have taken and on the wonderful contributions by people within the industry. It is my hope and I know it is the hope of the committee as a whole that the House will embrace the recommendations of this committee today.

I endorse the opening remarks made by the committee chairman about the recommendations of the committee on this particular issue of wheat exporting.


Some of us in this place can well remember the issues centred around the Australian Wheat Board at a time when there was significant activity which indicated some graft in the marketing of wheat, particularly export wheat. It is also true to say that, at that time, the behaviour of some individual senior officials within that organisation verged on criminal activity. These are the things that I am reminded of as I make my contribution within the committee process. Whilst we do not like to think about those things, the point I am making is that there has always been controversy in wheat marketing, whether it is at the local level or at the export marketing level. Some people in this place, including myself, were criticised by elements of the wheat growing community in this country because we believed that we should be protecting people in Western Australia and South Australia who were growing export wheat from being ripped off to the extent of $60 to $100 per tonne of their export wheat just to satisfy the A and B class shareholders within the Australian Wheat Board organisation.


In closing, I would like to thank the committee for the wonderful way in which we worked together to come to the recommendations that the chairman has outlined here in the House today. To the chairman, can I say that it is always a pleasure to work with him, because politics are put aside and we as a committee make our decisions on the basis of the open and transparent evidence that is taken within the committee process and on the basis of what we believe to be in the best interests of the people that we are representing. The outcome of this hearing—this recommendation that the House pass the Wheat Export Marketing Amendment Bill 2012—has been based on the independent evidence that we have taken and on the wonderful contributions by people within the industry. It is my hope and I know it is the hope of the committee as a whole that the House will embrace the recommendations of this committee today.

Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon—Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10:46):  I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore 6 to 16 November 2011. I present this report not in my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry but as leader of that delegation. I acknowledge the warm and friendly welcome we received at the meetings in each country and thank our hosts for their willingness to engage with us in frank and open discussion. I cannot overstate the value of delegation visits such as this one.


Two abiding outcomes in particular arose from our visit. The first is that nothing builds trust and understanding and promotes the discovery of common interests better than meeting people face to face. After visiting the region, it is impossible to ignore the fact that Australia's future prosperity and security is, in common with all the ASEAN countries, best secured by promoting peace and free trade in our region and around the world. Second and related to the first: historically, education has played an important role in the development of Australia's relationships in the region. The Colombo Plan, you might remember, marked the establishment of Australia as an international education destination. We are built on this, and education is now a major export industry for Australia that continues to promote links between Australia and other countries and ensures large numbers of former foreign students are comfortable doing business in and with Australia. But it is fundamentally a one-way street, for very few Australians study in Asian countries, and Australia needs to address this if we are to be further integrated into Asian growth and prosperity in the medium to long term.


The report has made recommendations intended to encourage more Australians to take up opportunities to study in ASEAN countries and to provide them with additional practical support while they do so. I believe that encouraging many more Australians to study in the region is the single most important thing we can do to strengthen our cultural and economic relationships with ASEAN countries in the longer term.


The trade relationships with the countries visited are very important to Australia. For example, two-way trade with Vietnam is over $6 billion, with Thailand around $19 billion and with Singapore around $23 billion. Vietnam has a population of around 90 million, and GDP per capita has been growing steadily as Vietnam opens up and reforms its economy to encourage foreign investment. On such a short visit to one city you come away with the impression that Vietnam has enormous social and economic potential, that it is building economic momentum and that it is about to take off. It has a large, youthful and energetic workforce; food security; significant reserves of oil, gas, and other minerals; and forests and fisheries which support its economic development. It follows that there are significant opportunities for further developing the economic relationship between Australia and Vietnam. Vietnam is actively seeking foreign investment to provide the capital necessary to further develop its natural resources, expand energy production and build the transport and distribution infrastructure necessary to support development in other sectors.


We also visited Thailand, which is so important to Australia in terms of trade and in normal diplomatic relationships. Indeed, we visited Thailand in the midst of the flood crisis which occurred in November 2011. We share many of the issues that face a relatively flat country, and there is more that we can do and more ways that we can benefit from each other in relation to this. A highlight of our visit to Thailand was the opportunity to visit Hellfire Pass and the related memorial museum and to lay wreaths at the Hellfire Pass memorial cairn and at the Kanchanaburi War Cemetery in honour of the prisoners of war who died working on the Thailand-Burma Railway. We were privileged to meet a group of British former POWs who despite their advanced age and the tropical heat made their way down Hellfire Pass and back, highlighting the need the Hellfire Pass memorial complex has for a suitable vehicle to transport elderly visitors to and from the memorial cairn. We have recommended that the Australian government fund the purchase of a suitable light vehicle.


Finally, we visited our very good friends in Singapore, with whom we have major trade agreements and also diplomatic and military ties. Singapore has very limited space available for military training, and an aspect of the defence relationship highly valued by Singapore is the unilateral access to military training areas Australia allows to Singapore.


I thank my colleagues the members for Gippsland, Reid, Cowper and Swan and those who organised this very important and highly productive delegation.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2012-06-18,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (10:51):  I take this opportunity to thank the member for Braddon for his leadership of the delegation and also thank my co-delegates the member for Gippsland, the member for Swan and the member for Reid. I think it was a very valuable trip and I would like to reflect on some of the key recommendations, particularly the first three. Recommendation 1 is that the Australian government, through Australia's diplomatic network, support the establishment and maintenance of alumni associations for students from Asia who have studied in Australia. Recommendation 2 is that the Australian government more actively promote the existing available education opportunities and support available for Australian students studying in ASEAN countries. And recommendation 3 is that the Australian government should consider providing access to funded scholarships for Asian students to study at Australian universities, perhaps as partnerships between the government and the private sector.


I think if I was left with one key message from the trip it is the importance of education not only in assisting countries develop but also in creating stronger links with our Asian neighbours. I reflect on my own university days, back in the seventies, which were quite some time ago now. At that time there were many students who were studying under the Colombo Plan. No doubt many of those students have gone on to senior roles within their countries, but the lack of an alumni association means I have lost track of those students. I do not really know where they are now, unfortunately, but there was a very strong relationship back in the seventies between the local students and the Asian students who were studying under the Colombo Plan. Recommendation 1 would go some way to ensuring that those links developed are maintained over the years ahead.


Education is an important factor. When we look at our aid budget, we do a great deal with that spending. Education is a very cost-effective way of delivering improvements in foreign countries and—whilst we all like to see improvements in infrastructure, health services and so on and so forth—it is always a challenge for Australia, many miles away, to effectively administer and implement those objectives from a long distance. But, with education, we have the ability to control and deliver services on a very cost-effective basis that we know will benefit those countries greatly. It will not only benefit the countries themselves but, as in the days of the Colombo Plan, benefit Australia by not only having Asian students exposed to Australia's way of thinking but also giving our local students who may not have had the opportunity to travel to Asia yet the opportunity to be exposed to the thoughts, aspirations and objectives of students from Asian countries.


I would like to see, particularly in relation to recommendation 3, a consideration of a greater focus on funded scholarships, either government funded or through the private sector. I think the private sector does, as this recommendation indicates, have an important role to play. We can have no better ambassadors from this country than students who have studied here over an extended period of time, who have had interface with Australian students and who appreciate our customs and where we are coming from. It is a great opportunity that should not be missed to further enhance our involvement in Asia through providing hundreds if not thousands, I would hope, of delegates for Australia—Australian ambassadors who will go back to their own countries and tell the Australian story.


I think we can in the future have far closer relationships with those Asian nations through the mutual benefit of study. The ability to improve the productivity of a country through the exposure of our institutions, our forms of governance and our forms of commerce would be invaluable, particularly in the case of Vietnam, a country which, as the member for Braddon said, is about to take off. There would be no better way of achieving that take-off than providing an additional avenue for Vietnam to obtain highly skilled young people who can use our way of thinking to the benefit of their country.


I take the opportunity to thank the other members of the delegation and again thank the member for Braddon for his great work in leading the delegation. It was a very useful trip. I think it certainly enhanced bilateral relations between Vietnam, Thailand and Singapore and Australia, and I look forward to seeing the implementation of the recommendations contained within the report, particularly in relation to education.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (10:57):  It is with great pleasure that I introduce the Protecting Local Jobs (Regulating Enterprise Migration Agreements) Bill 2012. We hear a lot about how the mining boom is creating wealth and jobs, but we need to talk more and do more about distributing these benefits in an equitable and sustainable way. There are some large numbers associated with the mining boom. The Governor of the RBA, Glenn Stevens, in his recent speech 'The glass half full', alluded to the following dramatic statistics:


… mining investment has recently been rising at an extraordinary pace. In 2005, mining investment was near its long-run average of around 2 per cent of GDP. By mid 2014 we expect it to reach at least 9 per cent of GDP. If that occurs, mining investment will be about as large as business investment in the rest of the private economy combined.


But the rise of the mining industry is neither inexorable nor universally beneficial. Australia export large quantities of iron ore and coal, but we also export a lot of dividend payments. In 2009-10 mining profits were $51 billion, of which 83 per cent, or $42 billion, accrued to foreign investors. Over the next 10 years, pre-tax profits for mining will probably be around $600 billion. At present levels of foreign ownership, around $500 billion of these profits will end up in the hands of overseas owners.


ABS figures show that in February 2012 total mining employment was 250,000, in a workforce of over 11 million. In other words, mining employs just around two per cent of the Australian workforce. Mining is, in fact, one of the smallest sectoral employers in the country. The Greens believe it is important to ensure that local workers are given the first opportunity to benefit from these jobs and that if overseas workers are used we make sure that those workers get their full wages and entitlements. This bill is one of several measures that the Greens have proposed to ensure that, as far as possible, all Australians share in the benefits of the boom.


In accordance with the original Treasury recommendations, the Greens would have improved, and will continue to seek to improve, the MRRT to ensure that by 2020 about $100 billion additional revenue will be collected, making it available for measures such as health, education, dental care and the infrastructure that the country will need for the future, when the rest of the world tells us to stop digging. The Greens proposed a sovereign wealth fund to help save for the future, but when it came to a vote the government and the coalition were not even prepared to have the Productivity Commission look at the feasibility of establishing such a fund.


This bill will help to ensure that large resource projects can only use skilled migration when all other avenues have been exhausted. Where EMAs are used, the bill will require high levels of compliance with workplace laws to ensure that all workers are protected. Disadvantaged groups will also be given priority for training and employment opportunities, and employers who use EMAs may be required to contribute to training for workers in the wider community.


As we saw recently, the current arrangements for EMAs do not meet community expectations. I agree with the Australian Council of Trade Unions that the current guidelines for EMAs fall short in a number of important respects, including, firstly, there being no guarantee that local workers have enforceable first rights to all jobs on EMA and projects and, secondly, that there is a lack of transparency regarding the contents of EMAs. This bill addresses those concerns. It improves the regulation of EMAs by putting them into legislation that sets out better processes for their establishment and ensures greater transparency for their operation. The bill will create a framework for enterprise migration agreements to ensure such agreements are used only where genuinely necessary and do not adversely affect local job opportunities. The bill will require employers to advertise jobs to locals before they can get an EMA. It will also require a local jobs board listing of those jobs in the resources sector to be maintained by the workplace relations minister. I acknowledge that after quite a long time in gestation such a board has been recently established by the government, but this bill will ensure that it stays in operation and will give it some legislative clout.


The current and future skills needs for Australia should be met through a considered approach that includes support for training and retraining of existing workers, labour market planning and forecasting linked to industry planning, and the use of skilled migration where appropriate. But skilled migration should never be a substitute for properly investing in and training the local workforce. It should be supplementary to locals skilled through domestic education and training. We should also aim to increase participation of those who continue to be under-represented in the workforce. This bill will help increase that participation.


The Greens support the making of EMAs only where every effort has been made to recruit locally. Where an EMA is established it should include a local jobs plan for the future, with a particular focus on training to be provided by EMA proponents. The plan should demonstrate how the project will reduce reliance on overseas labour by targeting training at those occupations in short supply. Unlike the current situation, responsibility for making an EMA will now legislatively rest with the immigration minister and the workplace relations minister to ensure coordination between these important portfolios.


The bill also sets out various conditions that can be included when an EMA is made. The workplace relations minister can require that the EMA participant concerned employs a specified number of Australian residents on the resource project concerned, including persons from one or more of the following groups: people living near the project, people who have been recently retrenched, people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities with high rates of unemployment, people from Indigenous groups and people from regions with high rates of unemployment. The workplace relations minister can also require that the EMA participant concerned provides specified training to persons employed on the project. In addition it can also be a requirement that the EMA participant concerned provides, or contributes to, training for Australian residents other than those employed under the EMA.


The workplace relations minister must also be satisfied that the EMA participant concerned has complied, and will continue to comply, with workplace laws. This is to ensure that all workers employed under EMAs are employed under the same wages, conditions and OHS standards as other workers. We have laws to protect everybody who works in Australia and we must ensure that these laws are enforced regardless of where people come from. This is an important point. Currently there is an economic incentive to employ people from overseas because the likelihood of someone from overseas knowing their full rights and then knowing how to insist on them is less than in an Australian workforce, especially an Australian unionised workforce. To that end, I am pleased to note that my colleague Senator Richard Di Natale will be moving in the Senate to have Australia ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.


This debate about EMAs does not need to be an either/or debate that pits various groups of workers against one another. What we do need to do is take greater steps to ensure that when people are working on remote projects and come to this country without an understanding of the minimum rights they are entitled to under the legal system the government takes extra steps to ensure that those people have full rights and know how to enforce them.


Lastly, this bill will require a copy of an EMA to be tabled in each House of the parliament as soon as practicable after it has been made. Transparency is not, and should never be, just be an esoteric principle—it should be practiced wherever possible. More information leads to better debate, which leads to better outcomes. As we have seen in the context of the recent Roy Hill EMA, a number of claims have been made about what is in that EMA and its benefits for the local population. Until copies of the EMA are made public and available to be tested, we will never know whether or not these agreements are delivering the benefits that they are said to. It should be very clear to an EMA seeker or participant that, if they want to get one of these EMAs, part of the condition for that is that the EMA will be made public and will need to be defended publicly.


The measures set out in this bill will ensure more job opportunities for locals and disadvantaged groups, more training for the future and more protection for those workers who bring their skills to Australia. Where EMAs are used, they will be based on genuine need and established through transparent processes. This bill is another step towards sharing the benefits of the boom, and I commend it to the House.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (11:29):  I thank the member for Forde for his bipartisan gesture. Economic reform in Australia has never been easy. In the post-war decades, the conservatives built up a tariff wall that helped make Australian industry uncompetitive and kept consumer prices high. In 1973, Gough Whitlam began the long process of breaking down Australia's tariff walls—the 25 per cent across-the-board tariff cuts. 


What did those opposite do? They came into this place and attacked him for it. Ralph Hunt, Michael MacKellar, Ian Sinclair and others criticised it. The Victorian Chamber of Manufactures condemned it. Yet nearly 40 years on, no-one is arguing for the tariff wall to be rebuilt. This, in a nutshell, is the story of economic reform in Australia—argued by Labor, often opposed by the conservatives and in the end becoming a part of the Australian social fabric. The result of reform is the prosperity that Australians now enjoy: four per cent growth rates, five per cent unemployment, two per cent inflation and the RBA cash rate of 3½ per cent—economic circumstances the rest of the world would give their eye teeth for.


But when those opposite speak about the economy there is only one place where they seem to be willing to tell the truth and that is London. When the opposition leader was in London recently he said:


… Australia has serious bragging rights. Compared to most developed countries, our economic circumstances are enviable.


When the member for North Sydney went to London he referred to the fact that Hong Kong, where debt levels are twice Australia's, had moderate government debt. He was certainly telling the truth and this clearly indicates his belief that Australia has low government debt. It is passing strange that it is only when they go to London—when they are in the 'mother country'—that those opposite can tell the truth about the Australian economy. It makes you wonder what is going through their heads. I think it could be something like, 'I did but see her passing by; I cannot tell an economic lie.'


It would be easy to spend 10 minutes talking about the protectionism of Barnaby Joyce, the DLP-style intervention of Tony Abbott, the backflips of Joe Hockey on the Parliamentary Budget Office and the opportunism around the debt ceiling. Those opposite would not know a Pigouvian tax if they tripped over one and they are the only ones in Australia who seem to think that royalties are better than a profits based tax for taxation of mining.


Back when they were introducing the GST, the coalition liked to point out that almost every OECD country had a GST. By 2015 there will be national or subnational emissions trading schemes in every OECD country but one; but now coalition MPs have changed their arguments. They say we should be lone wolves rather than running with the pack. Yet, as George Megalogenis reminds us in his most recent book, here is John Howard on 3 June 2007 promising:


This will be a world-class emissions trading system more comprehensive, more rigorously grounded in economics, and with better governance than anything in Europe. Implementing an emissions trading scheme and setting a long-term goal for reducing emissions will be the most momentous economic decision Australia will take in the next decade.


Similarly, a profits based mining tax is no more a left-wing idea than a good one. It was the Hawke government which introduced the petroleum resource rent tax and a profits based tax on uranium but it was conservative Sarah Palin who put a profits based tax on petroleum when she was governor of Alaska. It was the Northern Territory conservatives who were responsible for the profits based mining taxes that have worked so well in the NT. Profits based taxes are just a smarter way of taxing mining. They make sure that when world prices rise taxpayers share in the windfall. The current Liberal Party leadership has more in common with the DLP than the market oriented party of John Howard, Brendan Nelson and the member for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull. The current National Party leadership has more in common with the all-round protectionism of Black Jack McEwen than the reforming party of Tim Fischer and Mark Vaile.


But, rather than dwell on the coalition's economic illiteracy, I want to talk about the challenges and opportunities for Australia. With the rise of China, Australia sees great opportunities for our exports not only of goods but also of services. Australian finance and architecture firms are engaged with the Chinese boom. As we move to a more open economy we need to make sure that we keep investing in infrastructure and education. We know that boosting the quality and quantity of Australian education is absolutely essential as we move to a more open and technologically savvy world. We need to boost productivity. There was some reference last week to the Productivity Commission to-do list. Lost in that debate was the fact that on that list are things such as efficient water pricing, harmonised building codes and quicker processing of applications for major resource projects—all of which the government is pursuing. We also need to make sure that we help build an entrepreneurial culture. I pay tribute to Australia's latest Nobel laureate, Brian Schmidt, for his enthusiasm in making sure we develop more scientists and researchers.


When the Leader of the Opposition was asked why he could not find a single academic economist to back his command and control climate policy over Labor's market alternative, he responded by saying that this said something about 'the quality of Australia's economists'. Nothing could be further from the truth. Australian academic economics is as strong as it has ever been. Let me take a moment to note for the House some of the important research taking place. At the Australian National University, the Centre for Applied Macroeconomic Analysis has established a shadow Reserve Bank board to look at uncertainty around monetary policy. The shadow board comprises Paul Bloxham, Mark Crosby, Mardi Dungey, Saul Eslake, Bob Gregory, James Morley, Jeffrey Sheen, Mark Thirlwell, and Shaun Vahey. I acknowledge the work that Warwick McKibbin has done at the Australian National University to build CAMA into such a powerhouse.


At Deakin University, the Deakin Policy Forum is aimed at stimulating high quality discussion of economic policy. At Griffith University, the Economic Policy Analysis Program aims to foster economic research, particularly in the area of macroeconomics. Simon Ville and Glenn Withers are currently editing the Cambridge Economic History of Australia—because it is only by understanding your economic past that you can build good policies for the future. At the Melbourne Institute, the HILDA surveys facilitate hundreds of academic studies including work on employment, health, inequality, mobility, crime and happiness. Victoria University of Technology is hosting the Australian Conference of Economists from 9 to 12 July and I am looking forward to speaking and listening to some of the quality presentations at that conference. The ANU Crawford School's Economics and Environment Network was an important contributor to the development of an emissions trading scheme through its support for Professor Ross Garnaut. The Crawford School is also hosting a public policy week from 16 to 20 July, which will include a roundtable on the Henry tax review with James Mirrlees. The University of New South Wales has set up a Centre of Excellence in Population and Ageing Research involving economists and demographers. Monash University recently hosted a major development economics workshop supported by AusAID and involving Abijit Banerjee from MIT. Next month, Monash is hosting a joint conference with Warwick University on superannuation. The University of Queensland is running the 2012 Society for the Advancement of Economic Theory conference.


When Labor put an assets test on the pension in the early 1980s opposition leader Andrew Peacock called it an 'assault on the elderly' and promised to repeal it when the coalition won office. A decade after floating the dollar, the Leader of the Opposition still thought it was a bad idea.


For every reform, there will always be someone standing against it, but the thing is that history will forget the naysayers. History remembers the doers. Eventually, history will forget the doers and the parliamentarians who spoke for reform; it only remembers the things they did. The things we do in this place will outlast us. Reforms like an emissions trading scheme, a profits based mining tax, the National Disability Insurance Scheme, school infrastructure that will stand the test of generations and the National Broadband Network will be here long after those of us in this place have moved on. I thank the House.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2012-06-18,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (11:38):  I thank the member for Fraser for his motion. We have just listened to 10 minutes of talk about the opposition and about various university academic programs and, as usual, very little if anything about the government's economic record because it has no positive economic record to speak of.


Let us correct a couple of misconceptions from the member for Fraser's contribution to this debate. Firstly, we already have a profits based tax: it is called the company tax. No-one in the world has an economy-wide carbon tax, yet that is what this government is foisting on the Australian economy. Included in that is a $10 billion boondoggle for the clean energy fund to waste money on clean energy projects that are patently uncommercial. It is a sad, short summary of where this government's economic track record is.


Let us start with the final point of the member's motion, which:


… calls upon all Members to approach economic debates with facts rather than fear, and to put the national interest first when discussing the strong Australian economy.


Let us start with the definition of 'facts'. According to Dictionary.com a fact is something that exists; a reality or truth. A fact is 'something known to exist or to have happened' and 'known by actual experience or observation.' Let us look further at the member's motion, which states:


… OECD Economic Outlook 91 confirms that the Australian economy will significantly outperform OECD economies …


We do not know that. That is conjecture. It is an opinion. It is an estimation. It remains to be seen for the future. So it is not a fact. In addition, with regard to the statement about the IMF, the IMF has said of Australia:


… we welcome the authorities' commitment to return to a budget surplus by 2012-13 to rebuild fiscal buffers …


which will supposedly put 'Commonwealth government finances in a stronger position'. But does the IMF also welcome the government's move to increase the national credit card debt limit by another $50 billion? While the government says it wants to achieve a budget surplus of $1½ billion, it is still wanting an extra $50 billion. Last time I checked that did not add up. I do not think the IMF supports it, because it has made no comment about it.


The fact is this government continues to claim success for fiscal management which it cannot claim. The benefit of our current economic position has its genesis and its foundation in the reforms of the Hawke, Keating and Howard governments. That is what is continuing to benefit us today. It is the legacy of these reforms from which we still benefit.


Let us have a look at some of the other matters that were raised in this motion. There is a reference to government debt, and the member for Fraser touched on it briefly. I am pleased to see that, for a change, the member is staying in the chamber to listen. For our debt levels we can thank the hard work of the former Howard government which, under the stewardship of the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, succeeded in repaying $96 billion of accumulated Labor debt last time we came into government. Not only was this achieved but this government also came into office in 2007 with $70 billion of net assets and a $20 billion budget surplus. Since then this government has lived outside its means and accumulated $174 billion in budget deficits. Thanks to Labor we now share a net debt of $145 billion, which has been accumulated over only four-and-a-bit years. Given this government's track record, who knows where this figure will end up?


How will average Australians feel about some of the statements outlined in this motion, particularly as regards interest rates being at low levels by historical standards? Let me remind the House that the standard variable mortgage rate was 24 basis points lower on average under the coalition government during its term in office. On a typical $300,000 mortgage this difference would represent a saving under a coalition government of $720 a year or $60 a month.




Mr Perrett:
  What was it when we took office?




Mr VAN MANEN:
  Have a look at the spreads.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr KJ Thomson
):  Order! The member for Moreton will cease interjecting.




Mr VAN MANEN:
  The esteemed member for Moreton always has a contribution to make to the debate. Let us have a look at the spread on small business interest rates. It is not about the 3.5 per cent cash rate: that is not what Joe Public out there is paying—he is paying his mortgage rate to the bank. For small business the difference is even greater, with the spread for the average small business unsecured overdraft 135 basis points lower under the coalition than it was under Labor. For example, for a small business unsecured overdraft of $200,000 this represents a saving of $2,700 a year.


Let us not forget that the topic of interest rates is a double-sided coin. Last week I spent some time meeting with some of my constituents, and a number of them were self-funded retirees. Whilst a fall in interest rates is good for homeowners and small business borrowers, it is not very good for self-funded retirees because they rely on the interest rates they are getting on their money that is invested to fund their retirement. Once again this government only looks at half the picture. The majority of Australians will acknowledge that by historical standards unemployment, inflation and interest rates are at very low levels. But in reality they do not feel this as a day-to-day reality in their lives. Talk to a family man who is out of work or underemployed. Tell that to a family struggling to make ends meet, tell that to a pensioner who is living under the poverty line. There are real cost-of-living pressures out there that directly contradict Labor's economic celebrations. There are many examples of day-to-day financial struggles for pensioners, families and businesses that are the reality of what is being experienced day-to-day in our community.


This Labor government can stare through their rose-coloured glasses all they like but, at the end of the day, average Australians will not see it as a fact or believe it is great news because what they are experiencing right now is the very opposite of what this government says is happening. For example, food and petrol prices are up around 11 per cent, education and health costs have risen some 25 per cent. Under Labor, electricity has increased by some 66 per cent. It was only last week that I visited a local family owned commercial laundry operation in my electorate who expect their electricity and gas and fuel bills to increase somewhere between 10 and 25 per cent as a result of the world's biggest carbon tax. As it stands, many small businesses in my electorate are doing it tough. When I speak with business owners I hear about their struggles to pay the rent, to keep people employed and the challenges of competing with the high Australian dollar. They are not saying, 'Hey, Bert, isn't it great that interest rates are low,' or, 'Isn't it great that we have a AAA credit rating.' In actual fact, they are concerned about the rollout of the world's biggest carbon tax. 


This brings me to my last point about putting the national interest first when discussing the strong Australian economy. I say to the member opposite and to those in the government: if you really thought about the national interest first and keeping your job second, our economy would be in a much better position. For a long time now the people of this country have had to sit back and watch as this Labor-Greens government has voted in the carbon tax and an additional 26 new or increased taxes. I am more than happy to continue to put the national interest first when discussing the economy. I, along with my coalition colleagues, have been putting the interests of Australians first all along and we welcome the Labor-Greens government to do the same.

Mr SWAN
 (Lilley—Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer) (11:48):  I ask leave of the House to make a ministerial statement relating to the global economy.


Leave granted.




Mr SWAN:
  It has been my practice since the darkest days of the global financial crisis to keep the House updated on international developments and their implications for Australia. I do so today in the shadows of Greek elections overnight, just shortly before the Prime Minister meets with G20 leaders in Los Cabos. While we do not yet know the full implications of the results coming out of Greece, we do know that the G20 summit about to get underway is held at a time of heightened uncertainty in the global economy.


The Prime Minister and I have written to our counterparts outlining the need for Europe to take decisive action to stabilise their financial system and move towards deeper financial and fiscal union. All G20 members need to support growth and jobs, including through structural reforms, while putting their fiscal positions on a sustainable path. But we must be honest about the magnitude of the challenges facing Europe in particular, which no one meeting can fix entirely on its own.


I noted in the budget papers that the European economy as a whole was expected to contract in 2012 and that a re-escalation of the European sovereign debt crisis was the key risk to the global recovery. And despite a period of relative calm on global financial markets in the early months of this year, this was never going to mark the end of the global volatility. Recently, the tempo of global turbulence has risen again, this time triggered by the Greek elections and concerns around the Spanish banking sector.




Global and European 
o
utlook



The focus is obviously on Greece today. Adjustments necessary in Greece were always going to be difficult, with a disenchanted populace experiencing their fifth year of economic recession. The official outcome of the Greek election will not be known with any certainty today. But whatever the outcome, it is important that Greece's political parties quickly undertake coalition discussions and form a stable government.


We know that fear of contagion from Greece has already put upward pressure on government financing costs across many parts of Europe. Spain has also come under increasing pressure to address the substantial weaknesses in its financial sector, while at the same time meeting its ambitious fiscal targets. I welcome the support euro area finance ministers are providing to Spain to bolster their ailing banks, but it is crucial that further details of the package are released as soon as possible. While Greece and Spain have become the recent focus of Europe's distress, we should be under no illusions about the deep-seated challenges that confront Europe more broadly. Weak financial systems and fiscal positions continue to feed off each other at the expense of confidence and growth, and there has been insufficient political accord to make changes that are urgently needed. For the European project to prevail, what is needed is a pan-European approach that, once and for all, addresses the crisis. This type of unified approach must no longer be seen as a move that will threaten the individual interests of any one country, because the interests of each and every country within the euro area depend critically on the strength of the euro area as a whole. Only by moving forward with fiscal and political integration can Europe be saved. Europe needs to outline and, more importantly, deliver credible fiscal plans—policies that in the short run boost consumption and investment, and in the long run make budgets sustainable.


Good examples bring forward infrastructure projects that create jobs and demand in the short run, and add to productive capacity in the long run—precisely the type of investment that this government has persisted with, even at the height of the global crisis. The idea that you must choose between growth and fiscal consolidation is false. You can have growth then consolidation, so long as your plans are achievable and believable. The Australian pro-jobs, pro-growth model, with a well-anchored medium-term fiscal framework, is proof of that fact. By supporting growth in the face of the worst global recession in 80 years, we have emerged from the crisis in a position of strength that is virtually unrivalled. And by setting out a strict fiscal approach from day one, we are also returning to surplus ahead of all major advanced economies.




Rest of the 
w
orld



Against the backdrop of severe weakness in Europe, the United States economy continues to grow at a modest pace, though it has yet to achieve a self-sustaining recovery. GDP growth has improved since its soft patch in mid-2011, the unemployment rate has trended downwards, and even housing market indicators are registering tentative signs of improvement.


While these signs are encouraging, there is still underlying weakness in US labour and housing markets, and the US recovery remains vulnerable to further fallout in Europe. With much of Europe in recession and US growth still modest, the global recovery will continue to rely on emerging markets, particularly those in Asia. On IMF estimates, emerging economies contributed more than three-quarters of global growth in 2011, and this is expected to continue over the next two years. China has continued to grow at a robust, but more sustainable pace. Chinese policymakers are well-placed, if necessary, to use a range of policy tools, fiscal and monetary, to support growth—and indeed China has recently taken steps to do so.


We have seen this, for instance, through decisions by the Chinese government to speed up approval processes and bring forward infrastructure projects earmarked in the 12th five-year plan. Monetary policy has also been eased, including a reduction in the amount of funds that commercial banks must keep in reserve and a cut in the benchmark lending rate.




Australia



Amid the economic volatility now engulfing the world, Australia is recognised the world over as a beacon of strength, stability and resilience. The most recent data showcases our strong economic fundamentals that put our economy in a league of its own. Over the past year GDP grew by 4.3 per cent, the fastest pace in over four years.


We are officially growing faster than any of the major advanced economies and we are projected to outperform these economies over the next two years. While many advanced economies are not even back at the starting line yet, our economy is almost 10 per cent larger than it was just before the global financial crisis broke. Since this government came to office, over 800,000 jobs have been created. At the same time around 27 million jobs have been lost across the world.


These results have been made possible by the government's decisions to support our economy and jobs at a turbulent time. Our fiscal stimulus shielded our economy from the worst of the global recession, and our credible strategy to return the budget to surplus has underpinned the confidence that financial markets have in Australia. And in the face of rugged global circumstances we have not ignored or overlooked important investments in our productive capacity. Together, we have won the confidence and respect of the world through our actions and our resilience.


Confidence in our fiscal management is a key reason behind Australia receiving a AAA credit rating from all three major ratings agencies, for the first time in our history. Confidence in our financial system has ensured that Australian banks remain some of the most secure and highest-rated in the world. And confidence in the Australian economy has seen our pipeline of resources investment grow to a staggering half a trillion dollars. Over half of these projects are at an advanced stage, which provides a bedrock of support for our economy in uncertain times.


Of course, just as Australia has not been unaffected by global developments to date, we are not immune from a further deterioration in global conditions. While our economy walks tall, difficult global conditions have weighed on sentiment and demand for some of our exports, and we have seen the impact of global turbulence on our share market. Consumers are also more reluctant to take on debt, and this has contributed to subdued conditions in our housing market. And while some industries are booming, global headwinds have made it harder for some sectors already struggling from a high dollar and broader structural transitions underway in our economy.


We know there is some anxiety in our community during these times of economic turmoil abroad and structural change at home. But Australians can take great confidence in our rock-solid economic fundamentals and our standout performance in these testing times. Right now we have the best combination of impressive growth, low unemployment, contained inflation, strong public finances, low interest rates and a record pipeline of investment. We are only one of eight countries in the world to receive a AAA credit rating with a stable outlook from all three global ratings agencies. And during this difficult chapter for our global economy, there is an even greater responsibility of each and every member of this House to acknowledge the great strengths of our economy, our people and our businesses.




Conclusion



I accept that there will be continuing volatility from Europe for some time yet, but I do not accept that the pace and scale of action to address this has been adequate. As the Prime Minister gathers with our G20 colleagues in Mexico, the clear message that she and I have conveyed to our European colleagues is that we all have a responsibility to put world growth on a stronger and more sustainable path. And we will continue to remain closely engaged with our international counterparts to reinforce the strengths of the Australian economy and our region—a message I conveyed over the weekend to the managing director of the IMF, Christine Lagarde. We will continue to confront new challenges and opportunities with the same spirit of energy and resilience that our country is proudly known for.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2012-06-18,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (12:00):  We in the coalition fully appreciate that the global economy is delicately poised, not only with headwinds from Europe but also with moderating growth in the United States and some recent signs of a slowing in China. We also recognise that Australia's economy is not immune to the impacts of the global situation. Where the coalition differs from the government is in the approach that should be taken to respond to these challenges.


The Acting Prime Minister has advised the House that he and the Prime Minister have written to their European counterparts telling them of the need to stabilise their financial situation and put their fiscal positions onto a sustainable path. Well, this will hardly come as news to European leaders! I do not think European leaders will be dropping everything to read Prime Minister Gillard's letter. It was only last November that the Prime Minister was lecturing G20 leaders in France on concerns about European financial stability and on the need to act. That lecture had no discernible impact on recent decisions by European leaders, and it is clear that they would not pay any greater attention to our Prime Minister giving her new lecture—and I do not think the Treasurer of Australia will make any difference either.


We in the coalition suggest that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer should do less in the way of ink-based diplomacy, lecturing the Europeans with vague generalities about what their countries should do, and spend more time focusing on addressing the vulnerabilities which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have themselves created in the Australian economy—vulnerabilities exposing our economy in the event of a further downturn in the developed-world economy.


For the past few years, we in the coalition have been warning repeatedly of the risks that will face the Australian economy in the event of another global shock or a decline in our sky-high terms of trade. We have consistently urged the government to take the hard decisions to prepare our economy for volatile times. Unfortunately, these warnings have not been heeded by this government that has run out of ideas.


In the past few weeks we have received the news that growth in the March quarter was stronger than expected and that employment rose in May. We welcome the good news—although it is good news that comes through the rear-vision mirror. For example, it is notable that the rise in jobs in May was a reflection of the fact that we have had job growth at less than half what the Treasurer originally predicted when he boasted in the 2011-12 budget of 500,000 jobs being created over the next two years. Given that there were no new net jobs created—for the first time in nearly 20 years—in 2011, it was a pleasing outcome for May.


The more important point is that the labour market is a lagging indicator of the state of the economy. The March quarter growth figure tells us what was happening in the period three to six months ago. We now need to be focused on how the economy is travelling going forward. On that score, the Reserve Bank, which of course is forward-looking with monetary policy, has just cut the cash rate by 75 basis points over the last two months. At the same time, its accompanying statements have warned of a deterioration in financial market sentiment, of share market declines, of ongoing precautionary behaviour by households, and of further weakness in the housing market.


Then in the past 10 days we have also had current reads on both business and consumer sentiment. On the business side, the NAB monthly survey for May recorded sharp falls in business confidence and conditions, taking both back to below average levels. And on the consumer side, the Westpac sentiment index showed essentially no change in May or June from its weak levels, despite 75 basis points of cash rate cuts and a slew of government cash splashes.


It seems businesses are not impressed with a government that turns on a dime in changing its policies, including on the policy on company tax cuts, which it promised for two years and then dumped in the budget. And then, in a whimsical thought, the Prime Minister announced the other day that those cuts were back on the agenda, even though there is no money in the budget for them.


It seems consumers are not impressed with the government's attempts to buy their votes with handouts. Instead, they remain worried by this government's lack of any coherent economic strategy to lift growth, boost jobs and restore confidence. A lady came up to me last Saturday and said, 'Joe, why would I borrow money against any future earnings I have in this environment? With a government that seems to tax things out of the blue, with what is happening overseas, and with the instability in Canberra, why would I take the risk of borrowing money against any income I might get next year, and in subsequent years, to buy a home?' She said, 'I'm sitting on it. I'm sitting on what I have and, frankly, if I'm not going backwards in this environment, then I'm doing quite well.' I suppose that vox pop, if you like, in so many ways encapsulates the vulnerability this government has created.


It is not negativity from us—they keep talking about our negativity. I do not write the speeches or press releases for the head of Glencore, the head of BHP or the head of Harvey Norman. We do not write the press releases or media statements for Gerry Harvey or John Singleton. These people are at the coalface saying it is not as good as Labor say. In fact, the government are making it far worse by flip-flopping on policy and changing policy. There is no better example than the carbon tax, which so many of us are familiar with. And there are so many others, right back from 2008, when they changed employee share scheme arrangements and flip-flopped on that. They have flip-flopped on the mining tax over the years. 


They flip-flopped on withholding tax. That is a classic example which will be before the House soon. The government said they wanted to reduce withholding tax in Australia and in 2008 they reduced it from around 30 per cent to 7½ per cent to encourage foreign investment, particularly in commercial real estate. The coalition praised them for reducing the tax. Now the government say they are going to increase it from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent, which in itself leaves people confused. They thought there was a downward trend in relation to the tax but now the government are doubling it. Yet the government wonder why the world is so concerned about the sovereign risk in Australia.


Then there is the narrative from the government about the economy. The Treasurer does not talk about the 'patchwork economy' anymore, because he is making it harder not easier. They are making it harder for manufacturing by imposing a carbon tax on energy, which directly affects the value-add associated with manufacturing. Then, of all things, they go ahead and massively increase the passenger movement charge on the tourist industry, which they say has been going through such difficult times. 


International investors are wondering what the hell this government is about. It seems to think that the best way to make people more prosperous is to increase their taxes. This is the logic of Labor's economic narrative. I say, quite frankly, it is no wonder that when the rest of the world gets a letter from Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan they talk about it. The Prime Minister has said they are talking about that letter. I bet they are talking about that letter! They are rolling around in the aisles having a good giggle at that letter, because they are getting an economic lecture from Julia Gillard and Wayne Swan. The lecture is about how to be austere, how to live within your means. They are getting that from the Labor government of Australia and I bet they are they talking about that letter.


What matters is not just where all the risks to our economy come from but how we have prepared ourselves to deal with the risks. We remember the government's response to the collapse of Lehman Brothers after denying that there was any issue during the early part of 2008—in fact, declaring war on inflation and urging the Reserve Bank to increase interest rates at exactly the wrong time, the beginning of 2008. We remember this. We also remember that they inherited a situation where net debt did not exist—in fact, there was money in the bank. They inherited a strong surplus. The budget had recorded its fourth surplus in a row of 1½ per cent or more of GDP, and its tenth surplus of 12, under John Howard and Peter Costello. 


We are not in that position today. As we stand before the House, the budget deficit has increased to $44 billion this year. Let us talk about what it actually is, not what the government are promising. They are promising a surplus that, looking at their form, they will never deliver. In the current year they said there would be a $22 billion deficit and now we have a $44 billion deficit. They are cooking the books in order to promise a surplus next year. The Greeks got themselves into a bit of trouble cooking the figures. We are not on anything like that scale, but the truth is that if you include the NBN expenditure and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation then we are running a deficit. And the debt ceiling is increasing from $250 billion to $300 billion. The Prime Minister is giving the Europeans a lecture about austerity when she is increasing the debt limit of the Commonwealth government from $250 billion to $300 billion in a year when the government are promising a surplus.


Having more front than Myer, our Prime Minister is seeking to give the rest of the world a lecture. I say to our Prime Minister, 'Remind the world of where it all started: with a surplus, money in the bank and good consistent government that delivered stability and certainty.' (Time expired)

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (12:13):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, I present the committee's advisory report on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012. 


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Ms O'NEILL:
  by leave—I am pleased to speak to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services June 2012 report on its inquiry into the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012. These amendments are part of the SuperStream package of measures designed to enhance the back office of superannuation. The superannuation industry is currently dominated by a large number of paper transactions that are very inefficient for both processing costs and the time taken for transactions to occur and superannuation to be deposited in members' accounts. Members of superannuation funds and employers will both benefit from these changes, and it is estimated that the SuperStream measures are expected to save $1 billion in processing costs per year, which is quite a significant improvement. When averaged over the 33 million superannuation accounts, this translates to a saving in the order of $30 per account. Research undertaken by the Financial Services Council estimated that the reforms would deliver savings of up to $20 billion by 2020. 


The cost for implementing the SuperStream reform is $470 million over seven years. This will be paid by a SuperStream levy on Australian Prudential Regulation Authority regulated funds. Echoing the words of the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, if you averaged the full levy increase of $121 million to apply in 2012-13 across the approximate 33 million accounts existing today, the cost is roughly in the order of $4 per account. Just to put on the record why it is that we are in this position, I want to record today what it is that the Financial  Services Council described as the journey to the point we have reached. They stated:


Over the past decade, the industry has endeavoured to agree on a set of data standards for managing transaction between entities; however, we lack the capacity to compel external stakeholders and sometimes our own stakeholders to comply with industry developed standards. The introduction of these compulsory standards is therefore a welcome development as it will standardise processes for employers and funds in dealing with one another.


These comments about the need for leadership in this area and acknowledgement of the leadership shown by this Labor Gillard government are very much worth putting on the record here today. Further, I would like to record into Hansard the comments of Mr Murray who is the principal adviser on superannuation in Treasury and Mr Olesen, the deputy commissioner of superannuation at the Australian Taxation Office, who made the following comments. Mr Murray stated:


The background to these measures is that the superannuation industry has been trying for a considerable number of years to establish its own common standards and address these issues. Unfortunately, for various reasons, the industry has been unable to come to any agreement. The outcome of that has been a considerable number of different processes among the funds, there are considerable deadweight costs in the industry and they have these provisions for different requirements. The government has therefore been required to come in and become the decision-maker, to take control and push these reforms through, because unfortunately, to date, industry has not been able to come to an agreement itself.


Mr Olesen said:


I think the industry have tried at various times to develop some common data standards to use, but ultimately they have not been successful—hence, the government has taken these reforms.


I certainly stand here as a very proud member of the reforms that this government has undertaken in a range of fields but none are more important to so many Australians than this field of superannuation and financial services.


In terms of governance, the committee acknowledges that industry is seeking assurances that a sound governance framework is established to support SuperStream measures. To help usher in the changes contained in these bills the government has announced the establishment of the SuperStream Advisory Council, and two weeks ago we called for nominations from industry participants to be part of that council. This is another indication of how well this government is working with key stakeholders to make sure that we come up with policies and governance structures that advance the interests of all Australians and that we do it together. It stands in stark contrast to the carping negativity—the aggressive negativity—of those opposite.


To support that process further, a consultation paper has also been released. This paper has been met with approval by industry participants and underlines the government's commitment to working with the sector in implementing these important changes. The committee is assured that the governance framework provided through the SuperStream Advisory Council will provide an appropriate forum for industry members to speak to government on these reforms. 


With regard to the levy, the committee heard from some industry participants who expressed concern not about the scale of the levy but about how the levy would be spent. These concerns, in the committee's view, are very reasonable. The committee recommends measures that the Treasury has advanced. These measures are to encourage dialogue with industry on the costs of the SuperStream levy through the release of its discussion paper. We certainly as a committee encourage the industry to use this avenue to further discuss the detail of the high-level deliverables on SuperStream that were released by Treasury during the course of this inquiry.


The committee also notes that the levy is subject to annual review and should be adjusted when appropriate. However, to address industry concerns further, the committee also considers it highly appropriate that the Australian Taxation Office provide a regular detailed breakdown of costs and expenditure of the additional levies to the SuperStream Advisory Council. These would be based on reporting guidelines obviously developed in consultation between the council and the ATO.


I would like to underline the benefits that these changes will bring. In evidence to this committee, the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees focused on very significant productivity gains that this legislation will bring for industry and employers both large and small. Anything that supports productivity is something that this government is committed to assisting. The institute suggested that they expect savings of approximately 20 per cent in administration costs in the long term for the superannuation industry. That is quite a significant saving.


The committee is encouraged by the efforts already undertaken by the industry to adopt the SuperStream measures and to improve efficiencies in the administration of superannuation for the benefit of all employers and superannuation members—my fellow Australians. The committee also commends the extensive consultation and collaboration between industry and government officials that has taken place.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (12:21):  by leave—I too am pleased to speak to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services' June 2012 report on its inquiry into the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012. I am pleased to note that there is no dissenting report from this inquiry. The coalition is broadly supportive of any approach that reduces the administrative costs on employers and superannuation funds. Coming as I do from a background in the telecommunications industry, an industry which is characterised by extensive transmission of data between different players using information technology—including, for example, the mobile number portability arrangements under which end users can have their number moved from one telecommunications carrier to another within a matter of hours using extensive and efficient transmission of data—I was somewhat surprised to discover that in the superannuation sector there is still very heavy use of paper based transactions. The inefficiencies which result from that are clear to any Australian who has ever sought to move their superannuation balance from one provider to another. Therefore, the fundamental rationale underpinning this bill is one that the coalition supports.


However, it is not correct to say the coalition has no concerns about the way the legislation has been framed, and I want, in the brief time available to me, to highlight a couple of points that were made in the committee report, noting again that it is a joint report and the concerns were therefore, to that extent, shared by all members of the committee.


The first thing I want to highlight is that the bill is riddled with strict liability provisions. Unsurprisingly, a number of submitters to the committee raised concerns about the compliance regime. The Financial Services Council, for example, submitted that the proposed compliance measures for SuperStream are 'overly severe' and suggested that the penalty regime be reconsidered.


A particular concern which emerged during the committee's deliberations was the potential for the impact upon employers, and particularly small employers, given the nature of these strict liability provisions. Consider, for example, the position of a small business owner who is diligently seeking to discharge her obligations to pay superannuation for a handful of employees. She pays the amount required and pays it on time. However, the effect of the strict liability provisions in this bill is that, if this small business owner fails to include all of the items of data that are required under the standards, it is open to the regulator to prosecute her. Because the provisions are strict liability, it is not a defence for her to say that she thought that she was doing the right thing and that it was an inadvertent mistake born of the complexity of the reporting requirements. The Australian Taxation Office confirmed during the committee proceedings that this was certainly possible under the legislation as drafted.


It was somewhat pleasing to note the advice of the Australian Taxation Office that it has some administrative flexibility to waive or limit penalties where employers attempt to comply with the data standards but commit inadvertent technical breaches. However, the coalition will be keeping a close eye on the conduct of the Australian Taxation Office as regulator to ensure that its actual behaviour is as understanding as the assurances that it gave to the committee.


The other matter that I would like to address is one that was also addressed by the member for Robertson: the size of the levy which is being imposed upon industry participants to pay for the IT, information technology, changes that are required to give effect to these arrangements. The coalition is concerned about the size of this levy. The parties who appeared before the committee raised substantial concerns about how much money is being levied. The Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees indicated at the hearing that the levy will mean a lot of short-term pain for a long-term gain.


To date there has not been enough information provided by either Treasury or the Australian Taxation Office about how the money will be spent and why the amount is so large. The peak body of the superannuation funds, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, indicated that the amount that they, in their own experience, have spent developing complex IT systems is of much smaller magnitude than the sums which the Australian Taxation Office has indicated that it needs to develop its new IT systems. Given that developing IT systems and operating them is a core business function for superannuation funds, that advice from the superannuation funds and their peak body appearing before the committee is advice which, in my view, should be taken very seriously. The Australian Taxation Office needs to do a better job of justifying why it requires so much money to fund these information technology systems. That is a matter the coalition will continue to monitor closely.


Let me conclude by repeating that the coalition is broadly supportive of any approach that reduces the administrative costs inherent in the superannuation system. We do, however, have concerns about aspects of the implementation of these new arrangements as I have just described.

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (12:13):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, I present the committee's advisory report on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012. 


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Ms O'NEILL:
  by leave—I am pleased to speak to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services June 2012 report on its inquiry into the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012. These amendments are part of the SuperStream package of measures designed to enhance the back office of superannuation. The superannuation industry is currently dominated by a large number of paper transactions that are very inefficient for both processing costs and the time taken for transactions to occur and superannuation to be deposited in members' accounts. Members of superannuation funds and employers will both benefit from these changes, and it is estimated that the SuperStream measures are expected to save $1 billion in processing costs per year, which is quite a significant improvement. When averaged over the 33 million superannuation accounts, this translates to a saving in the order of $30 per account. Research undertaken by the Financial Services Council estimated that the reforms would deliver savings of up to $20 billion by 2020. 


The cost for implementing the SuperStream reform is $470 million over seven years. This will be paid by a SuperStream levy on Australian Prudential Regulation Authority regulated funds.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (12:49): The Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012 introduces a number of significant innovations aimed at improving gender equality. It will broaden the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 to encompass women and men, particularly their caring responsibilities. Also, for the first time, employers will be required to report on the gender composition of their boards. This is particularly dear to my heart, and I am very pleased that it is included in the bill. Smaller organisations with fewer than 100 employees will not be required to report, but they will be able to access the Workplace Gender Equality Agency's advice, education and incentive activities.


It is important to note that reporting will now be made easier for businesses and that it will be more meaningful and useful to them. Contrary to what those opposite have said, the minimum standards have been developed in consultation with industry and will provide employers with the capacity to assess and understand gender equality within their workplaces compared year by year with other workplaces within the industry.


We are removing red tape by allowing businesses to report online. The requirement for organisations to develop workplace programs will also be removed, and employers will now report against a set of gender equality indicators focusing on outcomes for both women and men in the workplace. Over time, the improved and standardised data will enable the minister to set minimum standards to target attention on areas where improvements are most needed. Minimum standards would be intended as an evidence-based way to identify and focus assistance on employers that require some direction on gender equality.


I am sure that, through this new reporting mechanism, many businesses will be able to focus more on gender equality, which will have a long-term benefit for their business. We want this bill to make reporting simpler and more useful for business so that business can achieve measurable progress. Many businesses may not be aware that, for example, having more women on their board will bring a different perspective to problems and issues that arise. I have spoken to many crusty old men on boards who are really appreciative of the views women can bring to the table on a whole range of issues, such as disability and access. I am sure that they would not mind me calling them 'crusty old men', because they are the ones who brought these issues up and have acknowledged, themselves, that they are crusty old men.



Mr Hartsuyker interjecting—



Mr Alexander interjecting—




Ms BRODTMANN:
  These are men who I have been on boards with in the past. They are wonderful men with a wealth of experience and expertise, and I am sure they would not mind me calling them that. They get it. They understand that greater diversity on their boards is in their companies' best interests. They understand it is a good thing.


We need to help more businesses realise this potential. It is reassuring that the big four banks are actually leading the way when it comes to increasing the number of women on boards. Other sectors doing well include diversified financials, telecommunications, transportation and insurance. However, companies engaged in commercial and professional services, consumer services and our big retailers rate poorly.


Another important element of this bill will enhance the agency's advisory and education functions. One of the functions of the agency will be to develop industry based benchmarks in relation to gender equality indicators. The agency will also have a more specified role in providing assistance and advice in relation to improving performance against any minimum standards, and it will have an important role in developing, maintaining and reporting on the data it collects across business, government and the community.


This bill improves the transparency and fairness of the compliance framework and the consequences of noncompliance, but it does not actually alter the compliance from the original legislation—the legislation introduced by the Howard government. Contrary to suggestions by those opposite, we have not changed it. More resources will mean the agency will be able to better ensure that all employers who should be reporting are actually reporting. The agency will be able to do small-scale compliance reviews to make sure employers are fulfilling their obligations under the act. Employers will be required to inform employees and shareholders that a report has been lodged, and employers will need to notify employees and employee organisations of the report's lodgement and be provided with an opportunity to comment. 


A consequence of not complying with the act without any reasonable excuse is that in the company or business may be named in parliament or more widely. Fairer, more consistent measures for ensuring that the government deals only with organisations that comply with the act will be developed.


It is important to outline exactly what the new objectives of the Workplace Gender Equality Act will be. The key new principal objectives are to: promote and improve gender equality, including equal remuneration between women and men, in employment and in the workplace; support employers to remove barriers to the full and equal participation of women in the workforce, in recognition of the disadvantaged position of women in relation to employment matters; promote amongst employers the elimination of discrimination on the basis of gender in relation to employment matters, including in relation to family and caring responsibilities; foster workplace consultation between employers and employees on issues concerning gender equality in employment and in the workplace; and improve the productivity and competitiveness of Australian business through the advancement of gender equality in employment and in the workplace.


These new objectives are more far-reaching and put the focus more on gender equality in the workplace. The bill now strikes the right balance between the need to drive and encourage change within business, without increasing the regulatory burden. 


Those opposite might try to argue against the qualities of this bill. They may try to argue it is not necessary legislation and that these are not issues our parliament should be concerned with. But I disagree. There has been extensive consultation with industry, employee organisations and the women's sector in the drafting of this legislation. There is a need for this legislation and we have reached a point where the all parties are comfortable with what we are proposing.


This is progressive legislation. It is legislation that will take Australian businesses forward and help shape the kind of workforce we want for the future. It is not good enough that in 2012 Australia is ranked 23rd on the World Economic Forum's 2011 Global Gender Gap Index, way behind countries like New Zealand, Cuba and Spain. It is not good enough that the average superannuation balance for Australian women is 40 per cent below that of men, with average payouts half those of men. It is time to take the necessary steps forward to address this gap before it gets any worse.


As I mentioned earlier, this bill is the result of an important review by the Office for Women in the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. It is clear that gender equality is essential if we are to maximise Australia's productive potential and ensure continued economic growth. As I said earlier, it has been estimated that closing the gap between men's and women's workforce participation could boost gross domestic product by 13 per cent. That really is the bottom line here. Gender equality is not just a social policy; it is an economic policy. The government is determined to improve women's economic security—and this begins with fair and equitable treatment in the workplace. It is simply good economics to improve gender equality in our workplaces, and this bill does so by placing gender equality in the workplace firmly under the spotlight. 


This is a sophisticated and meaningful package of reforms. It is a significant step forward that will enable employers and the government to measure and drive better outcomes for women and men in Australian workplaces. I commend the bill to the House.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2012-06-18,"



Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (12:58):  On 9 March, when this legislation originally surfaced, I said when I was acting spokesman on the status of women that this new so-called diversity regime was the sort of thing you would expect from a totalitarian regime which would lead to 'tokenism and the promotion of women simply because they are women'. I further described the proposal as 'heavy-handed, half baked and wasting $11.2 million', which was part of an agenda to strip away the rights of employers to run their businesses efficiently and employ people on merit. I stand by those comments.


It is interesting to take a look at the explanatory memorandum prepared by the government to support this bill and read some of the interesting material that is in it, which actually undermines the manner in which the government is attacking this issue of equality in the workplace, which we on this side of the House thoroughly support. We acknowledge that the contribution of women in the workforce is essential to the performance of our economy. But the snapshot proposals that are published in the government's own explanatory memorandum make statements like:


Women are more likely to be clerical, sales and community and personal service workers, while men are more likely to be technicians and trades workers, machinery operators and drivers and labourers. Women are still substantially under-represented in the manual trades in Australia, with the number of women in manual trades being less than 2 per cent.


Australian women are more likely to work under minimum conditions and be engaged in low-paid, casual and part-time work. It says:


Women workers are concentrated in the sectors of health care and social assistance and education and training (30 per cent of all female hours worked). When combined with the retail industry, 44 per cent per cent of total female hours worked are concentrated in just three industries. There is not a single industry in Australia in which women are paid more than men.


It also says:


A woman is approximately 50 per cent less likely to be employed as a manager, despite being equally likely to be in a full-time role in a professional capacity.


I think those comments are very pertinent in setting the scene to take me back to a report in December 2006 of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services, which I chaired, entitled Balancing work and family: report on the inquiry into balancing work and family. It was in that report that we made many important findings which are very supportive of the policy which is referred to in the amendment moved to this bill by the member for Farrer stating:


… whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that if the Government was genuinely committed to achieving equality for working women, it would adopt the Coalition s better, fairer Paid Parental Leave scheme …


which of course has something on the poor leave scheme that the government has put in place—minimum payments only and only for a lesser period of time than the coalition proposes. It also includes superannuation payments, which, of course, the government does not include.


In that report that I referred to we took evidence from a vast number of people, but one was from the Family Matters journal, where Matthew Gray and Professor Bruce Chapman investigated the issues of average loss of income for a hypothetical woman who completes secondary school and then commences having a family at the age of 25 with the option of further children. They said the simple fact of having a child reduces a woman's lifetime chance of being employed by seven per cent. The authors calculated that on average this hypothetical woman would lose 37 per cent of her lifetime earnings by having a child. They said the results for women with differing levels of education are similar. They went on to talk about the weekly earnings of an average employee who faces a decision, five years after finishing their education, whether to finish work, do part-time work or continue to work full time. They said employees who stay full time continue to increase their earning capacity. Those who change to part-time work or plateau and employees who leave the workforce face a reduced salary when they return, with the reduction increasing for the amount of time out of a job. In other words, at every turn there is enough evidence to say that real policies to see women remain in the workforce are gauged at enabling them to have a child, to be able to provide for that child in those early weeks with good financial backup and to feel that they can then go back into the workforce and not miss out on the important aspects that lead to increases in pay and not plateauing.


I think it is interesting to look at the statistics that came from one of the witnesses who gave evidence to us about what happens to women when they are using the education they have gained in more professional and higher-paid jobs. For instance, the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers Australia noted that, of their female membership, 69 per cent did not have children. By comparison, the current estimate for the Australian population generally is that 16 per cent of women are likely to remain childless. They said the very high proportion of childless female professionals found in the association's surveys reflects the reality that professional women with children are leaving the workforce or reducing their level of workforce participation due to family responsibilities.


It highlights one of the main reasons the government likes to criticise the proposed paid parental leave scheme that we are introducing and that would allow women to have 26 weeks at their replacement wage of up to $75,000: it would mean that we are acknowledging that there is important economic empowerment in higher-paid jobs as well as for those who are in lesser-paid jobs. This sort of inverted snobbery that the government likes to engage in does not recognise more women are now graduating from university than men. This potential to waste that education remains unrecognised by the government and, worse than that, in this legislation potential employers are being penalised.


The sort of additional red tape that this legislation imposes in its reporting requirements and the potential for so-called union involvement in investigating what is happening in small firms in particular means that people are going to be less likely to want to employ women at a higher level because of the nature of the legislation. I go to the point that we make: the failure to recognise that we want women who are utilising tertiary education to be able to do it in a way that they do not lose their place, dare I say it, in the pecking order.


When you look at the penalties that this legislation intends to impose upon firms, the Minister for the Status of Women has said:


Government trade with a non-compliant organisation will not just be discouraged, it will not be allowed by law.


Non-compliant companies will miss out on industry assistance, grants and government contracts—


and they will be non-compliant if they fall short of industry benchmarks or fail to improve over a two-year period. They will also be in breach of the rules if they fail to lodge a report as required, or fail to substantiate their report.


The fact of the matter is that this is to apply to any firm with 100 employees or more. These are the firms where we would hope that women with high qualifications would be seeking employment, yet the explanatory memorandum of the government's bill points out:


The workforce participation of mothers in Australia is low by international standards. Of Australian mothers with their youngest child under two, 82 per cent worked part-time and nearly half (45 per cent) worked 15 hours or less per week.43 The main barrier to full participation in paid work for women is difficulty balancing paid work and care responsibilities.


That is precisely what the opposition's policy is: to solve these problems so that women can continue in the paid workforce, utilise the education that they have acquired and see the statistics change so that they are not concentrated in the low-paid areas but are utilising that education to move up.


Red tape and penalising firms by preventing them from having government contracts is not the way to go. Nor is pumping $11.2 million of taxpayers' money into creating yet another piece of bureaucracy, this time called the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. It may be a make-work program for a number of people in the public sector to have yet another quango, but the fact of the matter is it is not going to assist women who are coming through education, as I said, at a greater rate than men in tertiary qualifications, yet this is not yet being reflected in workplace attainment.


The way forward is certainly not the red tape way in which this heavy-handed legislation is proceeding, but by accepting that the legislation—which, should we be elected, the opposition will introduce in government—for a fairer paid parental leave scheme will be one that will give real assistance to women to utilise their skills and not to find themselves plateaued or, indeed, falling behind and not making full use of those skills. Indeed, when we did this report back in 2006—and I have mentioned this before in a speech—we commissioned Access Economics to do an appraisal of women's participation in the workforce and what will happen if we do not improve the number of women who are in full-time work as distinct from part-time or indeed failing to participate.


The Access Economics report is at the back of the report I mentioned, and it simply shows that unless we do increase the number of women moving from part-time work into full-time work our economy will be seriously disadvantaged. So I say to the minister and I say particularly to women on the government side, particularly those who have got here by affirmative action: you do tend to make yourself a permanent second-class citizen if that is the way you wish to proceed. Women in Australia, as I see them, see that there is an opportunity to succeed on merit and to have the opportunity to utilise the skills that they are gaining. But it is not being done and it is not being helped by this heavy-handed legislation that is before the House.


I ask the government to reconsider the way it views women as being a political tool, and start looking at them as individuals who want to achieve and who aspire to contribute to the overall economy as well as being fine parents. Any publication you pick up about parenting shows that the number 1 concern people have when make their decision as to whether or not they wish to become parents is whether or not they can financially provide for that child. This sort of heavy-handed legislation does nothing to alleviate those concerns, but the splendid policy that has been put forward by the opposition for a fairer form of paid parental leave does answer many of those questions, and I would commend our policy rather than the government's as the way to proceed.

Mrs D'ATH
 (Petrie) (13:13):  I rise to speak in support of the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012, and I wish to briefly pick up on the point that the member for Mackellar just raised—that is, what many women, particularly mothers, are concerned about is making sure that they can make ends meet in relation to those cost of living pressures when you have a family. Certainly, as a member of this government I am very proud of our record of what we have delivered for working families—not just the paid parental leave but the dads' and partners' leave that has recently been introduced. You can also look at the increases to the family tax benefit B, the increases to the childcare benefit and the new schoolkid's bonus, just to name a small number of improvements this Labor government has made for working families and working women.


I know, as do all women of this parliament, how far we have come as a nation to instil quality in the workforce. The Labor Party has a very proud history of promoting and protecting equality, and with this amendment bill we aim to promote and improve gender equality in the workplace by recognising the vital importance of equal remuneration and family and caring responsibilities as central to the achievement of gender equality. Equality is core to the belief and purpose of the Labor Party, which was forged over 120 years ago out of a collective struggle for equality in the workplace, and as a government we have amended or introduced over 100 Commonwealth acts that eliminate discrimination. It is well over a decade since the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act was last reviewed and the economic, social and legislative landscape has changed significantly throughout that period. That is why Labor has acted. The former Minister for the Status of Women, the Hon. Tanya Plibersek, initiated a comprehensive review of the legislation and of the status of women and men in the workplace. That review found that the act needed to be updated and modernised to be fully effective in supporting and driving change in Australian workplaces.


I believe that gender equality in Australian workplaces is important for women, men, business and the economy more broadly. It has been estimated that closing the gap between women's and men's workforce participation could boost Australia's GDP by up to 13 per cent. Furthermore, extensive consultation has been undertaken with industry, employer organisations and the women's sector in the drafting of this legislation. We went to the people who will be directly affected by this legislation to find out what their needs are. That is why with this bill we have made sure that these changes are comprehensive, starting with the amendment of the name of the act to the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 to emphasise the focus of the act on gender equality, thereby improving outcomes for both women and men in the workplace. The name of the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency has also changed to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency and the title of the director of the agency has changed to the Director of Workplace Gender Equality to reflect the new focus of the act. The objects of the act will highlight the expanded coverage to men, particularly in relation to caring responsibilities, as well as highlighting the importance of equal remuneration to gender equality. I think this is very important because in listening to the member for Mackellar's statement on this bill, at no point was it acknowledged that this bill actually picks up on men's caring responsibilities and equality across genders.


The objects also make clear the underpinning nature of gender equality to improved competitiveness and productivity, and the particular need to focus on removing barriers to women's full and equal workforce participation. Thus, this proposed legislation presents a new framework for promoting and encouraging gender equality in Australian workplaces. The bill fulfils a dual purpose of supporting improved workforce participation, particularly of women and carers, as well as reducing the regulatory burden on business. We heard the member for Mackellar claiming that this bill actually increases the burden, but this bill does not introduce more compliance measures, it is based on the compliance measures in the existing legislation, which the Howard government introduced. There has been some criticism raised about this bill creating too much red tape, but in fact the compliance measures in this bill allow for processes to be filled out online—and they are simple to fill in—which has been included at the request of business. It was business in the consultation period that identified that this type of compliance system was preferred and that is what this bill proposes, so I recommend that the members of the opposition actually go and consult with those employers about red tape and compliance because this change in the bill has come about as a consequence of what employers are asking for. Relevant employers will no longer need to provide descriptions of their policies and programs, but will report against gender equality indicators, focussing on tangible outcomes and practices. Reporting, while clearly easier for business, will also be more meaningful and useful. It will provide employers with the capacity to assess and understand gender equality within their workplaces, compared year by year and with other workplaces within their industry.


The agency's advisory and education functions will be enhanced. The contemporary data focus will allow the agency to see and target advice and education as effectively as possible as particular sectoral or industry issues emerge. Smaller organisations—those with fewer than 100 employees—will not be required to report, but will be able to access the agency's expertise and expanded online resources. Over time, the improved and standardised data set will assist the minister in setting industry specific minimum standards against the gender equality indicators. The minister will consult with relevant stakeholders, as she sees appropriate, in the setting of those minimum standards. These minimum standards will help the agency maximise the impact of its education and advice. The bill provides that the agency must provide any employers who fail to meet the minimum standard with assistance aimed specifically at improving their performance against that minimum standard. We heard from the member for Mackellar claiming that it is all about a big stick in cases when a particular employer does not meet the minimum standard, but what this bill does is provide those employers with assistance aimed at specifically improving their performance and meeting those standards.


In addition to the minister setting these minimum standards, the agency will set benchmarks in relation to the gender equality indicators, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, which will not be part of the compliance framework. The benchmarks are intended as a way for the agency to collect, analyse and express the data collected from public reports in a useful and meaningful way. These benchmarks will enable relevant employers to consider their workplace outcomes and practices in relation to their industry peers and compared to their own performance from year to year. The bill facilitates the engagement of senior management and employees. The chief executive officer, or equivalent, will be required to sign-off on organisations' reports. Consultation with employees is a defined gender equality indicator. This is to ensure that the legislation is not simply about filling out paperwork and reporting, it is about meeting real outcomes.


The bill also improves the transparency and fairness of the compliance framework and the consequences of non-compliance. The agency will be able to check compliance by seeking information from employers relevant to compliance. Employees and shareholders will be provided with access to the report, and employees and employee organisations will be provided with opportunity to comment on the report. There is nothing wrong with employees having access to reports that relate to their workplace and benefits for women in the workplace. The consequences of non-compliance build on the existing provisions, but with a focus on improving transparency and consistency of application. If an employer does not comply, without a reasonable excuse, they may be named in a report to the minister or more broadly. Employers may also not be eligible to compete for Commonwealth contracts, grants or other financial assistance. This is an existing policy, but work is being done within government to ensure greater consistency and transparency in its application. To enable employers to have sufficient time to adapt to the new framework, the provisions of the bill are being phased in. The first full new reports will be due in 2014. The new framework will also enable the government, policymakers and the community to have access to better aggregate information about gender equality in Australian workplaces. The bill provides that the agency report every two years on progress relating to the gender equality indicators. The bill achieves a clear balance in addressing the needs of business by making reporting simpler and more streamlined, supported by a new online interface. It also, however, ensures a much greater focus on outcomes to effect genuine and sustainable change over time.


The government has engaged in significant consultation with key stakeholders in developing the proposed legislation. In 2011, the government convened an implementation advisory group to assist with the improvements to the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999. Membership of the industry advisory group consists of key representatives from industry, unions and business, as well as experts in the fields of gender equality and workplace issues.


This legislation is about supporting employers to achieve cultural change; it is not about punishing employers or setting unreasonable standards that they cannot meet. Since the bill was introduced on 1 March 2012, a number of organisations and individuals have indicated support for the changes to the legislation. This support has come from industry, employee organisations and the women's sector. This amendment is one piece of a broader Labor effort to build stronger and fairer partnerships in the workplace. I commend the bill to the House.

"Andrews, Karen, MP",LP,2012-06-18,"



Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (13:23):  I rise today to speak on the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012 and I welcome the opportunity to speak specifically about the issue of gender equality in Australian workplaces. The bill being debated today seeks to amend the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999 by firstly changing the name of the act to the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012, with the objects of the act to be amended as wel1. The bill will expand the advice and education functions of the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, with changes also set to be made to the compliance framework for employers. The coverage of the act is set to be widened, with men being covered as well as women, and it is extended to all employers and employees in the workplace.


The issue of gender equality is a very important issue for the coalition and is an issue which I personally find very significant, having graduated as a mechanical engineer and spent much of my professional working life in male-dominated industries. I would like to make it clear from the outset that women and men can and should contribute to all aspects of Australian life in their own ways. In relation to employment opportunities for men and women, I strongly believe that businesses should be employing, retaining and promoting individuals based on merit, not on their gender. It is a core belief of the coalition that government interference into the life of individuals and businesses should be minimised as much as possible. I therefore do not support efforts that seek to increase the level of government interference in the workplace.


I would like to begin my contribution to this debate by highlighting several concerns I have with this bill. I have already mentioned my objection to unnecessary government interference in businesses' ability to employ individuals based on their merit. I therefore have concerns that this bill may impose additional red tape for business and therefore unacceptable increased levels of regulation. The two main concerns that I have relate to the cost to business and whether the new reporting framework actually simplifies and streamlines the reporting requirements for employers. I also have concerns about whether the Workplace Gender Equality Agency will have the necessary resources to carry out its expanded role, and why the new term 'employee organisation' is inserted into the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act. 


In relation to the first issue I have, with regard to the costs to business, it seems unlikely that resourcing costs will decrease, as is claimed by the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. The changes proposed in this bill go further than the gender equality rules which apply now to ASX listed companies. Currently, ASX listed companies are required to comply with the ASX corporate governance principles and publish workplace gender diversity policies and have their objectives for achieving these policies disclosed each year. These companies are also required to release information that shows the proportion of women in the company and how many women are in senior management positions as well as on the organisation's board. The provisions of this bill should not be going further than the current obligations on companies, as it is likely that additional costs will be imposed on these businesses through the reporting requirements this bill proposes.


The second concern that I have relates to the bill's proposal to simplify and streamline reporting—however, it is not clear how the new reporting framework will achieve this goal. Under the proposed new reporting framework, employers must report against gender equality indicators. This must be a public report prepared by the employer and it is required to contain matters specified in the legislative instrument made by the minister. The bill, however, does not make it clear what 'matters' are to be specified and there is therefore uncertainty for employers about what they must report on under this proposed new framework. Because of this uncertainty it is difficult to see how reporting for employers will be simplified and streamlined.


This brings me to the two additional concerns I have, which, again, deal with some uncertainty with what the bill seeks to achieve and the provisions' ability to achieve these aims. Firstly, the Workplace Gender Equality Agency is given expanded roles to provide targeted advice and assistance to relevant employers, so that they can promote and improve gender equality in relation to minimum standards. As this is an expanded role, it appears that the agency would require additional resources to effectively undertake this role; however, it is unclear from the bills whether these additional resources will be provided. Secondly, the term 'employee organisation' is already given meaning under section 12 of the Fair Work Act 2009; however, this bill also inserts a new term into the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act. Clarification needs to be made in relation to this provision, as it seems unnecessary to include a new term when it already exists in the Fair Work Act. These are the technical issues with the bill; however, we must remember that there are larger issues relating to female participation in the workforce which deserve greater scrutiny. 


I would now like to highlight some recent statistics which give us an idea of how the current workforce as a whole looks. The recent labour force statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics give us a snapshot of the female participation rate in our workforce. I have picked a period from earlier this year. The participation rate for females during the February period, seasonally adjusted, was 58.7 per cent. This is significantly lower than the male participation rate during the same period, which was 71.7 per cent. I would also like to point out that the number of females employed in total for February is significantly lower compared with males. According to the ABS, there are over 5.2 million females employed, while there are over 6.2 million males employed. More than double the number of females are employed part time compared with males, with figures showing part-time female workers at about 2.374 million compared with just over one million males employed on a part-time basis. If we look at the employment of women in different industries, it becomes clear that there are specific industries where the employment of women is significantly lower compared with males. A look at 18 different industry groups reveals that only six industries have a majority of women employed either part time or full time. These industries are retail trade, with 56.4 per cent; accommodation and food services, with 55 per cent; financial and insurance services, with 50.9 per cent; administrative and support services, with 52.3 per cent; education and training, with 69 per cent; and health care and social assistance, with 78.8 per cent. A further seven industries have female part-time or full-time-equivalent employees at levels that are below 40 per cent: agriculture, forestry and fishing; mining; manufacturing; electricity, gas, water and waste services; construction; wholesale trade; and transport, postal and warehousing. The construction industry was at the lowest level, with women comprising only 11.6 per cent of employees. These statistics clearly demonstrate that we need to get more women into the workforce and improve their representations in industries almost across the board.


I am an enthusiastic advocate for improvement in the labour force participation rates for women and know that we can enhance our contributions to the economic and social wellbeing of Australia. In fact, earlier this year I raised these issues in this place and emphasised the need for work to be organised so family responsibilities can also be balanced. The figures I mentioned earlier regarding women predominantly taking up part-time work further justify my claim.


In concluding today I repeat my call to break down the barriers impeding improved female participation rates in the workforce and getting women back into the workforce. If we are serious, we need to identify what those barriers are and we need to take positive action to encourage and support more women in maintaining their place in the workforce or re-entering the workforce. Two issues have been identified to me very clearly within the electorate and quite widely around Australia. The first issue is good-quality and affordable child care. The second is an issue that, as I have indicated previously, I have touched on already in this place—work organisation to make it more appropriate and more attractive for women with family responsibilities to re-enter the workforce.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (13:35):  I rise to voice my strong support for the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012. This bill is the next step in the Gillard government's assault on inequity and discrimination in Australian workplaces. On this side of the House we can hold our heads high in this regard. We have delivered Australia's first paid parental leave scheme, which provides real support to working mums and dads and their young families—truly momentous. This is not pie-in-the-sky stuff; it is a practical, fair and sustainable scheme that provides financial assistance when they need it most. 


For women the road to equality has been a long and difficult one. Along this road we often take baby steps—and I use that term deliberately—but we are getting there. Australia was one of the first countries in the world to give women the right to vote and to sit in parliament. We were just pipped by New Zealand. After that, it was not until 1949 that our first female federal cabinet minister was appointed. That took 49 years. Up until 1966—which is not that long ago, as 1966 was when I was born—women working in the federal Public Service were required to resign when they married. In the last 50 years much has been achieved for women in equality in education, in the workplace and in things such as safe contraception and access to childcare facilities. In 1984 the federal government banned discrimination on the basis of sex. Today, more women than men are educated at secondary schools and universities and more women graduate from university with bachelor degrees. In 2006, women made up nearly 55 per cent of tertiary students and 47.5 per cent of students enrolled in vocational education and training courses. Forty per cent of Australia's small business operators are women and 57 per cent of the Australian Public Service are women, with around 36 per cent of senior executive positions. It is a different story in the private sector, where, sadly, only 12 per cent of management jobs are held by women. Progress is continuing but more needs to be done.


Let's have a look at parliament: there are currently more women parliamentarians in the Senate than at any other time since Federation, with 28 women out of 76; but, sadly, the number of women in this chamber dropped at the last election and is now less than 25 per cent. So 111 years after Federation we are down to less than one in four members of this chamber being women. Of course, in the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, we have Australia's first female Prime Minister, and likewise in Quentin Bryce we have Australia's first female Governor-General—a proud Queenslander, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott.


It is interesting to see how the Liberal National Premier of Queensland dealt with women in the workplace when he was the Lord Mayor of Brisbane. I have spoken about this with one of the councillors in the Moreton electorate and that is Councillor Nicole Johnston—now an Independent but previously a member of the Liberal Party. She was the councillor assisting Lord Mayor Campbell Newman, as he then was, before she decided that her job as a Liberal councillor for Tennyson required her to speak out on behalf of Sherwood residents about the bus depot that was rather hastily foisted on the local community. After Nicole dared to speak up and voice local community concerns, she says that she was frozen out by Mr Newman. He refused to speak to her. Thankfully, she was re-elected, not for Labor but as an Independent, at the recent council elections. Unfortunately, I have heard the now Premier Newman bagging the hardworking Nicole Johnston to all and sundry. He was quite indiscreet, in fact, in the past. Perhaps things might change now that he is the Premier. This might suggest poor judgment, a personality flaw or a huge lack of respect for women; we will see. Obviously, Mr Newman has a long way to go if he wants all Queenslanders to believe that such treatment is behind him.


In Queensland, of the 78 seats held by the LNP, less than 17 per cent are female. The LNP's representation of women is in line with countries like Kazakhstan and Venezuela. Obviously it is not good for a modern political party to have such disregard for equality. There is no minister for women under the state LNP government, and who knows what they will axe next? We will wait and see. There are still some sections of the community—both broadly known and smaller pockets—that are coming to terms with the proper way to treat and provide equal opportunity for women.


This bill before the chamber delivers on the Gillard Labor government's commitment to improve the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999. The bill changes the name of the act to the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012, because this is about improving outcomes for women and men in the workplace. The bill also changes the emphasis of the act to promote and improve gender equality in the workplace and achieve equal remuneration and a stronger focus on family and caring responsibilities. The bill also introduces a new reporting framework which requires employers with 100 or more employees—so not small businesses—to report against a set of gender equality indicators. A new online reporting facility will be easier and more useful, and will enable businesses to compare how they are travelling against other workplaces in their industry. Over time the data will enable the minister to set minimum standards for employers. 


The renamed Workplace Gender Equality Agency will also be required to develop industry based benchmarks regarding gender equality. They will then use these indicators to assist industry to meet these benchmarks. Employees and shareholders will be provided with access to a business compliance report, ensuring greater transparency and accountability for meeting gender benchmarks. I am pleased to see that extensive consultation has been carried out through the review of the act and broad consultation has continued throughout the reform process. I particularly commend the Minister for the Status of Women, Julie Collins, for her work directly engaging with key stakeholders in the development of the bill. This is an important piece of legislation in efforts to improve gender equality in the workplace—something that I am sure all members of parliament and all Australians would support. 


Back in 2009, I was part of an inquiry into pay equity as part of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment and Workplace Relations, chaired by the then member for Hasluck, Sharryn Jackson. The report Making it fair: pay equity and associated issues related to increasing female participation in the workforce made 63 recommendations. Unfortunately, I cannot stand here today and hold up that report and say that we have achieved all 63 of those recommendations, but nevertheless it is a bit of a guide—a path that this parliament might go down to achieve true equality. This bill implements some of those recommendations, particularly around better reporting, because it is through the information of reporting that businesses, governments and other institutions will be able to say: 'We've done this so far and we'll now be able to take the next step in achieving equality in the workforce.'


I take you back to some facts that are quite disconcerting: not that long ago, only 46 years, when a woman was married, the social expectation was that if she was in the federal Public Service she would resign, with the presumption she would be supported by her husband. A lot has been achieved, and I would like to particularly commend the efforts of the Prime Minister as she has quietly in her steely, strong, determined way gone about proving that women can do anything in Australia. I have often had people in my electorate come up when I am with the Prime Minister to say that they respect what she has done for their daughters and their grandchildren and to say thank you for leading the nation in such a way. Whilst there are suggestions from both sides of parliament, it is complicated when you look at the data and say that merit will out. The reality is that when half of the population is female but less than 25 per cent of the MPs in this chamber are female there is something going wrong—otherwise you must make the flawed presumption that half of the women in Australia do not have the same merit when it comes to being a proper representative. This bill is a great way to go. It is a step in the right direction and I commend the bill to the House.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (12:49): The Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012 introduces a number of significant innovations aimed at improving gender equality. It will broaden the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 to encompass women and men, particularly their caring responsibilities. Also, for the first time, employers will be required to report on the gender composition of their boards. This is particularly dear to my heart, and I am very pleased that it is included in the bill. Smaller organisations with fewer than 100 employees will not be required to report, but they will be able to access the Workplace Gender Equality Agency's advice, education and incentive activities.


It is important to note that reporting will now be made easier for businesses and that it will be more meaningful and useful to them. Contrary to what those opposite have said, the minimum standards have been developed in consultation with industry and will provide employers with the capacity to assess and understand gender equality within their workplaces compared year by year with other workplaces within the industry.


We are removing red tape by allowing businesses to report online. The requirement for organisations to develop workplace programs will also be removed, and employers will now report against a set of gender equality indicators focusing on outcomes for both women and men in the workplace. Over time, the improved and standardised data will enable the minister to set minimum standards to target attention on areas where improvements are most needed. Minimum standards would be intended as an evidence-based way to identify and focus assistance on employers that require some direction on gender equality.


I am sure that, through this new reporting mechanism, many businesses will be able to focus more on gender equality, which will have a long-term benefit for their business. We want this bill to make reporting simpler and more useful for business so that business can achieve measurable progress. Many businesses may not be aware that, for example, having more women on their board will bring a different perspective to problems and issues that arise. I have spoken to many crusty old men on boards who are really appreciative of the views women can bring to the table on a whole range of issues, such as disability and access. I am sure that they would not mind me calling them 'crusty old men', because they are the ones who brought these issues up and have acknowledged, themselves, that they are crusty old men.



Mr Hartsuyker interjecting—



Mr Alexander interjecting—




Ms BRODTMANN:
  These are men who I have been on boards with in the past. They are wonderful men with a wealth of experience and expertise, and I am sure they would not mind me calling them that. They get it. They understand that greater diversity on their boards is in their companies' best interests. They understand it is a good thing.


We need to help more businesses realise this potential. It is reassuring that the big four banks are actually leading the way when it comes to increasing the number of women on boards. Other sectors doing well include diversified financials, telecommunications, transportation and insurance. However, companies engaged in commercial and professional services, consumer services and our big retailers rate poorly.


Another important element of this bill will enhance the agency's advisory and education functions. One of the functions of the agency will be to develop industry based benchmarks in relation to gender equality indicators. The agency will also have a more specified role in providing assistance and advice in relation to improving performance against any minimum standards, and it will have an important role in developing, maintaining and reporting on the data it collects across business, government and the community.


This bill improves the transparency and fairness of the compliance framework and the consequences of noncompliance, but it does not actually alter the compliance from the original legislation—the legislation introduced by the Howard government. Contrary to suggestions by those opposite, we have not changed it. More resources will mean the agency will be able to better ensure that all employers who should be reporting are actually reporting. The agency will be able to do small-scale compliance reviews to make sure employers are fulfilling their obligations under the act. Employers will be required to inform employees and shareholders that a report has been lodged, and employers will need to notify employees and employee organisations of the report's lodgement and be provided with an opportunity to comment. 


A consequence of not complying with the act without any reasonable excuse is that in the company or business may be named in parliament or more widely. Fairer, more consistent measures for ensuring that the government deals only with organisations that comply with the act will be developed.


It is important to outline exactly what the new objectives of the Workplace Gender Equality Act will be. The key new principal objectives are to: promote and improve gender equality, including equal remuneration between women and men, in employment and in the workplace; support employers to remove barriers to the full and equal participation of women in the workforce, in recognition of the disadvantaged position of women in relation to employment matters; promote amongst employers the elimination of discrimination on the basis of gender in relation to employment matters, including in relation to family and caring responsibilities; foster workplace consultation between employers and employees on issues concerning gender equality in employment and in the workplace; and improve the productivity and competitiveness of Australian business through the advancement of gender equality in employment and in the workplace.


These new objectives are more far-reaching and put the focus more on gender equality in the workplace. The bill now strikes the right balance between the need to drive and encourage change within business, without increasing the regulatory burden. 


Those opposite might try to argue against the qualities of this bill. They may try to argue it is not necessary legislation and that these are not issues our parliament should be concerned with. But I disagree. There has been extensive consultation with industry, employee organisations and the women's sector in the drafting of this legislation. There is a need for this legislation and we have reached a point where the all parties are comfortable with what we are proposing.


This is progressive legislation. It is legislation that will take Australian businesses forward and help shape the kind of workforce we want for the future. It is not good enough that in 2012 Australia is ranked 23rd on the World Economic Forum's 2011 Global Gender Gap Index, way behind countries like New Zealand, Cuba and Spain. It is not good enough that the average superannuation balance for Australian women is 40 per cent below that of men, with average payouts half those of men. It is time to take the necessary steps forward to address this gap before it gets any worse.


As I mentioned earlier, this bill is the result of an important review by the Office for Women in the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. It is clear that gender equality is essential if we are to maximise Australia's productive potential and ensure continued economic growth. As I said earlier, it has been estimated that closing the gap between men's and women's workforce participation could boost gross domestic product by 13 per cent. That really is the bottom line here. Gender equality is not just a social policy; it is an economic policy. The government is determined to improve women's economic security—and this begins with fair and equitable treatment in the workplace. It is simply good economics to improve gender equality in our workplaces, and this bill does so by placing gender equality in the workplace firmly under the spotlight. 


This is a sophisticated and meaningful package of reforms. It is a significant step forward that will enable employers and the government to measure and drive better outcomes for women and men in Australian workplaces. I commend the bill to the House.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2012-06-18,"



Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (12:58):  On 9 March, when this legislation originally surfaced, I said when I was acting spokesman on the status of women that this new so-called diversity regime was the sort of thing you would expect from a totalitarian regime which would lead to 'tokenism and the promotion of women simply because they are women'. I further described the proposal as 'heavy-handed, half baked and wasting $11.2 million', which was part of an agenda to strip away the rights of employers to run their businesses efficiently and employ people on merit. I stand by those comments.


It is interesting to take a look at the explanatory memorandum prepared by the government to support this bill and read some of the interesting material that is in it, which actually undermines the manner in which the government is attacking this issue of equality in the workplace, which we on this side of the House thoroughly support. We acknowledge that the contribution of women in the workforce is essential to the performance of our economy. But the snapshot proposals that are published in the government's own explanatory memorandum make statements like:


Women are more likely to be clerical, sales and community and personal service workers, while men are more likely to be technicians and trades workers, machinery operators and drivers and labourers. Women are still substantially under-represented in the manual trades in Australia, with the number of women in manual trades being less than 2 per cent.


Australian women are more likely to work under minimum conditions and be engaged in low-paid, casual and part-time work. It says:


Women workers are concentrated in the sectors of health care and social assistance and education and training (30 per cent of all female hours worked). When combined with the retail industry, 44 per cent per cent of total female hours worked are concentrated in just three industries. There is not a single industry in Australia in which women are paid more than men.


It also says:


A woman is approximately 50 per cent less likely to be employed as a manager, despite being equally likely to be in a full-time role in a professional capacity.


I think those comments are very pertinent in setting the scene to take me back to a report in December 2006 of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services, which I chaired, entitled Balancing work and family: report on the inquiry into balancing work and family. It was in that report that we made many important findings which are very supportive of the policy which is referred to in the amendment moved to this bill by the member for Farrer stating:


… whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes that if the Government was genuinely committed to achieving equality for working women, it would adopt the Coalition s better, fairer Paid Parental Leave scheme …


which of course has something on the poor leave scheme that the government has put in place—minimum payments only and only for a lesser period of time than the coalition proposes. It also includes superannuation payments, which, of course, the government does not include.


In that report that I referred to we took evidence from a vast number of people, but one was from the Family Matters journal, where Matthew Gray and Professor Bruce Chapman investigated the issues of average loss of income for a hypothetical woman who completes secondary school and then commences having a family at the age of 25 with the option of further children. They said the simple fact of having a child reduces a woman's lifetime chance of being employed by seven per cent. The authors calculated that on average this hypothetical woman would lose 37 per cent of her lifetime earnings by having a child. They said the results for women with differing levels of education are similar. They went on to talk about the weekly earnings of an average employee who faces a decision, five years after finishing their education, whether to finish work, do part-time work or continue to work full time. They said employees who stay full time continue to increase their earning capacity. Those who change to part-time work or plateau and employees who leave the workforce face a reduced salary when they return, with the reduction increasing for the amount of time out of a job. In other words, at every turn there is enough evidence to say that real policies to see women remain in the workforce are gauged at enabling them to have a child, to be able to provide for that child in those early weeks with good financial backup and to feel that they can then go back into the workforce and not miss out on the important aspects that lead to increases in pay and not plateauing.


I think it is interesting to look at the statistics that came from one of the witnesses who gave evidence to us about what happens to women when they are using the education they have gained in more professional and higher-paid jobs. For instance, the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers Australia noted that, of their female membership, 69 per cent did not have children. By comparison, the current estimate for the Australian population generally is that 16 per cent of women are likely to remain childless. They said the very high proportion of childless female professionals found in the association's surveys reflects the reality that professional women with children are leaving the workforce or reducing their level of workforce participation due to family responsibilities.


It highlights one of the main reasons the government likes to criticise the proposed paid parental leave scheme that we are introducing and that would allow women to have 26 weeks at their replacement wage of up to $75,000: it would mean that we are acknowledging that there is important economic empowerment in higher-paid jobs as well as for those who are in lesser-paid jobs. This sort of inverted snobbery that the government likes to engage in does not recognise more women are now graduating from university than men. This potential to waste that education remains unrecognised by the government and, worse than that, in this legislation potential employers are being penalised.


The sort of additional red tape that this legislation imposes in its reporting requirements and the potential for so-called union involvement in investigating what is happening in small firms in particular means that people are going to be less likely to want to employ women at a higher level because of the nature of the legislation. I go to the point that we make: the failure to recognise that we want women who are utilising tertiary education to be able to do it in a way that they do not lose their place, dare I say it, in the pecking order.


When you look at the penalties that this legislation intends to impose upon firms, the Minister for the Status of Women has said:


Government trade with a non-compliant organisation will not just be discouraged, it will not be allowed by law.


Non-compliant companies will miss out on industry assistance, grants and government contracts—


and they will be non-compliant if they fall short of industry benchmarks or fail to improve over a two-year period. They will also be in breach of the rules if they fail to lodge a report as required, or fail to substantiate their report.


The fact of the matter is that this is to apply to any firm with 100 employees or more. These are the firms where we would hope that women with high qualifications would be seeking employment, yet the explanatory memorandum of the government's bill points out:


The workforce participation of mothers in Australia is low by international standards. Of Australian mothers with their youngest child under two, 82 per cent worked part-time and nearly half (45 per cent) worked 15 hours or less per week.43 The main barrier to full participation in paid work for women is difficulty balancing paid work and care responsibilities.


That is precisely what the opposition's policy is: to solve these problems so that women can continue in the paid workforce, utilise the education that they have acquired and see the statistics change so that they are not concentrated in the low-paid areas but are utilising that education to move up.


Red tape and penalising firms by preventing them from having government contracts is not the way to go. Nor is pumping $11.2 million of taxpayers' money into creating yet another piece of bureaucracy, this time called the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. It may be a make-work program for a number of people in the public sector to have yet another quango, but the fact of the matter is it is not going to assist women who are coming through education, as I said, at a greater rate than men in tertiary qualifications, yet this is not yet being reflected in workplace attainment.


The way forward is certainly not the red tape way in which this heavy-handed legislation is proceeding, but by accepting that the legislation—which, should we be elected, the opposition will introduce in government—for a fairer paid parental leave scheme will be one that will give real assistance to women to utilise their skills and not to find themselves plateaued or, indeed, falling behind and not making full use of those skills. Indeed, when we did this report back in 2006—and I have mentioned this before in a speech—we commissioned Access Economics to do an appraisal of women's participation in the workforce and what will happen if we do not improve the number of women who are in full-time work as distinct from part-time or indeed failing to participate.


The Access Economics report is at the back of the report I mentioned, and it simply shows that unless we do increase the number of women moving from part-time work into full-time work our economy will be seriously disadvantaged. So I say to the minister and I say particularly to women on the government side, particularly those who have got here by affirmative action: you do tend to make yourself a permanent second-class citizen if that is the way you wish to proceed. Women in Australia, as I see them, see that there is an opportunity to succeed on merit and to have the opportunity to utilise the skills that they are gaining. But it is not being done and it is not being helped by this heavy-handed legislation that is before the House.


I ask the government to reconsider the way it views women as being a political tool, and start looking at them as individuals who want to achieve and who aspire to contribute to the overall economy as well as being fine parents. Any publication you pick up about parenting shows that the number 1 concern people have when make their decision as to whether or not they wish to become parents is whether or not they can financially provide for that child. This sort of heavy-handed legislation does nothing to alleviate those concerns, but the splendid policy that has been put forward by the opposition for a fairer form of paid parental leave does answer many of those questions, and I would commend our policy rather than the government's as the way to proceed.

"D'Ath, Yvette, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Mrs D'ATH
 (Petrie) (13:13):  I rise to speak in support of the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012, and I wish to briefly pick up on the point that the member for Mackellar just raised—that is, what many women, particularly mothers, are concerned about is making sure that they can make ends meet in relation to those cost of living pressures when you have a family. Certainly, as a member of this government I am very proud of our record of what we have delivered for working families—not just the paid parental leave but the dads' and partners' leave that has recently been introduced. You can also look at the increases to the family tax benefit B, the increases to the childcare benefit and the new schoolkid's bonus, just to name a small number of improvements this Labor government has made for working families and working women.


I know, as do all women of this parliament, how far we have come as a nation to instil quality in the workforce. The Labor Party has a very proud history of promoting and protecting equality, and with this amendment bill we aim to promote and improve gender equality in the workplace by recognising the vital importance of equal remuneration and family and caring responsibilities as central to the achievement of gender equality. Equality is core to the belief and purpose of the Labor Party, which was forged over 120 years ago out of a collective struggle for equality in the workplace, and as a government we have amended or introduced over 100 Commonwealth acts that eliminate discrimination. It is well over a decade since the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act was last reviewed and the economic, social and legislative landscape has changed significantly throughout that period. That is why Labor has acted. The former Minister for the Status of Women, the Hon. Tanya Plibersek, initiated a comprehensive review of the legislation and of the status of women and men in the workplace. That review found that the act needed to be updated and modernised to be fully effective in supporting and driving change in Australian workplaces.


I believe that gender equality in Australian workplaces is important for women, men, business and the economy more broadly. It has been estimated that closing the gap between women's and men's workforce participation could boost Australia's GDP by up to 13 per cent. Furthermore, extensive consultation has been undertaken with industry, employer organisations and the women's sector in the drafting of this legislation. We went to the people who will be directly affected by this legislation to find out what their needs are. That is why with this bill we have made sure that these changes are comprehensive, starting with the amendment of the name of the act to the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 to emphasise the focus of the act on gender equality, thereby improving outcomes for both women and men in the workplace. The name of the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency has also changed to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency and the title of the director of the agency has changed to the Director of Workplace Gender Equality to reflect the new focus of the act. The objects of the act will highlight the expanded coverage to men, particularly in relation to caring responsibilities, as well as highlighting the importance of equal remuneration to gender equality. I think this is very important because in listening to the member for Mackellar's statement on this bill, at no point was it acknowledged that this bill actually picks up on men's caring responsibilities and equality across genders.


The objects also make clear the underpinning nature of gender equality to improved competitiveness and productivity, and the particular need to focus on removing barriers to women's full and equal workforce participation. Thus, this proposed legislation presents a new framework for promoting and encouraging gender equality in Australian workplaces. The bill fulfils a dual purpose of supporting improved workforce participation, particularly of women and carers, as well as reducing the regulatory burden on business. We heard the member for Mackellar claiming that this bill actually increases the burden, but this bill does not introduce more compliance measures, it is based on the compliance measures in the existing legislation, which the Howard government introduced. There has been some criticism raised about this bill creating too much red tape, but in fact the compliance measures in this bill allow for processes to be filled out online—and they are simple to fill in—which has been included at the request of business. It was business in the consultation period that identified that this type of compliance system was preferred and that is what this bill proposes, so I recommend that the members of the opposition actually go and consult with those employers about red tape and compliance because this change in the bill has come about as a consequence of what employers are asking for. Relevant employers will no longer need to provide descriptions of their policies and programs, but will report against gender equality indicators, focussing on tangible outcomes and practices. Reporting, while clearly easier for business, will also be more meaningful and useful. It will provide employers with the capacity to assess and understand gender equality within their workplaces, compared year by year and with other workplaces within their industry.


The agency's advisory and education functions will be enhanced. The contemporary data focus will allow the agency to see and target advice and education as effectively as possible as particular sectoral or industry issues emerge. Smaller organisations—those with fewer than 100 employees—will not be required to report, but will be able to access the agency's expertise and expanded online resources. Over time, the improved and standardised data set will assist the minister in setting industry specific minimum standards against the gender equality indicators. The minister will consult with relevant stakeholders, as she sees appropriate, in the setting of those minimum standards. These minimum standards will help the agency maximise the impact of its education and advice. The bill provides that the agency must provide any employers who fail to meet the minimum standard with assistance aimed specifically at improving their performance against that minimum standard. We heard from the member for Mackellar claiming that it is all about a big stick in cases when a particular employer does not meet the minimum standard, but what this bill does is provide those employers with assistance aimed at specifically improving their performance and meeting those standards.


In addition to the minister setting these minimum standards, the agency will set benchmarks in relation to the gender equality indicators, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, which will not be part of the compliance framework. The benchmarks are intended as a way for the agency to collect, analyse and express the data collected from public reports in a useful and meaningful way. These benchmarks will enable relevant employers to consider their workplace outcomes and practices in relation to their industry peers and compared to their own performance from year to year. The bill facilitates the engagement of senior management and employees. The chief executive officer, or equivalent, will be required to sign-off on organisations' reports. Consultation with employees is a defined gender equality indicator. This is to ensure that the legislation is not simply about filling out paperwork and reporting, it is about meeting real outcomes.


The bill also improves the transparency and fairness of the compliance framework and the consequences of non-compliance. The agency will be able to check compliance by seeking information from employers relevant to compliance. Employees and shareholders will be provided with access to the report, and employees and employee organisations will be provided with opportunity to comment on the report. There is nothing wrong with employees having access to reports that relate to their workplace and benefits for women in the workplace. The consequences of non-compliance build on the existing provisions, but with a focus on improving transparency and consistency of application. If an employer does not comply, without a reasonable excuse, they may be named in a report to the minister or more broadly. Employers may also not be eligible to compete for Commonwealth contracts, grants or other financial assistance. This is an existing policy, but work is being done within government to ensure greater consistency and transparency in its application. To enable employers to have sufficient time to adapt to the new framework, the provisions of the bill are being phased in. The first full new reports will be due in 2014. The new framework will also enable the government, policymakers and the community to have access to better aggregate information about gender equality in Australian workplaces. The bill provides that the agency report every two years on progress relating to the gender equality indicators. The bill achieves a clear balance in addressing the needs of business by making reporting simpler and more streamlined, supported by a new online interface. It also, however, ensures a much greater focus on outcomes to effect genuine and sustainable change over time.


The government has engaged in significant consultation with key stakeholders in developing the proposed legislation. In 2011, the government convened an implementation advisory group to assist with the improvements to the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999. Membership of the industry advisory group consists of key representatives from industry, unions and business, as well as experts in the fields of gender equality and workplace issues.


This legislation is about supporting employers to achieve cultural change; it is not about punishing employers or setting unreasonable standards that they cannot meet. Since the bill was introduced on 1 March 2012, a number of organisations and individuals have indicated support for the changes to the legislation. This support has come from industry, employee organisations and the women's sector. This amendment is one piece of a broader Labor effort to build stronger and fairer partnerships in the workplace. I commend the bill to the House.

"Andrews, Karen, MP",LP,2012-06-18,"



Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (13:23):  I rise today to speak on the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012 and I welcome the opportunity to speak specifically about the issue of gender equality in Australian workplaces. The bill being debated today seeks to amend the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999 by firstly changing the name of the act to the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012, with the objects of the act to be amended as wel1. The bill will expand the advice and education functions of the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, with changes also set to be made to the compliance framework for employers. The coverage of the act is set to be widened, with men being covered as well as women, and it is extended to all employers and employees in the workplace.


The issue of gender equality is a very important issue for the coalition and is an issue which I personally find very significant, having graduated as a mechanical engineer and spent much of my professional working life in male-dominated industries. I would like to make it clear from the outset that women and men can and should contribute to all aspects of Australian life in their own ways. In relation to employment opportunities for men and women, I strongly believe that businesses should be employing, retaining and promoting individuals based on merit, not on their gender. It is a core belief of the coalition that government interference into the life of individuals and businesses should be minimised as much as possible. I therefore do not support efforts that seek to increase the level of government interference in the workplace.


I would like to begin my contribution to this debate by highlighting several concerns I have with this bill. I have already mentioned my objection to unnecessary government interference in businesses' ability to employ individuals based on their merit. I therefore have concerns that this bill may impose additional red tape for business and therefore unacceptable increased levels of regulation. The two main concerns that I have relate to the cost to business and whether the new reporting framework actually simplifies and streamlines the reporting requirements for employers. I also have concerns about whether the Workplace Gender Equality Agency will have the necessary resources to carry out its expanded role, and why the new term 'employee organisation' is inserted into the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act. 


In relation to the first issue I have, with regard to the costs to business, it seems unlikely that resourcing costs will decrease, as is claimed by the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. The changes proposed in this bill go further than the gender equality rules which apply now to ASX listed companies. Currently, ASX listed companies are required to comply with the ASX corporate governance principles and publish workplace gender diversity policies and have their objectives for achieving these policies disclosed each year. These companies are also required to release information that shows the proportion of women in the company and how many women are in senior management positions as well as on the organisation's board. The provisions of this bill should not be going further than the current obligations on companies, as it is likely that additional costs will be imposed on these businesses through the reporting requirements this bill proposes.


The second concern that I have relates to the bill's proposal to simplify and streamline reporting—however, it is not clear how the new reporting framework will achieve this goal. Under the proposed new reporting framework, employers must report against gender equality indicators. This must be a public report prepared by the employer and it is required to contain matters specified in the legislative instrument made by the minister. The bill, however, does not make it clear what 'matters' are to be specified and there is therefore uncertainty for employers about what they must report on under this proposed new framework. Because of this uncertainty it is difficult to see how reporting for employers will be simplified and streamlined.


This brings me to the two additional concerns I have, which, again, deal with some uncertainty with what the bill seeks to achieve and the provisions' ability to achieve these aims. Firstly, the Workplace Gender Equality Agency is given expanded roles to provide targeted advice and assistance to relevant employers, so that they can promote and improve gender equality in relation to minimum standards. As this is an expanded role, it appears that the agency would require additional resources to effectively undertake this role; however, it is unclear from the bills whether these additional resources will be provided. Secondly, the term 'employee organisation' is already given meaning under section 12 of the Fair Work Act 2009; however, this bill also inserts a new term into the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act. Clarification needs to be made in relation to this provision, as it seems unnecessary to include a new term when it already exists in the Fair Work Act. These are the technical issues with the bill; however, we must remember that there are larger issues relating to female participation in the workforce which deserve greater scrutiny. 


I would now like to highlight some recent statistics which give us an idea of how the current workforce as a whole looks. The recent labour force statistics from the Australian Bureau of Statistics give us a snapshot of the female participation rate in our workforce. I have picked a period from earlier this year. The participation rate for females during the February period, seasonally adjusted, was 58.7 per cent. This is significantly lower than the male participation rate during the same period, which was 71.7 per cent. I would also like to point out that the number of females employed in total for February is significantly lower compared with males. According to the ABS, there are over 5.2 million females employed, while there are over 6.2 million males employed. More than double the number of females are employed part time compared with males, with figures showing part-time female workers at about 2.374 million compared with just over one million males employed on a part-time basis. If we look at the employment of women in different industries, it becomes clear that there are specific industries where the employment of women is significantly lower compared with males. A look at 18 different industry groups reveals that only six industries have a majority of women employed either part time or full time. These industries are retail trade, with 56.4 per cent; accommodation and food services, with 55 per cent; financial and insurance services, with 50.9 per cent; administrative and support services, with 52.3 per cent; education and training, with 69 per cent; and health care and social assistance, with 78.8 per cent. A further seven industries have female part-time or full-time-equivalent employees at levels that are below 40 per cent: agriculture, forestry and fishing; mining; manufacturing; electricity, gas, water and waste services; construction; wholesale trade; and transport, postal and warehousing. The construction industry was at the lowest level, with women comprising only 11.6 per cent of employees. These statistics clearly demonstrate that we need to get more women into the workforce and improve their representations in industries almost across the board.


I am an enthusiastic advocate for improvement in the labour force participation rates for women and know that we can enhance our contributions to the economic and social wellbeing of Australia. In fact, earlier this year I raised these issues in this place and emphasised the need for work to be organised so family responsibilities can also be balanced. The figures I mentioned earlier regarding women predominantly taking up part-time work further justify my claim.


In concluding today I repeat my call to break down the barriers impeding improved female participation rates in the workforce and getting women back into the workforce. If we are serious, we need to identify what those barriers are and we need to take positive action to encourage and support more women in maintaining their place in the workforce or re-entering the workforce. Two issues have been identified to me very clearly within the electorate and quite widely around Australia. The first issue is good-quality and affordable child care. The second is an issue that, as I have indicated previously, I have touched on already in this place—work organisation to make it more appropriate and more attractive for women with family responsibilities to re-enter the workforce.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (13:35):  I rise to voice my strong support for the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012. This bill is the next step in the Gillard government's assault on inequity and discrimination in Australian workplaces. On this side of the House we can hold our heads high in this regard. We have delivered Australia's first paid parental leave scheme, which provides real support to working mums and dads and their young families—truly momentous. This is not pie-in-the-sky stuff; it is a practical, fair and sustainable scheme that provides financial assistance when they need it most. 


For women the road to equality has been a long and difficult one. Along this road we often take baby steps—and I use that term deliberately—but we are getting there. Australia was one of the first countries in the world to give women the right to vote and to sit in parliament. We were just pipped by New Zealand. After that, it was not until 1949 that our first female federal cabinet minister was appointed. That took 49 years. Up until 1966—which is not that long ago, as 1966 was when I was born—women working in the federal Public Service were required to resign when they married. In the last 50 years much has been achieved for women in equality in education, in the workplace and in things such as safe contraception and access to childcare facilities. In 1984 the federal government banned discrimination on the basis of sex. Today, more women than men are educated at secondary schools and universities and more women graduate from university with bachelor degrees. In 2006, women made up nearly 55 per cent of tertiary students and 47.5 per cent of students enrolled in vocational education and training courses. Forty per cent of Australia's small business operators are women and 57 per cent of the Australian Public Service are women, with around 36 per cent of senior executive positions. It is a different story in the private sector, where, sadly, only 12 per cent of management jobs are held by women. Progress is continuing but more needs to be done.


Let's have a look at parliament: there are currently more women parliamentarians in the Senate than at any other time since Federation, with 28 women out of 76; but, sadly, the number of women in this chamber dropped at the last election and is now less than 25 per cent. So 111 years after Federation we are down to less than one in four members of this chamber being women. Of course, in the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, we have Australia's first female Prime Minister, and likewise in Quentin Bryce we have Australia's first female Governor-General—a proud Queenslander, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott.


It is interesting to see how the Liberal National Premier of Queensland dealt with women in the workplace when he was the Lord Mayor of Brisbane. I have spoken about this with one of the councillors in the Moreton electorate and that is Councillor Nicole Johnston—now an Independent but previously a member of the Liberal Party. She was the councillor assisting Lord Mayor Campbell Newman, as he then was, before she decided that her job as a Liberal councillor for Tennyson required her to speak out on behalf of Sherwood residents about the bus depot that was rather hastily foisted on the local community. After Nicole dared to speak up and voice local community concerns, she says that she was frozen out by Mr Newman. He refused to speak to her. Thankfully, she was re-elected, not for Labor but as an Independent, at the recent council elections. Unfortunately, I have heard the now Premier Newman bagging the hardworking Nicole Johnston to all and sundry. He was quite indiscreet, in fact, in the past. Perhaps things might change now that he is the Premier. This might suggest poor judgment, a personality flaw or a huge lack of respect for women; we will see. Obviously, Mr Newman has a long way to go if he wants all Queenslanders to believe that such treatment is behind him.


In Queensland, of the 78 seats held by the LNP, less than 17 per cent are female. The LNP's representation of women is in line with countries like Kazakhstan and Venezuela. Obviously it is not good for a modern political party to have such disregard for equality. There is no minister for women under the state LNP government, and who knows what they will axe next? We will wait and see. There are still some sections of the community—both broadly known and smaller pockets—that are coming to terms with the proper way to treat and provide equal opportunity for women.


This bill before the chamber delivers on the Gillard Labor government's commitment to improve the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999. The bill changes the name of the act to the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012, because this is about improving outcomes for women and men in the workplace. The bill also changes the emphasis of the act to promote and improve gender equality in the workplace and achieve equal remuneration and a stronger focus on family and caring responsibilities. The bill also introduces a new reporting framework which requires employers with 100 or more employees—so not small businesses—to report against a set of gender equality indicators. A new online reporting facility will be easier and more useful, and will enable businesses to compare how they are travelling against other workplaces in their industry. Over time the data will enable the minister to set minimum standards for employers. 


The renamed Workplace Gender Equality Agency will also be required to develop industry based benchmarks regarding gender equality. They will then use these indicators to assist industry to meet these benchmarks. Employees and shareholders will be provided with access to a business compliance report, ensuring greater transparency and accountability for meeting gender benchmarks. I am pleased to see that extensive consultation has been carried out through the review of the act and broad consultation has continued throughout the reform process. I particularly commend the Minister for the Status of Women, Julie Collins, for her work directly engaging with key stakeholders in the development of the bill. This is an important piece of legislation in efforts to improve gender equality in the workplace—something that I am sure all members of parliament and all Australians would support. 


Back in 2009, I was part of an inquiry into pay equity as part of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment and Workplace Relations, chaired by the then member for Hasluck, Sharryn Jackson. The report Making it fair: pay equity and associated issues related to increasing female participation in the workforce made 63 recommendations. Unfortunately, I cannot stand here today and hold up that report and say that we have achieved all 63 of those recommendations, but nevertheless it is a bit of a guide—a path that this parliament might go down to achieve true equality. This bill implements some of those recommendations, particularly around better reporting, because it is through the information of reporting that businesses, governments and other institutions will be able to say: 'We've done this so far and we'll now be able to take the next step in achieving equality in the workforce.'


I take you back to some facts that are quite disconcerting: not that long ago, only 46 years, when a woman was married, the social expectation was that if she was in the federal Public Service she would resign, with the presumption she would be supported by her husband. A lot has been achieved, and I would like to particularly commend the efforts of the Prime Minister as she has quietly in her steely, strong, determined way gone about proving that women can do anything in Australia. I have often had people in my electorate come up when I am with the Prime Minister to say that they respect what she has done for their daughters and their grandchildren and to say thank you for leading the nation in such a way. Whilst there are suggestions from both sides of parliament, it is complicated when you look at the data and say that merit will out. The reality is that when half of the population is female but less than 25 per cent of the MPs in this chamber are female there is something going wrong—otherwise you must make the flawed presumption that half of the women in Australia do not have the same merit when it comes to being a proper representative. This bill is a great way to go. It is a step in the right direction and I commend the bill to the House.

Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (13:45):  I rise today to congratulate two outstanding Territorians who I have mentioned in this place before. Des Abbott and Joel Carroll were today named in the Australian Kookaburras hockey team going to the 2012 Olympics. These two Darwin athletes are cousins and are fantastic Indigenous ambassadors. They are fantastic sports ambassadors for all Australians. This is an outstanding achievement for the Northern Territory as it will be the first time ever that two Northern Territorians compete together on the same team at the Olympic Games.


Des and Joel are cousins who have played together before at the national level. Most notably, they both played in the 2010 men's hockey Champion Trophy where they won gold. Des and Joel also won gold at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. They have a good track record.


This is not the first Olympic Games for Des. In 2008, he went to Beijing with the Kookaburras where they won a bronze medal. I know everyone in the Territory and around the nation will be watching the 2012 London Olympic Games very closely—even more so now that we have some home-grown talent on the world stage. It is great to know that the Kookaburras are going to the Olympics as the gold medal favourites. On behalf of all Territorians and the coalition I wish Joel and Des the very best of luck at the Olympics. We look forward to them bringing home the gold.

Mr SWAN
 (Lilley—Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer) (14:00):  I move:


That the House express its deep regret at the death on 12 June 2012 of the Honourable Francis John (Frank) Walker QC, a Member of this House for the Division of Robertson from 1990 to 1996, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


Today we mourn the loss of a distinguished former member of this place who has served our nation in ministerial office, the Hon. Frank Walker QC who died in Sydney last Tuesday just weeks shy of his 70th birthday. I did not know Frank Walker well. I was a new backbencher in the final term of the Keating government of which he was a senior figure. But I know he was a friend to many in this place, including the Leader of the House. Our condolences go out today to Frank Walker's widow, Pam, and all his many friends. I thank the New South Wales government for its generosity in offering a state funeral, which is a fitting tribute to such a remarkable career of community service. It is amazing to think that when my generation came to this place in the mid-1990s Frank Walker had been in politics for a quarter of a century, although he was still a youthful looking man just entering his 50s. He was part of the generation of Paul Keating, Laurie Brereton and Bob Carr, who were young men in a hurry and who left such a definitive stamp on the public life of our nation. 


Frank Walker was born in 1942 and came of age as a young Australian impatient for change as the Menzies era wound to a close. Labor was the natural home for a progressive young lawyer committed to human rights and would remain so from the age of 18 until his passing last week. In 1970 the young Frank Walker took what some regarded as an unrealistic tilt at the safe Liberal seat of Georges River in the New South Wales parliament. He won it with 48 per cent of the primary vote and held it for the following six elections. When Neville Wran assembled his first cabinet, Frank Walker was given the prize job of Attorney-General, becoming the youngest in the state's history. He set about the task of reform with a passion, unwinding the heavy-handed legacy of the Askin era and bringing the fresh breeze of law reform to New South Wales. In fact, Frank Walker was a minister for the whole 12 years of the Wran-Unsworth government, holding some of the toughest portfolios, always in the social arena, including housing and youth and community services as well as the arts. Perhaps most importantly for a man who had been one of free riders alongside Charlie Perkins, he became New South Wales first Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, delivering that state's first-ever land rights legislation for Aboriginal people and recognising the stolen generations as early as 1982. It was a great reforming government in the Labor tradition and Frank was at the very heart of it—a busy, boisterous and dashing figure throughout.


Two years later, after leaving New South Wales politics, he came to Canberra as the member for Robertson, joining that handful of figures who had successfully navigated the state-federal divide. Following the sweetest victory of all in 1993, Frank Walker became Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council and was given responsibility for turning Mabo into what became the Native Title Act. In 1994 he was promoted to Minister for Administrative Services, a position he held until the 1996 federal election. He was an active participant in the affairs of the parliament. He attended the 85th Inter-Parliamentary Conference in Korea in 1991 and undertook official visits to Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the United States. He also served on the community affairs and procedure committees. Of course, he was no stranger to the factional brawls and byways of the Labor family and so much so that one journalist described him as someone who roamed the political landscape like a Steppenwolf.


After politics Frank served as a judge on the Compensation Court of New South Wales from 1997 to 2003 and from 2004 to 2006 and was a judge of the Dust Diseases Tribunal in the district court of New South Wales. In these roles his compassion and social concern shone through, especially for those condemned to the painful illness and death through asbestosis disease. For all those 36 years in elected and judicial office, Frank Walker was an inspirational figure and he brought flair to whatever he did.


But this life so rich in accomplishment also contained more than its fair share of sorrow. Frank Walker suffered the grief of losing both his sons, Sean and Michael, to suicide following the onset of schizophrenia. It would be a crushing burden for any parent, but instead of turning inward Frank used his own sense of loss to propel change in the wider community. He served as president of the Schizophrenia Fellowship of New South Wales for a record term, as well as serving on the New South Wales Mental Health Review Tribunal and the Mental Illness Fellowship of Australia. The fact that mental health looms so large in contemporary public debate, and is finally receiving the funding it deserves, is in no small measure due to Frank's consistent advocacy.



By any measure this was a gifted brilliant life. It was the life of a reformer who did not just complain about why the world was unjust but who saw the possibility for change and—to paraphrase Bobby Kennedy—said, 'Why not?' His whole life as a politician, judge and activist was aimed at progress and reform. He was an unashamed social democrat and wore the badge of civil libertarian with pride. He spoke for those whose voices were not heard and now his own voice, a feature of public life for four decades, has been stilled and we are diminished as a result. So on behalf of the government and the people of Australia, I say farewell Frank Walker. A grateful nation honours your memory and pays tribute to your long and distinguished service in our name.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:07):  I rise to support the words of the Acting Prime Minister. Frank Walker was a long-serving New South Wales Attorney General, as well as Special Minister of State and Minister for Administrative Services in this parliament. Frank Walker's political life was devoted to infuriating conservatives, and in this I have to say that he was wildly successful. He upset conservatives in his own party as readily as conservatives on the other side of the parliament and in the wider community. By his own lights he was certainly a man of principle and he was someone who suffered for his beliefs. He was reportedly beaten and bashed for sitting with Aboriginal people in a segregated country theatre. His family pet was reportedly killed and its head dumped on his doorstep while he was a corruption-fighting minister in the Wran government.


As the Acting Prime Minister has made clear, his personal life was marked by tragedy, and he spent much of his post-parliamentary life supporting people with schizophrenia. In this role, quite rightly, he was universally admired. He certainly has helped to make mental health something that all sides of this parliament are very concerned about, and I well remember the welcome he gave to the former government's Better Access to Mental Health Services program. On behalf of the coalition I offer our condolences to his family, and to all who knew him and loved him.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:09):  I rise to add my support to this motion of condolence from the Acting Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Frank Walker was my friend. He was one of the most passionate, humble, loyal, dedicated and honest people that I had the privilege of knowing. He was absolutely committed to representing the interests of those who are the most marginalised in our society.


I first met Frank when I went along to a New South Wales Young Labor conference around about 1980—in Newtown, which now happens to be in my electorate. I was still at school. There I remember this minister standing at the front of the conference, talking about the action that he was taking to make New South Wales a more just society—changes such as repealing the unjust Summary Offences Act. The Leader of the Opposition has indicated the extent to which this drew opposition from some of the entrenched corrupt forces that were then in strong positions in New South Wales society. This angered many, particularly some sections of the New South Wales Police Force.


He drove through the most progressive Aboriginal land rights legislation at the time. He decriminalised homosexuality at a time when that was a radical notion and when people were still subject to being arrested for happening to be gay or lesbian. He had a commitment to public and community housing. He had a determination to help young people in particular who had got themselves into trouble with the law not out of any flaw of character but simply due to the circumstances of their birth and family situations.


As happens in politics, in spite of being an extraordinary local campaigner, Frank lost his seat when Labor lost office in 1988. In 1989 I was his chief scrutineer in the preselection ballot for the federal seat of Robertson, where he defeated Belinda Neal by just three votes to be the Labor candidate after Barry Cohen's retirement. He went on to win the seat of Robertson in 1990 and, of course, after 1993 to be a minister in the Keating Labor government.


Frank went on in post-parliamentary life to play a vital role in the judiciary, including helping victims of asbestos through the Dust Diseases Tribunal. He went on to make an extraordinary contribution as president of the Schizophrenia Fellowship of New South Wales from 1998 right up until his death. Schizophrenia, of course, was the condition that his two sons, Michael and Sean, suffered from—a condition which tragically proved fatal for both.


Right to the end, Frank was driven by his commitment to social justice. He remained an infectious personality even after he became very unwell. Every minute you spent with Frank Walker was a minute well spent. He was my friend, and I admired him deeply. He will be missed by the nation, the Labor movement, his many friends and by his family. Vale, Frank Walker.

Mr SWAN
 (Lilley—Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer) (14:14):  I have been to a few G20 conferences and, as I have sat at the table, there is one thing that all the developed economies there around the table know—there is no stronger developed economy in the G20 than Australia. There is no stronger developed economy in the G20 than Australia. But, of course, what do we get here? Day after day, the opposition comes into this House—and goes around the community—and talks our economy down, deliberately insulting all those hard-working business owners and those millions of workers who have worked hard to make our economy strong.


I have been asked by the Leader of the Opposition how many countries around the G20 table are putting in place policies to deal with dangerous climate change and creating situations where they can reduce their emissions. Seventeen of the G20 members, or 85 per cent, are putting in place emissions trading schemes at a national or subnational level. That is what is going on in the G20. I tell you what, if those on the other side were at Los Cabos, they would have been terribly embarrassed, because the G20 nations with developed economies and developing economies do appreciate the need to deal with reducing carbon pollution, and are putting emissions trading schemes in place at a national or subnational level.


Let us just go specifically to some of the countries that are sitting around the table.




Mr Abbott:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I asked the Acting Prime Minister if he could name a single country with a $23 a tonne carbon tax—a single one.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Acting Prime Minister is answering the question and has the call.




Mr SWAN:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I am certainly happy to address it directly. Over the four years to July 2011, European carbon prices have traded in the range of $16 to $50. Now, what countries could there be around the G20 table who might be in that situation? There is France, there is Italy, there is the United Kingdom—there is a whole range of developed economies that are part of the European scheme. Those opposite will come into this House and maintain that the European price is low at the moment, but there is no reason it will stay there. What we do know is that carbon prices in the European zone have traded between $16 and $50 over the four years through to the middle of 2011. I think that answers that question pretty clearly. You on that side of the House are so embarrassed by your performance here. Countries around the world are putting in place emissions trading schemes, because those countries understand the importance of dealing with dangerous climate change.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:34):  I thank the member for Lyne for his question and for his ongoing commitment to upgrading the Pacific Highway. Indeed, in the federal budget this year we did announce an additional $3.56 billion funding for the nation-building program and we indicated that it would be available for the Pacific Highway on a dollar-for-dollar matching basis. We also indicated that it was possible to achieve the joint objective, first put down by the Howard government, of a full duplication of the highway by 2016. So I was very disappointed by the fact that the New South Wales government has failed to step up to this opportunity in spite of the fact that year after year they made promises that they would deliver matching funds for the Pacific Highway and that they were committed to the full duplication by 2016. They failed to deliver.


Premier O'Farrell, Deputy Premier Stoner and Minister for Roads and Ports, Duncan Gay, are all on the record time after time saying they would make it a top priority. They now say that the reason was a $5 billion cut in funding for New South Wales in terms of revenue expectations. But the fact is this government found space to provide increased funding in the nation-building program even though there has been a $140 billion drop in revenue as a result of the global financial crisis. The NRMA came out for New South Wales to match the funding. But it gets even worse. Last year, the state government Treasurer, Mike Baird, said in his budget speech:


In its last Budget, the Commonwealth allocated $750 million …


… we are determined to provide the funds needed to match the Commonwealth offer.


In their budget papers of last week that figure has become $468 million—that is, they have cut funding for the Pacific Highway by $300 million on what they promised just six months ago.


What does the National Party do about this? The Leader of the National Party goes out there and says that 2016 cannot be achieved and he would be very disappointed if duplication was not completed by 2020. He would not commit one cent of additional funding for the Pacific Highway in spite of the fact that we have already committed $4.1 billion dollars. They committed $1.3 billion over 12 long years.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:38):  We certainly will, in terms of the member for Lyne's request. The fact is that the government had introduced additional funding for the Pacific Highway through the economic stimulus plan, including the Kempsey bypass. The longest bridge in Australia is being constructed there. Indeed, on the weekend we opened—through Senator Thistlethwaite, the duty senator for Cowper, and the state National Party member—an interchange on the Kempsey bypass. There is not one cent of state government money going into that section of the highway. They are happy to turn up to the openings but they do not want to actually deliver.


I table for the benefit of the House my letter to Michael Daley, the New South Wales Minister for Roads, indicating my disappointment with the funding for the Pacific Highway that the former state Labor government that did not do well enough on the Pacific Highway had done. I table the Sydney Morning Herald article 'Rees bungle costs state $50 million' about how I reduced funding for New South Wales due to the failure of the former government to deliver. I table the letter from David Campbell, the then Minister for Transport and Roads in the New South Wales government, asking for 80:20 funding for the Pacific Highway, and I table my response rejecting the proposition of Minister Campbell for the New South Wales government.

 (Lilley—Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer) (14:50):  It is quite ironic that the party that has come into this House and refused to support overseas processing then comes in and complains about an increase in arrivals. It is just quite extraordinary. They have got a real hide to come into this House after they sabotaged the Malaysian arrangement, which would break the people smugglers' model and put us in a position where we can send that message to the region about not jumping on a boat. But having wrecked that, they then come into the House and make all these others claims that we have heard from them both here and outside the parliament. There are no plans for Cocos Island from this government, but I can tell you this: we are going to hold you accountable for your failure to support in this House legislation that would break the people smugglers' model.

The campaign for women's equal representation in the workplace is one many decades in the making. We have seen various triumphs for women over the years at a national and international level. When I was researching this speech it was very interesting to hear many stories of women who have really put themselves out there to draw attention to this important issue. One of these was Zelda D'Aprano, who chained herself to the Commonwealth Building in Melbourne while campaigning to ensure equal pay. This was really important and the legislation before us today builds on the legislation and the many achievements that have gone before it.


The legislation goes back a long way, but in 1972 the big decision made by the courts was to grant equal pay for equal work. This was a very important decision because it put into law that women who were doing the same work as men, alongside their work colleagues, would get equal pay. We have continued to see some inequities in the area of equal pay, which I will talk about shortly, but that decision was a very important one in ensuring the start of equal opportunity in the workplace.


Twenty-eight years ago the Sex Discrimination Act was introduced and the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986 was introduced two years later. This was important legislation and there have been some important inroads made in this area. There was a government review in 1999 which looked at this issue and again some improvements were made—but one would agree that more than 10 years after that review it is important that we review the act again. In 2008, the then Minister for the Status of Women, Tanya Plibersek, announced a review of this legislation. It was very important that this take into consideration the many stakeholders and interested parties to ensure that we got this legislation right for the next decade. The legislation in front of us today makes some important improvements to the legislation. In particular—and it does a number of things—the bill amends the name of the act to the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012, which emphasises the focus of the act on gender equality, thereby improving the outcomes for women and men in workplaces. The name of the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency will also be changed to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. This will be important to equip this agency to prepare to move into the future. As I mentioned, things have changed: we hopefully do not have to have women chaining themselves to Commonwealth buildings to get fair pay, but we still have to make sure that we are approaching and tackling gender inequity in our workplaces, and this sets the agency up to be very much focused on its task ahead.


The bill amends the principal objectives of the act to reflect on a new focus to promote and improve gender equality in the workplace, with special recognition of equal remuneration and family and caring responsibilities as issues central to the achievement of gender equality. While we have come a long way in remuneration and ensuring that women and men get paid equally, we still have a long way to go. It was only very recently that we were able to celebrate—and I certainly welcomed—the decision by Fair Work Australia in the fair pay case. That recognised that there has been systematic underpayment of women, depending on which areas of work they take up, and that the structural inequity must be addressed. That was a very important decision, one that I welcomed, but I am also proud to be part of a government that not only welcomed that decision and what it meant for many women workers around the country but also responded practically by putting its money where its mouth was in terms of fair pay for women. I encourage all the states and territories to do the same. We need to work with the states and territories to ensure that the fair pay decision becomes realised. I am very pleased that this Commonwealth Labor government has made that commitment.


Family and caring responsibilities are issues central to the achievement of gender equality, and so often it is women who take on the brunt or the burden of caring. Many women are very pleased to take this on, whether it be for children or older parents, and they are pleased to be of service and want to do this. However, we must recognise that this can affect the participation of women in the workforce. Without having the proper flexibilities and the proper frameworks in place this can, for many women, affect their participation in the workplace and does not allow them to achieve gender equity.


It is not just in the workplace that this is an issue but also in the future with superannuation. For many women who take on part-time roles and balance their caring responsibilities with their work responsibilities, who take time out of the workplace while raising children, there will be inequities in superannuation. This is a very important area that we must continue to focus on as to how we ensure that women are not disadvantaged—not just at work but also in retirement. I am very pleased that the objects of this act will be amended to ensure that family and caring responsibilities are issues central to the achievement of gender equality.


This bill also proposes to improve the coverage of the act to include men as well as women. Agency advice and assistance functions will not be just for those companies that are required to report. Under the legislation employers of 100 or more employees are subject to the reporting requirements. This suggests that only those organisations could get advice and assistance from the agency. I am very pleased that this bill will ensure that the agency's advice and assistance will extend to all employers. So if that employer is a small business looking at gender equality and equity issues it will also be able to access advice. I encourage those small businesses that may be interested in this area to get in touch once the new agency is providing this advice to get some ideas about this.


The bill also introduces a new reporting framework in which relevant employers are required to report against gender equality indicators. This will commence from 1 April 2013. Obviously, this provides employers with some time in which they can get their information together. It has a phase-in period. The requirement for the equal opportunity in the workplace program will be removed and the reporting will be simpler as well as more meaningful and more useful.


One of the really important things in this bill is that it will allow employers to both measure and understand gender equality within their workplaces but also compare themselves to other workplaces in their industry. I think this is important because it will allow the agency to target assistance and, over time, will also allow employers to really gauge how they are doing on issues of gender equity. Over time, the improved and standardised data set will also allow the minister to set minimum standards. This will be important to communicate clearly to businesses what these minimum standards are. They will be based on a standardised set of data, recognising that things change from industry to industry. The functions of the agency will be to develop industry based benchmarks in relation to gender equality indicators. The agency will also have specific roles in providing assistance and advice on improving performance against minimum standards. The bill also clarifies and improves transparency associated with compliance with the act and the consequences of noncompliance. 


This bill builds on this Labor government's achievements when it comes to women's participation in the workforce. We have introduced key things. I have mentioned the fair pay decision and the commitment by this government to put money up to fund that decision. When we were first elected, we addressed the issue of childcare costs. We moved from a 30 per cent rebate to a 50 per cent rebate for childcare costs. That was very important. I was very proud to be part of a government that introduced paid parental leave for the first time in this nation's history. This paid parental leave ensures a continuing connection with the workforce for women taking time out of the workforce to have children, being able to re-enter the workforce if they desire. I am very pleased that this Labor government delivered that.


I think that this bill builds on a lot of advances that we have made in terms of gender equity in the workplace. I was very concerned to hear—back in my home state of South Australia—the state Leader of the Opposition, Isobel Redmond, say, when asked what she would do if she felt she was being discriminated against on the basis of gender, 'Look, I just put up with it and hopefully it will go away.' I do not think that is an appropriate response. I think it was a very concerning message to many women out there that they should just put up with it, that it should be just part of work. You feel discriminated against, you get passed over for promotion. There is not a sense that you are actually being recognised; you should just put up with it and ignore it. I do not think that is the attitude of most places. I do not think it is the attitude of most in this parliament. We need to ensure that there is gender equality in our workplaces right around Australia, that women and men get a fair go in terms of their time at work and ensure that their rights and ability to fully participate are encouraged.


On that note, I think this is a very important development on the bill. As discussed, a number of ministers have widely consulted on this and I believe this does strike a good balance in ensuring and progressing equity in our workforce but also in ensuring that it is easier for business to deliver.

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (15:33):  It is a pleasure to follow the member for Kingston in speaking to this Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012. This bill amends the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999 to deliver very importantly on a 2010 election commitment by the government to improve women's workforce participation. This proposed legislation presents a new framework for encouraging gender equality by removing those disincentives that mitigate against the equal participation of women in the workforce. It also fulfils a dual purpose of supporting improved workforce participation—particularly that of women and carers—as well as reducing, more importantly, the regulatory burden on business. This is a timely bill and the government must be commended for its determination to implement these important changes because they are defining changes that will make a real difference to women and men in the broader workforce.


Many of us still struggle to comprehend in today's society—living in one of the most democratic countries in the world—why it is that wage parity, practical employment structures and cracking that infamous corporate glass ceiling sadly still elude many women. In contemporary Australia, where women are encouraged to achieve and contribute to the workforce, the issue of gender inequality as a significant disincentive to women's workforce participation must be challenged and addressed. While much of this workplace discrimination may not be intentional, it does highlight a need to challenge the manifestation of entrenched views based on gender differences in the workplace. Many of those entrenched views stem from practices that are driven very much by gender stereotyping and expectations.


One of the most obvious differences and, therefore, stereotyping practices is that women are by nature designed to bear children, and men are not. With that comes a whole lot of other gender intricacies. Rather than be left to continue to make it difficult for women to participate in the workforce, these intricacies should be embraced and catered for, knowing that one size does not fit all in the workplace and that we need the flexibility to accommodate and therefore maximise workforce participation for women and men. The truth is that many prospective employers do tend to adopt an attitude that avoids employing or promoting women because it is perceived that they are more likely to have family-work balance issues that, if the truth be said, are not necessarily problems for prospective male employees. That is not to say that men do not have responsibilities to their families, but existing traditional workplace conditions together with social expectations have created a workplace culture which traditionally made it easier for men to participate and harder for women to participate. So we need to change our attitudes and, if we are to change the culture in the workplace as it relates to the participation of women and men, we need to encourage more women into the workforce and we have to act via legislation to ensure that these changes are implemented and we get a more equal playing field. That is why I support this bill.


Our community has changed and is changing around us, and it expects government to act and to respond to those changes. The introduction of this bill ensures that we are steadily working our way through our attitudes and practices on gender equality issues and the responsibilities of both genders when it comes to the balance between work and family. The introduction of this amendment bill follows a review that found that, since the act was last amended in 1999, there have been a number of economic, social and legislative changes that require the agency to provide a more contemporary response to these changes. The government undertook extensive consultation with industry, employee organisations and the women's sector and, in doing so, drafted legislation that is finely balanced—legislation that all parties are comfortable with and which is very much about supporting employers to achieve cultural change. It most certainly is not about punishing employers or setting unreasonable standards that they cannot meet.


Importantly, the government is acting by introducing this amendment bill because the review made it clear that gender equality is essential to maximising Australia's productive potential and ensuring continuing economic growth. Closing the gap between women's and men's workforce participation is estimated to have the potential to boost gross domestic product by some 13 per cent. But, more importantly, it also has the potential to improve the lives of the broader Australian community in so many ways beyond the GDP.


I do want to draw the House's attention to the recently released report by the Grattan Institute, Game-changers: economic reform priorities for Australia. In that report it is affirmed that the participation of women in the workforce is one of the three major areas that were identified by the Grattan Institute for increasing Australia's GDP. The issue of women's participation is a game changer. It is worth up to $90 million or so in GDP increase over the next decade. So it is a significant issue and cannot be ignored.


This bill makes the appropriate changes in order to take advantage of the participation of all Australians—in particular, women—in the workforce. It changes the name of the act to the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012, and the name of the agency from the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency.


The principal objectives of the amendments are to promote and improve gender equality, including equal remuneration between men and women in employment and in the workplace. It aims to do this by supporting employers to remove barriers to the full participation of women and men, recognising the disadvantaged position of women in relation to employment.


I cannot see how the aims of this amendment bill can be anything other than positive. Gender equality in Australian workplaces is important for women, it is important for men, it is important for businesses and it is important for the economy. And it is very much a win-win for all—for employers, for employees and especially for women. And it is, of course, a win for Australia's GDP capacity.


I know that my constituents would benefit greatly from achieving gender equality in the workplace. They certainly will be better off with the stated aim of this bill, which is to close the gap between men's and women's participation. Many people in my electorate talk about their responsibilities to their children, their aged parents and their disabled family members. They all talk about their ways of finding strategies to balance these responsibilities with the need to work. So I am absolutely certain that they will welcome this bill. In particular, there are many women in my electorate who go about the daily business of balancing work and family commitments. These are women who must look after their children but must also work, and in most cases they are the low-skilled women who are also in low-paid jobs. Then there are the young women in my electorate—those who are single and those who are highly-skilled, career-focused women who will largely rely on changes in the workplace culture to pave the way for a change of attitude that will enable them to face less discrimination as they pursue their careers and life's ambitions and choices.


So I am familiar, as all of us should be, with these community attitudes and how this bill will assist in making their lives a little easier as it will allow them to participate in the workforce. This is especially so for the women in my electorate, and I want to make a special mention of the many refugee women who have settled in the federal seat of Calwell. These are women who have come from less democratic and equitable societies—women who, in addition to working to support their families, have also to pick up the pieces of broken lives and lost homes; women who have fled war, who have feared and continue to fear for the safety of their loved ones, but especially for the security and the future of their children; women who have overcome horrors that we here in Australia have never experienced. Yet these women persevere, and they form a part of the socioeconomic and cultural diversity of the Australia community and, indeed, the Australian workforce. They are grateful to be here, as waves of migrants before them were; they are grateful for the opportunity. But they are more often than not the most likely to be excluded from workplace participation and they, like the rest of the Australian community, deserve a fairer, more equal playing field. We all deserve a society and a workplace that caters and allows for greater gender equity and flexibility. That is how we ensure a happier, fairer and more equitable society. Of course change is never easy, but in some circumstances it cannot be brought on soon enough. The time has come to address the obvious and allow workplaces to meet the needs of our changing societies, and I commend the bill to the House.

Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin—Minister for Community Services, Minister for the Status of Women and Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development) (15:44):  I thank all of those people who made contributions on this important bill. The Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012 amends the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999, delivering a significant package of reforms promised by this government during the 2010 election. These reforms are aimed at improving gender equality in Australian workplaces. For improved workplace participation and workplace flexibility for women, these reforms will help to improve productivity and address current and future skills shortages. It has been estimated that closing the gap between men's and women's workforce participation could boost gross domestic product by up to13 per cent.


The bill has been developed in close consultation with key stakeholders including industry, employee organisations and the women's sector. The government believes the bill strikes the right balance between the views of these stakeholders. Since its introduction on 1 March 2012, the bill has received widespread support from across the sectors.


The government will not be supporting the opposition's amendments to this bill. The second reading amendment proposed by the opposition, that implies the government is not genuinely committed to equality because we are not adopting the opposition's paid parental leave scheme, really is laughable because it is this government that took the historic step of delivering Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave scheme. We now have more than 160,000 expectant and new parents who have applied for the government's Paid Parental Leave scheme. Our scheme is affordable. It is fair for families and fair for businesses. We waited 11 years for those opposite to deliver this important reform, but they said no. Now they are proposing a $4.5 billion plan that ironically, from what we have heard in their contributions to debate on this bill, whacks a tax on business to pay for itself. The detailed amendments moved by the opposition are inconsistent and impractical and have the potential to increase red tape for businesses and for the agency.


What the government is aiming to achieve through this legislation is cultural change—that is, change that will come from employers receiving education, assistance and support to make their workplaces more gender equal, and change that will benefit women and men, businesses and industry, and the Australian economy. A review of the current act by the Office for Women found updates were needed both to the act and to the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency to provide a contemporary response to national challenges. The review also made it clear that gender equality is essential to maximising Australia's productive potential and to ensuring continued economic growth.


The bill changes the name of the act to the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 to emphasise this new focus in the act on gender equality in the workplace. Similar changes are made to the name of the agency, which is to be called the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. The government is providing the agency with an additional $11.2 million—a doubling of funds—a part of which will be used to provide practical help and advice to business.


The principal objects of the act are amended by the bill to reflect the focus on gender equality in the workplace, and include the promotion of matters such as equal remuneration, support for employers to remove workplace participation barriers for women in particular, and improved productivity and competitiveness of Australian businesses through the advancement of gender equality. Importantly, the coverage of the act is expanded to include men as well as women, particularly in relation to caring responsibilities.


Under the new, outcomes based, streamlined and more transparent reporting requirements, relevant employers will prepare and lodge public reports containing information on gender equality indicators for the reporting period commencing 1 April 2013. Smaller organisations with fewer than 100 employees will not be required to report. In other words, not one small business will be affected by the reporting requirements but they will still be able to access the agency's free advice, education and incentive activities if they wish. Relevant businesses will be able to complete and submit reports online using a secure web portal. Businesses have wanted this change and it will save them time and money.


The reporting changes will represent the first opportunity for the agency to gather and analyse a rigorous and standardised data set and will mean employers can measure their performance against other employers in their industry. This new reporting will mean less red tape. Businesses will no longer need to provide lengthy descriptions of the programs and policies they have in place. When an employer lodges a public report, employees and shareholders will be informed, and employees and employee organisations will be given an opportunity to comment.


Under the amended legislation, the minister will be able to set industry specific minimum standards in consultation with industry and experts. These minimum standards will be determined before 1 April 2014. The minimum standards will be evidence based, clear and fair, and will take into account industry characteristics and circumstances. We will be setting these minimum standards in close consultation with industry to make sure of this. This bill is not about punishing employers. These standards will be about identifying which employers need the most intensive assistance and education in order to achieve cultural change within their organisations. The bill also improves the transparency and fairness of the compliance framework and of the consequences for non-compliance.


Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Elizabeth Broderick, said in a media release that the bill was: 'a strong step toward improving women's workforce participation and, thus, closing the gender gap in Australia's workforce'. Westpac has also welcomed this bill. The Head of Diversity and Flexibility in the Westpac Group, Jane Counsel, said the reforms will provide a catalyst to drive concrete change through creating more focus, accountability and transparency to ensure all organisations are committed to delivering more inclusive and flexible workplaces.


The CEO of Citi Australia, Stephen Roberts, is happy to be on the record as saying he welcomes this legislation and the contribution it will make to improving gender diversity in the workforce. He says:


A diverse team is invariably smarter, more resilient and more productive—all of which is required for success in business.


The YWCA Australia executive director, Dr Caroline Lambert, has also commended the government 'for taking action to strengthen the tools for gender equality in the workplace'. She says:


YWCA Australia welcomes the focus in the Bill on caring responsibilities. This legislation will contribute to real change in the lives of women and men in workplaces across Australia, and we look forward to its passage in the Parliament.


Madam Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to say that time has arrived. This new legislation puts gender equality in the workplace in the spotlight and it shows the determination of this government to advance gender equality between women and men and to strengthen our economy.

33B Minister to repeal a legislative instrument when a new instrument is made


      If making a legislative instrument under this Act which imposes a requirement on employers, the Minister must cause an existing legislative instrument which imposes a requirement on employers to be repealed. 


As the Minister for the Status of Women, who is at the table, reminded us, this bill was introduced into the House on 1 March. It has finally lurched to its conclusion. It has taken months and yet there is not a single member of the government behind this minister here and now to wave this exciting piece of reform through, even though it has been described as such by every single speaker from the government.


If this bill made a single bit of difference to the women that I meet in my life as an opposition spokesperson and a local member—women struggling with participation in the workforce, with the cost of child care, with working the hours they want to work at times they want to work and with balancing very difficult work and family responsibilities, with, as my friend the member for Calwell said, issues surrounding recently arrived migrants and refugees—I would be supporting it without hesitation. But, if we apply the ultimate barbecue stopper, what members of the government will be going out into their electorates after today and talking about this bill? What members of the government are writing this bill up in their local newsletters or issuing media releases to say, 'Everybody, we've created a new agency. It's called the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. It's led by a new individual called the director of workplace gender equality. Our departments are putting together gender equality indicators and then there will be an enormous amount of ministerial discretion over how to apply the new rules that we have not yet worked out in the workplaces of Australia'? Mind you, it only affects private workplaces. If you work in public workplaces, this bill does not apply to you. We think that is incredibly unfair, by the way.


What members of the government are talking this up? I would challenge any one of them to send me the literature that they are putting out in their communities to support this, because this is meaningless. It is meaningless to the average Australian who is struggling with the cost of living and the issues of balancing work and family, which are supposedly what this bill is about. As I said, it covers a new agency, new indicators and vast-ranging ministerial discretion to do things which we are not sure about. The minister at the table said, 'Relax, it won't apply to businesses with fewer than 100 employees, so small businesses won't be affected.' But, because the discretion exists, it actually might. Articulated in this legislation is a mandate to consider these businesses as strategies are developed around resources et cetera. Those businesses are not automatically removed or ruled out of this legislation. In future this legislation may capture businesses with fewer than 100 employees. As it is, every business in Australia will be caught up in learning about this new legislation, what it means, whether they have to report, to what degree they might have to report and whether something will come down the track that will trap them into more red tape, more regulation and more explanations.


We are moving amendments to this bill, and I encourage members of the government and the Independents to consider them carefully. The amendments are varied, but the key amendment which I think should wave a red flag in this place is the one that says that, for every piece of regulation that is added for businesses under this bill, we expect one piece of regulation to be taken away. We do not think it is fair. I have heard speaker after speaker explain that this will take away the burden of regulation on businesses, so I would like to see that demonstrated by the government. I asked for that in my second reading speech, but I have not heard back. I can only assume that this is going to add to red tape and regulation.


The coalition has formed the view that this bill, which is being promoted as a bill to increase gender equality in the workplace, is in reality an artificial contrivance by the government to increase union power and leverage in workplaces. The government, when questioned about the impact of this bill, is unable to tell us how many more women will be employed, how many more jobs will be created or what is to be the actual increase in gender equality in the workplace as a result of the measures provided for in this bill. It is employers that will have to implement these proposed workplace changes, not the public sector, unions or lobby groups. It is employers that will have to bear the additional costs of these changes, notwithstanding that the government cannot tell us what those costs are. Our amendments are very much in the interests of the employers, the families and the communities that we on this side of the House speak up for.

I particularly note that the member for Farrer talked about the last amendment of the legislation removing red tape. It is interesting and quite unusual, because the opposition are asking the minister to cause a legislative instrument to be repealed, which I cannot do because that is the role of the parliament. That indicates what these amendments are about. The government does not support the amendments. We have consulted widely with employers on this legislation.

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (15:18):  I am very pleased today to speak on the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012. This is a very timely and important bill to ensure that we progress gender equality in the workplace.


The campaign for women's equal representation in the workplace is one many decades in the making. We have seen various triumphs for women over the years at a national and international level. When I was researching this speech it was very interesting to hear many stories of women who have really put themselves out there to draw attention to this important issue. One of these was Zelda D'Aprano, who chained herself to the Commonwealth Building in Melbourne while campaigning to ensure equal pay. This was really important and the legislation before us today builds on the legislation and the many achievements that have gone before it.


The legislation goes back a long way, but in 1972 the big decision made by the courts was to grant equal pay for equal work. This was a very important decision because it put into law that women who were doing the same work as men, alongside their work colleagues, would get equal pay. We have continued to see some inequities in the area of equal pay, which I will talk about shortly, but that decision was a very important one in ensuring the start of equal opportunity in the workplace.


Twenty-eight years ago the Sex Discrimination Act was introduced and the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act 1986 was introduced two years later. This was important legislation and there have been some important inroads made in this area. There was a government review in 1999 which looked at this issue and again some improvements were made—but one would agree that more than 10 years after that review it is important that we review the act again. In 2008, the then Minister for the Status of Women, Tanya Plibersek, announced a review of this legislation. It was very important that this take into consideration the many stakeholders and interested parties to ensure that we got this legislation right for the next decade. The legislation in front of us today makes some important improvements to the legislation. In particular—and it does a number of things—the bill amends the name of the act to the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012, which emphasises the focus of the act on gender equality, thereby improving the outcomes for women and men in workplaces. The name of the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency will also be changed to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. This will be important to equip this agency to prepare to move into the future. As I mentioned, things have changed: we hopefully do not have to have women chaining themselves to Commonwealth buildings to get fair pay, but we still have to make sure that we are approaching and tackling gender inequity in our workplaces, and this sets the agency up to be very much focused on its task ahead.


The bill amends the principal objectives of the act to reflect on a new focus to promote and improve gender equality in the workplace, with special recognition of equal remuneration and family and caring responsibilities as issues central to the achievement of gender equality. While we have come a long way in remuneration and ensuring that women and men get paid equally, we still have a long way to go. It was only very recently that we were able to celebrate—and I certainly welcomed—the decision by Fair Work Australia in the fair pay case. That recognised that there has been systematic underpayment of women, depending on which areas of work they take up, and that the structural inequity must be addressed. That was a very important decision, one that I welcomed, but I am also proud to be part of a government that not only welcomed that decision and what it meant for many women workers around the country but also responded practically by putting its money where its mouth was in terms of fair pay for women. I encourage all the states and territories to do the same. We need to work with the states and territories to ensure that the fair pay decision becomes realised. I am very pleased that this Commonwealth Labor government has made that commitment.


Family and caring responsibilities are issues central to the achievement of gender equality, and so often it is women who take on the brunt or the burden of caring. Many women are very pleased to take this on, whether it be for children or older parents, and they are pleased to be of service and want to do this. However, we must recognise that this can affect the participation of women in the workforce. Without having the proper flexibilities and the proper frameworks in place this can, for many women, affect their participation in the workplace and does not allow them to achieve gender equity.


It is not just in the workplace that this is an issue but also in the future with superannuation. For many women who take on part-time roles and balance their caring responsibilities with their work responsibilities, who take time out of the workplace while raising children, there will be inequities in superannuation. This is a very important area that we must continue to focus on as to how we ensure that women are not disadvantaged—not just at work but also in retirement. I am very pleased that the objects of this act will be amended to ensure that family and caring responsibilities are issues central to the achievement of gender equality.


This bill also proposes to improve the coverage of the act to include men as well as women. Agency advice and assistance functions will not be just for those companies that are required to report. Under the legislation employers of 100 or more employees are subject to the reporting requirements. This suggests that only those organisations could get advice and assistance from the agency. I am very pleased that this bill will ensure that the agency's advice and assistance will extend to all employers. So if that employer is a small business looking at gender equality and equity issues it will also be able to access advice. I encourage those small businesses that may be interested in this area to get in touch once the new agency is providing this advice to get some ideas about this.


The bill also introduces a new reporting framework in which relevant employers are required to report against gender equality indicators. This will commence from 1 April 2013. Obviously, this provides employers with some time in which they can get their information together. It has a phase-in period. The requirement for the equal opportunity in the workplace program will be removed and the reporting will be simpler as well as more meaningful and more useful.


One of the really important things in this bill is that it will allow employers to both measure and understand gender equality within their workplaces but also compare themselves to other workplaces in their industry. I think this is important because it will allow the agency to target assistance and, over time, will also allow employers to really gauge how they are doing on issues of gender equity. Over time, the improved and standardised data set will also allow the minister to set minimum standards. This will be important to communicate clearly to businesses what these minimum standards are. They will be based on a standardised set of data, recognising that things change from industry to industry. The functions of the agency will be to develop industry based benchmarks in relation to gender equality indicators. The agency will also have specific roles in providing assistance and advice on improving performance against minimum standards. The bill also clarifies and improves transparency associated with compliance with the act and the consequences of noncompliance. 


This bill builds on this Labor government's achievements when it comes to women's participation in the workforce. We have introduced key things. I have mentioned the fair pay decision and the commitment by this government to put money up to fund that decision. When we were first elected, we addressed the issue of childcare costs. We moved from a 30 per cent rebate to a 50 per cent rebate for childcare costs. That was very important. I was very proud to be part of a government that introduced paid parental leave for the first time in this nation's history. This paid parental leave ensures a continuing connection with the workforce for women taking time out of the workforce to have children, being able to re-enter the workforce if they desire. I am very pleased that this Labor government delivered that.


I think that this bill builds on a lot of advances that we have made in terms of gender equity in the workplace. I was very concerned to hear—back in my home state of South Australia—the state Leader of the Opposition, Isobel Redmond, say, when asked what she would do if she felt she was being discriminated against on the basis of gender, 'Look, I just put up with it and hopefully it will go away.' I do not think that is an appropriate response. I think it was a very concerning message to many women out there that they should just put up with it, that it should be just part of work. You feel discriminated against, you get passed over for promotion. There is not a sense that you are actually being recognised; you should just put up with it and ignore it. I do not think that is the attitude of most places. I do not think it is the attitude of most in this parliament. We need to ensure that there is gender equality in our workplaces right around Australia, that women and men get a fair go in terms of their time at work and ensure that their rights and ability to fully participate are encouraged.


On that note, I think this is a very important development on the bill. As discussed, a number of ministers have widely consulted on this and I believe this does strike a good balance in ensuring and progressing equity in our workforce but also in ensuring that it is easier for business to deliver.

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (15:33):  It is a pleasure to follow the member for Kingston in speaking to this Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012. This bill amends the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999 to deliver very importantly on a 2010 election commitment by the government to improve women's workforce participation. This proposed legislation presents a new framework for encouraging gender equality by removing those disincentives that mitigate against the equal participation of women in the workforce. It also fulfils a dual purpose of supporting improved workforce participation—particularly that of women and carers—as well as reducing, more importantly, the regulatory burden on business. This is a timely bill and the government must be commended for its determination to implement these important changes because they are defining changes that will make a real difference to women and men in the broader workforce.


Many of us still struggle to comprehend in today's society—living in one of the most democratic countries in the world—why it is that wage parity, practical employment structures and cracking that infamous corporate glass ceiling sadly still elude many women. In contemporary Australia, where women are encouraged to achieve and contribute to the workforce, the issue of gender inequality as a significant disincentive to women's workforce participation must be challenged and addressed. While much of this workplace discrimination may not be intentional, it does highlight a need to challenge the manifestation of entrenched views based on gender differences in the workplace. Many of those entrenched views stem from practices that are driven very much by gender stereotyping and expectations.


One of the most obvious differences and, therefore, stereotyping practices is that women are by nature designed to bear children, and men are not. With that comes a whole lot of other gender intricacies. Rather than be left to continue to make it difficult for women to participate in the workforce, these intricacies should be embraced and catered for, knowing that one size does not fit all in the workplace and that we need the flexibility to accommodate and therefore maximise workforce participation for women and men. The truth is that many prospective employers do tend to adopt an attitude that avoids employing or promoting women because it is perceived that they are more likely to have family-work balance issues that, if the truth be said, are not necessarily problems for prospective male employees. That is not to say that men do not have responsibilities to their families, but existing traditional workplace conditions together with social expectations have created a workplace culture which traditionally made it easier for men to participate and harder for women to participate. So we need to change our attitudes and, if we are to change the culture in the workplace as it relates to the participation of women and men, we need to encourage more women into the workforce and we have to act via legislation to ensure that these changes are implemented and we get a more equal playing field. That is why I support this bill.


Our community has changed and is changing around us, and it expects government to act and to respond to those changes. The introduction of this bill ensures that we are steadily working our way through our attitudes and practices on gender equality issues and the responsibilities of both genders when it comes to the balance between work and family. The introduction of this amendment bill follows a review that found that, since the act was last amended in 1999, there have been a number of economic, social and legislative changes that require the agency to provide a more contemporary response to these changes. The government undertook extensive consultation with industry, employee organisations and the women's sector and, in doing so, drafted legislation that is finely balanced—legislation that all parties are comfortable with and which is very much about supporting employers to achieve cultural change. It most certainly is not about punishing employers or setting unreasonable standards that they cannot meet.


Importantly, the government is acting by introducing this amendment bill because the review made it clear that gender equality is essential to maximising Australia's productive potential and ensuring continuing economic growth. Closing the gap between women's and men's workforce participation is estimated to have the potential to boost gross domestic product by some 13 per cent. But, more importantly, it also has the potential to improve the lives of the broader Australian community in so many ways beyond the GDP.


I do want to draw the House's attention to the recently released report by the Grattan Institute, Game-changers: economic reform priorities for Australia. In that report it is affirmed that the participation of women in the workforce is one of the three major areas that were identified by the Grattan Institute for increasing Australia's GDP. The issue of women's participation is a game changer. It is worth up to $90 million or so in GDP increase over the next decade. So it is a significant issue and cannot be ignored.


This bill makes the appropriate changes in order to take advantage of the participation of all Australians—in particular, women—in the workforce. It changes the name of the act to the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012, and the name of the agency from the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency.


The principal objectives of the amendments are to promote and improve gender equality, including equal remuneration between men and women in employment and in the workplace. It aims to do this by supporting employers to remove barriers to the full participation of women and men, recognising the disadvantaged position of women in relation to employment.


I cannot see how the aims of this amendment bill can be anything other than positive. Gender equality in Australian workplaces is important for women, it is important for men, it is important for businesses and it is important for the economy. And it is very much a win-win for all—for employers, for employees and especially for women. And it is, of course, a win for Australia's GDP capacity.


I know that my constituents would benefit greatly from achieving gender equality in the workplace. They certainly will be better off with the stated aim of this bill, which is to close the gap between men's and women's participation. Many people in my electorate talk about their responsibilities to their children, their aged parents and their disabled family members. They all talk about their ways of finding strategies to balance these responsibilities with the need to work. So I am absolutely certain that they will welcome this bill. In particular, there are many women in my electorate who go about the daily business of balancing work and family commitments. These are women who must look after their children but must also work, and in most cases they are the low-skilled women who are also in low-paid jobs. Then there are the young women in my electorate—those who are single and those who are highly-skilled, career-focused women who will largely rely on changes in the workplace culture to pave the way for a change of attitude that will enable them to face less discrimination as they pursue their careers and life's ambitions and choices.


So I am familiar, as all of us should be, with these community attitudes and how this bill will assist in making their lives a little easier as it will allow them to participate in the workforce. This is especially so for the women in my electorate, and I want to make a special mention of the many refugee women who have settled in the federal seat of Calwell. These are women who have come from less democratic and equitable societies—women who, in addition to working to support their families, have also to pick up the pieces of broken lives and lost homes; women who have fled war, who have feared and continue to fear for the safety of their loved ones, but especially for the security and the future of their children; women who have overcome horrors that we here in Australia have never experienced. Yet these women persevere, and they form a part of the socioeconomic and cultural diversity of the Australia community and, indeed, the Australian workforce. They are grateful to be here, as waves of migrants before them were; they are grateful for the opportunity. But they are more often than not the most likely to be excluded from workplace participation and they, like the rest of the Australian community, deserve a fairer, more equal playing field. We all deserve a society and a workplace that caters and allows for greater gender equity and flexibility. That is how we ensure a happier, fairer and more equitable society. Of course change is never easy, but in some circumstances it cannot be brought on soon enough. The time has come to address the obvious and allow workplaces to meet the needs of our changing societies, and I commend the bill to the House.

Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin—Minister for Community Services, Minister for the Status of Women and Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development) (15:44):  I thank all of those people who made contributions on this important bill. The Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Bill 2012 amends the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999, delivering a significant package of reforms promised by this government during the 2010 election. These reforms are aimed at improving gender equality in Australian workplaces. For improved workplace participation and workplace flexibility for women, these reforms will help to improve productivity and address current and future skills shortages. It has been estimated that closing the gap between men's and women's workforce participation could boost gross domestic product by up to13 per cent.


The bill has been developed in close consultation with key stakeholders including industry, employee organisations and the women's sector. The government believes the bill strikes the right balance between the views of these stakeholders. Since its introduction on 1 March 2012, the bill has received widespread support from across the sectors.


The government will not be supporting the opposition's amendments to this bill. The second reading amendment proposed by the opposition, that implies the government is not genuinely committed to equality because we are not adopting the opposition's paid parental leave scheme, really is laughable because it is this government that took the historic step of delivering Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave scheme. We now have more than 160,000 expectant and new parents who have applied for the government's Paid Parental Leave scheme. Our scheme is affordable. It is fair for families and fair for businesses. We waited 11 years for those opposite to deliver this important reform, but they said no. Now they are proposing a $4.5 billion plan that ironically, from what we have heard in their contributions to debate on this bill, whacks a tax on business to pay for itself. The detailed amendments moved by the opposition are inconsistent and impractical and have the potential to increase red tape for businesses and for the agency.


What the government is aiming to achieve through this legislation is cultural change—that is, change that will come from employers receiving education, assistance and support to make their workplaces more gender equal, and change that will benefit women and men, businesses and industry, and the Australian economy. A review of the current act by the Office for Women found updates were needed both to the act and to the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency to provide a contemporary response to national challenges. The review also made it clear that gender equality is essential to maximising Australia's productive potential and to ensuring continued economic growth.


The bill changes the name of the act to the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 to emphasise this new focus in the act on gender equality in the workplace. Similar changes are made to the name of the agency, which is to be called the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. The government is providing the agency with an additional $11.2 million—a doubling of funds—a part of which will be used to provide practical help and advice to business.


The principal objects of the act are amended by the bill to reflect the focus on gender equality in the workplace, and include the promotion of matters such as equal remuneration, support for employers to remove workplace participation barriers for women in particular, and improved productivity and competitiveness of Australian businesses through the advancement of gender equality. Importantly, the coverage of the act is expanded to include men as well as women, particularly in relation to caring responsibilities.


Under the new, outcomes based, streamlined and more transparent reporting requirements, relevant employers will prepare and lodge public reports containing information on gender equality indicators for the reporting period commencing 1 April 2013. Smaller organisations with fewer than 100 employees will not be required to report. In other words, not one small business will be affected by the reporting requirements but they will still be able to access the agency's free advice, education and incentive activities if they wish. Relevant businesses will be able to complete and submit reports online using a secure web portal. Businesses have wanted this change and it will save them time and money.


The reporting changes will represent the first opportunity for the agency to gather and analyse a rigorous and standardised data set and will mean employers can measure their performance against other employers in their industry. This new reporting will mean less red tape. Businesses will no longer need to provide lengthy descriptions of the programs and policies they have in place. When an employer lodges a public report, employees and shareholders will be informed, and employees and employee organisations will be given an opportunity to comment.


Under the amended legislation, the minister will be able to set industry specific minimum standards in consultation with industry and experts. These minimum standards will be determined before 1 April 2014. The minimum standards will be evidence based, clear and fair, and will take into account industry characteristics and circumstances. We will be setting these minimum standards in close consultation with industry to make sure of this. This bill is not about punishing employers. These standards will be about identifying which employers need the most intensive assistance and education in order to achieve cultural change within their organisations. The bill also improves the transparency and fairness of the compliance framework and of the consequences for non-compliance.


Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Elizabeth Broderick, said in a media release that the bill was: 'a strong step toward improving women's workforce participation and, thus, closing the gender gap in Australia's workforce'. Westpac has also welcomed this bill. The Head of Diversity and Flexibility in the Westpac Group, Jane Counsel, said the reforms will provide a catalyst to drive concrete change through creating more focus, accountability and transparency to ensure all organisations are committed to delivering more inclusive and flexible workplaces.


The CEO of Citi Australia, Stephen Roberts, is happy to be on the record as saying he welcomes this legislation and the contribution it will make to improving gender diversity in the workforce. He says:


A diverse team is invariably smarter, more resilient and more productive—all of which is required for success in business.


The YWCA Australia executive director, Dr Caroline Lambert, has also commended the government 'for taking action to strengthen the tools for gender equality in the workplace'. She says:


YWCA Australia welcomes the focus in the Bill on caring responsibilities. This legislation will contribute to real change in the lives of women and men in workplaces across Australia, and we look forward to its passage in the Parliament.


Madam Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to say that time has arrived. This new legislation puts gender equality in the workplace in the spotlight and it shows the determination of this government to advance gender equality between women and men and to strengthen our economy.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (16:17):  Let me say at the outset that the coalition supports these bills—the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012—which were introduced on Thursday, 24 May 2012 by the member for Maribyrnong, the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I will run briefly through the schedules in the first bill, then the single schedule in the second bill and cover a couple of areas of detail that have been raised since the minister introduced this legislation in the last sitting fortnight.


As I said at the outset on behalf of the coalition, we support these bills and the principles that underpin them. With respect to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012, the first schedule of the bill introduces—as the minister outlined in his second reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum—a framework to support the implementation of superannuation data and payment regulations and standards that will apply to specified superannuation transactions undertaken by superannuation entities, retirement savings account providers and employers. The second schedule amends the APRA Act, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998—specifically section 50—to enable costs associated with the implementation of the measures to be included in the minister's determination specifying the amount of the levy that is payable to the Commonwealth. The amendments also enable the minister to make a determination that specifies the proportion of levy money paid to APRA that is to be credited to the APRA Special Account. The Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill amends the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Act 1998 in a range of material respects to enable the Treasurer to make more than one determination on the imposition of levies for a financial year.


The coalition is supporting this legislation and supports the principle of measures that improve the efficiency, transparency and competitiveness of the administration of the superannuation system by making the system easier to use for employers, ensuring fewer lost accounts, providing a more timely flow of money to super fund members' accounts and delivering savings to employers and fund members. As part of the government's proposal, these bills provide for the implementation of data and payment regulations and standards, as I have outlined, that will allow participants in the super system to communicate by using standardised business terms in a consistent and reliable format. Electronic transmission using agreed transport and security protocols will allow for a more automated and timely processing of transactions with fewer errors. If properly implemented, these changes will deliver significant efficiency savings to the super industry and to employers. Indeed, the savings have been estimated by the Financial Services Council to be quite significant—of the order of $20 billion over 10 years. Much of the detail on these new standards will, of course, be in regulations, which industry participants consider to be appropriate.


Like most pieces of technical legislation, this has been before a parliamentary committee since its introduction on 24 May—that committee being the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, of which I am a member. That committee reported today—around lunchtime, to be accurate—recommending that the legislation be passed but also recommending:


That the ATO be required to provide a regular detailed breakdown of its costs and expenditure of the additional levies to the SuperStream Advisory Council, based on reporting guidelines developed in consultation between the council and the ATO.


That is a firm recommendation of the committee—and by all members on the committee. The cost of implementation, as outlined in the legislation and in the minister's speech, will be $467 million from 2012-13 to 2017-18, including $121 million in 2012-13. So we think that that recommendation in the report tabled earlier today is a relevant one. We on this side of the House note that it is supported by all members on the committee. As I said, we support this legislation and think if properly implemented it will certainly provide benefits and efficiencies right through the system.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (16:24):  The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012 introduce a framework to support the implementation of superannuation data and payment regulations and standards that will apply to specified superannuation transactions undertaken by superannuation entities, retirement savings account providers and employers. As the previously speaker noted, this is technical legislation, but it is legislation that will make a difference to Australians and their families.


SuperStream costs of $467 million will be collected through the superannuation supervisory levy from 2012-13 to 2017-18. That will enable the government to collect the implementation costs associated with the SuperStream measure. The opposition have acknowledged the efficiencies from the SuperStream proposal and have acknowledged that they have the potential to deliver real savings over time and will benefit superannuants.


The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia calculates that $1.3 trillion of assets are in superannuation funds. Treasury forecasts estimate that this will grow to between $3 trillion and $5 trillion by 2025. When Bob Hawke took office in 1983, just 40 per cent of the workforce had superannuation cover. Thanks to Labor, that rose from 72 per cent in 1991 to 94 per cent in 2007. Australians have more money invested in managed funds per capita than any other economy in the world.


The Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation today released new research showing broad support for the superannuation system but that, understandably, many people continue to find it a difficult topic to understand. Senator Sherry, who recently stepped down after many years of public service, was one of those in the Labor caucus with a true passion for superannuation—but I cannot promise that the rest of us ever had quite his level of engagement with that topic. But it is important that Australian policy makers recognise the benefits to improving the simplicity and the efficiency of the superannuation system.


There is $20 billion in lost super in Australia, and reuniting Australians with their lost superannuation is absolutely critical. I joined with Chris Bourke MLA, last year in running some mobile offices around the ACT. We found that there were particular postcodes in which there was a very high level of lost superannuation. We worked with a simple mobile office and a laptop computer helping people get back in touch with their lost superannuation accounts using the ATO's SuperSeeker tool. We were pleased on a number of occasions to assist people in finding their unclaimed superannuation.


The research announced today by the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation showed that people's level of interest in their superannuation varied depending on how old they are, how financially literate they are and the amount of superannuation they had saved. It found that across all age groups, the majority of Australians were not confident that they have enough superannuation to retire and live comfortably on and that, overall, employers believe that superannuation is beneficial to their employees and the general population to reduce the reliance on the pension—giving lie to the claim by some of those opposite in the early 1990s that employers would not support universal superannuation.


The superannuation industry is currently dominated by paper based transactions. They are inefficient in both processing costs and the time taken for transactions to occur and superannuation to be deposited in to members' accounts. The superannuation data and payment standards will allow participants in the superannuation system to communicate using standard business terms in a consistent and reliable format. Using electronic transmission, with agreed security protocols, will mean that we will get quicker processing of transactions and fewer errors. Just as e-health is bringing about efficiencies in the healthcare system, so, too, greater efficiency in the superannuation payments system is a benefit to all Australians. It is an easier system for employers to use. There will be fewer lost accounts and Australians will get the money in their accounts more quickly—which, of course, means that they will begin earning returns more quickly.


The superannuation data and payment standards will be mandated for superannuation entities, including approved deposit funds, RSA providers and employers. The regulators—being the commissioner and APRA—will support the rollout of the new data and payment standards through education activities and a new compliance framework. Industry submissions to the super system review estimated that savings of up to a billion dollars per annum are achievable from implementing the SuperStream reforms.


Members will be able to look up and keep track of their superannuation, have low-value inactive accounts consolidated automatically, be able to consolidate larger accounts easily, have their contributions and rollovers processed more quickly and be able to more easily check if their superannuation contributions have been made. Employers will benefit from having standardised, simplified administrative processes when dealing with superannuation funds. Superannuation funds will benefit from standardised and simplified administrative processes when dealing with employers and other funds, and be able to make greater use of tax file numbers to facilitate matching and consolidation of accounts and of electronic validation services from the ATO that will help their administration and help ensure members are properly matched with their superannuation. Efficiencies for superannuation funds mean higher returns for fund members.


When Prime Minister Paul Keating moved to introduce the superannuation guarantee levy, Wilson Tuckey drew on his long history in the racing industry to compare the legislation to the 'worst type of jockey … both stupid and dishonest'. Mr Tuckey continued:


When the poor old employer levy gets to 12 per cent, what will it deliver? Luckily, it might deliver an overseas holiday and a few presents for the kids, but it will not deliver a retirement income at the inflated costs of those days.


As Minister Shorten has demonstrated, a 12 per cent superannuation guarantee will provide to a worker now aged 30 on average full-time wages a real benefit of over $553,000 at age pension age. That should leave a bit of change after an overseas holiday and a few presents for the kids.


The Leader of the Opposition once called Labor's superannuation guarantee a con job. Those opposite have either been uninterested in superannuation or outright critical. When Senator Bishop—as she then was—spoke in the other place on the introduction of universal super on 18 August 1992 she said:


On this side opposition members argued very logically and meaningfully that the imposition of this compulsory superannuation tax is a de facto federal payroll tax.


Yes, they were running their 'great big new tax' argument even against compulsory superannuation. Then Senator Bishop told the Senate about a conversation with a small business person who had said:


But now that this compulsory superannuation payment has gone through, yesterday I had to sack a part time employee and turn a full time employee into a part time employee.


The late Senator Peter Cook, a man for whom I was privileged to work, was moved by that statement to interject that given that the law for universal superannuation had not yet come into effect, it was hard to see how small-business people would be affected by it. You can see shades of that in the scare campaign those opposite are running against the carbon price, which has not yet come into effect. But Senator Bishop—as she was then was—was unmoved and finished up the debate as follows:


I heard Senator McMullan say, ‘The difference between our systems on superannuation is that ours is compulsory and theirs is voluntary’. That is very true. That is an essential difference. Our policy is designed to make it attractive for people to provide for themselves in later life whereas this Government’s is designed to penalise business, to regulate it out of existence.


Of course, if you carry on with that logic then the member for Mackellar should today be saying to this chamber that superannuation is penalising business and ought to be scrapped. But the fact is that no-one is making those arguments. I quoted some of the statements made in the 1990s because they illustrate an important point, not just about superannuation but also about economic history more generally. The economic reforms that have made Australia great, like universal superannuation, were hard fought at the time. Many of them were opposed by those opposite and many of those opposite at the time said they would scrap them if they were to win government. But when they did in fact take the Treasury benches, they did nothing of the kind. Universal superannuation is now part of the Australian social fabric. It was attacked at the time, demonised as being a big new tax and is now recognised as being an important pillar of a dignified retirement in Australia.


Australian workers, 8.4 million of them, will benefit from an increase in the superannuation guarantee rate from nine per cent to 12 per cent. This government is also abolishing the age limit for the superannuation guarantee so, no matter what your age, if you work you will get super. It will provide an extra contribution for the 3.6 million Australians who are earning up to $37,000. That includes plenty of part-time workers as well as low-income earners. It is a recognition of the point made in the Henry tax review that the superannuation concessions were, under the Howard government, significantly more generous for high-income earners than for low-income earners.


We are putting in place simplification reforms, which will allow people to see their superannuation account and will give employees certainty by requiring superannuation information to be on every pay slip so people can check to make sure they have got what they are entitled to. We are also introducing a MySuper product, recognising that most employees will take the default fund and within that fund will take the default investment plan. So it is important that the defaults are good and that defaults get good market returns. We are also putting in place more efficiencies to ensure lower fees for fund members. All of these reforms will ensure Australians get the superannuation they are entitled to and ensure the system is as simple, efficient and equitable as it needs to be.


I commend the bill to the House.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (16:36):  It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Fraser, who gave us a discursive exploration of superannuation policy after briefly deigning to come to the specifics of the bill before us. Naturally, I am going to be more limited and—some might say—small minded by concentrating purely on the provisions that are before the House this afternoon.


What I would like to say is that, in the broad, the coalition is supportive of the legislative direction contained in the legislation the House is considering this afternoon. It is an uncontentious proposition that the superannuation sector is dominated by paper based transactions, and that there are real inefficiencies, real deadweight costs and transactions costs. There is clearly capacity to secure efficiencies through the use of information technology standardised formats for the exchange of data and so on. 


Coming, as I do, into this place from a background in the telecommunications sector, I became quite surprised as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on which I served learnt about the challenges currently facing the superannuation sector and the extent to which information is exchanged in paper based form. By contrast, and as one example of the kinds of efficiencies which can be secured on an industry wide basis through the use of information technology, in the telecommunications sector the mobile number portability standard requires that if a customer wishes to port his or her number from one mobile operator to another, it needs to take effect within the course of one day—and often it takes very much less time than that. Therefore I have in my own experience seen the efficiency benefits which can be delivered when standardised information technology systems are used and data transfer standards are applied to a range of participants in an industry.


Let me readily concede that the superannuation sector challenge is an even more daunting one than the one which applies in the telecommunications sector because of the fact that, in addition to all of the superannuation funds—and there are of course hundreds of them—you also have millions of employers, ranging from the very, very large to the many very small businesses. That does present some specific challenges and it also presents some areas of concern with particular aspects of this bill—areas which I am pleased to say were acknowledged by the committee in its unanimous report.


In the brief time I have to speak about this bill today, I want to make essentially three points. Firstly, I want to say that the provisions underpinning greater efficiency in superannuation contained in this bill and the legislative scheme, in the broad, make sense. Secondly, I want to highlight the fact that there are real reasons for doubt and for questioning why the amount of money which has been sought by the Australian Taxation Office to implement this set of information technology changes, and which is funded ultimately by a levy on the industry, is so high. Where is the justification for the costings? Thirdly, I want to question why it is that the legislation takes a particular approach which in particular bristles with penalties and strict liability provisions. 


Let me turn firstly to the broad rationale for this bill—a rationale which, as I have indicated, the coalition supports. As the explanatory memorandum states:


The purpose … is to improve the  administration and management of super accounts making the processing of everyday transactions easier, cheaper and faster for members and employers.


I think any Australian who has ever sought to transfer a superannuation balance from one fund to another would very much empathise with the proposition that, as it presently operates, the superannuation sector is grossly inefficient. That acts to the detriment of members of superannuation funds and all stakeholders, because the costs of the inefficient processing are borne across the sector when it comes to matters such as error, rework, misdirected or lost transactions—all of these things cause cost, inconvenience and inefficiency.


Accordingly, the coalition strongly supports as a principle measures to improve the efficiency, transparency and competitiveness of the administration of superannuation system. We want to see a superannuation system which is easier to use for employers; which ensures fewer lost accounts; which provides a more timely flow of money to the member accounts of superannuation fund members; and which delivers efficiencies and cost savings to employers, to funds and, ultimately therefore, to members. 


The scheme of this legislation is to provide for the implementation of data and payment regulations and standards to allow participants in the superannuation system to communicate by using standardised business turns in a consistent and reliable format. The government estimates that the SuperStream measures will save $1 billion a year in processing costs. The Financial Services Council estimates that the reforms are likely to deliver savings of up to $20 billion in aggregate by 2020 based on the current rate of growth of the asset base in the superannuation system. 


Anybody who has had any experience with large information technology systems and businesses involving the processing of hundreds of millions or even more transactions would know that very small cost savings per transaction can readily add up to a very large amount of money saved in aggregate across the system. I think that is what we can expect this set of changes to achieve if the scheme has the desired effect. 


Stakeholders in the sector are certainly supportive of the objectives. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia commented that it:


… considers the SuperStream measures to be the key component of the Government’s Stronger Super reforms as they have the greatest potential to improve members’ retirement outcomes through the creation of a more efficient superannuation system.


The Financial Services Council in its submission to the committee noted that there has been for a long time agreement in principle across the industry of the desirability of establishing superannuation data standards; however, it has not proven possible, to date, in a cooperative fashion to establish those standards and have all the stakeholders sign up to them. Accordingly, there is broad acceptance of the need for legislative action.


That brings me to the second point I want to make which is that, although there is broad acceptance of the need for legislative action, there are eyebrows raised across the superannuation sector as to the surprisingly large amount of money which the Australian Taxation Office has identified it needs to implement these new arrangements. Under this bill a levy is to be imposed on the superannuation sector which amounts to $467 million. That is a very large sum of money by any standard yet at the same time the degree of transparency and justification that has been provided for this very large sum is disappointing. It is a notorious truth that information technology systems development can be an extraordinary black hole. It is very tempting for those involved in the process to inflate their costs and identify a whole range of requirements which add to the total cost of the exercise. It is often difficult for those receiving the bill to assess the validity of the amounts that are claimed but, as a very first step, you need to be provided with details, specifics and justifications for the amount of money proposed to be spent on the new information technology system changes. That is a principle which is true in the private sector and it is equally true in this particular context which is essentially a hybrid of private and public sector activity.


It is not surprising that one of the strong themes which emerged from the committee's inquiry into this legislation is that there has been an inadequate level of justification by the Australian Taxation Office and the government for the amount of money stated to be required, which is to be extracted from the industry by means of a levy to fund these changes. That is an observation which has been made by quite a number of stakeholders. Let me quote, for example, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia:


… it remains unclear what the levies will actually pay for … The Explanatory Memorandum only has information on the proposed year by year funding with no further detail on what the money will be actually spent on. Given the substantial amount sought to be recovered ($467 million in total) much greater accountability should be demanded from the Australian Taxation Office.


Submitters also made the point that it would be wholly inappropriate for the Australian Taxation Office to obtain benefits funded from this specific levy on the superannuation sector which extended to its broader operations. I note that the concerns which were expressed by a number of industry stakeholders were acknowledged by the committee in its unanimous report and the committee has recommended that the Australian Taxation Office be required to provide a regular, detailed breakdown to the SuperStream Advisory Council of its costs and the expenditure of the additional levies.


Finally, I want to note that the compliance burden which will fall upon employers as a result of these changes will be a material one and it is therefore concerning that the legislative scheme adopted here is one which bristles with penalties and strict liability provisions. Employers are required to provide very detailed data associated with superannuation payments and failure to provide that data exposes them to penalties. It is not just superannuation funds which are exposed to penalties under this legislation; it is every employer including, of course, small employers. A number of stakeholders who made submissions to the committee pointed out the nature of the challenge that employers including, in particular, small employers will face in complying with this legislation. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry suggested that the government ought to consider including a 'safe harbour' provision in the legislation to allow employers, who with the best will in the world find themselves unable to strictly comply, protection against being hit with arbitrary penalties. The Financial Services Council submitted that the proposed compliance measures are overly severe.


I particularly want to note concerns that the bill is bristling with strict liability provisions. A strict liability provision is one where the mental state of the person who commits an offence is deemed to be irrelevant. Accordingly, even if you set out with the best will in the world and make every reasonable effort to comply but fail to do so, you are exposed to penalties under this legislation. The Australian Taxation Office acknowledged that it would have the legal right under this legislation to impose penalties on a small employer such as a butcher with two or three employees. If that butcher were to pay the amount of superannuation contribution required for each employee when it is required to be paid, but failed to include all of the items of data included under the standard, then that butcher is open to a criminal prosecution and there is no defence open to him or her. That is the reality of what a strict liability provision means.


The committee noted its concerns that the tax office ought to be what you might paraphrase as 'gentle' in the application of these powers. I would argue that trusting the tax office to be gentle is an inherently risky proposition and this is an area of significant concern. The coalition supports these provisions in principle but we have some implementation concerns as I have outlined.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:51):  I speak in support of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012. With about three million Australians currently over the age of 65 years, and 8.1 million Australians over the age of 65 years by 2050, reform in superannuation is not an optional extra but a necessity and a must. I think this federal Labor government has much to be proud of in its reforms of superannuation.


The super system review chaired by Jeremy Cooper recommended many of the reforms that were undertaken here today. Industry submissions to the review estimated that the industry could save up to $1 billion, achievable through the reforms that we are undertaking. Ernst and Young said similar things in its submission. We have confirmed our commitment in the budget to the SuperStream reforms, which will make a difference, and previous speakers have talked in part about those.


This is a package of reforms to make the superannuation scheme more flexible, more effective, more efficient and easier for members, funds and employers across the country. Currently it is pretty difficult to understand, and a young person who has had three or four different jobs in different locations, vocations or roles might have picked up a bit of superannuation working for one employer after another, sometimes with different funds, and it is easy for their super to be lost. We have an industry worth $1.36 trillion, but according to the Australian Taxation Office we have about $20 billion in lost superannuation. That is money which could be used for the retirement of Australians and to put less reliance on the pension system. So it makes sense to reform the system, to make it more effective and efficient, to reduce reliance on old technology like paperwork and to increase reliance on IT and computerisation.


The reforms will help members keep track of superannuation. An online portal is crucial in that regard so that people can have a look at superannuation, have a look at their accounts and track them, and employers can do the same. It assists people to consolidate those accounts electronically. I do not always agree with the member for Bradfield, but anyone who has ever rolled superannuation from one account to another—I have done this personally and I am sure members of this place and other Australians have also—knows the absolute idiocy of the procedures involved at times. It is extraordinary. I know of a circumstance where one constituent of mine was telling me that he had to arrange for a cheque to be flown to Sydney because they could not change the superannuation from the fund based in Brisbane to the one in Sydney. They had to fly a cheque down to Sydney to deposit it face to face into the fund. This is crazy stuff in the 21st century.


We have a lot of low, inactive accounts, many under $1,000, and these will be automatically consolidated into another of the member's account unless they opt out, saving members' fees and making super easier to control, manage and keep track of. There will be a lot of changes in this process, and I notice the SuperStream Advisory Council has been called for with nominations as well on 4 June 2012.


This government has a proud record, as Labor governments have, of making reform in this country. I am pleased to be advocating locally for the NDIS to come to my electorate, particularly Ipswich. There are great Labor reforms, like the minimum wage, the age pension, Medicare and superannuation. Lest anyone thinks that these came about because those opposite sat over here in government, they should be prepared to have a look, as did the member for Fraser, at speeches made by those opposite on superannuation. They should note the fact that those opposite opposed our reforms to increase the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent as part of what we have said on the minerals resource rent tax. If those opposite had been on this side of the House they would have deprived 43,000 people in my electorate of an increase in superannuation from nine to 12 per cent.


We have made a lot of changes. Specifically, this legislation amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and the Retirement Savings Account Act 1997. We are talking about a framework introduced to ensure the implementation of superannuation data and payment regulations and standards so that there are no inconsistencies and siloed arrangements between the different funds and so that it is standard across the whole industry. This legislation ensures superannuation transactions can be undertaken by various super funds and entities as well as retirement savings account providers, employers and employees, and will give consistency across the whole sector. The legislation also provides for amendments to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998, ensuring that costs associated with the implementation of the SuperStream measures are included in the determination of a levy, which the member for Bradfield accurately mentioned is paid by the sector to the Commonwealth.


The levy itself will be a levy on the industry. It is important that the legislation before the chamber be passed by 1 July this year, giving the industry time to implement the changes and the superannuation supervisory levy to make sure we collect the implementation costs from the SuperStream reforms. The levy will be on the industry in this particular matter, and it is not unusual for that to take place in a sector. As part of our stronger super package we have announced that this is the case. The industry and the stakeholders know it is coming. All the super funds want to make sure that the industry is viable, effective and efficient, and that the government costs associated will be, by virtue of the APRA regulated funds, $467 million from 2012-13 onwards. The minister can make a determination specifying the proportion of the levy money that is to be credited through the APRA special account.


These are important reforms. Members will be able to look up what their superannuation is. I know that during the global financial crisis many constituents in my electorate have talked to me about the fact that their superannuation funds have suffered. I know of a number of people who have put off retirement because of their superannuation being much lower than it once was. They are particularly interested now in keeping track of their super if they are in their late 50s or early 60s. Employers will benefit through simplified standard provisions, and funds will benefit by making sure they are able to have greater use of tax file numbers to facilitate matching consolidation funds, because the Australian Taxation Office administers super funds and has that overall responsibility.


Superannuation is a particularly important reform for my electorate. The bills here, and the part of the package that we are undertaking, are particularly important. I lobbied hard to make sure that we lifted the superannuation guarantee age limit from 70 to 75. We have done that, meaning another 18,000 Australians aged 75 years and over will get the benefit of superannuation if they continue to work. I talked about that issue just last week at the Ipswich Association of Independent Retirees and superannuants. I received a very favourable response about that because, as many of them said to me briefly, they were undertaking or have undertaken a transition in relation to their work-life situation. The days when people always just decided to retire and go from work to retirement are over. Often people transition all the way through. Making sure that they can pick up superannuation in those latter years is an important reform.


That is something that came up recently in relation to superannuation reform for my electorate. I know how important it is. When I talked to those people about the need for young people in our community to get more superannuation, lifting the guarantee from nine to 12 per cent, they supported it, having experienced that in their personal lives. Many of them told me that at times they wished that they had been able to get superannuation much earlier in their working lives, but it took a federal Labor government—the Hawke and Keating government—to actually bring in this great reform.


The second bill that is associated with this legislation is the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012. That will make some amendments providing that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth government has the capacity to make a subsequent determination for any financial year of the restricted and unrestricted levy percentages and the superannuation entity levy base. It gives the Treasurer the capacity and flexibility to make those determinations when he or she is required to do so. 


These reforms are important reforms. They should be seen as part of a package that we have undertaken, lifting the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent, making sure that older Australians can still get the superannuation guarantee no matter what age they are, making sure that there are extra superannuation contributions for the 3.6 million Australians who are earning up to $37,000 a year, which includes a lot of part-time workers, cleaners and shop assistants in my electorate. That will benefit about 23,600 electors in my electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland. It will make sure that people can get access and see their superannuation accounts, whether those accounts are active or inactive. It will make sure that we have a simple MySuper product available and it will ensure that there is greater effectiveness and efficiency in the whole sector.


These reforms are major reforms in the sector, long overdue to reduce red tape, long overdue to make sure that the sector works efficiently and effectively for those Australians in the future—not just the three million Australians currently 65 years of age and over, but the 8.1 million Australians who will be around in 2050 when many of us may not be around. Future Australians will benefit from these reforms. When people look back in the future at what this government achieved, I think they will look at superannuation and see it is an area where we made major changes in the Labor tradition of progressive reform to assist working men and women to have dignity and financial security in their retirement. I commend the legislation to the House.

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (17:04):  I rise to support the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Bill 2012. It is with some considerable pride that I stand to make this speech because the bills continue the great Labor tradition of making sure that superannuation is well managed. We were the ones who put superannuation in place and we are the ones who are continuing to make sure that Australians who are going through the process of collecting superannuation, those who are managing it and ordinary Australians who are standing just to receive the benefits from it are going to get the very best that this system can offer.


I note the comments from the member for Fraser about the significance of superannuation in the history of our financial literacy in this country and how critical it is that Labor got that going and that we are continuing to attend to it. I also note some of the great comments from my colleague, the member for Blair, about some of the practical inefficiencies that are currently a part of the superannuation structures. These were noted in particular in the Cooper review. The real reason for this legislative program that is before the House today is that the current problems with superannuation are that it is obviously too complex, it is unnecessarily expensive and it is very slow. The member for Bradfield made a very sound point in articulating a comparison with mobile telephones and the changes that have happened there in terms of people being able to transport their telephone numbers. We have come to take it for granted that we can all be advantaged by the options that modern technology provides. In terms of the superannuation structures, we have a system that is very clunky, where we have 33 million accounts around the country with only about 11 million workers. There is unnecessary duplication, and some of the points made by my colleagues here this afternoon might explain why people have three accounts and just let them do their own thing rather than go through the processes, that are currently so difficult, to compile those into one.


We know that the legislation that is before the House today will really make superannuation easier, for the funds to administer, for the members and for employers, and we know that there are significant gains—savings of up to $1 billion—that will be achieved through the implementation of these SuperStream reforms. Obviously the industry has been key in the conversation on the way we have planned for this to be implemented, and I am very pleased to say that, in our recent hearing, the Financial Services Council was very clear in welcoming this piece of legislation. They let us know that over the past decade the industry has actually endeavoured to agree on a set of data standards for managing these transactions between entities, but they articulated that they lack the capacity to compel external stakeholders, and sometimes even their own stakeholders, to comply with industry developed standards. They welcomed this legislation because these compulsory standards help standardise the process for employers and funds in dealing with one another. That can only be a good thing for Australians, who sometimes leave their superannuation on a 'set and forget' strategy.


That view, of how important this legislative change is for superannuation and ordinary Australians, was echoed by Mr Murray from Treasury and Mr Olesen from the Australian Taxation Office, who actually articulated exactly the same sort of story—that, for many, many years and for various reasons, the industry had been unable to come to an agreement, and that this failure to agree has led to a number of different processes being established between the funds, which led to a lot of deadweight costs in the industry. Obviously, we need to make sure that we respond to that reality and improve the situation.


I noticed that Mr Fletcher made some comments acknowledging that this is a unanimous report but raising some questions, as the member for Bradfield, about the Australian Taxation Office. I think it is very important that we actually get on the record that there has been a significant number of reviews and reforms to superannuation over the years. If we go back to the period of 2006-07, under a different government with a different leadership, we will see that there was an amount of $445 million—which was revised upwards to $525 million over five years—for a plan to simplify and streamline superannuation at that time. It is all well and good for members of the opposition to raise questions about why the ATO have come up with these numbers, but the reality is: there are comparative figures that indicate that this is a reasonable claim and, further, it is very important that there is consultation, with the industry sector and also the people who are going to be part of the supervisory panel, to ensure that these things are considered and to make sure that we get good value from the dollars as this money is being implemented to bring about change.


Indeed, to make sure that there is fair and open scrutiny, we have made a recommendation that the ATO be required to provide a regular, detailed breakdown of its costs and expenditure on the additional levies to the SuperStream Advisory Council, based on reporting guidelines developed in consultation between the council and the ATO. So I suppose it is like any major project that any person might commence on: you always hope that it might cost less than the numbers indicate. But, in the end, to make change and to undertake reform does cost money, and we do have a very high level of acceptance and, indeed, encouragement from the sector to move to make these changes, to make it so much easier for people who are employers—small, medium and large—to comply.


I want to also put this on the record in response to some of the comments made by the member for Bradfield as to concerns about strict liability regarding the ATO. We had evidence from the Australian Taxation Office on the day to indicate that, while there are strict liability provisions, this is supported by those in the industry, who understand that they need these tools to ensure compliance. But the ATO made a very clear point: they have the capacity, the administrative flexibility, to waive or limit penalties where employers are attempting to comply with data standards but perhaps commit inadvertent technical breaches. Of course we were very pleased to hear that, and we wanted to make sure that the ATO were encouraged to do so. So we have done that in our report, urging the ATO to use its discretion to waive or limit penalties in appropriate circumstances.


But, lest the fear campaign—even with regard to this—get some legs, I want to put on record that it will not be until 2015 that small employers will be required to actually comply with this piece of legislation in total, and that, during that period of time, there will be significant consultation with the providers of software such as MYOB or QuickBooks, which are used by many small businesses, to help the small businesses do all of their transactions regarding superannuation at the same time as they are lining up to make payments to their employees.


We have many employers who might be running a small hairdressing salon or a boutique in a local strip mall, who have a number of employees. Currently they have to fill in different forms for different employees and send any number of cheques off to different agencies—it is extremely inefficient and it is quite a paperchase to try and keep track of that. Large companies that use payroll providers will obviously be working very carefully with them to make sure that that is implemented, and it will be in the first period of time that that will occur. But, by the time this comes down to the local businesses—such as Snips Hairdressers at Copacabana or any of the other great local businesses in my seat of Robertson—the providers of the software will be well and truly across this material and be able to provide employers right across Australia, no matter how small the number of employees they might have, with adequate software to enable them to bring these provisions into their workplace and comply with the requirements of the Australian Taxation Office.


We are committed as a government not only to ensuring the superannuation system is reformed but to making sure that it boosts Australians' retirement savings. We are progressively increasing the super guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent, starting from 1 July next year, and we know that that stands to benefit 8.4 million workers. If you are a 30-year-old on earning an average full-time wage right now, the changes that we as a Labor government are proposing will bring an extra $118,000 to you at retirement. We are also introducing from 1 July a much-needed superannuation contribution for 3.6 million Australians who are on very low incomes. This is effectively going to refund $500 of contributions tax into the super accounts of people with incomes of up to $37,000.


As part of a range of responses to the real-life superannuation issues of Australians, we have abolished the maximum age limit on superannuation reforms of the super guarantee from 1 July next year, so that 51,000 hard-working Australians who want to keep working past the age of 70 will now be entitled to what we consider should always be their due—that is, superannuation contributions.


These two bills that are before the House today are, in fact, a natural extension of Labor's concern for doing the best we can for ordinary Australians. We are working with business and with peak bodies to make sure that we provide a degree of reform that is very enabling, that will increase productivity, that will reduce costs and that will improve outcomes for ordinary Australians. I commend the bills to the House and urge their prompt passage.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (17:16):  I would like to thank the member for Robertson for her contribution, and to thank all those who have spoken on this legislation. I rise to sum up this cognate debate on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012.


Our superannuation industry is one to be proud of, a distinct national advantage and one that is forecast to grow very significantly over the next 20 years. Our superannuation system currently manages $1.4 trillion for Australians. This amount will reach $6 trillion by 2030. Despite this, there are many inefficiencies still to be fixed in our system. There are currently approximately 12 million members with superannuation, yet there are over 31 million accounts, and there are over five million lost member accounts with a total value of over $20 billion—that is, an average of one lost superannuation account for every two working Australians.


The superannuation industry can do better in processing transactions, and there are still too many paper based systems. These inefficiencies lead to higher administration costs. Currently, different superannuation funds require different information from employers. This unnecessarily increases the compliance burden on Australia's employers. Ultimately, these inefficiencies lead to higher administration costs which consequently reduce the retirement incomes of all working Australians. The industry has attempted to develop its own voluntary standards over many years but has been unable, thus far, to achieve consensus. This is why the government has decided to take a leadership role by introducing this legislation, which will improve the efficiency of the superannuation industry under the SuperStream reforms. These reforms flow from the recommendations of the Cooper review inquiry into the superannuation industry.


Schedule 1 of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 introduces the framework for the development of common standards and processes for superannuation transactions. Supporting regulations and legislative instruments will prescribe the detailed requirements underlying this framework. By setting down standardised rules for how funds transact with each other, and by setting standardised requirements for the information that funds can request from employers, significant efficiencies will result, ultimately lowering administration costs, simplifying processes for employers and for funds, and resulting in a more timely allocation of contributions to member accounts.


The government has adopted a staged approach to implementation to minimise the impact on the superannuation industry and on employers. Rollovers between superannuation funds will be required to comply with the new standards from 1 July 2013. New standards dealing with contributions from employers with more than 20 employees will apply from 1 July 2014. These standards will then apply to smaller employers from 1 July 2015, subject to further consultation on their impact.


Schedule 2 of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012, together with the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012, enables costs to government associated with the implementation of the SuperStream measures to be recovered by a levy on APRA regulated funds. The superannuation industry's own estimates show that the SuperStream reforms of this government will deliver savings of up to $1 billion per annum. The benefit of these savings will flow through to members in the form of lower fees and charges. When averaged out across the number of accounts in the superannuation industry, the savings are in the order of $30 per account each and every year which significantly exceeds the transition costs involved in implementing these reforms.


The government will be bringing forward further legislation to complete the package of SuperStream reforms. This will include announced reforms to further benefit members, such as a new facility to enable members to easily look up and keep track of their superannuation. Fund members will also benefit from having low, inactive accounts consolidated automatically.


There are costs associated with implementing all these reforms. The most efficient way to meet these costs is by collecting them directly from the superannuation industry. The levy is a temporary one. It will only collect the costs that the government incurs in supporting the implementation of all these reforms. The costs will be recouped over six years, but must be considered in the context of the annual long-term savings of $1 billion estimated by industry.


These are real, important, significant and wide-ranging reforms. They will be implemented in a staged approach across a number of years. For these reasons, the government is establishing a SuperStream Advisory Council which will have the role of providing advice to government on issues relevant to the successful implementation and maintenance of the reforms.


I must acknowledge that the coalition has also acknowledged that the SuperStream measures have the potential to deliver real savings that will benefit superannuants, and that it supports changes that make the superannuation system more efficient, transparent and competitive. Valid feedback has been raised in relation to the provision of additional ongoing information in relation to SuperStream. While the government has already released some of the information on the breakdown of costs, further information will be released shortly. The government also acknowledges the contribution of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, and will consider how best to implement its recommendations about enhanced reporting by the ATO.


Finally, in relation to the matter raised by the member for Bradfield with respect to the strict liability provisions, I can advise the legislation provides a flexible compliance framework so that compliance action can be taken where necessary. However, the Australian Tax Office will take an educative approach in the first instance, as advised at the committee hearings. Secondly, I note numerous strict liability provisions that already exist in superannuation legislation were introduced by the Howard government in 2000. I commend the legislation to the House.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (16:17):  Let me say at the outset that the coalition supports these bills—the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012—which were introduced on Thursday, 24 May 2012 by the member for Maribyrnong, the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I will run briefly through the schedules in the first bill, then the single schedule in the second bill and cover a couple of areas of detail that have been raised since the minister introduced this legislation in the last sitting fortnight.


As I said at the outset on behalf of the coalition, we support these bills and the principles that underpin them. With respect to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012, the first schedule of the bill introduces—as the minister outlined in his second reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum—a framework to support the implementation of superannuation data and payment regulations and standards that will apply to specified superannuation transactions undertaken by superannuation entities, retirement savings account providers and employers. The second schedule amends the APRA Act, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998—specifically section 50—to enable costs associated with the implementation of the measures to be included in the minister's determination specifying the amount of the levy that is payable to the Commonwealth. The amendments also enable the minister to make a determination that specifies the proportion of levy money paid to APRA that is to be credited to the APRA Special Account. The Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill amends the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Act 1998 in a range of material respects to enable the Treasurer to make more than one determination on the imposition of levies for a financial year.


The coalition is supporting this legislation and supports the principle of measures that improve the efficiency, transparency and competitiveness of the administration of the superannuation system by making the system easier to use for employers, ensuring fewer lost accounts, providing a more timely flow of money to super fund members' accounts and delivering savings to employers and fund members. As part of the government's proposal, these bills provide for the implementation of data and payment regulations and standards, as I have outlined, that will allow participants in the super system to communicate by using standardised business terms in a consistent and reliable format. Electronic transmission using agreed transport and security protocols will allow for a more automated and timely processing of transactions with fewer errors. If properly implemented, these changes will deliver significant efficiency savings to the super industry and to employers. Indeed, the savings have been estimated by the Financial Services Council to be quite significant—of the order of $20 billion over 10 years. Much of the detail on these new standards will, of course, be in regulations, which industry participants consider to be appropriate.


Like most pieces of technical legislation, this has been before a parliamentary committee since its introduction on 24 May—that committee being the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, of which I am a member. That committee reported today—around lunchtime, to be accurate—recommending that the legislation be passed but also recommending:


That the ATO be required to provide a regular detailed breakdown of its costs and expenditure of the additional levies to the SuperStream Advisory Council, based on reporting guidelines developed in consultation between the council and the ATO.


That is a firm recommendation of the committee—and by all members on the committee. The cost of implementation, as outlined in the legislation and in the minister's speech, will be $467 million from 2012-13 to 2017-18, including $121 million in 2012-13. So we think that that recommendation in the report tabled earlier today is a relevant one. We on this side of the House note that it is supported by all members on the committee. As I said, we support this legislation and think if properly implemented it will certainly provide benefits and efficiencies right through the system.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (16:24):  The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012 introduce a framework to support the implementation of superannuation data and payment regulations and standards that will apply to specified superannuation transactions undertaken by superannuation entities, retirement savings account providers and employers. As the previously speaker noted, this is technical legislation, but it is legislation that will make a difference to Australians and their families.


SuperStream costs of $467 million will be collected through the superannuation supervisory levy from 2012-13 to 2017-18. That will enable the government to collect the implementation costs associated with the SuperStream measure. The opposition have acknowledged the efficiencies from the SuperStream proposal and have acknowledged that they have the potential to deliver real savings over time and will benefit superannuants.


The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia calculates that $1.3 trillion of assets are in superannuation funds. Treasury forecasts estimate that this will grow to between $3 trillion and $5 trillion by 2025. When Bob Hawke took office in 1983, just 40 per cent of the workforce had superannuation cover. Thanks to Labor, that rose from 72 per cent in 1991 to 94 per cent in 2007. Australians have more money invested in managed funds per capita than any other economy in the world.


The Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation today released new research showing broad support for the superannuation system but that, understandably, many people continue to find it a difficult topic to understand. Senator Sherry, who recently stepped down after many years of public service, was one of those in the Labor caucus with a true passion for superannuation—but I cannot promise that the rest of us ever had quite his level of engagement with that topic. But it is important that Australian policy makers recognise the benefits to improving the simplicity and the efficiency of the superannuation system.


There is $20 billion in lost super in Australia, and reuniting Australians with their lost superannuation is absolutely critical. I joined with Chris Bourke MLA, last year in running some mobile offices around the ACT. We found that there were particular postcodes in which there was a very high level of lost superannuation. We worked with a simple mobile office and a laptop computer helping people get back in touch with their lost superannuation accounts using the ATO's SuperSeeker tool. We were pleased on a number of occasions to assist people in finding their unclaimed superannuation.


The research announced today by the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation showed that people's level of interest in their superannuation varied depending on how old they are, how financially literate they are and the amount of superannuation they had saved. It found that across all age groups, the majority of Australians were not confident that they have enough superannuation to retire and live comfortably on and that, overall, employers believe that superannuation is beneficial to their employees and the general population to reduce the reliance on the pension—giving lie to the claim by some of those opposite in the early 1990s that employers would not support universal superannuation.


The superannuation industry is currently dominated by paper based transactions. They are inefficient in both processing costs and the time taken for transactions to occur and superannuation to be deposited in to members' accounts. The superannuation data and payment standards will allow participants in the superannuation system to communicate using standard business terms in a consistent and reliable format. Using electronic transmission, with agreed security protocols, will mean that we will get quicker processing of transactions and fewer errors. Just as e-health is bringing about efficiencies in the healthcare system, so, too, greater efficiency in the superannuation payments system is a benefit to all Australians. It is an easier system for employers to use. There will be fewer lost accounts and Australians will get the money in their accounts more quickly—which, of course, means that they will begin earning returns more quickly.


The superannuation data and payment standards will be mandated for superannuation entities, including approved deposit funds, RSA providers and employers. The regulators—being the commissioner and APRA—will support the rollout of the new data and payment standards through education activities and a new compliance framework. Industry submissions to the super system review estimated that savings of up to a billion dollars per annum are achievable from implementing the SuperStream reforms.


Members will be able to look up and keep track of their superannuation, have low-value inactive accounts consolidated automatically, be able to consolidate larger accounts easily, have their contributions and rollovers processed more quickly and be able to more easily check if their superannuation contributions have been made. Employers will benefit from having standardised, simplified administrative processes when dealing with superannuation funds. Superannuation funds will benefit from standardised and simplified administrative processes when dealing with employers and other funds, and be able to make greater use of tax file numbers to facilitate matching and consolidation of accounts and of electronic validation services from the ATO that will help their administration and help ensure members are properly matched with their superannuation. Efficiencies for superannuation funds mean higher returns for fund members.


When Prime Minister Paul Keating moved to introduce the superannuation guarantee levy, Wilson Tuckey drew on his long history in the racing industry to compare the legislation to the 'worst type of jockey … both stupid and dishonest'. Mr Tuckey continued:


When the poor old employer levy gets to 12 per cent, what will it deliver? Luckily, it might deliver an overseas holiday and a few presents for the kids, but it will not deliver a retirement income at the inflated costs of those days.


As Minister Shorten has demonstrated, a 12 per cent superannuation guarantee will provide to a worker now aged 30 on average full-time wages a real benefit of over $553,000 at age pension age. That should leave a bit of change after an overseas holiday and a few presents for the kids.


The Leader of the Opposition once called Labor's superannuation guarantee a con job. Those opposite have either been uninterested in superannuation or outright critical. When Senator Bishop—as she then was—spoke in the other place on the introduction of universal super on 18 August 1992 she said:


On this side opposition members argued very logically and meaningfully that the imposition of this compulsory superannuation tax is a de facto federal payroll tax.


Yes, they were running their 'great big new tax' argument even against compulsory superannuation. Then Senator Bishop told the Senate about a conversation with a small business person who had said:


But now that this compulsory superannuation payment has gone through, yesterday I had to sack a part time employee and turn a full time employee into a part time employee.


The late Senator Peter Cook, a man for whom I was privileged to work, was moved by that statement to interject that given that the law for universal superannuation had not yet come into effect, it was hard to see how small-business people would be affected by it. You can see shades of that in the scare campaign those opposite are running against the carbon price, which has not yet come into effect. But Senator Bishop—as she was then was—was unmoved and finished up the debate as follows:


I heard Senator McMullan say, ‘The difference between our systems on superannuation is that ours is compulsory and theirs is voluntary’. That is very true. That is an essential difference. Our policy is designed to make it attractive for people to provide for themselves in later life whereas this Government’s is designed to penalise business, to regulate it out of existence.


Of course, if you carry on with that logic then the member for Mackellar should today be saying to this chamber that superannuation is penalising business and ought to be scrapped. But the fact is that no-one is making those arguments. I quoted some of the statements made in the 1990s because they illustrate an important point, not just about superannuation but also about economic history more generally. The economic reforms that have made Australia great, like universal superannuation, were hard fought at the time. Many of them were opposed by those opposite and many of those opposite at the time said they would scrap them if they were to win government. But when they did in fact take the Treasury benches, they did nothing of the kind. Universal superannuation is now part of the Australian social fabric. It was attacked at the time, demonised as being a big new tax and is now recognised as being an important pillar of a dignified retirement in Australia.


Australian workers, 8.4 million of them, will benefit from an increase in the superannuation guarantee rate from nine per cent to 12 per cent. This government is also abolishing the age limit for the superannuation guarantee so, no matter what your age, if you work you will get super. It will provide an extra contribution for the 3.6 million Australians who are earning up to $37,000. That includes plenty of part-time workers as well as low-income earners. It is a recognition of the point made in the Henry tax review that the superannuation concessions were, under the Howard government, significantly more generous for high-income earners than for low-income earners.


We are putting in place simplification reforms, which will allow people to see their superannuation account and will give employees certainty by requiring superannuation information to be on every pay slip so people can check to make sure they have got what they are entitled to. We are also introducing a MySuper product, recognising that most employees will take the default fund and within that fund will take the default investment plan. So it is important that the defaults are good and that defaults get good market returns. We are also putting in place more efficiencies to ensure lower fees for fund members. All of these reforms will ensure Australians get the superannuation they are entitled to and ensure the system is as simple, efficient and equitable as it needs to be.


I commend the bill to the House.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2012-06-18,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (16:36):  It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Fraser, who gave us a discursive exploration of superannuation policy after briefly deigning to come to the specifics of the bill before us. Naturally, I am going to be more limited and—some might say—small minded by concentrating purely on the provisions that are before the House this afternoon.


What I would like to say is that, in the broad, the coalition is supportive of the legislative direction contained in the legislation the House is considering this afternoon. It is an uncontentious proposition that the superannuation sector is dominated by paper based transactions, and that there are real inefficiencies, real deadweight costs and transactions costs. There is clearly capacity to secure efficiencies through the use of information technology standardised formats for the exchange of data and so on. 


Coming, as I do, into this place from a background in the telecommunications sector, I became quite surprised as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services on which I served learnt about the challenges currently facing the superannuation sector and the extent to which information is exchanged in paper based form. By contrast, and as one example of the kinds of efficiencies which can be secured on an industry wide basis through the use of information technology, in the telecommunications sector the mobile number portability standard requires that if a customer wishes to port his or her number from one mobile operator to another, it needs to take effect within the course of one day—and often it takes very much less time than that. Therefore I have in my own experience seen the efficiency benefits which can be delivered when standardised information technology systems are used and data transfer standards are applied to a range of participants in an industry.


Let me readily concede that the superannuation sector challenge is an even more daunting one than the one which applies in the telecommunications sector because of the fact that, in addition to all of the superannuation funds—and there are of course hundreds of them—you also have millions of employers, ranging from the very, very large to the many very small businesses. That does present some specific challenges and it also presents some areas of concern with particular aspects of this bill—areas which I am pleased to say were acknowledged by the committee in its unanimous report.


In the brief time I have to speak about this bill today, I want to make essentially three points. Firstly, I want to say that the provisions underpinning greater efficiency in superannuation contained in this bill and the legislative scheme, in the broad, make sense. Secondly, I want to highlight the fact that there are real reasons for doubt and for questioning why the amount of money which has been sought by the Australian Taxation Office to implement this set of information technology changes, and which is funded ultimately by a levy on the industry, is so high. Where is the justification for the costings? Thirdly, I want to question why it is that the legislation takes a particular approach which in particular bristles with penalties and strict liability provisions. 


Let me turn firstly to the broad rationale for this bill—a rationale which, as I have indicated, the coalition supports. As the explanatory memorandum states:


The purpose … is to improve the  administration and management of super accounts making the processing of everyday transactions easier, cheaper and faster for members and employers.


I think any Australian who has ever sought to transfer a superannuation balance from one fund to another would very much empathise with the proposition that, as it presently operates, the superannuation sector is grossly inefficient. That acts to the detriment of members of superannuation funds and all stakeholders, because the costs of the inefficient processing are borne across the sector when it comes to matters such as error, rework, misdirected or lost transactions—all of these things cause cost, inconvenience and inefficiency.


Accordingly, the coalition strongly supports as a principle measures to improve the efficiency, transparency and competitiveness of the administration of superannuation system. We want to see a superannuation system which is easier to use for employers; which ensures fewer lost accounts; which provides a more timely flow of money to the member accounts of superannuation fund members; and which delivers efficiencies and cost savings to employers, to funds and, ultimately therefore, to members. 


The scheme of this legislation is to provide for the implementation of data and payment regulations and standards to allow participants in the superannuation system to communicate by using standardised business turns in a consistent and reliable format. The government estimates that the SuperStream measures will save $1 billion a year in processing costs. The Financial Services Council estimates that the reforms are likely to deliver savings of up to $20 billion in aggregate by 2020 based on the current rate of growth of the asset base in the superannuation system. 


Anybody who has had any experience with large information technology systems and businesses involving the processing of hundreds of millions or even more transactions would know that very small cost savings per transaction can readily add up to a very large amount of money saved in aggregate across the system. I think that is what we can expect this set of changes to achieve if the scheme has the desired effect. 


Stakeholders in the sector are certainly supportive of the objectives. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia commented that it:


… considers the SuperStream measures to be the key component of the Government’s Stronger Super reforms as they have the greatest potential to improve members’ retirement outcomes through the creation of a more efficient superannuation system.


The Financial Services Council in its submission to the committee noted that there has been for a long time agreement in principle across the industry of the desirability of establishing superannuation data standards; however, it has not proven possible, to date, in a cooperative fashion to establish those standards and have all the stakeholders sign up to them. Accordingly, there is broad acceptance of the need for legislative action.


That brings me to the second point I want to make which is that, although there is broad acceptance of the need for legislative action, there are eyebrows raised across the superannuation sector as to the surprisingly large amount of money which the Australian Taxation Office has identified it needs to implement these new arrangements. Under this bill a levy is to be imposed on the superannuation sector which amounts to $467 million. That is a very large sum of money by any standard yet at the same time the degree of transparency and justification that has been provided for this very large sum is disappointing. It is a notorious truth that information technology systems development can be an extraordinary black hole. It is very tempting for those involved in the process to inflate their costs and identify a whole range of requirements which add to the total cost of the exercise. It is often difficult for those receiving the bill to assess the validity of the amounts that are claimed but, as a very first step, you need to be provided with details, specifics and justifications for the amount of money proposed to be spent on the new information technology system changes. That is a principle which is true in the private sector and it is equally true in this particular context which is essentially a hybrid of private and public sector activity.


It is not surprising that one of the strong themes which emerged from the committee's inquiry into this legislation is that there has been an inadequate level of justification by the Australian Taxation Office and the government for the amount of money stated to be required, which is to be extracted from the industry by means of a levy to fund these changes. That is an observation which has been made by quite a number of stakeholders. Let me quote, for example, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia:


… it remains unclear what the levies will actually pay for … The Explanatory Memorandum only has information on the proposed year by year funding with no further detail on what the money will be actually spent on. Given the substantial amount sought to be recovered ($467 million in total) much greater accountability should be demanded from the Australian Taxation Office.


Submitters also made the point that it would be wholly inappropriate for the Australian Taxation Office to obtain benefits funded from this specific levy on the superannuation sector which extended to its broader operations. I note that the concerns which were expressed by a number of industry stakeholders were acknowledged by the committee in its unanimous report and the committee has recommended that the Australian Taxation Office be required to provide a regular, detailed breakdown to the SuperStream Advisory Council of its costs and the expenditure of the additional levies.


Finally, I want to note that the compliance burden which will fall upon employers as a result of these changes will be a material one and it is therefore concerning that the legislative scheme adopted here is one which bristles with penalties and strict liability provisions. Employers are required to provide very detailed data associated with superannuation payments and failure to provide that data exposes them to penalties. It is not just superannuation funds which are exposed to penalties under this legislation; it is every employer including, of course, small employers. A number of stakeholders who made submissions to the committee pointed out the nature of the challenge that employers including, in particular, small employers will face in complying with this legislation. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry suggested that the government ought to consider including a 'safe harbour' provision in the legislation to allow employers, who with the best will in the world find themselves unable to strictly comply, protection against being hit with arbitrary penalties. The Financial Services Council submitted that the proposed compliance measures are overly severe.


I particularly want to note concerns that the bill is bristling with strict liability provisions. A strict liability provision is one where the mental state of the person who commits an offence is deemed to be irrelevant. Accordingly, even if you set out with the best will in the world and make every reasonable effort to comply but fail to do so, you are exposed to penalties under this legislation. The Australian Taxation Office acknowledged that it would have the legal right under this legislation to impose penalties on a small employer such as a butcher with two or three employees. If that butcher were to pay the amount of superannuation contribution required for each employee when it is required to be paid, but failed to include all of the items of data included under the standard, then that butcher is open to a criminal prosecution and there is no defence open to him or her. That is the reality of what a strict liability provision means.


The committee noted its concerns that the tax office ought to be what you might paraphrase as 'gentle' in the application of these powers. I would argue that trusting the tax office to be gentle is an inherently risky proposition and this is an area of significant concern. The coalition supports these provisions in principle but we have some implementation concerns as I have outlined.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:51):  I speak in support of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012. With about three million Australians currently over the age of 65 years, and 8.1 million Australians over the age of 65 years by 2050, reform in superannuation is not an optional extra but a necessity and a must. I think this federal Labor government has much to be proud of in its reforms of superannuation.


The super system review chaired by Jeremy Cooper recommended many of the reforms that were undertaken here today. Industry submissions to the review estimated that the industry could save up to $1 billion, achievable through the reforms that we are undertaking. Ernst and Young said similar things in its submission. We have confirmed our commitment in the budget to the SuperStream reforms, which will make a difference, and previous speakers have talked in part about those.


This is a package of reforms to make the superannuation scheme more flexible, more effective, more efficient and easier for members, funds and employers across the country. Currently it is pretty difficult to understand, and a young person who has had three or four different jobs in different locations, vocations or roles might have picked up a bit of superannuation working for one employer after another, sometimes with different funds, and it is easy for their super to be lost. We have an industry worth $1.36 trillion, but according to the Australian Taxation Office we have about $20 billion in lost superannuation. That is money which could be used for the retirement of Australians and to put less reliance on the pension system. So it makes sense to reform the system, to make it more effective and efficient, to reduce reliance on old technology like paperwork and to increase reliance on IT and computerisation.


The reforms will help members keep track of superannuation. An online portal is crucial in that regard so that people can have a look at superannuation, have a look at their accounts and track them, and employers can do the same. It assists people to consolidate those accounts electronically. I do not always agree with the member for Bradfield, but anyone who has ever rolled superannuation from one account to another—I have done this personally and I am sure members of this place and other Australians have also—knows the absolute idiocy of the procedures involved at times. It is extraordinary. I know of a circumstance where one constituent of mine was telling me that he had to arrange for a cheque to be flown to Sydney because they could not change the superannuation from the fund based in Brisbane to the one in Sydney. They had to fly a cheque down to Sydney to deposit it face to face into the fund. This is crazy stuff in the 21st century.


We have a lot of low, inactive accounts, many under $1,000, and these will be automatically consolidated into another of the member's account unless they opt out, saving members' fees and making super easier to control, manage and keep track of. There will be a lot of changes in this process, and I notice the SuperStream Advisory Council has been called for with nominations as well on 4 June 2012.


This government has a proud record, as Labor governments have, of making reform in this country. I am pleased to be advocating locally for the NDIS to come to my electorate, particularly Ipswich. There are great Labor reforms, like the minimum wage, the age pension, Medicare and superannuation. Lest anyone thinks that these came about because those opposite sat over here in government, they should be prepared to have a look, as did the member for Fraser, at speeches made by those opposite on superannuation. They should note the fact that those opposite opposed our reforms to increase the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent as part of what we have said on the minerals resource rent tax. If those opposite had been on this side of the House they would have deprived 43,000 people in my electorate of an increase in superannuation from nine to 12 per cent.


We have made a lot of changes. Specifically, this legislation amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and the Retirement Savings Account Act 1997. We are talking about a framework introduced to ensure the implementation of superannuation data and payment regulations and standards so that there are no inconsistencies and siloed arrangements between the different funds and so that it is standard across the whole industry. This legislation ensures superannuation transactions can be undertaken by various super funds and entities as well as retirement savings account providers, employers and employees, and will give consistency across the whole sector. The legislation also provides for amendments to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998, ensuring that costs associated with the implementation of the SuperStream measures are included in the determination of a levy, which the member for Bradfield accurately mentioned is paid by the sector to the Commonwealth.


The levy itself will be a levy on the industry. It is important that the legislation before the chamber be passed by 1 July this year, giving the industry time to implement the changes and the superannuation supervisory levy to make sure we collect the implementation costs from the SuperStream reforms. The levy will be on the industry in this particular matter, and it is not unusual for that to take place in a sector. As part of our stronger super package we have announced that this is the case. The industry and the stakeholders know it is coming. All the super funds want to make sure that the industry is viable, effective and efficient, and that the government costs associated will be, by virtue of the APRA regulated funds, $467 million from 2012-13 onwards. The minister can make a determination specifying the proportion of the levy money that is to be credited through the APRA special account.


These are important reforms. Members will be able to look up what their superannuation is. I know that during the global financial crisis many constituents in my electorate have talked to me about the fact that their superannuation funds have suffered. I know of a number of people who have put off retirement because of their superannuation being much lower than it once was. They are particularly interested now in keeping track of their super if they are in their late 50s or early 60s. Employers will benefit through simplified standard provisions, and funds will benefit by making sure they are able to have greater use of tax file numbers to facilitate matching consolidation funds, because the Australian Taxation Office administers super funds and has that overall responsibility.


Superannuation is a particularly important reform for my electorate. The bills here, and the part of the package that we are undertaking, are particularly important. I lobbied hard to make sure that we lifted the superannuation guarantee age limit from 70 to 75. We have done that, meaning another 18,000 Australians aged 75 years and over will get the benefit of superannuation if they continue to work. I talked about that issue just last week at the Ipswich Association of Independent Retirees and superannuants. I received a very favourable response about that because, as many of them said to me briefly, they were undertaking or have undertaken a transition in relation to their work-life situation. The days when people always just decided to retire and go from work to retirement are over. Often people transition all the way through. Making sure that they can pick up superannuation in those latter years is an important reform.


That is something that came up recently in relation to superannuation reform for my electorate. I know how important it is. When I talked to those people about the need for young people in our community to get more superannuation, lifting the guarantee from nine to 12 per cent, they supported it, having experienced that in their personal lives. Many of them told me that at times they wished that they had been able to get superannuation much earlier in their working lives, but it took a federal Labor government—the Hawke and Keating government—to actually bring in this great reform.


The second bill that is associated with this legislation is the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012. That will make some amendments providing that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth government has the capacity to make a subsequent determination for any financial year of the restricted and unrestricted levy percentages and the superannuation entity levy base. It gives the Treasurer the capacity and flexibility to make those determinations when he or she is required to do so. 


These reforms are important reforms. They should be seen as part of a package that we have undertaken, lifting the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent, making sure that older Australians can still get the superannuation guarantee no matter what age they are, making sure that there are extra superannuation contributions for the 3.6 million Australians who are earning up to $37,000 a year, which includes a lot of part-time workers, cleaners and shop assistants in my electorate. That will benefit about 23,600 electors in my electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland. It will make sure that people can get access and see their superannuation accounts, whether those accounts are active or inactive. It will make sure that we have a simple MySuper product available and it will ensure that there is greater effectiveness and efficiency in the whole sector.


These reforms are major reforms in the sector, long overdue to reduce red tape, long overdue to make sure that the sector works efficiently and effectively for those Australians in the future—not just the three million Australians currently 65 years of age and over, but the 8.1 million Australians who will be around in 2050 when many of us may not be around. Future Australians will benefit from these reforms. When people look back in the future at what this government achieved, I think they will look at superannuation and see it is an area where we made major changes in the Labor tradition of progressive reform to assist working men and women to have dignity and financial security in their retirement. I commend the legislation to the House.

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (17:04):  I rise to support the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Bill 2012. It is with some considerable pride that I stand to make this speech because the bills continue the great Labor tradition of making sure that superannuation is well managed. We were the ones who put superannuation in place and we are the ones who are continuing to make sure that Australians who are going through the process of collecting superannuation, those who are managing it and ordinary Australians who are standing just to receive the benefits from it are going to get the very best that this system can offer.


I note the comments from the member for Fraser about the significance of superannuation in the history of our financial literacy in this country and how critical it is that Labor got that going and that we are continuing to attend to it. I also note some of the great comments from my colleague, the member for Blair, about some of the practical inefficiencies that are currently a part of the superannuation structures. These were noted in particular in the Cooper review. The real reason for this legislative program that is before the House today is that the current problems with superannuation are that it is obviously too complex, it is unnecessarily expensive and it is very slow. The member for Bradfield made a very sound point in articulating a comparison with mobile telephones and the changes that have happened there in terms of people being able to transport their telephone numbers. We have come to take it for granted that we can all be advantaged by the options that modern technology provides. In terms of the superannuation structures, we have a system that is very clunky, where we have 33 million accounts around the country with only about 11 million workers. There is unnecessary duplication, and some of the points made by my colleagues here this afternoon might explain why people have three accounts and just let them do their own thing rather than go through the processes, that are currently so difficult, to compile those into one.


We know that the legislation that is before the House today will really make superannuation easier, for the funds to administer, for the members and for employers, and we know that there are significant gains—savings of up to $1 billion—that will be achieved through the implementation of these SuperStream reforms. Obviously the industry has been key in the conversation on the way we have planned for this to be implemented, and I am very pleased to say that, in our recent hearing, the Financial Services Council was very clear in welcoming this piece of legislation. They let us know that over the past decade the industry has actually endeavoured to agree on a set of data standards for managing these transactions between entities, but they articulated that they lack the capacity to compel external stakeholders, and sometimes even their own stakeholders, to comply with industry developed standards. They welcomed this legislation because these compulsory standards help standardise the process for employers and funds in dealing with one another. That can only be a good thing for Australians, who sometimes leave their superannuation on a 'set and forget' strategy.


That view, of how important this legislative change is for superannuation and ordinary Australians, was echoed by Mr Murray from Treasury and Mr Olesen from the Australian Taxation Office, who actually articulated exactly the same sort of story—that, for many, many years and for various reasons, the industry had been unable to come to an agreement, and that this failure to agree has led to a number of different processes being established between the funds, which led to a lot of deadweight costs in the industry. Obviously, we need to make sure that we respond to that reality and improve the situation.


I noticed that Mr Fletcher made some comments acknowledging that this is a unanimous report but raising some questions, as the member for Bradfield, about the Australian Taxation Office. I think it is very important that we actually get on the record that there has been a significant number of reviews and reforms to superannuation over the years. If we go back to the period of 2006-07, under a different government with a different leadership, we will see that there was an amount of $445 million—which was revised upwards to $525 million over five years—for a plan to simplify and streamline superannuation at that time. It is all well and good for members of the opposition to raise questions about why the ATO have come up with these numbers, but the reality is: there are comparative figures that indicate that this is a reasonable claim and, further, it is very important that there is consultation, with the industry sector and also the people who are going to be part of the supervisory panel, to ensure that these things are considered and to make sure that we get good value from the dollars as this money is being implemented to bring about change.


Indeed, to make sure that there is fair and open scrutiny, we have made a recommendation that the ATO be required to provide a regular, detailed breakdown of its costs and expenditure on the additional levies to the SuperStream Advisory Council, based on reporting guidelines developed in consultation between the council and the ATO. So I suppose it is like any major project that any person might commence on: you always hope that it might cost less than the numbers indicate. But, in the end, to make change and to undertake reform does cost money, and we do have a very high level of acceptance and, indeed, encouragement from the sector to move to make these changes, to make it so much easier for people who are employers—small, medium and large—to comply.


I want to also put this on the record in response to some of the comments made by the member for Bradfield as to concerns about strict liability regarding the ATO. We had evidence from the Australian Taxation Office on the day to indicate that, while there are strict liability provisions, this is supported by those in the industry, who understand that they need these tools to ensure compliance. But the ATO made a very clear point: they have the capacity, the administrative flexibility, to waive or limit penalties where employers are attempting to comply with data standards but perhaps commit inadvertent technical breaches. Of course we were very pleased to hear that, and we wanted to make sure that the ATO were encouraged to do so. So we have done that in our report, urging the ATO to use its discretion to waive or limit penalties in appropriate circumstances.


But, lest the fear campaign—even with regard to this—get some legs, I want to put on record that it will not be until 2015 that small employers will be required to actually comply with this piece of legislation in total, and that, during that period of time, there will be significant consultation with the providers of software such as MYOB or QuickBooks, which are used by many small businesses, to help the small businesses do all of their transactions regarding superannuation at the same time as they are lining up to make payments to their employees.


We have many employers who might be running a small hairdressing salon or a boutique in a local strip mall, who have a number of employees. Currently they have to fill in different forms for different employees and send any number of cheques off to different agencies—it is extremely inefficient and it is quite a paperchase to try and keep track of that. Large companies that use payroll providers will obviously be working very carefully with them to make sure that that is implemented, and it will be in the first period of time that that will occur. But, by the time this comes down to the local businesses—such as Snips Hairdressers at Copacabana or any of the other great local businesses in my seat of Robertson—the providers of the software will be well and truly across this material and be able to provide employers right across Australia, no matter how small the number of employees they might have, with adequate software to enable them to bring these provisions into their workplace and comply with the requirements of the Australian Taxation Office.


We are committed as a government not only to ensuring the superannuation system is reformed but to making sure that it boosts Australians' retirement savings. We are progressively increasing the super guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent, starting from 1 July next year, and we know that that stands to benefit 8.4 million workers. If you are a 30-year-old on earning an average full-time wage right now, the changes that we as a Labor government are proposing will bring an extra $118,000 to you at retirement. We are also introducing from 1 July a much-needed superannuation contribution for 3.6 million Australians who are on very low incomes. This is effectively going to refund $500 of contributions tax into the super accounts of people with incomes of up to $37,000.


As part of a range of responses to the real-life superannuation issues of Australians, we have abolished the maximum age limit on superannuation reforms of the super guarantee from 1 July next year, so that 51,000 hard-working Australians who want to keep working past the age of 70 will now be entitled to what we consider should always be their due—that is, superannuation contributions.


These two bills that are before the House today are, in fact, a natural extension of Labor's concern for doing the best we can for ordinary Australians. We are working with business and with peak bodies to make sure that we provide a degree of reform that is very enabling, that will increase productivity, that will reduce costs and that will improve outcomes for ordinary Australians. I commend the bills to the House and urge their prompt passage.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (17:16):  I would like to thank the member for Robertson for her contribution, and to thank all those who have spoken on this legislation. I rise to sum up this cognate debate on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 and the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012.


Our superannuation industry is one to be proud of, a distinct national advantage and one that is forecast to grow very significantly over the next 20 years. Our superannuation system currently manages $1.4 trillion for Australians. This amount will reach $6 trillion by 2030. Despite this, there are many inefficiencies still to be fixed in our system. There are currently approximately 12 million members with superannuation, yet there are over 31 million accounts, and there are over five million lost member accounts with a total value of over $20 billion—that is, an average of one lost superannuation account for every two working Australians.


The superannuation industry can do better in processing transactions, and there are still too many paper based systems. These inefficiencies lead to higher administration costs. Currently, different superannuation funds require different information from employers. This unnecessarily increases the compliance burden on Australia's employers. Ultimately, these inefficiencies lead to higher administration costs which consequently reduce the retirement incomes of all working Australians. The industry has attempted to develop its own voluntary standards over many years but has been unable, thus far, to achieve consensus. This is why the government has decided to take a leadership role by introducing this legislation, which will improve the efficiency of the superannuation industry under the SuperStream reforms. These reforms flow from the recommendations of the Cooper review inquiry into the superannuation industry.


Schedule 1 of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012 introduces the framework for the development of common standards and processes for superannuation transactions. Supporting regulations and legislative instruments will prescribe the detailed requirements underlying this framework. By setting down standardised rules for how funds transact with each other, and by setting standardised requirements for the information that funds can request from employers, significant efficiencies will result, ultimately lowering administration costs, simplifying processes for employers and for funds, and resulting in a more timely allocation of contributions to member accounts.


The government has adopted a staged approach to implementation to minimise the impact on the superannuation industry and on employers. Rollovers between superannuation funds will be required to comply with the new standards from 1 July 2013. New standards dealing with contributions from employers with more than 20 employees will apply from 1 July 2014. These standards will then apply to smaller employers from 1 July 2015, subject to further consultation on their impact.


Schedule 2 of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Stronger Super) Bill 2012, together with the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Imposition Amendment Bill 2012, enables costs to government associated with the implementation of the SuperStream measures to be recovered by a levy on APRA regulated funds. The superannuation industry's own estimates show that the SuperStream reforms of this government will deliver savings of up to $1 billion per annum. The benefit of these savings will flow through to members in the form of lower fees and charges. When averaged out across the number of accounts in the superannuation industry, the savings are in the order of $30 per account each and every year which significantly exceeds the transition costs involved in implementing these reforms.


The government will be bringing forward further legislation to complete the package of SuperStream reforms. This will include announced reforms to further benefit members, such as a new facility to enable members to easily look up and keep track of their superannuation. Fund members will also benefit from having low, inactive accounts consolidated automatically.


There are costs associated with implementing all these reforms. The most efficient way to meet these costs is by collecting them directly from the superannuation industry. The levy is a temporary one. It will only collect the costs that the government incurs in supporting the implementation of all these reforms. The costs will be recouped over six years, but must be considered in the context of the annual long-term savings of $1 billion estimated by industry.


These are real, important, significant and wide-ranging reforms. They will be implemented in a staged approach across a number of years. For these reasons, the government is establishing a SuperStream Advisory Council which will have the role of providing advice to government on issues relevant to the successful implementation and maintenance of the reforms.


I must acknowledge that the coalition has also acknowledged that the SuperStream measures have the potential to deliver real savings that will benefit superannuants, and that it supports changes that make the superannuation system more efficient, transparent and competitive. Valid feedback has been raised in relation to the provision of additional ongoing information in relation to SuperStream. While the government has already released some of the information on the breakdown of costs, further information will be released shortly. The government also acknowledges the contribution of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, and will consider how best to implement its recommendations about enhanced reporting by the ATO.


Finally, in relation to the matter raised by the member for Bradfield with respect to the strict liability provisions, I can advise the legislation provides a flexible compliance framework so that compliance action can be taken where necessary. However, the Australian Tax Office will take an educative approach in the first instance, as advised at the committee hearings. Secondly, I note numerous strict liability provisions that already exist in superannuation legislation were introduced by the Howard government in 2000. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2012-06-18,"



Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra) (20:00):  I move:


That this House:


(1) recognises that:


(a) the band of the Royal New South Wales Lancers, based in Parramatta, makes a significant contribution to the local community;


(b) similar Army Reserve Bands across Australia make significant contributions to their local communities;


(c) these bands provide a key link between communities and the Australian Defence Force in this time of high operational tempo;


(d) the recent Government decision, as part of the Strategic Reform Program, to remove financial support for these bands places the onus for support on regimental associations; and 


(e) such associations consist largely of retired veterans without the financial resources to provide such support; and


(2) calls upon the Government to continue support for Army Reserve Bands, thus ensuring these key links with the local community are not lost.


I would like to take a moment or two to say something of the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers. It is the oldest cavalry regiment in Australia. It was established on 3 January 1885. It is a regiment that has had troops deployed in South Africa at Federation. It took its name in 1956 when the 1st Royal New South Wales Lancers and the 15th Northern Rivers Lancers amalgamated. It carries battle honours of a number of former regiments, to a total of 31, from the Boer War, the First World War and the Second World War. Highlights include Gaza-Beersheba, the defence of ANZAC, Jordan, New Guinea, Wareo-Lakona, Gusika, Borneo, Balikpapan, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Egypt, Damascus, Stockton Bight and the Solomon Islands again. It is a regiment that has contributed troops as groups and individuals to many contemporary operations undertaken by the Australian Defence Force. It has very distinguished leadership and I acknowledge particularly its most recent honorary colonel, Lieutenant Colonel Warren Glenny, who was the General of the Army Reserve for Australia.


The band of this particular regiment has been part of the Lancers almost from the beginning and was established in 1888. From its earliest days it struggled with financial survival, being forced from 1891 to undertake fundraising to purchase instruments due to the inadequate support from the General Officer Commanding, New South Wales. In 1897, the band was transferred to Parramatta and was located in the historic Lancer Barracks, which were built in 1819 under the instructions of the then Governor Lachlan Macquarie. They remain there today as the longest continually occupied military post in Australia.


The band has been involved in the Commonwealth of Australia inauguration ceremonies in 1901, leading a section of the parade through Sydney. The following day, with 21 other bands, it participated in the Commonwealth Inauguration Tattoo. This event, with an attendance of over 30,000 people, was the largest attendance at any gathering in Australia to that point in time. On 12 March 1913 it played at the Canberra foundation ceremony. In 1921 it commenced the annual participation in the Anzac Day march through Sydney, and this year on Anzac Day I remember the band of the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales lancers playing and leading a significant part of that ceremonial parade. It played at the formal opening of the parliament following the accession of King George VI in 1922. On 18 October 1959 it led the regiment to receive the freedom of entry to the City of Parramatta. During the centenary of the regiment in 1985 it led the regiment to receive the freedom of entry to the City of Sydney.


This band has been extraordinary. It has provided support to events across the local community, such as the Westmead Children's Hospital Bandaged Bear Ball, Floriade in Canberra, the Australia Day citizenship ceremonies at Parramatta, regimental dinners—I note the member for Parramatta is here; she and I attended the most recent regimental dinner, where again the band was playing. It has provided buglers for the local RSL Anzac Day services, the Anzac Day march in Sydney, the Reserve Forces Day 2011, the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia Vietnam Veterans' Day 2011, the Battle of Crete service at the Sydney Cenotaph, the Manly Jazz Festival, and buglers for funerals of veterans. It is a vital link between the community and the military, and so at this important time of ongoing operations, when one is seeking to get people to support the military, when one is seeking to recruit people for the reserves, this is the visible face that people see and can relate to. To constrain it is, in my view, quite inappropriate at this time. The band is a reminder of the proud and longstanding military history and record of service of a very fine regiment.


So I want to speak about the funding cancellation. A minute on 24 August last year directed that ongoing support for bands in respect of replacement and repair of instruments and ceremonial uniforms would be withdrawn from most regimental bands. When I think of the size of the defence budget—and I know that there is a need for savings—I find it extraordinary that the savings are being made in relation to the replacement of instruments and ceremonial uniforms. I find that absolutely extraordinary.


This band has enormous local support. I have no doubt that the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers Association will provide support for their band, but it needs to be recognised that that will come from the pockets of retirees, many of whom are superannuants and whose savings are dwindling. Such spending also reduces the support the association can give to their other activities—in the case of the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers, the fundraising for their museum and community activities in which they are engaged.


Regimental bands support communities and they bind communities to the military. It is very important when troops are serving overseas—in Afghanistan and elsewhere—that that support is forthcoming. Given that there are very few military units now based in Sydney—and there are not many Army Reserve units—bands are even more important than ever in bringing the community and the ADF closer together. The lancers recently deployed a squadron minus to the Solomon Islands, demonstrating an ongoing commitment to service.


The cancellation of support for the Army Reserve bands comes with a budget that has cut defence spending dramatically, as I have mentioned. Ongoing efforts by Labor have seen, I think, unfortunately, a steady withdrawal of support for the Army reserves. It has been cloaked as a strategic reform program, but it aims to pick off what I would call low-hanging fruit to make quick savings—low-hanging fruit like stopping reservists being paid for attending Anzac Day ceremonies in 2010; low-hanging fruit like reservist funding, such that the Army Reserve can no longer meet their full training and development needs for anything other than high-priority tasks; and low-hanging fruit like support for Army Reserve bands, like that of the lancers.


As you would know, there is no higher priority that the coalition has than the defence and security of Australia and its people. But targeting organisations like Army Reserve bands is, in my view, a very seriously misguided saving. It is a saving that will separate the community from the military. It is a saving that puts the onus for support on a bunch of superannuated veterans and ex-servicemen. It is a saving that hits communities as much as it hits the motivated reservists who form part of the bands. Specific funding allocated to ADF reservists is now insufficient to meet their training and development needs for anything other than high-priority tasks.


This motion deserves to be passed vigorously, and I hope the military brass are hearing what I hope will be support from both sides of the House. (Time expired)

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (20:11):  I applaud the member for Berowra for his commitment to the musical life of the military, but I rise to speak against this motion tonight because it is unnecessary and it is somewhat confused. I attend many, many defence events in the course of my job as the member for Canberra. At all of those events there is always a very strong musical presence. One of the highlights of my time in Canberra was going to Beating the Retreat at Duntroon—on a freezing cold night, from memory. It was an absolute highlight. There is a very strong musical tradition in the military, and I applaud the member for Berowra for raising our awareness on that, but I do rise to speak against this motion tonight.


I am not supporting this motion for the following reasons. The current draft of the private member's bill refers incorrectly to regimental bands as reserve bands. It refers specifically to the Royal New South Wales Lancers Band and similar bands. Such bands are in fact regimental bands, yet this motion calls on the government to continue to support Army Reserve bands. The government actually already supports reserve bands and will continue to do so. At present, the government supports six regional reserve bands and more than 20 Army Reserve personnel who work in four Army support bands. These personnel and bands are part of the Australian Army Band Corps. The matter of support raised in this motion by the member for Berowra is actually an administrative matter. What is more concerning is that this motion proposes to interfere with and reverse a decision taken by the Chief of Army.


I will go into more detail about these issues shortly but, before I do so, I would just like to talk a bit more about the current band structure in the Australian Army. As the member for Canberra, I am very appreciative of the role our Army bands play in our national discourse. The band of the Military College, Duntroon—often referred to as the RMC band or the Duntroon band—is based here in Canberra. The band is a respected and important part of Canberra's cultural life and is often called on to play at important events and ceremonies. So for me this is a pertinent issue.


There are two broad categories or divisions of bands in the Australian Army. The first category is the Australian Army Band Corps, which is composed of musically trained reserve and permanent personnel and was established to provide a musical service to the Army and the broader community. Our Australian Army Band Corps plays an important role. It provides music for ceremonial and training activities conducted by the Army and other services of the ADF. It provides music for ceremonial activities, including for royal and vice-regal events and federal, state and territory and local government agencies. It enhances morale and esprit de corps through entertainment for Army personnel in barracks and those deployed on operations or exercises and supporting civil affairs and psychological operations. It contributes to the attraction of quality recruits to the Army and—this is really important—it promotes the public image of the Army through musical performance.


The Australian Army Band Corps is organised as follows: it has one Army band of 43 Australian Regular Army musicians; four Army support bands of 22 Australian Regular Army musicians and 21 Army Reserve musicians; six regional Army Reserve bands of 40 Army Reserve musicians and three Australian Regular Army staff; a Defence Force School of Music—I have been to that school and met many of the players there—with 11 regular Australian Army staff; and a Director of Music Army with six staff. This structure is based on a 43-piece Australian Regular Army band in Canberra, the Royal Military College Band, and Army support bands each consisting of 22 Australian Regular Army personnel located proximate to formations in Townsville, in Brisbane, in Sydney and in Wagga Wagga. Each Army support band will hold an Army Reserve establishment of 21 in addition to the Australian Regular Army element. Regional Army Reserve bands consisting of 40 Army Reserve and three Australian Regular Army staff will be located in Melbourne, Adelaide, Hobart, Newcastle, Perth and Darwin. Perth and Newcastle will contain an Army Reserve pipes and drums component.


The second category refers to the regimental bands, which are composed of volunteers and are established to provide musical services primarily for a specific unit or regiment. As I mentioned before, the Royal New South Wales Lancers, referred to by the member for Berowra, is an established regimental band. Regimental bands are staffed by volunteers from both permanent and part-time Army personnel from the parent regiment. The members of these bands are already employed by the Army in other roles. For example, if they are employed by the army as a cook, they may volunteer to play in the regimental band. The motion we are debating here claims that associations like the Royal New South Wales Lancers are a reservist band. They are in fact a regimental band. The member also suggested that they consist largely of retired veterans without the financial resources to provide support. This is also incorrect. The Gillard government already supports Reserve bands and will continue to do so. As I said before, the Gillard government supports six regional Reserve bands and over 20 Army Reserve personnel who work in four Army support bands. These personnel and bands are part of the Australian Army Band Corps.


As I also mentioned earlier, following a review into Army bands in May 2011, a decision was made by the Chief of Army to transfer the resourcing of regimental bands from the Commonwealth to the associated regimental associations. This decision by the Chief of Army is an administrative matter that is delegated to the Chief of Army pursuant to the Defence Act 1903. Therefore, the member's motion proposes to interfere with a decision by the Chief of Army.


As I understand it, these resourcing changes were necessary to ensure Army's dedicated musical capability could be sustained in the long term. To ensure that resources were focused on Army's dedicated musical capability, voluntary bands such as the regimental bands were given the responsibility to repair or replace musical instruments, uniforms and other equipment. The Chief of Army made a decision to no longer replace the musical instruments, uniforms and other equipment held by the voluntary regimental bands in order to prioritise financial support to the dedicated members and bands of the Australian Army Band Corps. This decision was made to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Australian Army Band Corps. This decision was made with fiscal responsibility in mind as well as a determination to see the history and culture of our Australian Army bands continue.


Members of the Royal New South Wales Lancers in Parramatta who are listed in the private member's motion, will be offered part-time positions with the Australian Army Band Sydney, which is an Australian Army Band Corps band funded by Army. The Australian Army does not plan to disestablish regimental bands. Regimental bands will retain their current musical instruments and uniforms. All Army Reserve members who are currently volunteering in regimental bands such as the Royal New South Wales Lancers and who are qualified as Army musicians will be given the option of transferring to an Australian Army Band Corps band. It is important to note that the regimental bands reflect the heritage of various units and corps and perform duties primarily for their own regiment, which is why the responsibility should lie with the unit.


Ultimately this is an administrative matter which is delegated to the Chief of Army. I can appreciate the importance of our Army bands and I agree with the member for Berowra that they are incredibly important to the life of the military, to the culture of the military and also to the culture of communities such as Canberra. They are steeped in history and they are important to our national character, but this motion is simply unwarranted and unnecessary.

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2012-06-18,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (20:20):  I rise to support my colleague the honourable member for Berowra's motion and am happy to speak in support of it. The member for Berowra has given a very good account of the problems facing regimental bands—in this case the Royal New South Wales Lancers based in Parramatta. Whilst the member for Canberra has so eloquently gone through the issues of the Australian Army Band Corps and its history, she had the effrontery—the blatant audacity—to say that this $2 million saving was about fiscal responsibility. She said fiscal responsibility, after this government has just gutted the Defence Force to the tune of $5½ billion. Since 2008, the cuts, deferments and imposition on absorbed costs have resulted in over $20 billion being ripped out of Defence to hollow it out. You come in here, Member for Canberra, and talk about fiscal responsibility for $2 million from 14 regimental bands and you expect me to take you seriously. Well, ma'am, with the good grace that I have and as good a member of parliament that you may well be, I find that comment outrageous in the extreme.


On 24 August last year the Army, in response to the government's dubious strategic reform program, issued a directive to withdraw support from 14 regimental bands. It was an arbitrary decision—another example where the government failed to consult with the senior staff of the military. The policy has resulted in the Army withdrawing all instruments from these regimental bands, in effect passing the cost of instruments, uniforms and the like onto regimental associations. Why? For that fiscal responsibility, Member for Canberra: to save $2 million while your party and government gutted $20 billion. Let's put that in context: $2 million versus your $20 billion gutting. And you speak of fiscal responsibility—a drop in the ocean that is nothing short of outrageous, especially when you spend $30 million advertising your carbon tax and you cannot even say the term 'carbon tax.'




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Member for Fadden, I am reluctant to interrupt in the given time, but you are referring to 'you', being the occupier of this chair. I would ask—




Mr ROBERT:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I apologise for my youthful exuberance and the word 'you'—but there is a public outrage at the cuts that our Defence Force is going through. The member for Canberra tells me that this wasn't the government's decision; this was General Morrison. General Morrison issued this decision, yet after the public outrage this punitive policy was fiddled, it was changed. The Sydney Morning Herald on 1 October 2001 said that the 14 regimental bands will be allowed to keep their existing instruments but will not be provided any support to maintain those instruments or to purchase new instruments. So, Member for Canberra, what you are saying is that the Chief of Army made this decision and then, after this great public outcry, General Morrison—a man I know well and a man not prone to changing his mind easily, may I say—suddenly changed his mind without any instruction from the minister and without any political engagement or fiddling at all. May I suggest this is what happened, Member for Canberra: that the government, under its strategic reform program, has forced the Army into a range of dreadful cuts, as it is doing right now. After the great outrage, could the minister have said: 'Oh, Chief, this is not going well; could we make a little bit of a change here'? Do you think that could have happened, Member for Canberra, or do you think the Chief of Army simply changed his mind because this was an administrative decision of the Army and nothing to do with the government of the day? If you are suggesting that, I find that hardly credible and I struggle to believe it.


The member for Berowra has quite rightly noted that Labor's mean-spirited policy will put significant financial strain on Army reservists and their regimental associations connected with them. These associations so often made up of ex-regimental members—and I can attest to that from personal experience—are 100 per cent committed to their units—100 per cent committed to their communities and the units they serve with.


The motion simply asked for a little bit of goodwill. For all the fiscal responsibilities you talk about, how about community responsibility? How about responsibility for the unique nature of military service? But, then again, you will not index DFRDB pensions, so you are saying what your view of the unique nature of military service is. How about a bit of goodwill to assist 14 regimental bands, their associations and the communities that serve our nation? That would not go astray.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (20:25):  With some regret, I have to say that I also cannot support this motion, because it is not really the parliament's role to look at the expenditure decisions of the Chief of Army and pick and choose which ones we as a parliament would have changed. It is just not our role to do that. This is a decision that the Chief of Army has made. 


The reason why I say it is with some regret is that I know the Army Band Corps very well. My father was in the 1st Military District Band for 20 years and won an Order of Australia for his services to the military as a musician in the army bands. It is a sound I know well. I was raised with it. I spent a lot of time in Enoggera. I spent a lot of time watching parades and listening to my father. I understand the extraordinary contribution that the army bands have made not just to the community but to the broader community by the provision of those full-time positions throughout our community and the support that those positions give to teaching, to part-time musicians that work in clubs in various bands. The effect of those full-time positions and the quality of that work feeds out to the music industry generally, so it has a double purpose. 


I am delighted to see in the decision that the Army made an absolute strong commitment to the maintenance of that professional band corps through the Army band in Canberra, the four army support bands, the six regional Army Reserve bands and also the Defence Force School of Music. There is in its decision an extraordinary commitment to maintaining those professional bands both full-time Army and Reserve bands.


I would say this as an observer to both the Army and the regiment: bands like the lancers are very much a part of our community. It is the oldest surviving regimental band in Australia. It was formed in 1888. It is one of three bands in Parramatta that are over 100 years old. We also have the Parramatta City Brass band, which celebrated its 100th last year, and the Parramatta Citadel Band from the Salvation Army, which is also over 100 years old. We have three in Parramatta, but the lancers is associated with the oldest functioning barracks and the most decorated regiment, which was formed for the Boer War. It has this history which we in Parramatta take on as very much a part of our own—an extraordinary barracks because of the nature of its buildings and the nature of its history. It is where our men and women enlisted for the first and second world wars. It is an extraordinary place.


The member for Berowra is incorrect in referring to them as superannuates and retirees. They are actually not; they are reservists and soldiers who have other jobs in the Army and do this on a part-time basis in their spare time. It would be reasonable, I would think, for a clarinettist always to provide their own clarinet and a trumpet player to provide their own trumpet—as they do in every band, by the way. The drums and the instruments, on the other hand, are a slightly different matter and are really quite expensive. So this will provide a difficulty for bands like the lancers and it would be quite tragic if in the course of time we saw these bands, particularly a band like this one with its extraordinary history, substantially weakened or disappearing. I would hope that in the transition period we are quite sensitive to the needs of these bands. Mind you, I am talking for the one I know; I am sure there will be other communities around Australia that will talk for their regimental bands as well in exactly the same terms as I do. Once again, I do not criticise the Army for the decision it has had to make because I do not know of the other decisions it has had to make. This is one of a suite of decisions—you cannot look at one alone. But I would say again that bands like the Lancers, in the role they have had, carry an extraordinary part of our military history and the loss of even one of these bands would be a tragedy. It is going to be quite an interesting transition. I will be working with the band through that as best I can, but I have to support the Chief of Army in the suite of decisions he has had to make.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (20:30):  I rise to speak on this important motion from the member for Berowra regarding the Royal New South Wales Lancers from Parramatta. This motion notes that many Defence Force bands similar to the Lancers make a significant contribution to the local community, but their very existence is presently under threat due to the decision by this Labor government to cut funding. The Reserves are an integral component of Australia's Defence Force. Along with my coalition colleagues, including the member for Brisbane, I have long supported the unique skills that reservists bring to defence and I have always supported the important work they carry out in achieving the ADF's objectives both at home and abroad.


Unfortunately, as a result of Labor's poor and reckless financial management of the country's budget, the government has decided to cut funding to the Department of Defence and, as the member for Berowra said, to the so-called low-hanging fruit of that department. An important consequence for the community of Labor's Strategic Reform Program, which is supposed to save $20 billion over 10 years, is that such low-hanging fruit consists of things like paying for training and development needs of sectors of the Defence Force which are not considered high priority. At the very time that Australia has a significant number of troops overseas—clearly our highest priority—it does not make sense to be cutting funding in this way. A lot of sensible and positive programs that are not related to direct combat will be cut but the coalition does not believe that their funding should be cut—not in the current context and not ever. Yet this Labor government has decided that the defence department does not matter to the extent that their budget, as a percentage of GDP, is less than 1.5 per cent—the lowest it has been since 1938.


The May budget saw $5.5 billion of cuts to the Defence portfolio. I ask the question: was there a specific strategic justification for these cuts? The answer is simple: of course not. Has the world become safer or changed so much in the last couple of years that a capable Defence Force is deemed completely unnecessary? Of course not. At the same time, have conditions changed to the extent that the service of reservists in Army bands is no longer required? Of course not. The Labor government has abandoned its commitment to the reserves to the extent that specific funding allocated to Australian Defence Force reservists is so insufficient that some reserve units are down to as low as 20 days training per annum. This is despite numerous parliamentary studies of the Reserves agreeing that for an effective reserve service there must be a minimum of approximately 30 training days per year.


There are two main streams of Defence Force bands in the Brisbane area with which reservists assist. They are the regular Australian Army Band Brisbane and the Band of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment which formed 58 years ago. The band of the RAR recently performed at the Ashgrove dawn service on Anzac Day this year for the 42nd year in a row. Unfortunately it may be the case that they will not be able to perform for the 43rd year in a row. It might the case that, as the member for Berowra highlighted, there will be no buglers available to provide their services for the funeral of a veteran. At passing-out parades for diggers who have been deployed overseas to risk their lives for this country there will not be a band to welcome them home or to see them off.


A worrying development occurred on 24 August 2011 when it was announced that, for those in regimental bands, ongoing support for replacement and repair of instruments and financial support for things like ceremonial uniforms will be withdrawn. This is a threat to the Defence Force and the community. It is not trivial that these bands serve as an entertainment outlet for serving Australians both here and on overseas deployment; that they perform at Defence and government occasions; that they support the Defence Force's public and community relations events; or that they contribute to educational programs at schools and other charity organisations. I assure the Australian people that a re-elected coalition government will urgently seek to address the Gillard government's failure to properly support the ADF Reserves. I call on all members to support this motion.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter—Chief Government Whip) (20:35):  It is a great pleasure, Mr Deputy Speaker Murphy, to be addressing the parliament while you are in the chair. I begin my contribution by acknowledging what I am sure is a very genuine motion from the member for Berowra. I understand that he, like all of us in this place, appreciates the enormous contribution these people make through their participation in Defence bands and like organisations. They are invaluable to local communities; there is no doubt about that.


I am a late entrant to this debate because I realised about an hour ago that I might have caused this debate. It was me who, as then Minister for Defence, put in place the Strategic Reform Program and I suspect there may be, as other speakers have indicated, some link between the Strategic Reform Program and the Chief of Army's decision to curtail some of these activities. At the end of the day it is pretty simple: when I became defence minister we began, as we had committed to, the process of developing another Defence white paper. As we all know in this place, we live in an uncertain world in a region which is going through dynamic change, and no-one would contest the fact that, over time, as we continue to grow economically along with our near and not-so-near neighbours we will need to continue to develop Australia's defences in a way which allows us to continue our ability to defend ourselves independently of any other nation state.


Any look at our strategic outlook indicates that, over time, we will need to continue to spend more money on high-end capability, whether it be on air warfare destroyers, fast jets or other capabilities. There is only so much money a country can contribute to defence as a percentage of its GDP and, on average, we are up there with many comparable countries. It became clear to me as defence minister that, given our strategic outlook, we would not be able to find off the budget the sort of money we would need to be investing over the course of the next decade or more, so I came to the conclusion that the only way we could enhance the money coming from the centre of government was to find savings within defence.


I remember vividly suggesting to the Chief of the Defence Force and the secretary of the department at the time that, having had a thorough look at the organisation, we should be able to find $10 billion internally—not $10 billion to give back to the centre but $10 billion to redirect into high-end capability within defence. Some people criticised me for that assessment, but having asked an independent private sector organisation to come in and study defence I was informed: 'You were wrong, Minister. You probably got it wrong when you suggested that $10 billion could be found. We think $20 billion could be found.' That was the recommendation from the independent consultant. So we put in place a strategic reform program not to take money out of defence but to make savings internally so that they could be redirected back into defence. That is what the strategic reform program is all about.


Having done that, we need to rely upon the service chiefs to make the decisions. If they want high-end capability and an efficient defence force they need to make some tough decisions about some of the legacy issues and how they might deal with them. It seems apparent to me—not that I look at these things all that closely these days—that the Chief of Army has decided that there needs to be some rationalisation with respect to Army bands. I think it would be a very dangerous thing for this place, this parliament, this House of Representatives to look to intervene every time a service chief took a decision about how they might rationalise the spending within their own defence organisation.


Again, I accept the genuineness in the approach of the member for Berowra and of those who have supported him, but if we are going to have a strong defence force in the future we must have an ongoing reform program, we must rationalise, we must make savings and we must redirect those savings to the high-end capability in the force we need to protect our nation state. While not questioning anyone's genuineness, I think the parliament should stay out of these decisions. This is a relatively low-level decision for the Chief of Army and we should support him in his decision.

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2012-06-18,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (20:40):  Quite frankly, I am shocked. I rise to speak in support of my friend and colleague the member for Berowra and his motion that the band of the Royal New South Wales Lancers, based in Parramatta, makes a significant contribution to the local community and that Army bands across Australia make significant contributions to their local communities. I commend my friend for moving that this House recognise military bands.


I represent the seat of Herbert and the garrison city of Townsville. We are home to Australia's largest Army base—the 3rd Brigade at Lavarack Barracks. Not only do we house Australia's best troops and ready deployed forces but we are also home to the world famous 1RAR band. I must first commend the commander of 3rd Brigade, Brigadier Shane Caughey, for his commitment to ensuring that the Army maintains a strong community presence. His commitment to our community and to the greater North Queensland community must have played some part in his very much deserved Queen's Birthday honour.


The commander of 1RAR is Lieutenant Colonel Eamon Lenaghan. 1RAR is a battle-ready regiment. It maintains a high level of training for its primary role, which is to keep Australia safe. It continues a strong tradition of commitment to a number of community causes, but it is the 1RAR band which forms the social bond between all things military and civilian in my city. I note that the Chief of the Defence Force, General Hurley, was a former commander of 1RAR.


Under the Leadership of Major Lindsay Mee the 1RAR band plays a constant stream of community events. They play with joy and happiness. They play brilliantly. They have played the formal military role and they have also provided first-class musical accompaniment to a vast number of charitable and community events. Everything from the senior citizens to the Ronald McDonald House ball will see the band providing dinner music, big band music, as well as jazz, blues, and rock and roll for every audience.


The band also provides musicians for the local music scene. I was lucky enough to be present for the 3RAR welcome parade to see the 1RAR band team with the Barrier Reef Symphony Orchestra and the 4th field regiment's artillery to present an open air rendition of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. That, my friends, was a truly memorable evening. It is the willingness of the band to represent the entire community which I love the most. On Anzac Day the brass section can be seen at every dawn service, including Magnetic Island. They will then join together for the march along the Strand and will end up playing somewhere that evening.


I have a personal fondness for Grant Thomas. He plays the six-string bass in the main band and plays bass and lead in the rock band. He also plays trombone for the marching band—although the other band members tell me that he cannot play at all but they need the numbers so they give him a dummy trombone and let him pretend. His taste in music is wide and varied and he is just so happy to be there, playing music, but he is above all else a professional soldier. When the rock and roll band starts up Angie Currington moves from the back and brings a big and sassy jazz/blues voice to the front of house and really gets the party started.


The thing I like most about the bands we have in the military of Australia is that they do not have to do the public shows. They can quite legitimately concentrate on their role as a military band and as soldiers. That they see the greater good in the role they play in extending the hand of friendship from the ADF to the community speaks volumes of the individuals in the band and the leadership role they play. It is this pastoral and parish care of their staff which leads the way in setting the example and opening doors the right way.


There are many things in Townsville which need action. We have many problems and many things which require fixing. But we are an aspirational people. We care about our community. We care about the relationship between the ADF and our city and region. When everything is tough, and you turn up to a function and see the boys and girls of the 1RAR band setting up and laughing about the night ahead, you cannot help but feel good. This motion, from the father of the House, is a wonderful opportunity to thank the members of Australia's military bands for all the unpaid work they do for all our communities. I am glad we have them here and may they continue forever because, if they do stop, a part of history will be gone and it will be gone forever. These guys are soldiers first, but they are professional musicians second. I talked to Brigadier Shayne Caughey about the 1RAR band. I asked him, 'What you are here for?' and he said, 'I am with the band. That is all I am; I am with the band.' It is about being special and it is about being proper and great for Townsville. Long may they live.

Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (20:45):  First I would like to acknowledge the sentiments that have been expressed by my colleagues about the service members who perform in bands, regimental or reserve, and the service that they render to our nation as soldiers as well. I understand the sentiment that the member for Berowra is exhibiting on this issue. I commend his concern for the traditions of the Army. I certainly understand that. I understand very much the sentimentality that attaches to this but also the essence of the traditions and why those traditions are there and what constitutes the esprit de corps that makes the Australian Army what it is and the tradition that it has.


Of course, many things have happened over the years that I would not like to see disappear from the Australian Army. I was very sad to see that we did not have batmen any more when I joined up, and I missed my morning cups of tea and clean shoes, but they disappeared with the traditions of a bygone age. Certainly chiefs of army over the years have made all sorts of decisions about the conditions of service and the traditions that we have served under. Some of those have included the previous chiefs of army and the land commanders deciding that members would no longer wear berets in many circumstances. There was a great deal of emotional response to that issue as well.


But, at the end of the day, these are all decisions that the Chief of Army makes in relation to the authority that is delegated to him under the Defence Act. When we start trying to interfere with those decisions of the Chief of Army, where do we draw the line? This particular decision was not made as a result of any pressure put on the Chief of Army through the recent budget cuts because I remember these issues were being discussed with the Chief of Army prior to the last election. These were all part of his concept of rebalancing the Army. It really did not even relate to the strategic reform program as such. The issue that was being discussed then by the Chief of Army was his concern about reprioritising the efforts and maintaining his ability to sustain the actual band capability within the Army itself. I think the mistake that the member for Berowra makes in the motion is to conflate the regimental bands with the reserve bands, because they are different things. The regimental bands are made up of voluntary participants, permanent and reserve, who are not part of the band corps itself. There are certain formal band corps structures that are maintained within the Australian Army band corps itself. They are, in effect, professional musicians.


The Army supports reserve bands and also permanent band capability within that construct. So there are six regional reserve bands and there are over 20 Army reserve personnel who are working for Army support bands as well. They are part of that band corps structure. The Chief of Army has not decided that he intends to do away with the regimental bands. They may, in fact, continue. Hopefully they will continue. The only decision that the Chief of Army has made in this respect is that he will no longer replace the musical instruments, uniforms and other equipment held by the voluntary regimental bands so that he can prioritise his support to the actual Army band corps personnel.


Those regimental bands will hopefully be well supported by philanthropic groups and by those who raise funds through the normal regimental trust fund processes to make sure that those bands can sustain their instruments and their uniforms and the traditions associated with their regiments. Those who are involved with those regimental bands who wish to transfer to the reserve band structure or the band corps can do so and that will be facilitated. That structure consists presently of a 43-piece Australian regular Army band based in Canberra. Army support bands with 22 personnel each are located in various regions such as Townsville, Brisbane, Sydney and Wagga Wagga. The Army reserve bands of 40 Army reserve personnel and three regular personnel are located in Melbourne, Adelaide, Hobart, Newcastle, Perth and Darwin. Perth and Newcastle also contain an Army reserve pipes and drum component.


So the fine traditions of the Australian Army in relation to the band tradition will be maintained, supported and funded by the Chief of Army. I expect that the regimental bands will continue to draw support to sustain their traditions and their musical capability into the future. I certainly look forward to watching them in action at ceremonies around Australia.

"Hawke, Alex, MP",LP,2012-06-18,"



Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (20:51):  It is a pleasure to rise to support the member for Berowra's fine motion on Army reserve bands tonight. It is interesting to follow the Parliamentary Secretary. I want to start by saying I was a member of the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers and, for the Parliamentary Secretary, to suggest there is any difference between regular service and reserve service is a falsehood. It is in fact a hallmark of a free society to have the citizen soldier at its disposal. The 21 battle honours of the 1st/15th, the most decorated regiment of the Australian Army, are a fine testament to that regiment and all of its serving men and women over the years. 


This particular motion relates to the bands, and the band form part of the rich Australian cultural heritage that has developed through the Australian military. This band formed in 1891, and even in 1891, before Federation, £250 was received from the New South Wales government and, after Federation, £150 from the Commonwealth government. If it was good enough in 1891 to fund this band, what is wrong with funding it today?


The service of the band has been recorded in the regimental history over more than 100 years. This is a regiment that has lasted the test of time. It has seen service in 21 different conflicts in defence of this nation. The rich tapestry that has been formed by the band goes to show the strength of our local community in Parramatta, and it was extraordinary to see the member for Parramatta come into this place and speak against the local Parramatta regiment, the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers, based at their historic headquarters at Parramatta. It was extraordinary for the member for Parramatta to come in here and say, 'That is an Army decision.' This is a direct decision of government that this motion relates to tonight—to fund the Australian Army and its reserve forces to be able to conduct its duties in Australia today—and it is the responsibility of this parliament to call to attention those deficiencies that come about when funding is not available for the reserve forces. We could fund it in 1891 with pounds from the New South Wales and Commonwealth governments, but we cannot afford to fund it today when we have $10 billion for a Clean Energy Finance Corporation? We cannot find instruments for people to play in their regimental bands on our Anzac Days and at our memorial services in our communities, to help recruit young men and women to these reserve regiments to serve as citizen soldiers, to follow in that fine tradition of the Roman citizen soldier Cincinnatus—'I am not a soldier; I am a farmer'—and of the minutemen, and of privateers in Elizabethan England? Free societies have been dominated by citizen soldiers, and the 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers is a fine example of a citizen soldier regiment, giving us great service.


These people in the band do not do this for the money; I want to make that clear. They are not in this for the money. They do more service and voluntary activity than the government can ever possibly fund. We have heard from the member for Herbert about the dedication and the voluntary and selfless service that these young men and women provide. Yet this government says that there is no funding available for these great reserve regiments and for their bands. And that affects many bands. I have the minute here from Australian Army headquarters. These are the regiments affected: in 1st Brigade, 5RAR and 7RAR; in 7th Brigade, 2nd/14th LHR; and in 2nd Division, 1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers, the 4th/19th, the 23rd Field Regiment, the 2nd/10th Field Regiment, 8/7 RVR, 5/6 RVR, 9 RQR, 10/27 RSAR, 2/17 RNSWR, 25/49 RQR, the Queensland University Regiment, the Sydney University Regiment, the University of New South Wales Regiment and the Western Australian University Regiment—all of those reserve regimental bands. For the parliamentary secretary to stand here today in this place and say, 'Somehow they will find the funding,' and that they should be a charity case is really demonstrating a lack of understanding of the importance of these reserve regimental bands and how they operate. 


These people are already volunteering a lot of their time and a lot of their effort, putting their hearts and souls into these units that provide the social fabric at the heart of so many local communities around Australia. That is what a reserve regiment does. That is what a citizen soldier regiment does: it provides the corps at the heart of those communities—another social setup that provides unity and cohesion in society without the need for government to be involved.


If it was good enough to fund the RNSWR Lancers in 1891 with £250 from the state government and £150 from the Commonwealth government, it is good enough for us today to continue that fine tradition of 110 years of dedicated and selfless service that this regimental band and all of these regimental bands that I have mentioned, in all their societies all around Australia, provide, serving our nation, doing us proud and providing invaluable service to our communities. And it is a great motion before this House today to support them in what they do.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (20:56):  I note the contribution of the member for Mitchell; it was very passionate. In that spirit, in terms of declaring any particular interest, before I move to the motion raised by the member for Berowra, I will declare my particular interest, as a flight lieutenant in the RAAF Reserve, No. 23 (City of Brisbane) Squadron. Just before you get interested, I will just declare that I do not receive any money or any remuneration—no profit under the Crown. I do my work as a volunteer and do not get remunerated. I am not in a band. I have been in a band, but that did not receive any federal support. In fact, some could argue that it received almost no support at all! But that is another story for another day—on the curse of YouTube.


I turn to the more serious matter of the motion raised by the member for Berowra, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, who I always listen to and have a lot of respect for. I am on committees with him. However, I do think that this motion is a little unnecessary and a little bit misguided and, I would suggest, even perhaps an interference with the Chief of Army's duties to administer the Army in an efficient and effective manner.


I am from Brisbane, not from Sydney; I know that the member for Mitchell and the member for Berowra would have a better understanding of some of the decisions of the Chief of Army in terms of how they apply. Under the Howard government, in those times, the changing of the guard and the band accompanying it at the Sydney barracks was a decision that was made for lots of reasons; it is not for me to inquire into. It was a decision made by the Chief of Army and I support that decision.


As I said in my declaration of interest, it is as a legal officer in the RAAF Reserve, not the Army or the Navy. But my understanding is that this motion does incorrectly refer to regimental bands as 'reserve bands'. I am sorry I did not hear the earlier conversations or whether that was corrected; I was otherwise engaged. But this motion refers specifically to the New South Wales Lancers' band and similar bands. My understanding is that such bands are in fact regimental bands. Yet the motion calls on the government to continue to support the Army Reserve bands, and my understanding is that this is factually incorrect.


Obviously, the Gillard Labor government already supports reserve bands and will continue to do so. I am advised that we support six regional reserve bands and over 20 Army Reserve personnel who work in four Army support bands. These personnel and bands are part of the Australian Army Band Corps, or the AABC. The government supports six regional reserve bands, and over 20 Army Reserve personnel who work in four Army support bands. These personnel and bands are part of the Australian Army Band Corps. Following a review into Army bands in May 2011, a decision was made by the Chief of Army to transfer the resourcing of regimental bands from the Commonwealth to the associated regimental associations. Regimental bands are staffed by volunteers from both permanent and part-time Army personnel from the parent regiment. The members of these bands are already employed by the Army in other roles. For example, they may be employed by the Army as a cook, but volunteer to play in the regimental band in their spare time, and perhaps even for no remuneration. Regimental bands are established to provide musical services primarily for a specific unit or regiment.


The decision is an administrative matter which is delegated to the Chief of Army and, as I am sure those opposite would know, respecting that chain of command is pursuant to the Commonwealth Defence Act 1903. This motion, as I read it, proposes to interfere with the decision of the Chief of Army. The Chief of Army made a decision to no longer replace the musical instruments, uniforms and other equipment held by the voluntary regimental bands—

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (21:30):  A crucially needed piece of infrastructure in my electorate is the link between the F3 and M2. This is needed for a range of reasons: to reduce the appalling congestion on Pennant Hills Road, to reduce traffic on the Pacific Highway, and to establish the missing link between these two vital pieces of transport infrastructure, including for long-distance trucks travelling between Brisbane and Melbourne or otherwise taking long-distance journeys that do not necessarily originate or terminate in the Sydney metropolitan area.


Two exhaustive studies have recommended that the appropriate solution for the Pennant Hills Road congestion and the appropriate solution to establish a link between the F3 and the M2 is to build a tunnel under Pennant Hills Road. What then have we seen from the federal Labor government towards the achievement of this important objective? In last year's budget announcement, buried deep in the budget papers for 2011, there was a withdrawal of $150 million, which had previously been set aside in the forward estimates for planning work on the F3-M2 link. This year in the May 2012 budget, the position is at best extremely opaque. In an opinion piece during the week of the budget the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport had this to say:


In Tuesday's budget the Treasurer announced increased funding for infrastructure and measures to encourage private sector financing of Sydney's Moorebank Intermodal, the F3 to M2 link, and the M5 East.


This is a magnificently Delphic statement and it is extremely unclear what the minister actually meant by that. On my examination of the budget papers—and I readily concede I have only been here a relatively short time—no mention of the F3 to M2 link can be found. We made inquiries of the minister's office and asked for clarification. The minister's office pointed to a glossy booklet entitled Sydney Transport Infrastructure: Project Highlights. That glossy booklet contains the following statement:


Given the significant capital cost of both projects, the Australian Government tasked Infrastructure Australia to work with the NSW Government to explore private financing options for expansion of the M5 East and the F3 to M2.


Again, this is a magnificently Delphic statement. It is very hard to understand what it actually means and what level of finance has been allocated to the task. The picture gets even more murky when you look at the transcript of what the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport had to say in a recent interview with Adam Spencer on ABC Radio, where he made a vague claim that $150 million was still available for the F3 to M2 link. That claim was repeated in the recent consideration in detail in the Federation Chamber of the infrastructure and transport portfolio where the minister had this to say:


In addition to that, $150 million that we have committed is available also to assist in terms of being allocated in the budget for the F3 to M2.


It is difficult to understand what the position is. It is clear from last year's budget that $150 million, which had previously been contained in the forward estimates for feasibility work on the F3 to M2 link, was removed. On an examination of this year's budget it is difficult to find any specific statement that refers to the F3 to M2 link and any specific statement that the $150 million has been reinstated. Yet we have statements made by the minister, both in an interview with Adam Spencer on ABC Radio and in the consideration in detail in the Federation Chamber, that the $150 million is still available. This is a matter of great importance to my constituents in the Bradfield electorate and everybody who would like to see a better connection between the F3 and the M2. I call upon the minister to clarify this position and indicate what federal funding is available for the F3 to M2 link.

Mr VASTA
 (Bonner) (10:31):  I rise today to bring to the attention of the House a great example of how the Bonner local community came together, with bipartisan help from all levels of government, to achieve a balanced outcome for all stakeholders. In late 2011, Optus proposed a new mobile phone tower right next to Guardian Angels Primary School in Wynnum. After some concerned parents looked into the tower's location, they came to the view that, to be on the safe side, an action group should be formed. The action group was called No Tower Near Guardian Angels.


Community engagement on the project revealed that the local community overwhelmingly opposed the tower. This was evidenced by over 3,500 local signatures on a petition to have a more appropriate location found. From my personal dealings with Optus, I know that they work hard to find the balance between community concerns and demand for increased mobile coverage—never an easy balance to achieve. Thankfully, in this case, the balance was achieved. I thank Optus, on behalf of those in the local bayside community who had their say on this issue, for listening to them and, most importantly, for really hearing them. I particularly thank Rowena Gilbertson, Manager of Government Affairs at Optus, for her sensitivity and professionalism in dealing with this matter.


I also acknowledge Natalie Von Hoff, Nathan McNamara, Michelle Evans, Kristy Gilchrist, Raff Foniatti, Kylie Vigen, Sam Johnson, Kellie Sommerville, Paul Caton and Stephen Sherrard—just to name some of the many local heroes who worked hard behind the scenes to achieve this stellar result for the community. I found the group to be very fair and professional. Special mention should also be made of the new state member for Lytton, Neil Symes, and Councillor Peter Cummings for their care and attention to this matter. This result could not have been achieved if the three levels of government had not worked together. I also acknowledge my friend and colleague the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull for his interest in this issue and for his advice and work behind the scenes, as well as Deidre Thomson.


I, along with my state and local colleagues, will continue to work constructively with Optus as they investigate other locations to install the proposed communication infrastructure. We acknowledge that we must continue to ensure that balance is found between community interests and Optus's need to deliver better services to the local community and to businesses.

Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (11:00):  It dismays me immensely that I have for the second time to move a motion of this nature in relation to the Torres Strait seawalls. Last year in March I had a motion prepared and I was ready to have it submitted to this place for debate. I was asked directly by the Minister Crean's office not to put it up, that the government had made a decision that they were inclined to support that motion but they needed more time. They could not take the money out of the RDA funds because it was totally inappropriate and the minister was looking for an opportunity to identify funds from another source. In the interest of bipartisan support, I agreed to delay putting the motion up until August to assist the minister in his endeavours to locate the money.


In August, I still had not heard from the minister and I advised him that it was my intention, as per our agreement, to put the motion up. The motion was put up and the government supported it. The motion asked that the issue of seawalls be addressed immediately, that infrastructure be put in place so that we do not start to lose existing infrastructure. We have $1 billion worth of infrastructure that is being damaged every single year. We had lost over half the Saibai Island's cemetery which had been washed out to sea. I was pleased that the government supported the motion. In fact in August I wrote to the minister and congratulated him, thanking him on behalf of the Torres Strait Islands community because he was prepared to support us.


I then asked when the money could be expected to flow and where the money would come from. I had to wait until December, and, after many subsequent follow-ups was told by the minister that he was no longer going to support it, that it was not really a federal government issue but an issue for the state and for the local council. Why didn't he tell me that back in March when I was putting that motion up?


In that period, I have to say, more graves were lost; more graves were washed out to sea. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, how would anybody in this place, whose mother or father, brother or sister, grandparents or whomever was interred in a cemetery, feel when they went there the next day to visit them to find that they had been washed out to sea, never to be found. Anywhere else in the country it would be absolutely outrageous and the matter would be fixed immediately, but up there, it seems, from this minister's perspective, it really does not matter. Like many other things in Indigenous issues, it is all about the politics. It is not about finding real solutions.


But it is also a very, very stupid decision. There is $1 billion worth of infrastructure on the six affected islands and every year there is a couple of million dollars worth of damage. Yet every year they are prepared to fix up that damage but not to fix the cause of the problem. It is not about climate change, it is not about rising sea levels, it is about failing, ageing, 50-year-old infrastructure. That is the problem, and it is easily fixed. It is a $22 million to $24 million fix. This government can find $240 million to give to the UN to give to micro-Pacific nations to address issues pertaining to climate change. They can give that money—$240 million; it is not much when you say it fast—to these countries to build their sea walls. But they will not give $22 million to fix a small Pacific community that just happens to be in Australia. You have to pose the statement: maybe it is about buying a place on the UN for a thorn in this government's side, rather than trying to address the genuine issues that are facing this community every year. We are right on the front line of Papua New Guinea. A couple of kilometres away there is tuberculosis, HIV, meningitis, Japanese encephalitis, cholera. I recently came back from Daru, and when you walk past the cemetery you see grave after grave of people that have just died of cholera. You understand just how real it is, but this mob down here does not give a damn. 


More recently the RDA funding came out—this is the second round we have had—and the only money to be given north of Mackay was $5 million that was going to the sea walls in the Torres Strait. Lo and behold: $5 million for a $24-million fix. That is the only RDA money that was given over two rounds, and that $5 million is for a $24-million job. They go up there—Senator McLucas, Minister Macklin, Minister Crean—patting themselves on the back and saying: 'Hallelujah, we've found a solution, but there is a catch. We are going to put another $7 million in, but we don't know where we are going to find that yet. But the whole lot—the whole $12 million or so that we are going to put up—is conditional on the state government finding the money.' 


Now we know that the Bligh government left the Campbell Newman state government with a debt that is going to rise to $100 billion. Where are they going to suddenly draw $12 million out to put in there for something that should have been fixed by this government several years ago? This is a problem that has been going on now for six years. It is all smoke and mirrors. You have people up there in the community thinking, 'Wow, it is going to happen.' I have news for them—it is not going to happen. The reason that they did it this way is that it is a guaranteed way that they do not spend a cracker. I was talking to Ron Enosa, the chairman of the Saibai community. He knows that it is a lie. He knows that it is not going to happen. He is bitterly disappointed. 


I was talking to Fred Gela, the Chair of the Torres Strait Island Regional Council, only yesterday. He said, 'I would love to give them the benefit of the doubt, but the more I speak to them, the more I realise that this is never going to be a reality, because $5 million is not going to fix it and it is conditional on the state government putting $12 million up that they do not have and they did not budget for, and another $7 million that is going to materialise out of thin air; Simon Crean has not yet decided where it is going to come from.' It really made me wonder if the criteria for being a cabinet minister in this government is the ability to continue to mislead the Australian public, the same as the Prime Minister has done— 




Mr Perrett:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I would ask the member for Leichhardt to withdraw that suggestion about the cabinet. I find it unparliamentary and offensive.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  The member for Leichhardt, to assist the chamber—




Mr ENTSCH:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I also find it unparliamentary and offensive that—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Leichhardt will resume his seat. The member for Leichhardt will withdraw that statement for the resumption of the debate to take place.




Mr Entsch:
  I withdraw, but I find it offensive that I was promised—call it what you like—in March that Simon Crean, the minister, would support it. It took till August. I complied 100 percent and it took till August, and the government came out and voted and supported it. There was no argument about it. Now we find, almost a year later, that we are no closer to having it happen. What they have done is totally inappropriate. They have definitely misled me. There is no question about it. They have misled me and they have misled the Torres Strait people, who are sitting there waiting for the next king tide, which is in a couple of months time, when more of the cemetery is going to be washed away and more of their ancestors are going to disappear into the sea. More infrastructure is going to be destroyed, and it is going to raise the risk of cholera, dysentery, meningitis and Japanese encephalitis. 


It is a cruel hoax. It is a disgusting trick on the Torres Strait people. The minister and this government should stand condemned for their appalling treatment of these people in their deliberate attempts to avoid, in any way they can, fulfilling their obligations and responsibilities. These people are Australians. They may live in the Torres Strait, but they are very, very proud Australians and they are entitled to have a government that steps up to its responsibilities and takes the appropriate action to ensure that they have security of their own communities.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (11:10):  I rise to oppose the member for Leichhardt's motion on the flooding of communities in the Torres Strait. My electorate is a long way away from the Torres Strait, and I would particularly like to acknowledge the passion of the member for Leichhardt about this topic. I know he has got credibility and the respect of his community for representing the needs of his constituents. However, I will point out a couple of things in response to his speech. This problem did not begin on election night 24 November 2007—as the member for Leichhardt acknowledged. He indicated that it had been a problem confronted by the Howard government beforehand. He said that it had been going on for six years, and obviously we have only been in power for less than five years. So this has been an ongoing issue for a long time. It did not commence on 24 November 2007. That is the first thing that anyone with common sense would understand.


There is another thing that we need to understand—and I say this with a little bit of knowledge, as the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs; and I note that the member for Bonner is in the chamber. We have a bit of familiarity with the Constitution. When I look through the Constitution, I cannot see a reference to the Commonwealth government having responsibility for local graves. That is not in any way to take away from the heartbreak that it must be to experience the graves of your ancestors and loved ones being washed out to sea. I am not in any way minimising the heartache that is associated with that. But, when I read the Constitution, I cannot find a Commonwealth constitutional head of power to look after every single grave in Australia. For Commonwealth war graves, whether they be in Gaza or Thailand or Flanders, we do have a responsibility. However, the 720 local councils in Australia have a responsibility to look after their local graves. That is the first bit of law that I am sure the member for Leichhardt would agree with.


I remind the member opposite that there is actually another level of government between the local government and the Commonwealth government, and that is the state government. The Queensland state government has some additional oversight over local governments and their ability to look after the tasks that they do. As the member knows, with the DOGIT lands in his part of the world, state government and local government interaction is much closer than the interaction between the Commonwealth government and local government. These are some of the facts that we need to get out there.


The member for Leichhardt seemed a little bit ungrateful about the federal government's announcement of $12 million to help fund coastal protection works in the Torres Strait, but it seemed to be more about the delivery rather than the actual policy. This is a complex issue that has required extensive consultation. I am not shying away from the Commonwealth responsibility for that. It has been part of the Labor Party's responsibility since election night 2007. But, I am sure if I look through the member for Leichhardt's webpage, I will see his great press releases commending the Labor government for delivering for the Torres Strait Islander community in all those other areas.



Mr Entsch interjecting—




Mr PERRETT:
  I will take that interjection that, no, I will not! The member for Leichhardt said: 'It is all about the politics, not about finding solutions.' They were his words. He said that the cause of the problem has nothing to do with climate change. I also think he seemed to be drifting away from the bipartisan support of the parliament for our aid policy in looking after Pacific nations. I am not sure if that was a frolic of his own or a new departure in foreign policy. I will have to explore that later. 


The reality is that the Labor government has invested $12 million through this $5 million grant to the Torres Strait Island Regional Council because we know that the Torres Strait has particular problems with their funding base. The nation turned its eyes to the Torres Strait recently on the 20th anniversary of Mabo. We looked at the member for Leichardt's area and the contribution that people there have made. We know about the connection of Torres Strait Islander communities to their land and how, from that, the High Court was able to extrapolate that the mainland Indigenous community also has a longstanding commitment to their land. The $12 million investment will be provided to the Torres Strait Island Regional Council and the Torres Strait Regional Authority to work in partnership to deliver seawalls in six island communities and repair the damaged infrastructure. As Commonwealth parliamentarians we well know that the local government area is where the rubber meets the road, where the shovel meets the road. The local people know the concerns of their community, and the opposition's suggestion that climate change has not had an impact on rising sea levels flies in the face of 99.9 per cent of scientists. Most right-thinking people understand. They can see the tracking. If we look at the Keeling curve and the rise in parts per million of CO2 recorded scientifically around the world, we know that there is a greater cause and that it did not somehow, magically, become a problem on 24 November 2007.


On this side of the House we are a lot more serious about taking out the politics and finding the solutions. We are investing $200 million in projects right across Australia in the second stage of a five-year regional funding program. In Queensland alone, eight projects have been funded under the RDAF round 2, with the Australian government contributing $33.67 million to projects worth more than $134 million. I note the member for Leichardt stood up and said—I assume with some authority, after consultation with his state member and his LNP premier—that the Queensland state government would not give a single dollar to this project. I am not sure whether that was what he was suggesting and whether he had the authority to say that the state government will not match the Commonwealth. Or was he saying that it is too hard? I thought the member for Leichardt had been meeting with Premier Newman. I wish he had talked about his meetings with Premier Newman to request that the Queensland government match the federal government's contribution of $12 million to build seawalls in the Torres Strait. I would hate to remind the member for Leichardt that if Premier Newman cannot even commit to protecting permanent workers in the Australian government after the election, as he did before the election, he might shy away from committing any funding to protect seawalls in the Torres Strait. I ask all Queensland federal members of the LNP to call on Premier Newman to match this $12 million funding commitment by the federal government and to make a commitment to provide coastal infrastructure to protect people in the Torres Strait from destructive tides. Premier Newman has been the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, but I hope he will be the Premier for all of Queensland and make sure that we are looking after these people, who are a long way away from George Street.


The member for Leichardt is very proficient in describing problems, but I would suggest that he is not necessarily being part of the solution. I seem to recall that he was the member of parliament responsible for the Torres Strait for about 12 years. I do not think that these tides magically appeared at midnight on 24 November 2007. If we go back to 3 March 1996, when he became responsible for the Torres Strait, the reality is that king tides were starting to become a problem even then.




Mr Entsch:
  No, they weren't!




Mr PERRETT:
  I am sorry; I disagree. I did not realise that the moon changed its orbit on 24 November 2007. When it comes to addressing the hard issues, the Leader of the Opposition says that he cannot fix anything. Things like the Murray-Darling Basin are complicated processes and you need people to sit down to discuss them. This is another classic example of where we can get all three levels of government on the same page and take the politics out of it. The member for Leichardt said it is all about politics and not about finding solutions. I think it will be best resolved if we can sit down together. The reality is there is a rates base in the Torres Strait that is not able to fund all of these issues.




Mr Entsch:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The honourable member made a comment which is blatantly untrue. The reality of the situation is that in the 2002 election—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  The member for Leichhardt will resume his seat. There are ample opportunities to statements corrected in this place. Now is not the time to do it. The member for Moreton.




Mr PERRETT:
  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I would remind the member for Leichhardt that there was no election in 2002 federally.




Mr Entsch:
  2010.




Mr PERRETT:
  Obviously the member for Leichhardt will be able to make a substantive motion later today in terms that the cabinet has misled him. There is an opportunity for him to move that substantive motion and we will see whether this motion is all about the politics or whether it is actually about achieving solutions. I know that Simon Crean's door would always be open to him to achieve real change. (Time expired)

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (11:21):  I rise to support this motion relating to Torres Strait communities brought before this House by my friend and colleague the member for Leichhardt. It is with some sadness that I speak on this today as this motion has been before the House before and has had bipartisan support, but what we have here is a fundamental breach of faith. I have a great deal of time for the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, but he has let down the very people about whom he should be most concerned. As the member for Leichhardt has already stated, there are six Torres Strait islands heavily affected by king tides, particularly over the last four years. These king tides inundate the low-lying islands which causes roads to flood and we see seawater through houses, businesses and even cemeteries. The cost to repair the seawalls that exist to protect these assets and infrastructure and personal spaces from flooding has been estimated at between $22 million and $24 million.


The minister backflipped on the government's support for Mr Entsch's 2011 motion stating that it was the responsibility of the Torres Strait Island Regional Council and the Queensland government to fund and that it was not appropriate for it to be paid for from the Regional Development Australia Fund, or RDAF. If that was not bad enough, Minister Crean backflipped again, allocating $5 million for the project through the RDAF this month. So the previous speaker saying that there are not constitutional grounds for the federal government to do this would seem to fly in the face of what the government has actually done. That there is no plan in place for the other $17 million to $19 million beggars belief. They have stated that there should be $12 million from the state government, which has never been involved in this process, and do not even outline where the other $5 million in funding will be found. Perhaps if the Torres Strait islands were declared an independent nation our government would be all over them, like it was 102 degrees in the shade and they were prickly heat, to give them the money.


Our government will spend more than $160 million over five years in funding especially to help the Pacific island nations deal with the impacts of climate change and rising sea levels, yet if you are an Australian citizen this government will walk away from you. What do the people of the Torres Strait do here? Australia's full aid budget for East Asia and the Pacific in 2012-13 is $2.5 billion, and yet we cannot support these people at home for $22 million to $24 million. For that I say: shame on this government. This government always talks a good game when it comes to Aboriginal and Islander affairs, but at every turn it walks away from commitments and opportunities to show that very support, be it in public housing on Palm Island or help in the brave efforts of the community radio station 4K1G to keep an Aboriginal voice over a huge part of North Queensland and Cape York. It is true to form at every turn. The problem with this government is that every time there is an opportunity to do something it simply rolls out the platitudes and starts conversations recognising the traditional owners and then walks away thinking the job has been done. From the first Australians of my electorate and on behalf of those people in the Torres Strait who have been left behind by this government's platitudes, I say, 'Thanks for nothing.'


I will digress to give an example. On Palm Island we build houses not much bigger than a garden shed at a cost of over $600,000. And we build them with the toilet pan below the waterline so they cannot be flushed properly and are therefore uninhabitable. There is no use of the licensed builder and the five licensed plumbers and electricians or even of unskilled labour from the island's residents. The end result could have been so different, but I still have houses on Palm with over 20 inhabitants and that is no good for anyone.


With 4K1G, you will see every manner of government minister ringing Lloydy Wiles to get their message across; but when they receive a call from the station that they are struggling with cash flow but are asset rich, they disappear. They disappear even though you have the Attorney-General, the Minister for Aboriginal and Islander Affairs, and the minister for communications physically in Townsville for the best part of a week. And yet they cannot spare 4K1G 20 minutes for a meeting. Instead they send a staffer along to tell them which government departments they could possibly write to. It simply is not good enough to come in here and sprout a good game; we must actually do something and have an ability to get behind this thing to fix the things in the Torres Strait and to show the people at home that we actually care about them: the people in the Torres Strait who are without the services and the people in the Torres Strait who are being inundated by health concerns from Papua New Guinea. The people of the Torres Strait are citizens of Australia and deserve better than not having a $22 million wall replaced and not funded. That the government—the member for Moreton—can sit there and say that it is not in the constitution beggars belief. It absolutely beggars belief, and it is pretty much chump change to the people of the Torres Strait.


I call on the government to back this motion and actually deliver for the Torres Strait.

"Saffin, Janelle, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Ms SAFFIN
 (Page) (11:26):  Sitting here listening to the contribution from the honourable member for Herbert, you would think that there was nothing happening. I am sure they have either deliberately or mistakenly not read what is happening. The motion itself is actually redundant, if it was ever needed, because all of the work was actually going on, and it was clear there was a commitment from the Australian government—from the Labor government—to fund and support the Torres Strait Islanders from the severe flooding that they experience.


There has been a $12 million allocation of funds—but I will come to that. If the motion actually took out things like 'condemns the minister'—because it has been the minister and the senator for Queensland, the Hon. Jan McLucas, who have been doing a lot of work on this with locals and with local authorities—then it is something I could get up and speak in support of. But as it is, there is no way that I could give support to it because it is just simply put there as an attack. It is easy to do that; it is easy to put words on paper and it is easy to come in here, speak big and act as though nothing is happening when in fact the opposite is true. Talk about trying to alter reality to fit your perceived political notions of the world!


I would recommend that all the speakers here reflect on the importance of the work being done in the Torres Strait and right across the country—particularly through the Regional Development Australia Fund. Many members would have seen that there was RDAF round 1 and RDAF round 2, which has just been announced across Australia, and quite a lot of members would have seen wonderful projects get up in their area. I will come to my electorate of Page, where a great project got up under Regional Development Australia Fund 2—I had the Minister for Regional Development and Local Government in my electorate, announcing that in conjunction with Ballina Shire Council—but this motion is directed to Queensland.


Some of the things I want to put on the record here that are important with this nonsense motion is that two weeks ago the ministers for Indigenous affairs and for regional Australia, and senator for Queensland, Jan McLucas, announced up to $2 million to help fund coastal protection works in the Torres Strait. I am told that we are still waiting to hear from the Queensland government what they are going to announce and what their contribution would be. Also, if this motion included talking about the Queensland government and what they could do, it would have more integrity—and it does not. It is a glaring omission. The $12 million funding I just referred to includes a $5 million grant to the Torres Strait Island Regional Council from round 2 of the Regional Development Australia Fund and up to $7 million in additional funding. It shows that the government is doing all that it can to support the local council, the regional authority, the communities and people living on the islands to protect their homes. I acknowledge the strong advocacy and support provided by Senator Jan McLucas from Queensland. From her Cairns base, she has travelled many times to Torres Strait to work towards finding a workable funding solution to address the community need. That is what local members or senators with a particular interest in an area do—we work to find solutions. We do not just come in here, throw a few words down on paper, have a bit of a dummy-spit in the chamber and then walk out and say, 'Job done,' before putting out a media release saying, 'Am I not wonderful?' That is how I read this motion from the member for Leichhardt. You can come in here and describe a problem, but it is more difficult to actually put up part of the solution. I come back the point that the Queensland government must surely have a role in this and that it should come to the party.


Earlier, I mentioned the biochar project in my area. It is an $8½ million project being funded to the tune of $4.3 million under RDAF round 2 and being run through Ballina Shire Council. This project is a first in Australia and it is something the shire council have worked on for a number of years. There has been a huge amount of work done in the community, which has provided great support. As a result, when the grant came through, all the groundwork was done—they are ready to roll. This project means that they will be doing their bit to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as saving money.

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (11:31):  I stand to support the motion of the member for Leichhardt on the flooding of communities in the Torres Strait. I commend the member for the determination and passion he has shown in bringing this issue to the attention of the House. I know Western Australia is a long way away from the Torres Strait, but, as the member for Shortland and the member for Hindmarsh would recall, we visited the Torres Strait Islands back in 2010 and ran a health inquiry up there. We saw some of the degradation of the islands while we were there.


During the last sitting, I spoke in this place about the importance of maintaining river walls in my own electorate of Swan. My electorate shares a large section of its boundary with the Swan River and I understand the importance of river walls in maintaining the foreshore and protecting existing infrastructure along the river. Despite several requests, local councils—a group of 21 of them—have received no support from the federal government in dealing with the logistical and financial challenge of maintaining this critical infrastructure. As those affected in the Torres Strait well know, this is not a problem that can just be tucked under the rug by this government. With every delay in action, the problem becomes worse and the solution more expensive to implement. 


As I said, the member for Leichhardt showed considerable passion in his speech, during which he said that this is about fixing the problem and not blaming local or state governments—which is just what the member for Moreton, who followed the member for Leichhardt, did in his speech. He started going back to the blame game, something this government promised years ago it would not indulge in. 


Just yesterday, we read about the latest example of reckless waste by this government, with the Sunday Telegraphwebsite and Tim Andrews from the Australian Taxpayers Alliance describing the $3.27 million blown by jet-setting bureaucrats at the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. In the last year alone, officials from the department racked up more than 6.5 million kilometres of travel, producing 1,000 tonnes of carbon emissions, while going to talkfests about the warming planet in locations such as the Maldives, Vanuatu and the Caribbean. This extravagant travel expenditure is just one more in a long line of examples of wasteful spending by this government—wasteful spending being incurred whilst critical projects are being neglected. Officials appear to have significantly less enthusiasm for visiting the affected communities in the Torres Strait than they do for travelling to five-star resorts around the world.


This is behaviour that, unfortunately. we have come to expect from the government. The government is happy to organise summits and committees and send bureaucrats to luxurious talkfests, but, as the member for Leichhardt pointed out, when it comes to the critical task of actually taking action on issues or actually solving problems—even when the solution is as obvious as it is in this case—this government falls short time and again. Simon Crean, the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, made a commitment but reneged on his promise, shifting responsibility to the state and local governments and leaving locals with a commitment from the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency which represents only a small fraction of what is needed to fix the problem. Instead of fixing the problem, the government is content to shift responsibility while the locals continue to suffer from flooding events and resulting damage. I note that while local council applications in my electorate are rejected and the damage bill to coastal infrastructure in the Torres Strait continues to mount, this government has spent over $328 million on international climate change initiatives to fund upgrades to infrastructure and coastal resilience overseas. That is the real crux of the matter: the government focuses on overseas projects before it focuses on Australian projects. As my colleague the member for Leichhardt has said, Torres Strait Islanders have every right to feel neglected and offended by the government's response. However, I do see hope at the end of the tunnel. The Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change listened to my recent speech on the river walls in Swan. He said that he would be happy to look at the issue and meet with some of the people from those councils, who are in Canberra at the moment, including the Mayor of the City of South Perth, Sue Doherty. He has said on a couple of occasions that he will make himself available. I applaud him for giving consideration to meet with the people who have been putting in submissions for river wall projects on the Swan River. I will finish by again stating my support for the Torres Strait Islanders. I support the member for Leichhardt. The huge commitments overseas should be matched in Australia.

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (11:36):  I rise to talk about this motion and to note the differences between those opposite and we as a Labor government in our understandings of what leadership means. The Labor government wants to make sure that we lead in the local regions. As a Labor government, when we see a problem we get on with the job and move towards a solution. We see in this motion that is before the chamber today the classic strategy of the Liberal Party and the National Party: describing a problem, whinging about the problem, whinging about any offer of a solution to the problem and continuing in that same vein indefinitely. We have seen incredible, aggressive negativity from those opposite, with the Leader of the Opposition as the leader of those who oppose everything in more ways than one.


The reality is that the issue of the management of the sea wall in Queensland is one that the Labor Party is very much dealing with. I want to acknowledge in particular the work of Senator Jan McLucas, who has announced $12 million help fund the coastal protection works in the Torres Strait Islands. We know that she is a passionate advocate for her state of Queensland. Obviously, I believe that New South Wales is and always will be the premier state. But while I take my responsibility as a representative in the national parliament seriously, I am happy to be pleased at the success of others in making sure that those who need assistance receive it. We understand that sea walls and other coastal management measures are vital to this nation and particularly to the vulnerable Torres Strait Island communities in their battle against king tides. That is why our commitment to this region through this $12 million is a very significant one.


The question is now whether Mr Entsch will approach his Liberal-National Party colleagues in Queensland and get them to get on with the job of pulling their weight. We know that they have the classic capacity to whinge, but what are they going to do? When are they going to put some money towards meeting the needs of the community? When are they going to get on with addressing the hard issues? When are they going to address the material threats facing the people of the Torres Strait Islands?


In the time that is remaining, I want to speak about Labor's commitment to the regions through the vehicle of our regional development authorities. In my own region, I want to acknowledge the former head of my RDA, John Dawson, and his CEO, Anthony Dow. They were instrumental in helping us achieve success in our bid for funds in the first round of grants from the Regional Development Australia Fund. That round provided $890,000 for my local community. I am pleased to say that it added to the over $1 million gathered by the local community.


This money has gone to the coast community centre, a vital piece of infrastructure. This refurbishment means that this centre is going to be able to function much more effectively, offering assistance to those most in need. The new premises are expected to be opened before the end of this year, on time and on budget. The centre will then have the capacity to offer meals, shower and laundry facilities and food parcels. It will provide a community meeting room and a conference room and there be a site to make referrals for people who need help in getting that sort of advantage. It is obviously a critical piece of infrastructure in terms of building the capacity and developing the confidence of individuals. It would not have been able to be delivered under the regional rorts system that was run under the Howard government. This was a transparent process. The best bid went forward. This will have a profound and positive impact in my area, again showing Labor's leadership in getting on with the job. I am also pleased to put on the record that in the second round we were successful in getting $2.5 million in funding for the Narara Valley sporting precinct. I want to acknowledge the leadership of the new chair of our board, Dave Abrahams, and his very hardworking assistant and CEO, Andrew Roach, who made sure that we put in a fantastic bid. We have matching community funding for this money from the federal government. This $2.5 million is for a project worth $5.18 million. This project will incorporate the construction of new sporting fields, floodlighting and recreational facilities, bringing a much-needed capacity to our area. (Time expired)

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (11:41):  I rise today to speak on this very important private member's motion. I thank the member for Leichhardt for his ongoing dedication to ensuring that the sea walls in the Torres Strait Islands are maintained. There are six particular islands in the Torres Strait Regional Council area which every year are heavily affected by king tides, the islands of Saibai, Boigu, Masig, Iama, Warraber and Poruma. These islands are some of the worst hit in the world. The king tides inundate roads, homes and businesses and, in a further blow to the local communities, its cemeteries. The Torres Strait Island Regional Council commissioned a report which showed that at least $22 million is required to rebuild the sea walls in the region. On that issue, the government and the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, the member for Hotham, have not done enough. Frankly, the locals are fed up.


On 18 August 2011, this House passed with bipartisan support a motion proposed by the member for Leichhardt. This motion called on the government to commit to restore and rebuild the damaged sea walls on the outer islands of the Torres Strait. On that date, the government publicly committed itself to providing funds and the Torres Strait community took that undertaking in good faith. They were excited that there would be action—until November 2011, when the minister reneged on his promise, claiming that the issue was suddenly one for which state governments and local councils should be responsible. The minister's most recent announcement, which was on 4 June 2012, was yet another example of this government pronouncing that they are going to fund an important cause and take action on it while carefully leaving out critical details, such that the so-called funding will not be directed to where it is needed most.


The member for Leichhardt noted that the announced $5 million is a cruel hoax. Firstly, as we all know, that is simply not enough funding to adequately address the issue of the failing sea walls. They do not know where the other $7 million will come from. On top of that, the minister said that the Queensland state government has to put in $12 million as well. Perhaps if the minister visited my home state more often he would understand that after 20 years of the Australian Labor Party there is no money left. As former federal Treasurer Peter Costello advised last Friday, Labor sent Queensland almost bankrupt. It is now not in a position to commit to funding this. The Labor government did nothing in their 20 years. The federal government must recommit itself to fixing this problem now and deliver real solutions.


Yesterday, I spoke to the Mayor of the Torres Strait Island Regional Council, Mr Fred Gela. Fred was locally born and educated and is passionate about the future of the Torres Strait Islands and surrounding areas. As the mayor—he is in his second term—he highlighted to me the absolute urgency of getting funding to restore the dilapidated sea walls. The situation is so serious that Fred has previously pleaded with the Prime Minister, unfortunately to no avail, for adequate funding, saying that if it is not given Torres Strait Islanders could become displaced refugees. Therefore, I speak today because it is an important opportunity to remind the government that they are overseeing serious failures in this policy area, and in many others. The minister's announcements in June came days after the member for Leichhardt tabled this motion. So I am pleased that the coalition has been able to finally pressure the government into acting, even if their announcement was insufficient. 


I would also like to thank Mr Fred Gela as well as Mr Ron Saisa, the Torres Strait Regional Authority member for Saibai Island. While Ministers Crean, Macklin and McLucas have made various announcements taking credit for issues in the region, the only two people, as the member for Leichhardt has mentioned, who should receive credit and acknowledgement are Fred and Ron. They are to be commended on their hard work and dedication, and their advocacy for land and sea matters in the region. This motion calls on the government to provide funding and further investigate remediation works for the affected seawalls. I remind the government that people in the Torres Strait Islands region need to see action. They need action now not weasel words, and we need to see action quickly.

Ms LIVERMORE
 (Capricornia) (11:45):  I think I might have come into debate the wrong motion because I thought it was about the Torres Strait Islands seawalls and remediation works that are needed to combat serious erosion and inundation—the same seawalls that the government have provided $12 million for in the last couple of weeks. In fact, we are now calling on the member for Ryan's colleagues in the LNP government in Queensland to match that funding and come on board, and be part of the solution, not continue to carp about the problem. I might also point out that, while the member for Ryan and others on her side of the debate are right to point out the very proactive approach of the Torres Strait Regional Authority and the Torres Strait Regional Council on this very important matter, the submission by the Torres Strait Regional Authority to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts inquiry into the effects of climate change on coastal communities pointed out that it was in fact the Queensland Labor Senator Jan McLucas who made a very impassioned plea back on 10 October 2006 to the former Howard government to take action on this issue. So I just point that out to members opposite, and I now return to the motion. 


I was driving through my electorate a couple of weeks ago back from a terrific event at St Lawrence when I heard a report on the radio of the projects that were to be funded under this latest round of Regional Development funding. While I was a little disappointed that a project I was very supportive of in my own electorate had not been funded this time around, I was absolutely thrilled to hear that such a significant amount of funding was being made available to the Torres Strait Regional Authority. I mentioned the inquiry back in 2008 and 2009 when our climate change committee looked at the problems facing coastal communities, and in this case particularly Indigenous communities facing the impacts of climate change and possible sea level rise, and we heard at some length from the Torres Strait Regional Authority about the very serious issue of coastal inundation and erosion in all of the Torres Strait Islands. Six in particular were identified in their evidence. The Torres Strait Regional Authority did a terrific job of putting their case and outlining the extent of the problem, and urging remedial action. The government have come forward with $12 million towards this program of works. It is estimated that the entire program to safeguard those islands would come to $24 million, but any fair-minded person would recognise that $12 million pledged by the federal government is making a very serious attempt to play a positive role in addressing these problems. The $12 million will go to rebuilding or building seawalls and wave return walls, particularly on the most vulnerable islands of Boigu and Saibai. They were amongst the six islands that the Torres Strait Regional Authority described in evidence to our climate change committee. There has already been some significant damage to those islands. What comes up most often is the damage that has been suffered by the cemetery and to marine facilities on those islands. These seawalls will go a long way to reassuring the residents of the islands that they can continue to live safely and securely and that their community assets and their cultural heritage will be protected.


It is an example of how regional funding from this government can be made available to communities to meet their priorities. I call on the LNP government in Queensland to match this funding as a matter of priority. (Time expired)

Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (11:51):  It is a great pleasure to rise for the second time in this 43rd Parliament to support a motion on this issue by my very good friend and colleague, the Chief Opposition Whip and member for Leichhardt. The member's passion and interest in this problem cannot be doubted. I congratulate him on the way he represents his constituents in this place, particularly those that reside in the Torres Strait.


Of course, we are here debating the rebuilding of seawalls on the two Torres Strait Islands of Saibai and Boigu. This is a terrible story that has been going on for four years. My colleagues have comprehensively covered the background of this issue. Effectively, the seawalls that protect the villages on these mud islands have deteriorated to the extent that, when the king tides occur, intense flooding occurs and the communities get severely damaged. The member for Leichhardt has previously relayed terrible stories in this House about graves in cemeteries in Saibai getting washed out into the ocean after the terrible flooding. It is a tragedy that in the 21st century in Australia we are still seeing instances like this.


I also take intense interest in matters pertaining to the Torres Strait, particularly as they relate to my shadow portfolio areas of international development assistance. I have been working with the member for Leichhardt on issues relating to AusAID funding for tuberculosis treatment for PNG nationals, which affects the people who reside in the Torres Strait Islands. The Torres Strait Island Regional Council Mayor Fred Gela put out a press release on 1 February this year which said:


Mayor Gela said that Warren Entsch’s achievement was great in gaining Federal support when the Private Members motion received bipartisanship in regards to funding the restoration and construction of seawalls in our affected communities, only to be advised by the Federal government that it was State’s obligation to fund such issues.


""Stop passing the buck between Federal and State Government,"" Cr. Gela said.


""We are all Australians and we are calling upon the Federal Government to put their money where their mouth is.


""They supported the private members bill, so it is in fact their responsibility to determine how and where the funds will come from.


Then surprise, surprise, after Minister Crean reneged on a commitment—after the Labor Party supported the private members' bill—the member for Leichhardt put this motion on the Notice Paper and, guess what, the federal government announced some funding. This announcement came just a few days after the member tabled the motion but, again like so much of what this government does, there is a twist. There is always a twist. You can never take an announcement by this government on any face value.


The announcement—and I have the press release in front of me—was made that the government would commit $5 million from the Regional Development Australia Fund plus up to $7 million in additional funding, which apparently comes out of thin air because nobody knows where that $7 million is coming from. If they were genuine they would announce $12 million, straight and upfront, for the Torres Strait coming under the Regional Development Australia Fund. But now there is a catch, and there is always a catch. The Queensland government must match it with $12 million worth of contribution. What a sneaky, underhanded way of saying that you are going to provide funding. This government knows full well that the Queensland government has been left in a financially unviable state by the former Labor government. The incoming Treasury brief to the Newman government stated that the levels of spending and borrowing were unsustainable. Then we have seen the interim report of the Commission of Audit, headed by my distinguished former colleague Peter Costello, which has revealed the Queensland government debt—



Mr Neumann interjecting—




Ms GAMBARO:
  You don't like the word 'debt'; it really upsets you. The debt is $100 billion. Let me repeat that: $100 billion. You hate that word 'debt'. Well, your previous state government colleagues put us in this situation, yet this government makes an announcement that it is dependent and hinges on the funding by the state government. As the member for Leichhardt said, this is a cruel hoax.



Mr Neumann interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Rishworth
):  Order! There will be less interjection.




Ms GAMBARO:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. That was very timely. As the member for Leichhardt says, this is a cruel hoax. It is smoke and mirrors, and every federal Labor member from the great state of Queensland should hang their head in shame for the damage that their party is doing to our great state. I fully support the member for Leichhardt, and I fully congratulate him for his tireless efforts, for his never-ending work and particularly for putting this motion. I commend the motion to the House.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (11:56):  This federal Labor government has committed $33.6 million across eight projects with a value of more than $134 million in my state of Queensland. We have done that, and there are a number of projects, two in my electorate. The Somerset Regional Council received a second round of funding of $500,000 towards a $1 million Kilcoy Showgrounds facility development, and the Ipswich City Council received $5 million towards the $15 million Robelle Domain stage 2 parkland development.


I also noticed $5 million going to the Torres Strait Island Regional Council towards the $24 million Torres Strait coastal protection works. I then decided to have a look at the application and what the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government Arts and Sport said on their project fact sheet, which I would like those opposite to have a bit of a look at from time to time, because it talks about the Torres Strait coastal protection works helping to protect low-lying island communities in the Torres Strait from destructive coastal erosion. Then there is the matter of how the project will be funded. The application was made by the Torres Strait Island Regional Council, which asked for $5 million from the federal government and made the point that they could leverage a further $19 million in partnership funding. That is what they said, and the project was to be completed by 30 June 2015. We have come up with $12 million: there is $5 million from Regional Development Australia, and Senator Jan McLucas announced up to $12 million to help fund coastal protection works in the Torres Strait.


I have heard those opposite from Queensland waxing lyrical about the member for Leichhardt, but the Regional Development Australia fund and the money we are rolling out—over $1 billion—is funded under the minerals resource rent tax. Every member opposite, including the member for Leichhardt, voted against that legislation, which provides the funding source from which we have given money to the Torres Strait council in relation to this particular Torres Strait coastal protection work. So the member for Leichhardt really has a gall to come into this chamber and say to us that we should be providing all this money when he and all those opposite voted against the very $5 million that is being funded under the Regional Development Australia fund, opposing every last dollar and cent for the Torres Strait coastal protection works.


They are not acknowledging the fact that the Torres Strait Island Regional Council actually put a proposal to the federal government asking for the $5 million. Those opposite say we should be providing $24 million. There is no recognition of the fact that their government—the LNP state government—has not put a brass razoo towards this project, or of the fact that the regional council said that they could get partnership leveraging funding assuming that they could get some money from the LNP state government, as we expected. But no; the LNP state government have just gutted road funding, by hundreds of millions of dollars. All those members opposite who say that we should be putting more money into infrastructure in Queensland should take note of the fact that their state colleagues are gutting road and infrastructure funding in Queensland.


We called on them to put the $12 million into this project in the Torres Strait at the same time as we have doubled funding for infrastructure in Queensland: $8.5 billion for road, rail and port infrastructure. But those opposite not only voted against that in terms of the Regional Development Australia Fund that we are providing for the Torres Strait Island Regional Council they voted against every last dollar and cent that we are putting into Queensland in that regard. If anybody should hang their heads in shame, it should be the member for Leichhardt and all his LNP comrades and colleagues from Queensland, who opposed this funding.


We are happy to work and provide funding for regional Australia and the Torres Strait to take action in relation to the damaging effects of climate change in the Torres Strait and all of Queensland. We are prepared to do it. We are partnering with the local councils, whether it is the Somerset Regional Council, the Ipswich City Council or the Torres Strait. Those opposite are opposing every dollar and cent. (Time expired)

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (12:01):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


As we now understand from the report into the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012 by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, which was tabled earlier this morning, the public is ready to do the right thing and remove discrimination from our marriage laws. Sixty-four per cent of the people who responded to the survey conducted by the committee supported this bill, and over a quarter of a million people responded to the survey, the biggest ever response for a House of Representatives inquiry.


The Australian population has moved on. The Australian population is relaxed about someone marrying the person that they love. But we should support this bill not just because it is popular but because it is right. Love is a powerful force. Love knows no boundaries. It knows no limits. And love knows when it has found its partner. There have been many attempts throughout history to limit love, and all have failed. As we move further into the 21st century, I am confident that attempts to limit love will fail yet again and that full marriage equality will become a reality.


It is important, not just because we can no longer continue to discriminate against people just because of who they love it is also important because who are we in parliament to tell people in this country that the person they love is not someone they can celebrate their love with in front of their friends and in front of their families simply because of their sexuality? That ultimately is the issue. The arguments against this bill ultimately come down to an argument against same-sex-attracted people themselves and their relationships.


It is more than just preserving people's individual rights, though. It is more than giving effect to what the Australian public wants. It is also sending a very, very important message, from this parliament out to the community, that we believe that love is equal. As we speak, there is no doubt a boy in a country town who is working out who he is attracted to; there is a girl at high school who is wanting to invite her partner to the school formal and has been told she cannot do it because her partner is a girl. When we have same-sex-attracted people in this country more than four times as likely to commit suicide and when we know that increases the further out that you get from the cities and into the rural and country areas, then we have an obligation in parliament to send a message to every member of the Australian community that you are valued, and that your love and the person that you choose to spend your life with are just as valuable and just as respected as anyone else's. We need to end the situation where we say that in Australia there are two classes of people and some have greater rights than others. It is time for the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to get out of the way and allow history to take its course and for parliament to give effect to the will of the Australian people. Unfortunately, we have a situation where one side of the parliament, the Labor Party, has a policy in favour of equal marriage but their members are not obliged to vote for it. Given that, and given that we have the Prime Minister, with a group of MPs, opposing change, to see reform in this parliament we are now going to be reliant on coalition members of goodwill. I know that there are members of the coalition who support this change, but we are in the situation where Labor members are able to have a free vote and the coalition, the party of freedom of choice and the party that is, supposedly, about giving its MPs the right to vote as they wish, is restricting its members from voting according to their conscience. This is the party that says that individuals should be able to do as they choose, so long as it does not harm someone else, and that freedom of choice should be paramount. It seems that stops at someone's door and you are not allowed to marry the person that you love. 


I hope that we see reform in this parliament. I will not be pushing this bill to a vote quickly, because at the moment that would fail, but I am confident that in this parliament we can see reform if the Leader of the Opposition allows a conscience vote.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (12:06):  Thank you, Madame Deputy Speaker. I rise to oppose the bill in its entirety. I rise to speak against the bill and to reaffirm my long-held and firm views that marriage is between a man and a woman. I rise also to acknowledge the coalition's view that we will vote on this issue as a matter of policy. We went to the last election with a firm view expressed to the Australian people that we would not be looking to change the definition of marriage and that we believe a marriage is between a man and a woman. More importantly, we believe in holding our election promises and keeping our word. Our word was that we would vote on it as a matter of policy and, despite the remonstrations of the member for Melbourne, we will not be changing our view on that. We will not be altering our view that this is a matter of policy. In line with our firm commitment to the Australian people that we made solemnly at the last election, we will adhere to the view given at the last election and we will vote against this bill and against any bills that seek to achieve the same thing by watering down in any way the fact that marriage is between a man and a woman.


The marriage equality campaign has been driven by elements of our society including—and not the least being—the Greens, of which the member for Melbourne is the deputy leader. That marriage equality campaign has, deceptively, given the public the impression that discrimination still persists in Australian law for same-sex couples. Let me categorically make a statement: it does not exist; there is no discrimination at all. As family law expert Professor Patrick Parkinson said in his submission to the senate inquiry:


In Australia, functional equality has already been achieved.


I am not aware of any legal rights and obligations that arise from marriage that do not also apply to registered same-sex unions, other than the right to call the relationship a marriage. Certainly that is so in federal law. For example, there is complete equality in rights in relation to the division of property and the payment of maintenance on relationship breakdown. The Prime Minister pointed out on Q&Aon Monday, 11 June that there is no practical discrimination against same-sex couples. In 2008 I was here, in the House, and I voted for the removal of 85 laws. That was supported unanimously by both sides of the House and it removed all discrimination against same-sex couples from Commonwealth law. State law was generally ahead of the Commonwealth on this, as a matter of interest, and relationship registers or their equivalents existed in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the ACT to ensure there was no discrimination at a state or territory level. The issue that has been disingenuously pushed in our community—that this is somehow about discrimination—is patently and utterly false. No discrimination currently exists in law against same-sex couples: all have been removed. 


I am equally concerned about the freedom of speech aspects that have been driven by the Greens and others in this campaign for marriage equality. It has been driving a whole range of alternative voices in the debate. There has been public demonisation. People have used a whole range of dreadful labels against the likes of the Australia Christian Lobby and other supporters of marriage. In fact, Victoria's Deputy Chief Psychiatrist, Professor Kuruvilla George, was forced to resign as a commissioner on the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission because he simply participated in a submission to the Senate inquiry which supported retaining the definition of marriage. There were calls by gay activists for tennis great Margaret Court's name to be removed from an arena at the Melbourne Park tennis centre because she disagreed with same-sex marriage. In every jurisdiction where marriage or something able to be described in the law as the 'same as marriage' has been given, this sort of situation has arisen. 


Proponents of marriage equality have tried to assure the church that it will never be forced to provide marriage equality to same-sex couples. Yet Denmark, the first country in the world to recognise civil partnerships for same-sex couples, this month legislated to force the church to provide same-sex weddings. Everything that the Greens have driven out there in the public purveyance in terms of this bill has been wrong. No discrimination exists. Their campaign forcing people to move away from their jobs, forcing views to change because of this, is disingenuous at best. The coalition will not be supporting this bill in its entirety or in its piecemeal.

Mr MURPHY
 (Reid) (12:11):  I rise to speak against the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012. One of the lasting results of second-wave feminism in the 1970s is marriage equality. That term was used to mean equality of the sexes within marriage—something I believe we in this House all support. Some people still think that is what marriage equality means. But this seemingly innocuous term has been hijacked by those who want to redefine marriage to include same-sex couples—for the simple reason that this will maximise support. Most people support marriage and almost everyone supports equality. It sounds so reasonable.


Speaking at the recent Sydney Writers' Festival, early gay-rights activist and author, and now Director of the Institute for Human Security at La Trobe University, Professor Dennis Altman, made some very candid and very revealing points in a panel on same-sex marriage. First, he correctly pointed out that marriage was established to deal with issues related to the procreation of children. Second, he wants the entire Marriage Act to be abolished, saying that marriage sends 'dangerous signals' to people who are not in long-term relationships. Same-sex marriage therefore diminishes the cultural achievement of most gay people, in particular gay men, who are actively non-monogamous and, as Altman said, 'do not need the sanctity of state or church to legitimise their relationship'. He added that same-sex marriage is 'a conservative form of winning respectability'.


Supporting Altman's call to remove the words 'a man and a woman' as a first step to abolishing the Marriage Act, prominent gay writer Masha Gessen attacked those who claim that redefining marriage to include same-sex couples will not diminish the importance of traditional marriage, saying: 'It is a lie to say the institution of marriage won't change … We want to abolish marriage.' Her words confirm my previous speech in this House, when I said redefining marriage would change the meaning of marriage for all Australians. Effectively, it would make marriage meaningless.


Given my public stand that marriage is the union of a man and a woman, I have received much feedback. Some same-sex couples have spoken to me directly of their desire to get married. But other gay individuals, echoing Dennis Altman's view, said they cannot understand how any gay person would want to embrace an unambiguously age-old heterosexual institution. I have found that most of the support for same-sex marriage has come from people who are heterosexual, particularly young people, including teenagers, who have abstract and less developed notions of equality based on inexperience. Some supporters of same-sex marriage were downright abusive and intolerant of my view, and made it clear that they will never vote for me unless I support their view. That is their right, of course, and I do accept this. However, I do not accept that the move to change the Marriage Act to accommodate same-sex couples is a matter of equality or human rights. It is not about equality for all since there has never been marriage equality, as I outlined in detail in my previous speech on this matter. Marriage, in my view, is therefore only possible between two people of the opposite sex. 


Marriage as a legal institution corresponds to the reality of what marriage is: the unique sharing by a man and a woman in all aspects of life. However, the purpose of marriage as a legal institution relates specifically to the distinctive biological possibilities of this union. Some people say, wrongly, that this means couples who do not produce children are not really married. Whether or not children are produced does not change this, as I can attest from my own circumstances on this very day—the 29th anniversary of my marriage to Adriana. Happy anniversary, Honey. 


People who want to redefine marriage claim that this will affect only a small number of Australians. In fact, the opposite is true. The definition of an institution determines the way society relates to that institution. Without children, there is no need for marriage. Marriage serves the public interest by connecting mothers and fathers and their children, and holding biological parents accountable for raising their children. That is the crux of this matter.

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (12:17):  In joining this debate, I do intend to participate in a very respectful and moderate manner, which is the tone that I believe is required in our community on this very sensitive issue. For the record, I support the recognition of legal rights within same-sex relationships, but I do not support proposals to change the Marriage Act. I am also on the public record in the past as having expressed my support for all political parties to actually grant their members a conscience vote on this issue. My view of a conscience vote may be different from some other members, but it is my view that a conscience vote is not that straightforward. I believe that members should examine their own personal views on a topic but also recognise the views of their electorates, and recognise their role, duty and responsibility as members of parliament. 


I think in all good conscience, as a representative of a particular seat, we need to recognise that different electorates have different views on this issue and we need to balance those two issues—our personal views and those of our electorates—and, if there is a conflict, maybe face a tough decision as an individual. I have previously sought the views of my electorate in relation to this issue in a community survey. Like other members, I have received petitions both for and against this topic. My own survey attracted about 700 responses. But I do point out that the survey was self-selecting; it appeared in a newspaper so it should not be regarded as a scientific opinion poll by any stretch. I did receive strong feedback and 64 per cent of respondents to that survey in my electorate were opposed to the same-sex marriage. I am not using that today as a reason to justify my position; I am just putting it out there as a matter of course that different electorates have different views. 


The Gippsland electorate, overall, is opposed to same-sex marriage as it stands today, and they support the current system that is in place. I have received many emails both for and against the topic. The majority of emails from within my electorate have been supportive of my position—that is, to continue with the current system and to oppose to same-sex marriage. But that is not the sole basis of my opposition to the changes to the Marriage Act. I believe that as a matter of political consistency and as a reflection on my own role here and my own personal integrity, it would be inappropriate for me as the member for Gippsland to support any changes in this current term of parliament, because I expressed a view in opposition to same-sex marriage in the lead-up to the last election. Unlike the Prime Minister and her breach of trust in relation to the carbon tax, if I intend to change my position the only fair thing to do for the people of Gippsland would be to take a principled course of action and campaign on that basis in the lead-up to the next election, and then adopt that position in a future parliament, just as the member of the Melbourne has done in his own seat. The member for Melbourne, who has put forward this bill today, to his credit had a principled view. That is his view. He took it to his voters and they voted for him, so I have no grudge to bear against the member for Melbourne for taking his position forward. But the position I took forward—and I will be principled in that position for the people of Gippsland—is to remain in opposition to changes to the Marriage Act.


There is only a short amount of time to examine the issues here today, and I am sure there will be future opportunities to debate this issue, but I want to refer to one area of concern that bothers me in relation to these proposed changes, and that is this issue of retrospectivity. I believe there is an element of retrospectivity in the proposals to change the definition under the Marriage Act, and that is because there are millions of Australian couples today who signed up to marriage under the current definition. If we change the definition of marriage under the Marriage Act, we are fundamentally altering the nature of the contract that they have entered into, so I think there is an element of retrospectivity to this debate and to the legislation that is proposed. I know that for a lot of people that is of no consequence whatsoever, and I acknowledge that. They are completely comfortable with such a change, and that does not affect their definition or their own relationship. But for others in the community this is a very big deal indeed, and they have expressed that opinion to me quite strongly. They signed up for marriage under the current definition, and they believe in the sanctity of that definition and the traditional view of marriage as being between a man and a woman.


I also do not accept the view put forward by others that it is some form of discrimination against same-sex couples to maintain the consistent approach of the current definition and protect the position of couples who have already been married under the existing Marriage Act. I also do not accept the view of some people who have contacted my office, who try to infer that being opposed to same-sex means you are bigoted or homophobic. I do not believe that is a fair assumption to draw. I think it is possible to be opposed to same-sex marriage and still support the urgency of some ongoing efforts, both within my community and more broadly, to work together as a community to support same-sex couples, particularly in regional areas, where younger gay people are over-represented in the incidence of self-harm, mental illness and suicide.


So I will continue to participate in this debate. I believe it is an important debate, and I believe it is critical for members to be very moderate and respectful in their language and not to inflame what can be a very divisive issue in our communities. (Time expired)

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (12:22):   Like many people in this House, I have relatives and friends living in loving, monogamous same-sex relationships, and I respect and love them. They are cherished, and their love should be accepted, honoured and understood. I love my sister-in-law Rhonda and her partner, Marion. I have friends like Andrew, Clinton and others. But, respectfully, I do not agree with same-sex marriage. As a member of the Australian Labor Party and this government, I was very pleased to vote for more than 80 pieces of legislative amendment which removed discrimination on issues such as immigration, superannuation and the like—without dissension from those opposite.


There have been many wild and ridiculous claims in relation to these matters, on both sides. For instance, from those more fundamentalist extremists from a religious point of view, there have been some ridiculous claims in relation to polygamy et al. This is simply nonsense. I think they are repugnant and really quite disingenuous in relation to their position. But equally, for those people who have argued that this is solely about marriage equality, I think that that same comment in relation to being disingenuous is also the case. For instance, we do not have a situation in this country where one man can marry one woman and then be married to a second woman. That is bigamy, an offence in Australian law. We have prohibitions on marriage between people in close blood relationships. We also have a situation where we have restrictions on the capacity of children to marry. I think it is a clever marketing ploy. I tip my hat to it, but I think that it is disingenuous to argue that it is solely about marriage equality.


I think that marriage between a man and a woman was in the mind of the framers of the Australian Constitution when they enumerated section 51. It gave the power to the new Commonwealth government to legislate in relation to divorce and marriage. I think there is considerable argument in relation to the capacity of the Commonwealth government to legislate in the area of same-sex marriage.


As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs we saw real dispute on this particular matter with constitutional limits of the Commonwealth government to make laws in this area. In written and oral submissions there were disagreements in relation to this. Ultimately, if the House of Representatives and the Senate pass legislation, I am sure that those constitutional limits will be tested in the High Court. But steeped in history, in religion, in culture and in our law is the concept of the old definition that marriage is between a man and a woman. That cannot be denied. It is part of our history and our tradition going back to ancient times. It is part of English law and Australian law. I do not ever think that the framers of the Constitution thought that the Commonwealth government had the power to deal with this issue.


It has significant repercussions to our society. I believe that a marriage between a man and a women is a fundamental institution of our society. I cast no criticism on those people who find love—no matter how they find it—in adult relationships. I have acted for plenty of people in same-sex relationships when I was a practising lawyer in the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. I know many colleagues from my days as a lawyer who were in same-sex relationships. But fundamentally, before we mess with the concept of marriage held by so many Australians, we need widespread and strong community consensus. We do not have it; therefore, I do not support the bill.

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (12:27):  I too rise to oppose the bill. I understand there have been a number of speakers who have put this view this morning. I think it is very important that opposition to the bill is articulated clearly in this place, because this is a contested issue in our community at this time. I have had very vigorous communication from a large number of members in my community seeking me to stand and defend the current definition of marriage on their behalf. I know that there will be tabling of documents today regarding an inquiry into this bill and data related to that. I can reflect from my own local community that 70 per cent of the people who have communicated with my office on this matter oppose any change to the current definition of marriage.


I would like to also make an observation from conversations with people in my local community. This is often an issue where views that hold to the current definition are ascribed to older people who are somewhat out of touch with the current values and milieu of our society. In fact, the reality is that there are many young people who speak to me as well. There are many people who absolutely applaud the Labor federal government's amendments to legislation in our very first term to ensure equality before the law. The reality is that they accept that, they are proud of that and they absolutely want to go on the record as having no opposition to homosexuality but much the contrary: to be very clear in their support for the current definition of marriage. 


I also want to indicate the large number of submissions that came to the inquiry from the Sikh community, from Uniting Care and also from that great supporter of community social justice, the Salvation Army. I again put on the record my opposition to the bill.


Debate adjourned.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-06-18,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (12:01):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


As we now understand from the report into the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012 by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, which was tabled earlier this morning, the public is ready to do the right thing and remove discrimination from our marriage laws. Sixty-four per cent of the people who responded to the survey conducted by the committee supported this bill, and over a quarter of a million people responded to the survey, the biggest ever response for a House of Representatives inquiry.


The Australian population has moved on. The Australian population is relaxed about someone marrying the person that they love. But we should support this bill not just because it is popular but because it is right. Love is a powerful force. Love knows no boundaries. It knows no limits. And love knows when it has found its partner. There have been many attempts throughout history to limit love, and all have failed. As we move further into the 21st century, I am confident that attempts to limit love will fail yet again and that full marriage equality will become a reality.


It is important, not just because we can no longer continue to discriminate against people just because of who they love it is also important because who are we in parliament to tell people in this country that the person they love is not someone they can celebrate their love with in front of their friends and in front of their families simply because of their sexuality? That ultimately is the issue. The arguments against this bill ultimately come down to an argument against same-sex-attracted people themselves and their relationships.


It is more than just preserving people's individual rights, though. It is more than giving effect to what the Australian public wants. It is also sending a very, very important message, from this parliament out to the community, that we believe that love is equal. As we speak, there is no doubt a boy in a country town who is working out who he is attracted to; there is a girl at high school who is wanting to invite her partner to the school formal and has been told she cannot do it because her partner is a girl. When we have same-sex-attracted people in this country more than four times as likely to commit suicide and when we know that increases the further out that you get from the cities and into the rural and country areas, then we have an obligation in parliament to send a message to every member of the Australian community that you are valued, and that your love and the person that you choose to spend your life with are just as valuable and just as respected as anyone else's. We need to end the situation where we say that in Australia there are two classes of people and some have greater rights than others. It is time for the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to get out of the way and allow history to take its course and for parliament to give effect to the will of the Australian people. Unfortunately, we have a situation where one side of the parliament, the Labor Party, has a policy in favour of equal marriage but their members are not obliged to vote for it. Given that, and given that we have the Prime Minister, with a group of MPs, opposing change, to see reform in this parliament we are now going to be reliant on coalition members of goodwill. I know that there are members of the coalition who support this change, but we are in the situation where Labor members are able to have a free vote and the coalition, the party of freedom of choice and the party that is, supposedly, about giving its MPs the right to vote as they wish, is restricting its members from voting according to their conscience. This is the party that says that individuals should be able to do as they choose, so long as it does not harm someone else, and that freedom of choice should be paramount. It seems that stops at someone's door and you are not allowed to marry the person that you love. 


I hope that we see reform in this parliament. I will not be pushing this bill to a vote quickly, because at the moment that would fail, but I am confident that in this parliament we can see reform if the Leader of the Opposition allows a conscience vote.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (12:06):  Thank you, Madame Deputy Speaker. I rise to oppose the bill in its entirety. I rise to speak against the bill and to reaffirm my long-held and firm views that marriage is between a man and a woman. I rise also to acknowledge the coalition's view that we will vote on this issue as a matter of policy. We went to the last election with a firm view expressed to the Australian people that we would not be looking to change the definition of marriage and that we believe a marriage is between a man and a woman. More importantly, we believe in holding our election promises and keeping our word. Our word was that we would vote on it as a matter of policy and, despite the remonstrations of the member for Melbourne, we will not be changing our view on that. We will not be altering our view that this is a matter of policy. In line with our firm commitment to the Australian people that we made solemnly at the last election, we will adhere to the view given at the last election and we will vote against this bill and against any bills that seek to achieve the same thing by watering down in any way the fact that marriage is between a man and a woman.


The marriage equality campaign has been driven by elements of our society including—and not the least being—the Greens, of which the member for Melbourne is the deputy leader. That marriage equality campaign has, deceptively, given the public the impression that discrimination still persists in Australian law for same-sex couples. Let me categorically make a statement: it does not exist; there is no discrimination at all. As family law expert Professor Patrick Parkinson said in his submission to the senate inquiry:


In Australia, functional equality has already been achieved.


I am not aware of any legal rights and obligations that arise from marriage that do not also apply to registered same-sex unions, other than the right to call the relationship a marriage. Certainly that is so in federal law. For example, there is complete equality in rights in relation to the division of property and the payment of maintenance on relationship breakdown. The Prime Minister pointed out on Q&Aon Monday, 11 June that there is no practical discrimination against same-sex couples. In 2008 I was here, in the House, and I voted for the removal of 85 laws. That was supported unanimously by both sides of the House and it removed all discrimination against same-sex couples from Commonwealth law. State law was generally ahead of the Commonwealth on this, as a matter of interest, and relationship registers or their equivalents existed in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the ACT to ensure there was no discrimination at a state or territory level. The issue that has been disingenuously pushed in our community—that this is somehow about discrimination—is patently and utterly false. No discrimination currently exists in law against same-sex couples: all have been removed. 


I am equally concerned about the freedom of speech aspects that have been driven by the Greens and others in this campaign for marriage equality. It has been driving a whole range of alternative voices in the debate. There has been public demonisation. People have used a whole range of dreadful labels against the likes of the Australia Christian Lobby and other supporters of marriage. In fact, Victoria's Deputy Chief Psychiatrist, Professor Kuruvilla George, was forced to resign as a commissioner on the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission because he simply participated in a submission to the Senate inquiry which supported retaining the definition of marriage. There were calls by gay activists for tennis great Margaret Court's name to be removed from an arena at the Melbourne Park tennis centre because she disagreed with same-sex marriage. In every jurisdiction where marriage or something able to be described in the law as the 'same as marriage' has been given, this sort of situation has arisen. 


Proponents of marriage equality have tried to assure the church that it will never be forced to provide marriage equality to same-sex couples. Yet Denmark, the first country in the world to recognise civil partnerships for same-sex couples, this month legislated to force the church to provide same-sex weddings. Everything that the Greens have driven out there in the public purveyance in terms of this bill has been wrong. No discrimination exists. Their campaign forcing people to move away from their jobs, forcing views to change because of this, is disingenuous at best. The coalition will not be supporting this bill in its entirety or in its piecemeal.

Mr MURPHY
 (Reid) (12:11):  I rise to speak against the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012. One of the lasting results of second-wave feminism in the 1970s is marriage equality. That term was used to mean equality of the sexes within marriage—something I believe we in this House all support. Some people still think that is what marriage equality means. But this seemingly innocuous term has been hijacked by those who want to redefine marriage to include same-sex couples—for the simple reason that this will maximise support. Most people support marriage and almost everyone supports equality. It sounds so reasonable.


Speaking at the recent Sydney Writers' Festival, early gay-rights activist and author, and now Director of the Institute for Human Security at La Trobe University, Professor Dennis Altman, made some very candid and very revealing points in a panel on same-sex marriage. First, he correctly pointed out that marriage was established to deal with issues related to the procreation of children. Second, he wants the entire Marriage Act to be abolished, saying that marriage sends 'dangerous signals' to people who are not in long-term relationships. Same-sex marriage therefore diminishes the cultural achievement of most gay people, in particular gay men, who are actively non-monogamous and, as Altman said, 'do not need the sanctity of state or church to legitimise their relationship'. He added that same-sex marriage is 'a conservative form of winning respectability'.


Supporting Altman's call to remove the words 'a man and a woman' as a first step to abolishing the Marriage Act, prominent gay writer Masha Gessen attacked those who claim that redefining marriage to include same-sex couples will not diminish the importance of traditional marriage, saying: 'It is a lie to say the institution of marriage won't change … We want to abolish marriage.'

I think that marriage between a man and a woman was in the mind of the framers of the Australian Constitution when they enumerated section 51. It gave the power to the new Commonwealth government to legislate in relation to divorce and marriage. I think there is considerable argument in relation to the capacity of the Commonwealth government to legislate in the area of same-sex marriage.


As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs we saw real dispute on this particular matter with constitutional limits of the Commonwealth government to make laws in this area. In written and oral submissions there were disagreements in relation to this. Ultimately, if the House of Representatives and the Senate pass legislation, I am sure that those constitutional limits will be tested in the High Court. But steeped in history, in religion, in culture and in our law is the concept of the old definition that marriage is between a man and a woman. That cannot be denied. It is part of our history and our tradition going back to ancient times. It is part of English law and Australian law. I do not ever think that the framers of the Constitution thought that the Commonwealth government had the power to deal with this issue.


It has significant repercussions to our society. I believe that a marriage between a man and a women is a fundamental institution of our society. I cast no criticism on those people who find love—no matter how they find it—in adult relationships. I have acted for plenty of people in same-sex relationships when I was a practising lawyer in the Family Court and the Federal Magistrates Court. I know many colleagues from my days as a lawyer who were in same-sex relationships. But fundamentally, before we mess with the concept of marriage held by so many Australians, we need widespread and strong community consensus. We do not have it; therefore, I do not support the bill.

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (12:27):  I too rise to oppose the bill. I understand there have been a number of speakers who have put this view this morning. I think it is very important that opposition to the bill is articulated clearly in this place, because this is a contested issue in our community at this time. I have had very vigorous communication from a large number of members in my community seeking me to stand and defend the current definition of marriage on their behalf. I know that there will be tabling of documents today regarding an inquiry into this bill and data related to that. I can reflect from my own local community that 70 per cent of the people who have communicated with my office on this matter oppose any change to the current definition of marriage.


I would like to also make an observation from conversations with people in my local community. This is often an issue where views that hold to the current definition are ascribed to older people who are somewhat out of touch with the current values and milieu of our society. In fact, the reality is that there are many young people who speak to me as well. There are many people who absolutely applaud the Labor federal government's amendments to legislation in our very first term to ensure equality before the law. The reality is that they accept that, they are proud of that and they absolutely want to go on the record as having no opposition to homosexuality but much the contrary: to be very clear in their support for the current definition of marriage. 


I also want to indicate the large number of submissions that came to the inquiry from the Sikh community, from Uniting Care and also from that great supporter of community social justice, the Salvation Army. I again put on the record my opposition to the bill.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (12:30):  I thank colleagues for taking on this debate with regard to military superannuation and the many concerns in the community in relation to equity and justice within the military superannuation scheme. There is a large and frustrated community of ex-service men and women who feel that the standard of living entitlements are not keeping pace with existing fundamentals within the military superannuation scheme. This motion was, effectively, put through this very chamber nearly three years ago by me and was passed with the full support of the House. Yet we still see frustration, concern and a very active campaign, particularly online, of the ex-service community, who want to see more access to equity and justice.


I accept that there are some realities that government does need to deal with in considering any changes. They relate to cost and, if Parliamentary Library figures are to be believed, there are some substantial costs in relation to any changes in this area. There are issues in relation to impacts on the cash balance and the fiscal balance. There are issues in relation to clawback within the scheme, acknowledging that any increases do potentially have an impact on other arrangements such as those to do with age pension payments. That does need to be sensitively considered through any changes in this regard. Also, there has been ongoing debate since the early 1970s in relation to establishing the appropriate link between indexation with regard to the military superannuation pension and the issue of purchasing power to guard against erosion by inflation. Report after report has been unable to resolve this issue of a link. 


The use of CPI methodology is based on recommendations of Professor AH Pollard in 1973. It has been challenged in reports such as the Jess review of 1970. There were Senate select committee reports in 2001 and 2002 and in 2008 there was a Senate standing committee report. ABS is still grappling with it, the Podger review grappled with it, all the way through to the Matthews report in 2008, and remained unable to resolve this issue of how to adequately link military superannuation schemes with those issues around purchasing power and the CPI.


I accept the difficulty in dealing with this issue. However, there are many in the community who are aggrieved and their concerns deserve to be heard in this House. There are many who are frustrated that government, report after report, seems to get the concerns about a lack of purchasing power within the current military superannuation scheme, yet, when it comes to actually doing something about it, the arguments of cost and difficulty in making those changes seem to be directed towards those who have done military service. So there is, I think, some justification in the argument that 'why is it only those who have done military service who get the book of government thrown at them when it comes to all being too hard?' Why not engage the military superannuation and ex-service community in trying to work through the many challenges in trying to answer the at least half-dozen reports that have been done in this area since the 1970s and come up with the right and appropriate scheme that can deliver equity and justice for those who have served this country so well and so often? I ask the government to consider this again and I hope this motion has the full support of the House.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (12:35):  This is the third motion on the indexing of DFRDB pensions to be moved in the last four years. The first was moved by the member for Lyne, the second was moved by me and now the member for Lyne has moved a third motion. I suggest this one will also be agreed to by all members. Yet still nothing has been done.


I support the member for Lyne in his comments. I introduced a private member's bill, through Senator Ronaldson, in the Senate to achieve the very issue we are talking about now. Even though the government agreed twice previously—in the member for Lyne's motion and my motion, which were exactly the same thing, to index DFRDB by the same mechanism as the age pension—on the voices in the last two motions, when a private member's bill went up to achieve the outcome, the government voted against it.


The government has form on this. In 2007 they went to the election promising to fix military superannuation, and they did not. They failed. They failed the veterans of Australia. In 2010, Tony Abbott went to the election with a policy to index DFRDB. On the back of that announcement at the 2010 election, we took a private member's bill into the Senate—because when we announce something at an election as something we are going to do, we follow through with it. But again the government voted against it, as did the Greens.




Ms Burke:
  What did you do in 11 years in government? Eleven years of inaction!




Mr ROBERT:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, you should know better than to speak out of turn. Yet even in the Greens policy it says quite clearly:


Australian Greens leader Bob Brown wrote to Minister Tanner earlier this year to urge him to re-consider the government's response to the Matthews' review and revise the indexation for Defence Force superannuation pensions. We strongly believe that the Government should now act to provide wage-based indexation on the same terms as the Aged Pension …


That is straight from the Greens policy, and yet when we put forward a private member's bill in the Senate, the Greens voted it down. They voted against their own policy. That is how disingenuous the coalition partner of the Labor Party, the Greens, are. Bob Brown said, 'We can't afford it.' The government said it will cost $175 million; we need savings. As part of the private member's bill that was taken up in 2011 to index DFRDB pensions, $300 million worth of savings were found over the forward estimates by reducing the increase in the public service from 12.4 per cent to a miserly 8.4 per cent—a fairly strong increase nonetheless—but there was a four per cent decrease in the growth of the public service within the Department of Defence. That was yielding about $300 million worth of savings—twice the amount of savings needed to pay for the coalition's DFRDB policy. And still the Greens—and, indeed, Senator Xenophon—voted against it. The government said the savings were not real and then three or four months later the Minister for Defence stood up and said, 'I'm here to announce $300 million worth of savings by tapering off the increase in the public service, taking out a piece of work, almost 100 per cent. The level of disingenuousness of this government is completely and utterly staggering.


We believe in the unique nature of service. If I look at the Alliance of Defence Service Organisations in the inquiry of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee on the coalition's bill, the Alliance of Defence Service Organisations stated:


In no other calling, occupation or profession has the State the power to accept or demand the surrender of these rights. The Unique Nature of Military Service deserves unique solutions and also places a great burden on the Government as the ""employer” to ensure that ADF members are looked after both during and after Service.


The RSL further said as a submission to the Senate inquiry:


An examination of legislation for the Australian Defence Force shows that in almost all respects, the Parliament has been consistent since Federation in regarding the nation's armed forces as a separate and quite distinctly different part of Australian society.


We agree with them that the military is required to do a range of actions on behalf of the nation and that that service is unique. We believe in the unique nature of military service. We accept the concept of the unique nature of military service. We have seen it in action. We have experienced it. We have committed to it, which is why we once again commit upon government that we will fairly index the DFRDB.

"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Mr GRIFFIN
 (Bruce) (12:40):  This has been a vexed issue for this parliament with respect to Defence and veterans' policy over a number of years so I think that it is important in that context that we explain a little bit of that history. It is an issue which governments have grappled with not just over the last four or five years but quite a while before then, and I draw this particular point in those circumstances.


Those who come here today, as the member for Fadden has done, and state that without doubt, unequivocally, the coalition will act upon the commitment they have now made, needs to remember that for 11 years they did not do it. It was not an issue that was raised only in the last four to five years; it was an issue raised regularly over the previous decade. Throughout the previous decade the coalition government, of which for most of that period the now opposition leader was a member of cabinet, said no. I have even seen recent comments which have suggested that the former foreign minister, Alexander Downer, has suddenly had a conversion on the road to Damascus and now thinks that this is an issue that needs to be acted upon. 


I have got to give marks though to the former finance minister, former Senator Nick Minchin, who at least has had the courage of his convictions to be consistent with respect to this issue when recently he wrote in a letter that was printed which said:


It is easy to feel sympathy for the demands made by retired defence personnel for improved superannuation ... 


However, all claims made upon the public purse, even those by retired defence personnel, should be considered rigorously and on their merits.


This particular claim was properly rejected by the Howard government, of which I was a member, as well as by the Labor government.


There is no inherent logic to the proposition that a public sector employment related superannuation payment should be indexed in exactly the same fashion as a means-tested welfare benefit in this case, the aged pension.


Defence personnel have their superannuation payments indexed the same way that all other commonwealth public servants on defined-benefit schemes have their payments indexed.


The payments are maintained in real terms, which is what they signed up for. Changing the indexation for defence personnel would create immediate demands for the same change to be made for all other former commonwealth employees, at a potentially enormous cost to taxpayers.


The government should continue to reject this demand.


That is the position of Nick Minchin, former senator, former finance minister, long-time member of the cabinet of the previous government, long-time cabinet colleague of the now opposition leader who has done an amazing backflip compared to his past. Others—and there may be some here—would remember not only that, but that when he was minister for employment and workplace relations, his department actually put forward a submission in respect of considering related issues around the question of compensation in which he argued that defence personnel and people in that area should be treated no differently from other Commonwealth employees. So we have seen a change, and I think that is something that really needs to be remembered by the defence community. 


Is military service unique—yes, it is. What do you then do to recognise that uniqueness? A range of things can be done, and a range of things have been done. For example, there is the capacity to access superannuation at an earlier stage under the scheme we are talking about than is the case overwhelmingly for people in the public sector. The fact is that there are various compensatory payments made through the Department of Veterans' Affairs for the impacts of military service. It is recognised.


I would like to address one point that was made in passing, which was the claim that I as a shadow minister prior to the 2007 election went around the country spruiking the fact that we would make changes with respect to this policy. That is incorrect. I must admit that I did when asked on rare occasions make the point that we were committed to a review of superannuation indexation arrangements. That review occurred and was acted on. A set of decisions were made that are well known to the Defence community, decisions that they were not happy with. But the fact that there was a commitment to a review does not commit us to change. I certainly made that point on a number of occasions prior to the 2007 election. I understand the concerns that have been raised by the veteran community. I support their right to pursue those concerns. I wish them well. But we need to try to remove some of the hypocrisy from the arguments that have been put by those opposite about this serious issue.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (12:45):  I rise today to speak on this motion because Australia's veterans and their families deserve a fair go. This motion addresses many serious issues for the Ryan electorate and I thank the member for Lyne for putting this motion today. My office has received literally hundreds of emails and telephone calls regarding fair indexation and the government's failure to appropriately deal with this issue. Fair indexation is one of the most important issues affecting the veteran and ex-service community. I spoke in my maiden speech about Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera, which is in the Ryan electorate, and I acknowledged the very valued contribution made by their service men and women. In that speech, I recommitted again to fair indexation of the Defence Force Retirement Benefits Scheme, the DFRBS, and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme, DFRDBS. It is something that I will continue to fight for.


The coalition believes in the unique nature of military service and believes that current indexation, which utilises the CPI alone, does not adequately reflect changes in the cost of living of ex-service men and women, Australians who have given much to their nation. Fortunately, I am pleased to reconfirm that the coalition has a positive plan to address this problem. This is not a new issue. The Leader of the Opposition announced prior to the 2010 federal election that military superannuation pensions would be fairly indexed. The coalition acted on 18 November 2010 when we introduced into the Senate the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Amendment (Fair Indexation) Bill 2010. But it was a shameful day for the Australian Senate and for Australia when Labor and the Greens combined to vote down this bill. That was a clear demonstration that the Prime Minister, the Australian Labor Party and the Greens are not committed to improving the lives of military superannuants and their families.


On 14 March this year, I recommitted to the reform of military superannuation pensions when I signed the coalition's pledge to continue our commitment to Australia's veterans. This pledge has also been signed by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for veterans' affairs and many other members of the coalition. That pledge says: 'The coalition will ensure DFRB and DFRDB military superannuation pensions are indexed in the same way as age and service pensions. All DFRB and DFRDB superannuants aged 55 and over will benefit.' If we had a government that was capable and responsible, a government that knew how to manage the economy for all Australians, then finding this funding for military superannuants would not be difficult. In fact, it would be paramount. This government is splashing $56 billion plus on the NBN without even referring it to the Productivity Commission but says that it cannot afford to fund this change, which is critical for equity and justice.


The government demonstrated their lack of commitment in this year's budget by announcing that they wish to seek to maintain a yet-to-be-delivered surplus by deferring spending of $33.7 million on compensation arrangements for veterans and giving higher priority to cost blow-outs in immigration detention centres and carbon tax advertisements. This is a slap in the face to veterans. Veterans with whom I have spoken have said how offended they are about these delays. It is simply not appropriate to delay changes recommended in the Campbell review for two years until July 2014 while at the same time wasting taxpayers' money on carbon tax advertisements. This government clearly has its priorities wrong when it comes to doing the right thing for veterans. It is absolutely crucial that the government commit to fully support fair and just military superannuation pensions. It is clear, however, that the only way to deliver this very important reform is to change the government. Should the coalition be elected into government by the Australian people, we will look after all military superannuants and their families because that is the right and just thing to do.

Ms BURKE
 (Chisholm—Deputy Speaker) (12:50):  I rise to speak to the motion moved by the member for Lyne. Thank you very much for bringing this important issue to the attention of the House. Having had the benefit of being in the parliament for 14 years, unlike the two previous speakers, I know that this is not a new issue; it is not something that has just sprung from a well that someone has decided to do something about. Indeed, one of the big problems with this is that for 11 years under the Howard government nothing was done. Promise after promise was made and review after review was held. The Podger review came out. It was not even released. No-one talked about it. This festering sore of an issue has been allowed to gather steam.


The difficulty is that nobody has said no. One thing in life that you do not want to hear is 'No'. Nobody has mounted the case as to why this should not happen. They have promised reviews. Indeed, Labor was at fault in this as well—we promised and had a review, the Matthews review. The Matthews review said that there should be no change. We have built up a level of expectation among our service men and women, and that is unfair. Our service men and women deserve better than that. They deserve an answer one way or another and not this continual playing of politics with their lives. It has been an ongoing debate, with several reviews. For the last speaker to make statements about what the next coalition government will do is cant hypocrisy, because they never did it in the past.


Indeed, changing indexation methodology may be inappropriate, inequitable for other Commonwealth superannuants and indeed very costly. Where will the money be found? The men and women of our Defence Forces do an amazing job. We should not be playing around with their service. We should recognise it and not use it as a political football. They need to understand that the benefits that they receive are above and beyond those of other people—as they should be, because what they do for their country is above and beyond that of other people. They receive currently higher employer contribution rates of 18 per cent to 20 per cent depending on service time, compared with the nationally legislated rate of nine per cent, which is going to become 12 per cent. There are sovereign guarantees within the fund so that their rates do not go up and down with fluctuations in the market. They can receive lump sum payments. They can access, as they should, their superannuation immediately upon service retirement. They do not have to wait until reaching preservation age as others do.


Understandably, this is a matter that many people feel passionately about. I have had many discussions with my service veteran communities. We need to see the best outcome for those in retirement. It needs to be clarified that superannuation retirement pay is not the same as the age pension. Superannuation is an employment based benefit whereas the age pension is a means tested income support payment that is part of our social security system. I say to many in my electorate: 'You never want to be on a pension. Work hard and never end up on a pension.' We should not be comparing these two benefits. They are not the same. These payments serve different purposes and are provided for different reasons. It is not relevant to compare indexation, as indeed Nick Minchin has stated quite eloquently, with the member for Bruce reading that into the Hansard. It is not relevant to compare them. For many people, the age pension is their only source of income. For many Defence personnel, their Defence Force super is not their only source of income.


However, there are individuals who are receiving less than or the equivalent of the age pension on their Defence Force super. Indeed, many in my electorate who have Commonwealth superannuation are receiving less than or the equivalent of the age pension. We need to deal with that issue. But that is a separate issue. Let us deal with that lingering sore but not by taking up a sledgehammer—which many want to do—to change indexation. Let us deal with those people who are caught in a bind and not put a huge impost upon the budget by going a different route—a route the coalition never chose when they were in government. We need to be seeking the right and just income for our service men and women because they have done so much for us.


In his 2008 Review of Pension Indexation Arrangements in Australian Government Civilian and Military Superannuation Schemes—a review the ALP said it would do upon coming to government—Mr Matthews said:


… it would need to be generally accepted that an employer retains a responsibility to compensate former employees for improvements in productivity, as reflected in salary rises, which occur after an employee leaves them. This is not a generally accepted responsibility in Australia.


The view from Matthews was that you cannot keep compensating people. The difficulty with the compensation issue is that it will reward those on the highest income and will actually not fix those who are left behind at the bottom. (Time expired)

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-06-18,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (12:55):  This Labor government has not done the right and proper thing by veterans as far as their superannuation entitlements are concerned. I acknowledge what the member for Chisholm has just said. If that is so, let us work together as a parliament for those people she rightly praised in her speech. For people who have bravely and willingly laid their lives on the line for their country, the present indexation levels are unacceptable and need to be rectified. The government's continued refusal to pay adequate and fair compensation to ex-service personnel raises many questions. Why does the government continue to discriminate against military superannuants by not indexing their superannuation to retain purchasing power, as promised by their employer when they joined their respective service? Why do the minister and his department continue to neglect the nation's obligation to honour enlistment conditions—contract vested property—and engage instead in continuous extraneous rhetoric, spin and political posturing? Serving and retired members of the Australian Defence Force should not be treated as second-class citizens.


This is a big issue for the Riverina and for Wagga Wagga, a triservice city, because many defence people retire to the region because of the quality of the regional lifestyle. If fair indexation is affordable for some 3½ million age pensioners and other welfare beneficiaries, and if generous indexation is affordable for certain parliamentary and judicial superannuation pensioners, why is fair indexation not affordable for military superannuation pensioners?


Australian Defence Force people deserve substance, not a so-called fact sheet, the contents of which can be disputed all the way through. Our veterans served their country selflessly and at great personal risk, as we all know too well. In retirement, they, their widows and their families deserve to have their employment conditions honoured as faithfully as they provided their gallant service. As a condition of employment, fair indexation must be a nondiscretionary obligation in the budget. Surely in a country such as ours, where a fair go is one of the cornerstones of our culture, just things such as this are always affordable. When will the government take real action to fix this? Why does the government permit a military condition of service to continue to be breached? The Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who claims to be well aware of the concerns of the veteran community, would surely understand this. This condition of service provides for retirement pay, a superannuation pension which maintains its purchasing power. Service people themselves compulsorily contribute to it. The nation is duty bound to honour that employment condition; ipso facto, the budget should provide—veterans argue—for fair indexation as a nondiscretionary item before other discretionary items.


Fair indexation of military superannuation pensions is not a new or improved benefit but a condition of employment. It has been and remains a condition of military service that superannuation pensions maintain their purchasing power. That is why the parliament made provision for that to be done when the schemes were established. This was an employment condition, if you like, or contract which established vested property at the time of enlistment. The cost to provide for fair indexation to meet that condition of service is estimated by the coalition at $100 million over four years before clawbacks—a figure supported by renowned economic commentator Peter Thornton. Of course, any cost to the taxpayer is moot given that proper indexation was a condition of employment and is thus, or should be—according to those who stand to lose out if this issue is not addressed—a nondiscretionary obligation on the public purse. The government's continuing refusal to address this issue cannot be reconciled with Labor's current platform which says it will 'continue to explore equitable and affordable mechanisms for the improvement' of military pensions.


Failure to justly index military superannuation pensions comes at a significant cost to veterans' purchasing power. That cost for an average superannuant on $23,000 per annum who has been retired for 15 years is the loss of some $280 per fortnight in real purchasing power which they would have had if their super had been justly indexed at the same rate as age pensioners. With the cost of living increasing all the time and the carbon tax—certain to place even greater pressures on those relying on a pension to make ends meet—real purchasing power becomes an even more burdensome, everyday issue. Fair indexation of military superannuation pensions to maintain their purchasing power is a founding principle of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits, and Military Superannuation and Benefits acts. This purchasing power is a condition of service and veterans plan their lives in retirement on that basis.


Australia has a magnificent record of service in war and peacekeeping operations since Federation, with nearly 1½ million serving. The sacrifice made by their families has also been enormous. It is now time to honour that service with fair indexation. I support this motion and I call on the government to do the right thing by our retired military personnel. This is about equity and justice for those frustrated veterans who are out of pocket and because they have been let down, unfairly, by this Labor government.

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:20):  I would like to make some remarks in opening about the departmental budget for 2012-13 for the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. The department will receive an appropriation totalling $218.5 million. Of this, the department will receive administered funding of $114.1 million, down quite significantly on last year as a result of the termination of various programs. It will receive departmental funding of $97 million and capital funding of $7.4 million. In addition, the Clean Energy Regulator associated with the department has been established and it will receive an appropriation totalling $763.1 million, comprising administered funding of $670.8 million and departmental funding of $92.3 million.


The major components of the department's administered funding include the Low Carbon Communities program, energy efficiency measures, land measures and climate change science applications. Measures for the portfolio announced in the 2012-13 budget included $37.1 million for the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards program, $2.8 million for the building energy efficiency program and $3 million for climate change adaptation. Additionally, in the budget the government decided not to proceed with the tax breaks for the green buildings program. That will provide a saving of $405.2 million over the forward estimates.


The budget for the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency is fiscally responsible. It reflects the fact that much of the government's climate change policy is now contained in the clean energy legislation, the policy for which was announced in July last year. The clean energy legislation and its implementation from 1 July in the form of the carbon price mechanism in particular will decouple economic growth from growth in pollution. Our economy will grow but greenhouse gas emissions will fall, reducing the emissions intensity of the economy over time. It will improve Australia's economic competitiveness in the coming decades when clean energy and low-pollution technologies will be a key to competitive advantage. That is particularly going to be the case in the Asia-Pacific region, where our major trading partners are located. The economies that are able to reduce their emissions intensity—the greenhouse gas emissions per unit of economic output—will have a competitive advantage. That is why it is perfectly valid to assert that the introduction of the carbon price mechanism will drive not only emissions intensity reductions in our economy but productivity improvements as well. Those opposite contend quite differently. No doubt that will be part of the debate that we will have in the upcoming period of time.


The Clean Energy Act become law nearly eight months ago. Since that time, the fact of the matter is that there has been record investment in our economy and exceptional economic growth. We are currently growing faster than every single major advanced economy, as illustrated by the figures released two weeks ago. GDP growth is currently running at 4.3 per cent. Unemployment is at five per cent. We have very high levels of business investment, with more than $173 billion in capital expenditure expected in the year 2012-13 and half a trillion dollars in the resource investment pipeline. This is an essential economic reform at a time when the economy is in a strong position. It is in the long-term interests of the country. As 1 July comes closer—it is now less than two weeks away—I think people will have the opportunity to experience the real world rather than baseless fear campaigning in relation to this issue. The economy is strong. This is a reform that needs to be made and the policy measures associated with the clean energy future package are included in the 2012 budget position for the department.

I note in particular the decision of the New South Wales Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal to authorise electricity price rises of 18 per cent from 1 July. I note that, as part of that, in the average case across the state at least 50 per cent of that increase will be as a consequence of the carbon tax and that, in the case of Integral Energy, up to 85 per cent of the price rise will result directly and solely from the carbon tax.


The rise in prices is going to occupy almost the entire amount of the 10 per cent allocated by the government in its modelling. I refer specifically to Strong growth, low pollution:modelling a carbon price: update,from late 2011, and, in particular, to page 12, where it says, 'Over the first five years of the carbon tax'—not just the first day—'the price rise as a consequence of the carbon tax on electricity will be 10 per cent.' Is the minister really saying that there will be no further price rises as a consequence of the carbon tax in the electricity space? I refer to the fact that the government's own modelling shows a more than 25 per cent increase in the carbon tax on electricity between now and 2017. In particular, the most recent budget showed that the rise would be from $23 to $29 on the carbon price by 2015-16.


Will the minister deny that that 25 per cent plus increase in the carbon price will have any impact on future electricity prices? Will the minister deny that the auctioning of forward permits in April 2014 and beyond for the electricity sector will have any impact on electricity prices? This is particularly so given that the Electricity Supply Association of Australia warned last year that this additional forward auctioning of permits would add another 10 per cent to the price of electricity immediately. So I refer to the fact that five years worth of electricity price rises will have occurred on day one. Does the minister believe that there will be no impact from the additional 25 per cent increase in the carbon tax and does the minister believe that there will be no impact from the auctioning of forward permits, which the Electricity Supply Association of Australia has predicted as of April 2014 will have a further 10 per cent impact on prices?

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:28):  The government has a great degree of confidence in the modelling that has been undertaken. It was independent modelling of a very comprehensive nature by the federal Treasury, supported in the case of the energy market by two private organisations that did extensive modelling of the electricity price impact. We stand by what that modelling says, which is a 10 per cent increase in household electricity prices averaged across the country. Different scenarios were contained in that modelling and the government has a lot of confidence in them.


It is interesting and—from a standpoint where the Leader of the Opposition has been saying there would be an unimaginable price impact and at various times has asserted that electricity prices will rise by 25 per cent and then 30 per cent and even more—it is important to note now that in various jurisdictions regulators are examining this issue and what the real-world price impact will be, and they are confirming that the Treasury modelling is accurate. Just last week, the South Australian regulator issued the estimated price impact in South Australia, and it is $1.50 averaged across households in South Australia. In Western Australia, it is averaging $2.50. In New South Wales, IPART has confirmed that it is $3.30. It is important that we keep these things in some perspective. We certainly have a lot of confidence in the modelling. The regulators are now resolving that the electricity price impacts are consistent with what the Treasury said; in fact, in some jurisdictions it is less than what the Treasury had estimated. 


The other important point to make is that the attribution of carbon pricing to everything that is happening with electricity prices has been misrepresented in this debate. In various jurisdictions, electricity prices have risen by over 50 per cent over the last several years. I was in Western Australia last week. Electricity prices have risen by 50 per cent, I think, in two years in Western Australia. None of these things have anything to do with carbon pricing, which commences just from 1 July. My colleague the member for Chifley and I, as New South Wales politicians, are acutely aware that there was, I think, an 18 per cent increase in electricity prices in New South Wales last year This had nothing to do with carbon pricing, and it came off the back of previous significant increases. This has all been driven by the investment in poles and wires in our transmission and distribution system in a host of jurisdictions throughout the country. An urgent investment has been recognised as necessary in those areas. If there is excessive investment—and I note that some commentators are indicating that gold-plating is going on—then that is an issue that needs to be tackled by the relevant jurisdictions and the relevant electricity market regulators. 


It is very important to make that point about what is really driving electricity prices in this country. There has been an underinvestment in the network for quite a significant period. It is important that it be addressed. It is important that it not be gold-plated. We have to do all that we can to help people at a household level deal with the impact of these price rises. Only $9 in every $100 that a household consumer pays in their electricity bill is going to be attributable to the carbon price, averaged across the country. To assist, the government have announced—and it is the only government acting in this way—a significant number of measures to assist households with these cost pressures. Specifically, with the introduction of the carbon price, there is $3.30 a week averaged electricity price impact and $10.10 assistance provided by the Commonwealth through tax cuts, increases to pensions, increases to family tax benefits, payments to many self-funded retirees, payments to many veterans and increases in a host of other Commonwealth entitlements. This is what is important to bear in mind. Clearly the coalition, having failed in its fear campaigning up to this in time and confronted now with some facts about actual increases, are now moving to try to scare people about impacts over the next five years. They cannot have it every way. The facts will out with the fear.

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (16:33):  I thank the minister for his attendance today and for the opportunity to ask him some questions, particularly given the Gippsland-Latrobe Valley region is recognised, I think even by the government, as one of the regions that will be most adversely affected by the carbon price—or the 'carbon tax', as we like to call it in the Latrobe Valley, even though apparently no-one on the other side of the House likes to call it a 'tax' anymore. I will refer specifically to the regional structural adjustment package, which is supposedly being developed as part of the government's carbon tax package. It has been confirmed by the minister for regional development that there are no guidelines in place for the distribution of this $200 million package. Even when you consider that this $200 million package is grossly inadequate to assist the affected regions, it strikes me as staggering that we are only days away from the implementation of the carbon tax and this $200 million structural adjustment package is without guidelines.


Given that there are no guidelines now and that the tax will come into effect in just a couple of weeks time, can the minister explain how regions which are going to be adversely affected by the carbon tax will be compensated for those adverse impacts?


The Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government was in my electorate quite recently—I think it was last Wednesday or Thursday—and he gave the impression that the vast bulk of the money that was allocated under the package would be contingent upon regions demonstrating that they had been adversely affected by the policy through such things as contracts for closure. Given that the government so far has refused to fund even a socioeconomic analysis of the Latrobe Valley to assess what the impacts of the carbon tax or a contract for closure would be, I am interested to know how the government proposes to demonstrate which regions have been adversely affected and how these funds will be allocated. On that specific issue of the contract for closure, given that we are just days away from the implementation of the carbon tax and given that the government was going to make some announcements on 1 July in relation to the contract-for-closure tender process, will the minister deny that the government is going to announce an extension of time for contract for closure?

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:35):  I thank the member for Flinders for his questions. I appreciate that he has a number of apprehensions, and I hope that I can dispel them to the extent appropriate this afternoon. Sometimes the coalition believe their own propaganda, and I think that is part of the problem we are dealing with here. They have gone around the country—and in particular the Leader of the Opposition—to regions like the Latrobe Valley and terrified the living daylights out of people and created enormous apprehension. I have experienced the same in my own region, which is a coalmining region, where, because the Leader of the Opposition has done the most unconscionable thing and stood before people and said to them, 'You are going to lose your job,' it has created enormous apprehension—



Mr Chester interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The minister is responding.




Mr COMBET:
  One of the first things I learned as a trade union official is that you never, ever, ever mislead people, and the Leader of the Opposition will pay for what he has done. He has created this apprehension in the Latrobe Valley and in many other regions with statements to the effect that Whyalla will be wiped off the map. Just imagine what that means to families in Whyalla—what a disgrace. You have to stand before people and deal with them with some integrity, and that has been lacking in the coalition's approach. As the carbon price comes into effect, this will become clearer and clearer to members of the community, including the Latrobe Valley. 


I do not suggest the question was put in any inappropriate way. I know that the member is genuine in his concerns, but I think that we have to keep things in perspective here. We are acutely conscious of the circumstances that the Latrobe Valley and, in particular, the brown coal generation sector find themselves in. A very significant amount of funding of course was allocated in the form of energy security payments in the package to ensure that there was confidence on the part of the investors, the equity holders and the debt providers, for the brown coal generators in the Latrobe Valley, and I think there is evidence that those payments have been successful by their continuing confidence in the assets that are there. That is very important for people's jobs as well. The government committed significant funds to ensure that there was ongoing confidence in those assets and in the region.


I have visited the Latrobe Valley a couple of times over the last 12 or 18 months to talk to people about this issue, and I can assure the member that I am as concerned as anyone else to ensure the wellbeing of that community. A number of the electricity generators in the Latrobe Valley region did indicate that they would like to discuss, in the appropriate process, the contract-for-closure issue, and those discussions have been continuing in an appropriate way through the department of my colleague the Minister for Resources and Energy. They are commercial-in-confidence discussions. Our public policy announced in July last year, to which we continue to adhere, is that that process would be brought to a conclusion by 30 June, which of course is imminent. That remains our policy position. 


It is not appropriate for me to speculate on the outcome at this point in time, but the process that we initiated should appropriately be continued and a conclusion reached. I can say to people in the Latrobe Valley that we are very mindful of the circumstances there. We have put a lot of resources into supporting them. We are working very closely with the business community and, I might add, with the Victorian government in relation to these issues.

In doing so, I remind the chamber that of course answers given in this chamber have the same weight and bearing as answers given in the primary chamber of the House, with all the consequences for statements made that may or may not be true. Very briefly, my question to the minister is: is the government considering, involved in or negotiating any form of bailout package for sections of the aluminium sector, given the imminence of the carbon tax?

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:40):  I appreciate the question because it gives me the opportunity to put on the record once again a number of the difficulties that are confronting the aluminium-smelting sector in particular. Essentially, there has been a very significant fall in aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange—in fact, a 40 per cent depreciation in prices over the last few years—and that is impacting on the profitability of much of the aluminium industry within our domestic economy. Added to that, given the strength of the economy and the investment in the resources sector in particular, we have been experiencing a high dollar, above parity with the US dollar, for some months, and for an extended period of time the value of the dollar has been well above its historical average. It could be that that situation will be sustained for a significant period of time, given the strength of the economy and the drivers of the high valuation of the Australian dollar in the marketplace. Those two factors alone—low prices, associated with oversupply in the international market, and the high value of the Australia dollar—are impacting significantly.


Added to that, of course, are pressures arising from the fact that long-term electricity contracts that had been negotiated between various state governments or state instrumentalities with the aluminium smelters, as is the case particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, in recent times and in the coming years are expiring. They are contracts that have had perhaps a 25- to 30-year term. Many of those contracts have involved a discounted electricity price for supply for the aluminium smelters involved, and the repricing of those electricity contracts by the relevant generators or state instrumentalities is a very material factor in the viability of these businesses. There has been extensive discussion between the aluminium industry, and the smelters in particular, and the various state governments and state instrumentalities in relation to that issue, including in Victoria. It was one of the key issues behind the decision by Norsk Hydro a month or so ago to close the aluminium smelter at Kurri Kurri in my own region, the Hunter. To put that into a fair historical perspective, it was a decision of the New South Wales government, followed by a decision of the O'Farrell government, that they would not renew the electricity contract on terms sufficiently favourable to Norsk Hydro to allow the continued operation of that smelter.


All of that—low prices, the high dollar and electricity contracts—is yet again being completely misrepresented by the coalition in a misleading way. They are trying to attribute these problems to carbon pricing, which is completely fallacious. To put that in context, aluminium smelting is an industry that in 2012-13 will attract for free an average of 94.5 per cent of the permits it will require under the carbon price, reducing the effective average carbon price in aluminium smelting to $1.30 a tonne. It is a trade-exposed industry, and that is why the government has taken a significant step. That is the assistance that has been provided. Aluminium companies are in constant discussion with the government about these issues and, particularly with my other portfolio hat on, it is not surprising that I would be having discussions pretty regularly with the aluminium sector and others who are feeling some of these pressures—for example, the steel industry—and continuing to monitor the situation.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (16:44):  I want to pick up on a number of things. The member for Flinders referred to Western Sydney and my home state of New South Wales and what is going to be happening there with power prices. He referred to the fact that power prices will increase by 18 per cent. I think it is important to state that more than half of that is not due to the carbon tax or carbon price but, rather, has a lot to do with the decisions that have been made as a result of approval given by IPART to the pricing movements requested by state owned corporations, which are the responsibility of state governments. I do not recall that there has been any move to provide any sort of household assistance to cover for the increases to power prices that the state owned corporations have had approved through state based regulators.


I understand that there is a household assistance package that will cover households as a result of any move to introduce a carbon price from 1 July, as opposed to what is happening due to the state owned corporations. On top of that, there has been a very active scare campaign about the impact on councils in New South Wales as a result of the introduction of the carbon price which I would like to get some clarity on. So the first thing is to get clarity on the impact, particularly in Western Sydney, of the carbon price on power prices for households. The second thing is the impact on rates and council operations in Western Sydney.


The third thing I want to get clarity on follows from an opportunity I had to visit De Bortoli Wines, which has a distribution centre based in Western Sydney. They have been the beneficiary of assistance to help them shift their operations to a more sustainable footing. I was very impressed when I went out to Glendenning on Friday and met the New South Wales manager of De Bortoli Wines who outlined the types of measures that have been taken to move to a more sustainable footing and use their energy more efficiently. While there has been a lot of focus on the carbon price itself, there has not been enough focus on what measures are being taken by businesses and industry to make themselves much more sustainable, to use energy more efficiently in the way they conduct their affairs. I would like to know, particularly from a Western Sydney focus, what other businesses are able to do and what assistance they are able to tap into to find more energy efficient ways to operate and thereby reduce their own costs.

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:47):  I thank the member for Chifley for the question because there are some important issues traversed there. I will take them sequentially. It is very important to note that 8.9 per cent, as I recall, of the electricity price rise approved by IPART in New South Wales is attributable to the introduction of a carbon price. That equates to an average household cost of $3.30 a week—exactly what the government said it would be. And of course, with respect to that, the federal government is providing an average of $10.10 per week to households in New South Wales in assistance in the form of tax cuts, family tax benefit improvements and pension increases. In Western Sydney, where I had the privilege to grow up—in fact, in the electorate of the member for Chifley, an excellent representative for that area—this is very important for people. There are many people in New South Wales, in Western Sydney, doing it tough. The tax cuts, the pension increases, the family tax benefits, the help for self-funded retirees, for many veterans and many others are very, very important to them. The federal government is the only government that is helping in these circumstances.


As to the rest of the electricity price rise approved by IPART, there are very significant factors that are within the New South Wales government jurisdiction to deal with. They are providing no assistance. The federal coalition have banged on for the last 12 or 18 months about all the doom and gloom, the fear and the terror that is created by carbon pricing. Do you know, the investment in poles and wires in New South Wales equates to the price impact of carbon pricing coming in, as it does in other jurisdictions—and, not only that, it has been more in previous years. Yet they have been claiming doom and gloom for everything with respect to that, when in fact the federal government is providing $10.10 a week, on average, in assistance. The New South Wales government is not helping people. It is not even actively looking at how it can ensure that there is no gold-plating of these investments, which are going on within its jurisdiction, so that New South Wales Electricity consumers are not placed under even greater pressure. That is a very material factor. It is total hypocrisy for the O'Farrell government to try to attribute the totality of the price rise to the carbon price as the member for Flinders was trying to do in his first question. It is completely fallacious and factually untrue. The New South Wales government is not providing assistance to help people in the way the federal government is.


The other thing that IPART did in recent weeks was to examine in a thorough way the potential price impact of carbon pricing on councils and their costs. There is a very thorough breakdown published on IPART's website which demonstrates very clearly that we are talking about an increase in the range of 0.4 per cent to 0.6 per cent in local government costs in New South Wales—I do not have the material before me, but it certainly was not more than 0.6 per cent. Fortunately, in that jurisdiction IPART keeps a pretty close eye on what the councils can do, along with the state government. Those are the facts of the matter.


I was in Brisbane last week. The Brisbane City Council, which is, of course, under Liberal National Party control, has come up with a completely fallacious claim. Given the same circumstances, they will be putting rates up by 1.9 per cent and ripping people off and having no transparency and accountability about it. These are all material factors.


The member for Chifley is right to point to the importance of programs generally that will assist organisations such as manufacturing businesses and local governments to reduce their energy consumption. Of course, some of the revenue from the carbon price mechanism is dedicated to programs which will assist in this. Last week the government announced a number of recipients among local governments and not-for-profit organisations of energy efficiency grants which will see energy consumption and electricity bills reduced. Last week I visited a food manufacturing facility at Emu Plains called Crafty Chef. A co-contribution by the government is expected to reduce the carbon emissions intensity of Crafty Chef by 54 per cent, deliver CO2 savings, boost its turnover from $20 million to $50 million and increase jobs.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2012-06-18,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (16:52):  I have two sets of questions for the minister. The first is in on the solar hot water rebate program. This program was axed in February, with $45 million lost. Although at the time the government claimed there was no reduction against budget expenditure, on budget night it was shown that the net loss as a consequence for the sector was $45 million, and the budget papers were reduced accordingly. The government has now reinstated that funding, although in a different format. My first question to the minister is very simple: where does that $45 million come from? Within which programs was it contained in the current budget? If it was not contained in any of the programs, will the minister confirm that the government's so-called surplus will be reduced by $45 million?


The second set of questions relates to landfill and the number of liable entities on the government's register of liable entities. Is the minister aware of plans by some landfill operators, and indeed potentially by some councils, to divert waste from consolidated high-quality landfills to smaller regional landfills so as to legitimately avoid the 25,000 tonne limit but in so doing potentially to lead to an increase in overall emissions and a decrease in environmental standards? Is the minister aware of any case where this is occurring, and can he rule out that landfill is being diverted from larger landfills to smaller landfills so as to avoid the liability but in so doing also losing the potential for methane strip and diverting waste to landfills which may not have the same lining and environmental standards?

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:54):  In relation to the solar hot-water rebate, which was introduced in 2007, it is material to point out that the government has now provided over $320 million to help more than 258,000 Australian households replace older, higher emissions related hot-water systems with renewable, lower emissions alternatives. As at 31 May this year, an additional $68 million had been spent on rebates above the budget for the program announced in 2007, and an additional 33,000 systems have been installed above the target announced in 2007. It has been a program with a significant degree of funding expended on it over five years and with a significant number of systems installed—over a quarter of a million. The program has not been closed early; it was always designed to be closed in 2012, and that is what the government has done. We have obviously consulted widely in the industry and with associated stakeholder groups about this issue, but I emphasise that it was always scheduled to end on 30 June this year.



Mr Hunt interjecting—




Mr COMBET:
  On 6 June, just a couple of weeks ago, the government announced through Parliamentary Secretary Dreyfus that the $44.7 million that I think the member for Flinders is referring to, which remained from the Renewable Energy Bonus Scheme, will be used to support two national programs assisting local communities and low-income families to become more energy efficient. This will involve a new $24 million Local Government Energy Efficiency Program, established to help councils install solar or heat-pump hot-water systems in community facilities, and an extra $20.7 million under the Home Energy Saver Scheme, to support low-income households to invest in a bigger range of energy-efficient whitegoods and heating and cooling systems. This does not add to the budget in the way that was implied by the member for Flinders; this is an underspend from the program.




Mr Hunt:
  That is untrue. The budget was corrected and the money was taken out.




Mr COMBET:
  I am afraid that that is the position. I am reminded that it was factored into the budget surplus in a contingency reserve, and perhaps that is why the member for Flinders had not picked that up. 


In relation to landfill, only 34 councils—as of Friday, according to the list based on current data published by the Clean Energy Regulator—have been identified as liable entities on the Liable Entities Public Information Database. That is 34 councils of 559 nationally. The coalition, in yet another example of fearmongering and campaigning and misrepresentation and misleading statements, has been running around trying to terrify local governments about this issue. The fact of the matter is that the government has worked very closely with the Australian Local Government Association for several years—since the previous parliament—about how to structure landfill emissions to minimise methane liability under the carbon-pricing mechanism. Many local governments that operate landfill sites have already invested in methane capture technology, which is what triggers landfill liability. Many local governments, including in my own region, have already invested in methane capture technology in order to either flare the methane, which under a carbon-pricing arrangement will potentially reduce their liability below the emissions threshold that triggers liability, or use it to generate electricity. We have consulted very closely with the landfill sector and local governments about the issue that the member for Flinders pointed to—the potential diversion of waste. It might be recalled that, under the CPRS, mechanisms had been mooted to deal with the potential of that issue. We satisfied ourselves in consultations that that is an issue that it was not necessary to address under the clean energy future package at this point in time.

 (Gippsland) (17:00):  I must admit that I was struck by the member for Chifley's question before. It seemed like the 'don't mention the war' episode out of Fawlty Towers, only heslipped up and mentioned the carbon tax. 'I did it once but I think I got away with it'. I am sorry to say, Member for Chifley, that the people of my electorate and right throughout Australia do not feel that you are getting away with it. They know what this tax is going to do to their lives. This is a tax, and all the bribes and the slick advertising will not hide the fact that this tax is going to cascade through the economy and have a big impact on regional communities. It is also a tax that your Prime Minister specifically ruled out ever introducing. But I do thank the minister for his answer previously, and I also acknowledge, Minister, that 1 July is the government's policy in relation to contract foreclosure. But the practical reality of the situation is that contract foreclosure negotiations are going nowhere fast, and I think the minister knows that. My community in the Latrobe Valley is suffering right now because of the uncertainty being created by your government's policy. Your government has no plans in place in relation to structural adjustment. Your Minister for Regional Development, Regional Australia and Local Government has acknowledged that as well. There are no guidelines in place for that particular policy, and there is a crisis of confidence going on right now in the Gippsland and Latrobe Valley region which is directly related to the carbon tax policy which the Prime Minister explicitly ruled out in the lead-up to the last election.


I repeat my question from before, Minister. Will the minister deny that government is going to announce an extension of time for its contract foreclosure negotiations?

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:02):  I thank the member for his question. This is where the coalition tries to have it every way, of course. On the one hand it is doom and gloom and terrible. I think the Leader of the Opposition today was forecasting the price to go up, and so on, but on the other hand, when it is politically suitable for them, they try to point to the price falling and therefore holes in budgets and all the rest. 


We have confidence in the Treasury modelling, and that is reflected in the budget. I was reminded today in question time in relation to this issue, when the member for Flinders was googling the European Union allowance prices, that in fact in July 2008 the European unit price was, I think, A$56 a tonne just prior to the global financial crisis. It is an emissions trading scheme, it is a market price that is set. Of course, the carbon price mechanism that we have implemented will migrate to a floating price, a market price, from 1 July 2015, and the market will set the price. The Treasury has modelled that, in one of the most comprehensive modelling exercises undertaken for a public policy change, at $29 a tonne in 2015-16. We have confidence in the modelling. If the member for Flinders is a derivatives expert on carbon markets, that is great. However, to be suggesting at this point in time that, in three years, we will still have low prices in Europe is a pretty big call, for a number of reasons. One of them is that we would all share the hope that the current debt crisis that is being experienced throughout the European zone is resolved as expeditiously as possible. That debt crisis has affected many markets, including the carbon market in the EU. I know, through consultations that I have with the EU in relation to this issue, that there is a great degree of concern about that and the need to resolve the debt crisis and restore confidence and stability to markets in Europe, including in relation to the trading of European Union allowances. 


The government has already announced that we are in consultation with the European Union about the potential for ultimately linking the two schemes, which would be an important policy initiative—it is the largest carbon market in the world. The European Union scheme goes into a third phase in the not-too-distant future. There is a lot of discussion in Europe about the application of that phase and whether there would be contemplation of measures to support the price in the EU ETS as part of those changes. That is a matter for the European Union to deal with. The point that I am endeavouring to make is that 1 July 2015 is some period away, and we certainly anticipate that carbon prices and international markets will recover. By the time that we migrate to a floating price, from 1 July 2015, I think the Treasury modelling is going to prove to be as sound as the confidence we have in it.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (17:07):  It gives me great pride to be able to speak in support of the measures contained within the appropriation bills. The 2012-13 budget delivers on the government's commitment to return the budget to surplus. The surplus is growing over the forward estimates. As well as returning to surplus, the budget spreads the benefits of the resources boom to help families and low- and middle-income earners with increases in the cost of living. The return to surplus is the right decision for the Australian economy because it will sustain confidence in the strength of Australia's public finances, it will strengthen the government's balance sheet, to support Australia's capacity to respond to future adverse economic shocks, and it is appropriate for an economy expected to grow around trend and allows monetary policy to respond to economic conditions. 


Australia's budget will return to surplus ahead of any other advanced major economy. Many other advanced economies are still grappling with the task of rebuilding their economies as well as setting their public finances on a sustainable footing. The current European sovereign debt crisis makes maintaining strong fiscal discipline and credibility more important than ever. Australia's strong public finances, very low public debt, solid economic growth, low unemployment and contained inflation make it one of the strongest economies in the world. 


The government will return to surplus despite tax receipts being revised down by $28 billion over four years from 2011-12, relative to the 2011-12 MYEFO, due to parameter and other variations. Relative to the forecast made in the 2008-09 budget, total tax receipts have been written down by around $150 billion over the five years to 2012-13. The government has taken a disciplined approach to both return the budget to surplus and create room for new investments. This has required the government to identify $33.6 billion over five years in savings, with those savings split roughly equally between expenditure and receipt measures. These savings have been designed to be targeted and responsible, ensuring that the most vulnerable Australians and front-line services are protected. In addition to delivering the surplus and spreading the benefits of the boom, the 2012-13 budget contains a number of important initiatives, including establishing the first stage of a national disability insurance scheme; reforming Australia's aged-care system to make the system fairer, more transparent and responsive; delivering additional dental health services; and investing in a number of high-quality infrastructure projects, including funding for duplicating the Pacific Highway, additional funding for Roads to Recovery and Black Spot programs, committing to develop the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal and the Torrens and Goodwood rail project. 


Average real growth in payments over the forward estimates is 1.8 per cent. This is within the commitment to maintain a two per cent annual cap on real spending growth on average, until surpluses are at least one per cent of GDP and while the economy is at or above trend. The budget also sees a fall in nominal payments in 2012-13 compared to 2011-12—the first fall in 42 years for which data is available. This highlights the key role disciplined spending is playing in the fiscal consolidation. The discipline imposed on real spending growth has reduced payments as a proportion of GDP to 23.5 per cent in 2012-13—that is a fall of 1.6 percentage points from 2011-12. In 2012-13 and each subsequent year in the forward estimates, payments as a percentage of GDP are expected to be at their lowest level since the onset of the global financial crisis. Across the forward estimates from 2012-13, payments are expected to be below 24 per cent of GDP. This is the longest sustained period below 24 per cent since the 1980s. 


The budget includes measures to support the integrity, fairness and sustainability of the tax system, such as the removal of tax concessions for golden handshakes and living-away-from-home allowances. Nonetheless, over the forward estimates the tax to GDP ratio is projected to remain below what it was in 2007-08. In 2012-13, the tax to GDP ratio is expected to be 1.6 percentage points lower than the 2007-08 level, which equates to around $24.1 billion worth of tax in 2012-13. Tax receipts are projected to reach 22.9 per cent of GDP in 2015-16, around one percentage point below the levels reached in the mid-2000s. Tax receipts as a proportion of GDP in 2011-12 and the previous two years were the lowest since 1993-94. (Time expired)

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (17:12):  I thank the Assistant Treasurer for his opening remarks. I want to touch on a few things before moving to his specific responsibilities. I would like to focus on the general issues around the budget. There is some confusion surrounding the budget papers and why in a number of cases they were delivered late to coalition people in the opposition budget lock-up. Assistant Treasurer, was it Treasury's responsibility to deliver the budget books to the opposition in the budget lock-up? Were any copies of the budget or related papers, including the portfolio budget statements, shredded at any stage during the printing process in the lead-up to the 2012-13 budget? Copies of portfolio budget statements were not available at 1:30 pm when the opposition budget lock-up started. I wonder whether the Assistant Treasurer could shed any light on that; whether there was any delay in the loading dock. I am curious as to why those papers were not available when they would ordinarily have been available. 


I also want to talk about the clarity within the budget papers and their transparency in accurately reflecting the Commonwealth's budget position. You would be aware of criticisms from Ross Gittins, who was quite vivid in his criticisms of the actual budget position and how that was communicated—the transparency in a range of transactions that have been shifted off budget and the accounting rationale there; a table that aggregates all those transactions under a range of different headings; and their headline and underlying impacts. You would be aware that he was pointing to a budget surplus when, in his words, 'it actually hides an $8.7 billion budget deficit.' He goes on to say:


The hiding of the headline deficit is just one example of the way the budget papers are becoming less informative rather than more, and the way the spin doctors are turning them into an exercise in media management rather than transparency and accountability.


He provides a number of specific examples. I invite the Assistant Treasurer to address himself to those criticisms that Mr Gittins outlined in relation to payments to NBN Co. as an example, and also on the Clean Energy Development Bank and why that is presented in the way it is in the budget papers.


AAP also had a complaint, which Mr Gittins has alluded to:


This year AAP has accused the government of leaking budget information to selected media for broadcast during the budget lock-up. How's that for duplicity.


Has the Assistant Treasurer had those complaints by the AAP investigated, either by the Treasury or the government? What are the outcomes of those arrangements? Does he agree that this in part undermines the whole point of the lock-up, where there is selective release of information? The Assistant Treasurer and I share a spot on a particular television program, where he is fond of saying, 'I won't be drawn on budget speculation,' and then proceeds to talk about the selective speculation he would love to be drawn on and was actively involved in propagating. 


I would invite the Assistant Treasurer to comment on those two very concerning issues about the integrity and transparency of the process and the papers themselves, and on the bewildering reason why key documents were not available to the opposition as they would ordinarily be in the regular course of events.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (17:16):  The first point that the member for Dunkley raised—which goes to the question of documents and materials that were provided or were intended or meant to be provided to the opposition and the timeliness of their provision—is not a matter that has been raised with me previously. Certainly, that is something that I will endeavour to look into and provide the member for Dunkley with further information on. It is my understanding that it is up to the respective individual departments themselves to make available information to the opposition. I am not aware of any instance in which the way in which departments conducted themselves in the most recent budget departed in any way from the way in which matters would ordinarily occur. I have no knowledge of anything untoward in that regard, but I will certainly have a look at the matters that the member for Dunkley has raised.


I welcome the member for Dunkley's interest in transparency, because with a $70 billion black hole the Australian people are going to be very interested in the transparent in way in which the opposition presents its proposals to the Australian people ahead of the next election. The budget papers, in all regards, comply with the usual accounting practice in terms of how budgets are recorded and matters are disclosed. There is no suggestion that that is not the case. It is good to see the member for Dunkley imbibing his daily or weekly element of Mr Gittins's commentary, because I think the opposition could learn a lot from much of what Mr Gittins has said. He has been a very strong critic of the lack commitment to fiscal discipline on the part of the coalition.


On the question of transparency, the government is very pleased to stand behind a budget that is being returned to surplus. We have stated the reasons why it is so important that we return the budget to surplus. We have done so using all of the accounting mechanisms that would ordinarily apply to the way in which these matters are reported. That will show that we are delivering in 2012-13 a $1.5 billion surplus. The surpluses that will be achieved into the out years grow over time. Of course, this is a remarkable result when we consider what is occurring all around the world at the moment. Indeed, these projections are based upon strong growth, growth that is strong by international standards. There is good reason to believe that those projections will be realised. In recent national accounts data released we see that the Australian economy continued to grow more strongly than any other major advanced economy. The Australian economy today is somewhere in the order of nine per cent larger than the economy that existed before the GFC. We are experiencing growth at rates that no other major advanced economy can even come close to, and we are returning our budget to surplus faster than any other major advanced economy. Indeed, as we return the budget to surplus others are still grappling with very large deficits, and we all operate in the current global economic settings with the inherent challenges they bring.


The government are very pleased that in this budget we have been able to spread the benefits of the mining boom, and that is so important. The national accounts data really did show that the growth in this country is occurring much more strongly in some parts than in others and in some sectors more than in others. As we extract mineral resources in this country today to meet the demands of the global economy and the global marketplace, it is absolutely important that we extract a sufficient and appropriate return for the Australian people from those resources. Through the mining tax and the minerals resource rent tax we are doing that, and we are determined to make sure that the benefits of the boom are being spread. I think that is the responsible thing for the government to do, particularly in a climate where the resources boom, which has meant so much bounty for so many, has also provided structural challenges and changes that have impacted on so many others throughout the economy. This is a very good budget, one that has returned to surplus and one that helps spread the benefits of the mining boom.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (17:21):  I want to ask the Assistant Treasurer about the government's decision to return the budget to surplus, but I also want to make a couple of observations in that context about the state of the Australian economy, which is today nine per cent larger than it was before the global financial crisis. Like the Assistant Treasurer, I am a subscriber to the Treasurer's Economic Note, which reminds me that, compared with pre-GFC levels, the Italian economy is now five per cent smaller, the British economy is three per cent smaller and the Japanese economy is one per cent smaller. Other economies have grown, but not by much. The United States economy is up by one per cent and it is the same with Germany; the Canadian economy is up by four per cent. So the Australian economy, having grown by nine per cent from pre-GFC levels, really is in a class of its own.


I also want to raise the recent national accounts figures. As the Assistant Treasurer has noted, the release of those figures really did give the lie to those who argue that Australia's best days are behind us. As the Treasurer put it, the release of those figures was a week when the optimists won over the pessimists. It is important to put in place productivity-boosting reforms and they are reforms that Labor is currently undertaking. The National Broadband Network, the historic investment in schools and boosting the quality of Australian schools are reforms that will pay dividends, but they will not necessarily pay off in the year in which they are implemented. We know this from looking back at past reforms. We can see, for example, that the deregulation of the financial sector and the cutting of tariffs in the 1980s paid off in productivity in the 1990s.


In terms of Australia's debt level, which naturally goes to the question of the return to surplus, it is worth drawing on a number of observations made in the press recently. The Executive Director of the Australia Institute, Richard Denniss, has noted that Australia's level of public debt is among the lowest in the world. In fact, he noted:


At less than 10 per cent of GDP, the Commonwealth’s Net Debt is so low that the financial sector has urged the Gillard Government to issue more government bonds than is actually necessary to ensure the ‘liquidity’ of the government bond market.


Stephen Koukoulas, in the Australian Financial Review on the morning after the budget, noted, 'Not once did the Howard or Fraser governments in about 20 years in office achieve a single year where government spending was cut in real terms, while Labor governments have been able to cut real spending in five years since the mid-1980s.' Mr Koukoulas further notes that in the 2012-13 budget the ratio of government spending to gross domestic product will fall to 23.5 per cent, which is 0.7 per cent of GDP lower than the average of the 12 Howard government budgets. 'In today's dollars, that is around $10 billion less spending.' George Megalogenis, writing last year in the Australian, had this headline: 'ALP best manager of money, history shows'. Mr Megalogenis goes through the average annual real spending increase when the economy was growing at better than two per cent a year. Those figures show that under John Howard as Treasurer growth was 2.3 per cent. Under Peter Costello mark 1, it was 1.9 per cent. Under Peter Costello mark 2, in the salad days, it was 3.3 per cent. Under Wayne Swan, it was 1.0 per cent.


There is a fear campaign being run by those opposite against the debt that we took on in order to save 200,000 jobs and tens of thousands of small businesses, which I am sure that the member for Dunkley is deeply concerned about. Yet we still see those opposite running scare campaigns on things like the debt cap, which we have been advised to increase in order to take account of the fact that there are fluctuations in government revenues through the course of the year. We are raising the debt cap prudently. But those opposite seem keener on taking a leaf out of the playbook of the US Republicans.


My question to the Assistant Treasurer is: why is the government returning the budget to surplus and why is this important for maintaining Australia's economic prosperity?

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (17:26):  I thank the member for his very informed and insightful contribution. I welcome the opportunity to respond to his question. He asked why it is important to return the budget to surplus. There are many reasons why it is important to return the budget to surplus. We as a government should be attempting to live within our means. When the economic circumstances are as strong as they are—and the economic circumstances in this country stand in stark contrast to the challenges that so many other economies are facing around the globe—these are precisely the times in which governments should be attempting to return their budgets to surplus.


What are the indicators to which I refer? When it comes to solid growth, the recent national accounts figures are a testament to the strength of growth in the Australian economy. I often hear those on the other side allege that the government has a preference for redistribution over wealth creation. The strongest endorsement of this government's commitment to wealth creation is the fact that this economy has grown faster in the period since the global financial crisis than any other major advanced economy. As a Labor government, we are committed to ensuring that there is fairness in the way in which taxation and transfer systems operate. But we also believe first and foremost that an economy must grow. Through growth and enlarging the pie, we are able to give more and more Australians the opportunity, with government support and assistance, to realise their potential so that they can make the contribution that our country requires and deserves from them. Our growth is very strong.


We also operate in a context in which unemployment is relatively low. An unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent is relatively low compared to those economies with which we would normally compare ourselves. If we have a look at those economies in Europe and economies such as the US and the UK, what we see is that our unemployment levels are considerably lower. All of those countries to which I have referred would give their right arms—they would give a limb—to have an unemployment rate with a five in front of it. And that is what we have in Australia. In fact, much of the discourse in this country at the moment is positioned around the challenges of confronting labour and skills shortages. And this is a government that has a plan to address those matters as well. We have strong growth and low unemployment, and we have contained inflation. Containing inflation is the best way that any government can attempt to fight the rising cost of living. Containing inflation is, by definition, a government's efforts to contain rising costs of living. With contained inflation, we see strong growth and low unemployment. At the same time, as the member for Fraser rightly pointed out, our net government debt is amongst the lowest of major advanced economies, peaking at 9.6 per cent this year. In fact, if you look at comparable nations and put them all in a basket and work out their average, our net debt peaks at about one-tenth of the average for those countries. We have low net debt, despite the carry-on and the protestations of the opposition. Whenever they have this discussion they firstly do not wish to acknowledge the international realities and the comparisons with other countries. 


The other point that those opposite seem to forget is that we have been through the global financial crisis. They want to forget that because they are ashamed of their record of having voted against so many of those important measures that we as a government implemented to support jobs. I have mentioned all of these indicators, but the 800,000-plus jobs that we have created in our time in office are perhaps the strongest indication of this government's agenda. It is about growth. It is about jobs. We have delivered those jobs. Often we have had to do it without the support of those opposite, because they come into the parliament and vote against these measures. Then they want to pretend that there was not a significant international economic incident and a period of challenge that we have been through. We tackled it. As a result of having tackled it, hundreds of thousands of Australians had a job who would not have otherwise had a job.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2012-06-18,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (17:31):  The Assistant Treasurer talks about the stimulus measures—I think that is what he is alluding to—which in broad figures saw the budget position expand expenditure by $40 billion in that year. Is it not true that the so-called targeted and temporary measures involving the GFC response were neither temporary nor targeted but that they elevated the floor for Commonwealth expenditure by some $40 billion? It has never turned back. On your analysis, Sir, that would mean that every day that Labor has been in office, we have been in a GFC mode, because there has been no reduction in expenditure or no removal of that GFC stimulus for any of the years that followed. It just represented an elevated floor against which further increases were added. You now claim that those increases were not as substantial as they might have otherwise been, conveniently ignoring the $40 billion uplift in one year under the name of the GFC. Is it not true that those stimulus uplift factors created a new floor for the Commonwealth outlays, that we are now spending $370 billion a year compared to $270 billion a year four years ago, that there has been no restoration of the budget base nor the trajectory that was in place before the GFC, and that all of your comments about modesty in expenditure are completely fallacious because there has been no restoration of the expenditure trajectory prior to the GFC?


On the issue of those outlays and the budget position, may I remind you that you have not delivered a surplus; you have forecasted one. None of your economic forecasts have come within a bull's roar of the end-of-year position. How confident are you that this budget will have some sort of accuracy that belies the track record up to date? What analysis have you done on the sensitivities that you have factored into the budget parameters? I refer to what was a remarkable inclusion under the contingency reserve for budget year 2012-13, which is a sizeable negative number. After some flapping around in Finance estimates, the explanation that was provided for this unusual occurrence was there was a lower than expected March quarter CPI outcome that needed to be factored into the papers and that this was 'received too late in the process to be allocated to individual agencies or functions'. Is this answer accurate and reliable? How is it that this reduced CPI outcome is not reflected anywhere else in the budget or, if it is, can you please point to where it is? Could you give some indication of the size of the downward forecast revision and what this downward forecast revision has meant for revenue? And, to pursue this matter further, in terms of that late revision and the economic parameters that it is supposedly influencing, what are the revenue and growth projections that are now in the budget if you have got that downcast in there covered by a negative contingency reserve amount but it does not appear anywhere else in the budget papers?


I will move on to the budget issue. You touched on debt. If you are claiming it is a surplus, how is it that there is a growth in the debt profile and why are you seeking an increase in the debt ceiling? How is it that the explanation you provided relating to the fluctuations in revenue throughout the year cannot be accommodated by an existing mechanism available to you through the Loan (Temporary Revenue Deficits) Act 1953? How can you credibly say there will be a surplus when you are forecasting a need to increase the debt position? On the issue of the sensitivities regarding the downward revision in GDP, what is the sensitivity to net debt for each year across the forward estimates of a one per cent increase or a one per cent decrease in GDP and where does that leave the final budget position? 


On the issue of taxation, you talk about the taxation measures that are included. When was the decision made to abandon Labor's company tax promise? Less than 24 hours before the Treasurer delivered the budget speech, the Minister for Small Business claimed that that was still part of the budget and, when asked why 92 per cent of small businesses feel that no government policy is helping them, reached for that measure. Being on the Expenditure Review Committee, he must have known that that was not the case, so why was he not being straight with people? That is probably why the member for Deakin has circulated that information. What is the status of the company tax cuts?


Finally, doesn't your budget confirm the abolition of the entrepreneurs tax offset, which will put up the level of taxation on the income of about 400,000 of Australia's smallest businesses? How is that assisting small business, in the manner you claim, in distributing the proceeds of the mining boom?

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (17:36):  I welcome the member for Dunkley's intervention on this occasion. In particular, I welcome his willingness to bring small business front and centre into the debate about what this government is doing. Once again, I am surprised that he would come into this place and seek to draw attention to his own abysmal failure. The member for Dunkley is the shadow small business minister, and he would have to be the only shadow small business minister, certainly from the coalition side, in the history of this parliament who has voted against tax relief for small business. He came into this parliament and voted against tax relief for small business, and then he has the audacity, the hide, to come in here.


But it gets much better than that. He glossed over the fact that he voted against tax relief for small business—the instant asset write-off measure, which will ensure that small businesses all around this country will be able to share in the benefits of the mining boom by getting an upfront deduction, an instant asset write-off for every asset they purchase under $6,500. This will be a massive boost to small business and will give them the capacity to invest in their own capabilities and in their own capital and equipment, making sure that they are able to take advantage of the opportunities that arise in the markets they serve. Not only did he gloss over that point, he had the audacity to come in here and challenge the government when it comes to the question of company tax cuts. Day after day we came into this parliament and those opposite jumped up and down and said, 'We will vote against company tax cuts.' The rationale for that was, they said: 'We don't support the income-generating source. We don't support the minerals resource rent tax. So, because we don't support the minerals resource rent tax, we won't be supporting any of the expenditure measures that are attached to it.' They made that point. They would have an ounce of credibility if they would at least maintain some consistency on that point. But what have they now done? We have handed down a budget where we have made it clear that, despite their determination to block our company tax cuts, we will make sure we spread the benefits of the boom. But we are going to do it by providing some other forms of assistance—in the form of increases to family payments and increases to allowances—to ensure that those individuals and families who are doing it tough share in the benefits of the mining boom. And what did they say? 


All of a sudden they discovered that they were in a position where they could support expenditure measures that were linked to the MRRT. I think the real issue here is that the shadow small business minister does not have the clout in shadow cabinet. When it comes to small business issues, he was not able to get them over the line when it came to supporting a tax cut for business. What a shameful position to be in! He has been the only shadow Liberal small business minister to vote against tax relief for business, but then he got rolled. He got rolled in shadow cabinet on trying to give a company tax cut. For the member for Dunkley to come in here and try to challenge the government when it comes to tax reform, particularly in relation to company tax cuts, not only is really gilding the lily but is beyond the pale. 


The member for Dunkley also made a few points in relation to the global financial crisis. He wants to block it from his memory. We all remember the shameful position that they took when they voted against the stimulus measures that supported this economy—or at least those that managed to turn up to parliament to vote against them. The member for Dunkley voted against them. Hundreds of thousands of jobs have been protected and supported as a result of that. One challenge I hand down for those opposite is that they should come forward and tell us which economy, which country, out of all those economies out there in the world handled the global financial crisis better than Australia.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (17:41):  A bit of coverage on superannuation is important, member for Dunkley. 



Mr Billson interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  He does not need protection; he could take all three of you on. The 2012-13 budget delivers on the government's commitment to return the budget to surplus from surpluses growing over the forward estimates. But, as well as returning to surplus, this budget spreads the benefits of the resources boom to help families on low and middle incomes with the cost of living. The return to surplus is the right decision for the Australian economy because it sustains confidence in Australia's public finances and it strengthens the government's balance sheets to support Australia's capacity to respond to future adverse economic shocks. Return to surplus is appropriate for an economy expected to grow above trend, and it allows monetary policy to return to surplus ahead of any major advanced economy. 


Many other advanced economies are dealing with the very difficult issue of an ageing population and how to make sure that there is enough money for all people who reach 65 to retire. That is why we had some measures in our budget which improve the superannuation prospects of Australians. Unlike the coalition, who consistently vote against increases to superannuation, we on the Labor side believe in boosting Australian's superannuation. We also believe super should be concessionally taxed, and we are making the system fairer for millions of low-income earners by removing the compulsory tax on compulsory superannuation contributions from 1 July 2012. It was also clear to us that a small number of people on very high incomes are getting a better tax deal out of superannuation than millions of Australians on average incomes, because most compulsory superannuation contributions are taxed at a flat rate of 15 per cent, regardless of the person's income. This is why we are making the system fairer by reducing the higher tax concession that the very high-income earners receive on their concessional contributions. Indeed, in this budget we announced that we would take steps to more closely align the tax concession for very high-income earners with the concession received by average-income earners. The government took this step because it is not fair, nor is it good economic policy, to give 128,000 Australians a 30 per cent tax break, excluding the Medicare levy, on their superannuation contributions. We are better targeting the tax concessions for superannuation by reducing the significant concession which very high-income earners receive on their contributions. This reform will affect only people whose income is more than $300,000, which is approximately 1.2 per cent of people contributing to superannuation in 2012-13. We are reducing the tax concession which wealthy taxpayers receive on their contributions from 30 to 15 per cent, so it is more in line with the concession received by people with average earnings. This reform builds on our low-income superannuation contribution, which will make concessions on contributions fairer for about 3.6 million low-paid workers in 2012-13. The low income superannuation tax abolition—that is, getting rid of the 15 per cent tax paid on superannuation by people who earn less than $37,000 a year—will also support, in particular, women. Of the 3.6 million Australians who earn less than $37,000 a year, approximately 2.1 million are women, thus ensuring that they have more money for their retirement, when it is well known that women find it more difficult to save money for their retirement when they have to step in and out of the workforce.


In addition, in 2012-13 and 2013-14, all individuals will be subject to the general concessional cap and will be able to make concessional superannuation contributions of up to $25,000 per year. We are deferring the start date of the higher cap by two years, from 1 July 2012 to 1 July 2014, in light of comments made by industry about the difficulty in administering the higher cap before the new start date. During consultation, the superannuation industry raised concerns in relation to the cost and complexity involved in administering the balance limit and the difficulty some individuals may face in determining whether they are eligible for the higher cap. Deferring the start date will significantly help resolve these issues. It will allow implementation to occur at the same time super funds are making more changes to their systems to report more information to the ATO as part of the SuperStream reforms. In addition, individuals will be able to more easily determine whether they are eligible for the higher cap when the ATO provides access to comprehensive account balance information from early 2014. The Labor government is the only party in federal politics that is interested in improving superannuation for all Australians. (Time expired)

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (17:46):  Could the minister confirm that the superannuation contributions paid by employers that are legislated to increase from nine to 12 per cent are indeed paid for by employers and have been legislated? There has been some suggestion from Labor members that this is subject to some kind of negotiation and wiggle room. That came as news to most people. Could he confirm that that is the case. Could he also turn his mind to a question that has been put to the coalition which relates to the number of small businesses that are suffering at the moment through a 48 per cent increase in small business insolvencies. A number of them point to their business being their retirement nest egg and thank the coalition for the capital gains tax rollover relief and other measures that they had planned to rely upon for their retirement. They point to the lack of appetite for purchasing new businesses or instances where a business has hit the wall and there may be a limited window within which to accumulate a retirement nest egg. Has the minister any plans to examine the contribution cap for mature age people, particularly in light of the reduction that the government has introduced where there might be a limited period of time—say, for the people over the age of 50—to accumulate a retirement nest egg and whether that is on his radar screen?


I move to a related area about the accountants exemption that the minister would be aware of and FOFA changes first announced by then minister Bowen. It was proposed by the government that this exemption would be changed. This has created some uncertainty and concerns for accountants across Australia. Can he update us on progress of the proposed changes to the accountants exemption allowing them to provide advice on setting up or closing SMSF funds? I believe that was to come within weeks back in February. I think the minister was reported as saying that that was forthcoming within the next two weeks. So there is a bit of date slippage, but we are just wondering where that has got to and whether any changes to this measure are being contemplated that deviate from what Mr Bowen had to say. What action is being taken and when will this next two weeks arise as the minister promised? 


I will just more onto another related area, mindful that I suspect the clock will be run down by Labor colleagues. In the investment manager space, can he explain the delay in finalising the investment manager regime legislation? Is one of the issues resourcing of Treasury? I note there was a report of about some four dozen—




Mr Shorten:
  Do you like Treasury? You normally hate them.




Mr BILLSON:
  I am always fond of Treasury. It is Treasurers we have to keep an eye on. We look out for the pre-election budget outcome, because we know your mysterious hand has not gone over those figures and so they have a degree of tidiness about them. Is this an issue of the resourcing of Treasury? Has Treasury received any stakeholder feedback on the delay and is there some reason that that seems not to be 'moving forward', to coin a phrase?


On payday lending, could the minister update us on progress with the proposed payday lending changes contained in the Consumer Credit and Corporation Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Bill 2011? I acknowledge that the minister has appreciated that payday lending is different to microfinance, and there has been some change there.




Mr Shorten:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Owens

Mr Shorten:
  I just want some clarification. Several of the questions asked by the member for Dunkley have nothing to do with the appropriations bill which we are discussing. I am more than happy to answer them but ask that he refer to the part of the budget he is addressing.




Mr BILLSON:
  It is quite simple: Treasury officials are funded by appropriation. You have a football team of them here, Minister. They certainly are related to the budget. I am confident you would be able to cope with them.



Ms O'Dwyer interjecting—




Mr BILLSON:
  I have never seen anything like it before! I hope you appreciate us seeking clarification about how your portfolio is financed, Minister. What is the status of the review of the definition of retail and wholesale clients? The options paper was released in January 2011 and submissions closed over a year ago, on 25 February 2011. It is unclear why it has taken so long. Have any decisions been made to abandon this process or to change the process? When can we expect an announcement relating to that?


Finally, regarding APRA regulated funds, were all of them compensated for losses in Trio? Has the process for providing compensation been finalised? I would be grateful for an answer to a couple of those questions. (Time expired)

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (17:51):  Following on from the Chief Opposition Whip's interest in fishing, the member for Dunkley has decided to do his own form of fishing which cannot be regulated by protection of the Barrier Reef. Fair enough. The most substantial question which the member for Dunkley led off with was about superannuation and who pays it. Let me be very clear on this matter. It is not appropriate for the opposition to spend their time scaring business and misleading people about who pays for superannuation. Superannuation increases are paid for out of the creation of value and wealth in enterprises going forward. For this, I submit the real-world evidence of what happened between 1992 and 2002. Over that time period, where compulsory superannuation was increased from three per cent to nine per cent, we saw at the same time a decrease in the unit labour costs of business, an increase in business profit as a share of GDP, an fall in unemployment from 11 per cent to something around six per cent and a rise in real wages in a continual pattern. It is not good enough that those opposite, who are the shipwreck survivors of the Howard-Costello era, without necessarily the capacity of some of those former members, have forgotten their own party's record on superannuation. What they always do is initially oppose and then they try to own the changes.




Ms O'Dwyer:
  Why don't you talk about your record?




Mr SHORTEN:
  The member for Higgins, who has had a very bad weekend in preselections, is now interjecting. What I recall is that her former boss, the former member for Higgins and the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, acknowledged the benefits of superannuation. I touched a raw nerve there with the member for Higgins. As for who pays, it is paid for out of the creation of productive value in enterprises. The only way you could argue that it is some sort of a cost on business would be to suggest that there will never be real wage increases in the whole period going forward and that the wages in 2013 would, without superannuation, be the same remuneration received by employees in 2019, which is patently false. The question of who pays is clearly and succinctly dealt with. To paraphrase former Prime Minister Keating, 'When conservatives tell you that this is some sort of tax on employers, they are either misinformed or they are lying, and they are wrong.'


Some of the other questions raised by the member for Dunkley include the proposition that superannuation is another impost on small business. Having first established that it is not actually what it has been described as by the shadow minister for small business, I would also remind him of the measures which this government has put in the actual appropriation bill to help small businesses. Of course, that includes not least the loss carry-back provisions. I also remind him of the deduction for motor vehicles which are purchased. I remind him of the tax deduction for purchase of capital equipment. These are real measures which help small business.


Of course, in politics it does not do anyone any credit to practise political amnesia. The reason why small business did not get a tax cut is that those opposite were against it. To quote the Assistant Treasurer in the chamber, the first spokesperson for small business ever in the history—



Ms O'Dwyer interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  The louder you shout, Member for Higgins, your logic does not improve. Does anyone remember a coalition small business spokesperson ever voting against a tax cut for small business? You look through the history. You look through Hansard from 1901. There is only one person who wins that prize, and that is the current member for Dunkley.


He also asked questions about contribution caps. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black! There is only one party in this parliament that believes in increasing the contribution caps. That is the Labor Party; that is the government. We believe in increasing the contribution caps for people over 50. The opposition, as on many things in terms of policy for the nation, have their policy on contribution caps in a witness protection program. We know they cannot afford to be positive and match Labor's policy of lifting it to $50,000 in 2014 for people over 50 with account balances up to half a million dollars. We know that those opposite cannot afford to be positive because they cannot afford to pay the bills. They have done no work in opposition and they do not know how they are going to fund it.



In terms of the other questions asked by the member for Dunkley, the IMR regime legislation will come forward soon, as will legislation on payday lending. We are most interested to see if those opposite will actually support reform of payday lending. In terms of the accountants' exemption, that will be resolved fairly soon after continued discussions with all the relevant bodies. In terms of the APRA-regulated funds within Trio, people who had money which has been lost through malfeasance in APRA-regulated funds have in fact been compensated. (Time expired)

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (17:57):  Obviously this is an opportunity for us to talk about the things that actually matter for real people in real places like the seat of Robertson. If it were not for Labor, with a vision for the future and a capacity to articulate with hope for an Australia where there is an opportunity for people to share in the wealth, there would never have been a superannuation scheme. Right now, at this point of time, in the budget that is before the House at this stage, we see another articulation of what it means to be Labor and to believe in ordinary Australians.


In my seat, there are a number of groups of people who I have particular concerns about, Minister. I would really be very keen to hear how the government's reforms that are being revealed through Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013, which is before us today, will assist these particular groups of people. First of all, I am thinking of people who are roughly at the age of 30. Thankfully, having grown up in a period after Labor brought in superannuation, these young 30-year-olds know the term 'superannuation', and in their lives they will have some experience of the benefits that that has given to people who are older. But, for our 30-year-olds, what does what we are about to implement with the appropriation bill coming to pass actually mean?


Another question I would really like a response on, Minister, is about the commitment that we have to people who manage on a very low income. What is it that Labor is doing in this appropriation bill to make sure that low-income earners in the seat of Robertson are going to get the advantage of having voted in a Labor government, knowing that we are going to honour our word and honour our ideological commitment to making sure all Australians move forward together? What is there for the low-income earners of Robertson?


One of the features of the seat in which I live is that we have a large number of people—over 18 per cent of the population in my seat—over 60. I note that many of them have given great service to this country and have an incredible level of experience that they still want to contribute to the community. Being over 70 does not mean that you are unemployable; it means that you are much more employable in many, many ways than others. What are we doing to help people who are over 70 in my electorate to get their fair share of what is going on in this country?


It would be unsuitable for me not to ask a question about women. Being a working mother myself and having faced all of the wonderful opportunities and challenges that come with being a working mother, I know that Labor has a legislative commitment to advance women's rights and issues, to advance the economic potential for women to provide for their own futures and to have a secure retirement. We know that, currently, women are terribly underfunded in terms of their retirement savings. What is there in this budget that helps and supports women in getting better equity in life outcomes?


I know there has been considerable argy-bargy here this afternoon with regard to small business, but the reality is this is a government that absolutely understands that small business is a major employer. In seats like my seat of Robertson, where there is a large service and retail sector, small business employers really need the advantages of what we can offer them as a federal government at this point in time. I am very interested, Minister, to hear what is in the appropriations bill that we can give to the small businesses in the seat of Robertson.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Oakeshott
):  I thank the member for Robertson and I will call on the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation to respond. It is by agreement that we go through to 6.30 pm. I am conscious that we will chew in to people's time if there are further questions for the Minister for Financial Services. I will therefore let the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation respond, but then I am keen, as chair, to get over to the new minister.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (18:01):  I will try to be brief in answering that question. In terms of the propositions made about superannuation, there have been a range of measures made in this appropriations bill and there has been work done by the Treasury officials funded in this appropriations bill previously and going forward. So, adopting the standard of the member for Dunkley, I will range widely in terms of giving a comprehensive but brief answer to the member for Robertson.


First of all, Labor is the party of superannuation. Without the successive Labor governments, the superannuation system as we know it now—universal and providing retirement nest eggs as part of people's retirement strategies—simply would not exist. It is also fair to advise the electors of Robertson that, whenever the coalition has had an opportunity to increase superannuation, they have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. Again, the latest budget just represents more of the same of their DNA—to make superannuation the preserve of just some, not all.


In particular, the member for Robertson asked me about what is being done to in support for women and their superannuation. I would obviously refer not only to this budget but also to earlier legislation which has seen the abolition of the 15 per cent contributions tax paid by people who earn less than $37,000. As the member for Robertson well knows, a high proportion of the very large number of Australians who earn less than $37,000 are women. What we have done is, basically, provided in the course of this year an almost billion-dollar tax concession to the low paid. That is good news for the people of Robertson, in particular to the women electors who earn less than $37,000.


But that is part of the broader superannuation strategy in which we have been assisted by Treasury. We have increased the rate from nine to 12 per cent—that is good. We have abolished the tax for the low paid—that is equitable. We have put on a slightly higher charge for people who earn over $300,000—that is equitable and it is making sure that tax concessions are falling to those who most need them. We have also been improving the back office. I do acknowledge that the coalition today has voted to support some of our efforts in the back office operation of the SuperStream levy. We have also managed—although we were opposed by the opposition—to abolish the discrimination against people over 70 who are employees. Courtesy of this government, if the member for Robertson has people over 70 who are still employees, they will, from next year, be able to get superannuation on what they earn.


In addition we have propositions in the parliament about better governance of superannuation. We had to take the difficult decision to defer the concession caps—that is the amount of money you put into superannuation above which you do not get the tax concession advantage. We had hoped to make it $50,000 per annum for people over 50. This year, clearly, the need to get back into surplus and the wise economic stewardship of the nation required a deferral of a quite attractive proposition to July 2014. I note also, for the member for Robertson to advise her electors, that we are the only political party interested in having an increase in the concessional caps. Unfortunately, we have heard nothing from the opposition—they are very good on the negative but not so good on the positive—in terms of superannuation.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Oakeshott
):  We have three ministers here at the moment. On the agreement I have in front of me there is only a need for one to be before us, but I will leave it up to those on the jump to test their luck. The member for Higgins.

He has 16 officials sitting behind him. I think it has been an enormous waste of an opportunity. It is, again, a demonstration that the government is trying to avoid scrutiny.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I have only just taken the chair so I do not know what happened previously. The Federation Chamber is dealing with proposed appropriation for the Treasury portfolio of $4,441,842,000. The question is that the proposed expenditure for the Treasury portfolio be agreed to.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (18:06):  Tonight I have serious concerns about the management of the tourism portfolio. This is an industry, when you combine tourism and hospitality, that employs about one million people or 8.8 per cent of the Australian workforce. The issue I want to start with is the funding for Tourism Australia. When this government came to power the budget for Tourism Australia was $136,269,000. This year the proposed budget is $130,178,000 and in the forward estimates it is $134,556,000. This is the lowest funding level ever for Tourism Australia—the lowest funding ever for an industry that employs a million people. In fact, in real terms, the dollar loss between 2007 and 2012 is $18,949,000 or 16 per cent, and projected through to the forward estimates it is $22,943,000 or 19 per cent less. So, Minister, given that last year Australians spent 132 million bed nights on holidays overseas and that in 2008 Australia dropped from fourth to 13th place in the World Economic Forum's travel and tourism competitiveness index rankings, how do you justify reducing the budget for Tourism Australia when the numbers have dropped off so massively?


The second thing I want to raise with you, Minister, is about your announcement on 2 May, the week before the budget, when you launched the Australian Tourism Investment Guide with great fanfare, yet in the budget—and you must have been aware of this—the MIT withholding rate was increased from 7½ to 15 per cent. Minister, surely you would have understood that that was going to have a massive effect. You got people wound up, geed up and excited about investing in Australia and then, after barely a week had gone by, that confidence for overseas investment particularly in our hotel industry was absolutely destroyed. It is no secret that there is a bed shortage in Australia, particularly of quality hotel accommodation. We both agree on that. So how do you address the fact that you launched the policy knowing what was going to be in the budget? You are a cabinet minister and I can only assume that things affecting your portfolio would have been discussed with you.


The third thing I wish to raise with you, Minister, in the limited time we have here is the passenger movement charge. When you came to government in 2007 the passenger movement charge was $38. It was increased to $47. It is now proposed to increase it to $55. Minister, how do you justify a 45 per cent increase in a tax when this, projected through on the forward estimates, will raise $1.04 billion but the operational cost for Customs in delivering the services is around $239 million? On top of that, how do you justify putting a CPI on the PMC tax going forward from next year? Minister, given that you turned up at the National Tourism Alliance on 2 March, the final line under item 2 of their communique says:


The Minister stated there would be no increase in the passenger movement charge.


And then later on, in discussion on 'passenger facilitation', it said:


The Minister informed the meeting he had heard of no proposal to raise the PMC in the upcoming budget.


Minister, how can an industry have confidence if you are telling them one thing before a budget and doing something different afterwards, or does this equate to the promise that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead' and then you introduce one? You have gone to the tourism industry and told them that there will be no increases in the PMC, and then after the budget they find that they are getting whacked.


I know you are going to say that you are offsetting with the Asia Marketing Fund of $61 million. Minister, your CPI increase alone will collect $156 million just on the CPI increase, and you are giving $61 million back to the industry. How do you justify that when our tourism industry is doing it so tough?

Mr MARTIN FERGUSON
 (Batman—Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (18:11):  Firstly, I note that I was here ahead of time. There was half an hour set aside and I will be leaving at 6.30 because it is in accordance with the scheduled timing of this portfolio.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Oakeshott
):  You can rest assured that the chamber will be moving onto other business at 6.30 pm—




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  I take it from the honourable member's intervention that, based on his reference to the passenger movement charge, the media release that attacked the New South Wales government over its dramatic change last week with respect to the movement of passengers in the cruise ship industry—





Mr Baldwin:
  This is about your government, Minister, and your accountability.




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  Let us have a little bit of consistency when it comes to the question of the movement of Australians in and out of Australia. It is all right when out of the blue the New South Wales government introduces a new cruise ship tax of $20 per person, whereas previously it was an amount levied on each vessel by the appropriate port authorities. 




Mr Baldwin:
  Minister, this is about your tax!




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  If it is good enough for the coalition in New South Wales to do this, then why can't the Australian government similarly adjust taxes as required? 


Perhaps the member for Paterson should also give the House an explanation as to why it was all right for the coalition when in government to increase the passenger movement charge on a regular basis, but it is not all right for the current Australian Labor government to do so. Let us go through a little bit of history in terms of when he was a member of the Howard government over 13 long years.




Mr Baldwin:
  You are not answering the question.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! Is the honourable member seeking to ask a question?




Mr Baldwin:
  No, I am seeking to answer a question, as the minister has actually asked me a question.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No, sit down please.




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  Let us go to the passenger movement charge. Yes, there was an increase in the budget—




Mr Baldwin:
  A rip-off.




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  just as there was an increase in the passenger movement charge in 1999 by the Howard government, from $27 to $30. Then they sought to create the impression that this would just be to cover short-term costs related to the Olympic Games, but all of a sudden we found that increase was to continue—it was set in concrete.


Then we go to 2001. It increased in 1999 and then in 2001we had a further increase from $30 to $38, an increase of 27 per cent. So it is good for the coalition, it is okay to increase the passenger movement charge, but when it comes to a government of an alternative political persuasion it is not appropriate.


Let us also go to what we did as against the opposition. The increase in the passenger movement charge will have a minimal impact on the Australian tourism industry, because it is actually going better than the member for Paterson would like it to go both internationally and domestically. The average international visitor during the 2010-11 financial year spent $4,096 when visiting Australia. The proposed increase in the passenger movement charge of $8, or 17 per cent—a lower increase than the 27 per cent increase in 2001—represents only a small cost in the context of total visitor spend: 0.2 per cent.


I also inform the House that work undertaken in 2011 by the Centre of Economic Policy at the University of New South Wales on behalf of the state and territory governments—overseen by Tourism Research Australia—modelled a 20 per cent increase in the passenger movement charge, higher than what the government proposes. It found that it would have minimal impact on international visitation and potentially a positive impact in terms of Australians not going overseas, which is one of the desires of the Australian tourism industry. At the moment, we have 5.5 million visitors per year from overseas with 7.5 million Australians going overseas per year because of the strength of the Australian dollar—and the strength of the Australian economy.


On the question relating to how the Australian tourism industry is going, the truth is that in relative terms, given the challenges in North America and Europe—and I suppose the opposition spokesman has not noticed that there are major economic challenges in North America and Europe at the moment—international tourism is doing well from an Australian perspective. In 2011, there were 5.9 million international arrivals, a similar result to 2010, which is not bad given the challenges in Europe and North America. Growth in Chinese arrivals was particularly strong, with an increase of 19.4 per cent in one year. Indonesian arrivals were up 13.2 per cent—and people forget the importance of Indonesia. And there was an increase in Indian arrivals of 6.8 per cent. (Time expired)

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (18:17):  I ask the minister if he would not mind switching hats for me—switching from his beach hat to his mining and resources hard hat. I have a great deal of sympathy for you, because you strike me as quite a practical man. I do not know how you manage to sit through some of your cabinet meetings listening to the bulldust about the carbon tax. I know that in your heart of hearts, Minister, you do not actually believe in what you are being forced to implement.


I want the minister to try to explain to me the seemingly contradictory position that he has. He has openly spoken about his support for efforts to clean up brown coal, possibly for export purposes. I think that it was the minister who coined the phrase, 'The Latrobe Valley could be the Pilbara of Victoria.' I believe that that position contradicts and is in stark contrast with your government's contract-for-closure policy, under which you are seeking to force the closure of 2,000 megawatts of brown coal power production and force the owners of those power stations out of business. Perhaps the minister can explain to me the miracle that occurs on the ships as they cross the seas in which this brown coal is somehow cleaned of its carbon content. Minister, I do not believe that you have any love for the contract-for-closure policy. Previously, you have left yourself a fair bit of wriggle room in your comments. You are saying that it is not contract for closure at any price. You are probably the only minister who has left himself a bit of wriggle room in that regard.


On the contract-for-closure policy, given that we are just days away from the 1 July deadline the government has set, will the minister deny that the government is going to announce an extension of time for this process? Isn't it a fact, Minister, that the whole process is completely off the rails and there is no prospect of an agreement within the next couple of weeks and that you need an extension of time to try and salvage something from this policy wreckage? Rather than announce an extension of time, Minister, why won't you do what you really want to do, which is abandon this dud of a policy, a policy that will cost jobs and do nothing to change the temperature of the planet? Minister, we both know that closing coal-fired power stations in the Latrobe Valley will not deliver a single direct environmental benefit anywhere in the world. We both know that contract for closure is a dud policy. Minister, will you deny that the government is going to announce an extension of time on its contract-for-closure policy?

Mr MARTIN FERGUSON
 (Batman—Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (18:19):  Let us, firstly, deal with the nature of the Latrobe Valley. The Latrobe Valley is rich in brown coal reserves. Let us also be frank, historically it is not able to be exported because it of its high moisture content and its combustible nature. The government is therefore absolutely involved with the Victorian government in exploring potential technology opportunities. The opportunities are basically driven by the private sector to which both parties are prepared to make a financial contribution and to assess potential technology, which would reduce the moisture content, and hence make it exportable. Also from an export potential it would represent a further energy opportunity for countries not as rich in resources as Australia in reducing emissions. For example, one of the projects involves Australian proponents in association with a company out of India. The lignite in the Latrobe Valley is akin to the lignite in India—high in moisture content—and if we break through on the technology front we create a new export opportunity.


I am pleased to say that there are a whole variety of potential technology solutions in the Latrobe Valley including carbon caption storage which we also committed money to in trying to guarantee the future of the Latrobe Valley. In terms of the contract-for-closure process, obviously there are a range of issues of a commercial-in-confidence nature. I can also say that a number of the applicants—as has the government—have negotiated in good faith. They are interested in assessing whether or not it is possible within the envelope provided by government to enter into an agreement over time to reduce the emissions in the Latrobe Valley in terms of the high-emitting nature of the Latrobe Valley. No-one can deny that in relative terms the emissions out of a coal fired power station in Victoria are significantly higher than most other coal fired power stations in Australia.


Hence, we also have the approach to technology of how to reduce the moisture content and, in doing so, reduce the emissions. With respect to the contract-for-closure process, if we make the breakthrough in technology, who will know what we will get out of the contract-for-closure process? There is an envelope and I will not go beyond the envelope because our assessment of what is value for money in terms of those existing power stations. Should one power station, for example, close, a change on technology can guarantee the future life and even potentially extend the life of other coal fired power stations because of the potential capacity to reduce emissions.


These processes and negotiations are continuing, including with HRL and Energy Brix. I had further discussions today including, I might say, with the Victorian government to assess all available options. The real issue is: how do we assist the Latrobe Valley in creating a new future. I remind the honourable member that, under a direct action of his own coalition party room's policy at the last election, their intent to close power stations in the Latrobe Valley was absolutely reflected in direct action. I am reminding him of the policy at the last election—he was a candidate at the last election—



Mr Chester interjecting—




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  It would be done by using consolidated revenue, which would close the Latrobe Valley because the coalition at the time also appreciated—



Mr Chester interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order!




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  If possible, we had to work on a technological front to reduce the emissions and to guarantee the Latrobe Valley a future. That is what I am consumed with and that is why I have a close working relationship with my Victorian counterpart, the minister for regional development, and with Mr Ryan the Deputy Premier of Victoria.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Have you concluded your answer, Minister?




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  Yes. If he gets his time, he could ask another question.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Does the member for Gippsland seek to ask a question?




Mr Chester:
  Yes, if that is okay, Mr Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Minister, will you allow a question?

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (18:24):  Very briefly, Minister, in your comments you referred to the fact that Latrobe Valley coal could not be exported and perhaps used in China, India, Korea and Japan. If it is okay for the Latrobe Valley coal to be used in those contexts, why is it not okay for Latrobe Valley power station workers to keep their jobs?

Mr MARTIN FERGUSON
 (Batman—Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (18:24):  Consider my answer. I refer to the technology which reduces the moisture content therefore, potentially, makes it exportable because it is no longer combustible. It also means the end use has low emissions, be it in Australia or overseas. My answer also referred to the fact that, if you get the necessary break from technology for whatever power stations that may continue operation in the valley, it makes them lower emitting; therefore, more viable under a carbon tax regime.

Mr IAN MACFARLANE
 (Groom) (18:25):  I ask the minister a few questions about the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute. Does he agree with the new CEO of that institute, Brad Page, who said in the press on the weekend in regard to the seed capital of $100 million a year being given to the institute that it 'was more than it knew how to spend' and said further:


It's actually impossible to spend that amount of money responsibly.


Does the minister agree with that statement? If he does not agree with that statement, can he explain to the House exactly what control he and his department have over the expenditure of the institute, which according to an article written by Lenore Taylor—who I am sure the minister has respect for because Lenore gets things right—describes a lavish lifestyle of that committee as it travelled first-class around the world having meetings at exorbitantly expensive venues. The questions are: does he agree with Brad Page that it is actually impossible to spend that amount of money responsibly, and can he explain what control he has over the institute to stop it wasting money?

Mr Ian Macfarlane interjecting—




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  I might have had other issues to attend to over the weekend. The total Australian government funding for the institute is $315 million to 2016-17. You will find that, since the institute was first established through normal budget processes, I as the minister have been part of the process of winding back, in my opinion, the institute's allocation of funding to what we believed was appropriate. I was part of that process. The initial figure raised is no longer the figure, as the honourable member appreciates.


The current funding allocation enables us to pull our weight internationally as the major coal-exporting nation in the world, to participate in other countries in terms of the research and learning processes potentially related to how we reduce the cost of carbon capture and storage. The technology is not proven; the issue is how to reduce the cost to commercialisation. In the same way we have to work out how we reduce the cost of every other form of clean energy, be it nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal or whatever. Our responsibility as a nation is to invest in R&D in these alternative forms of clean energy with one exception. We are not investing in nuclear because, frankly, we do not have to. If Australia at some point decides to go nuclear, there are further technological advances being made by other countries, who are responsible for this technology, which we will buy off the shelf at a point in the future if the community so decides. For other forms of clean energy such as carbon capture and storage, we have to pull our weight.

I have confidence in the new CEO, Mr Page, to attend to the requirements of the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute in terms of current government funding and accountability, and, I might say, moving it to a model which requires industry to commence part funding of this organisation. We either front up and invest in technology or we walk away from reducing emissions, because fossil fuels, whether some people like it or not, are part of our future.

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:20):  I would like to make some remarks in opening about the departmental budget for 2012-13 for the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. The department will receive an appropriation totalling $218.5 million. Of this, the department will receive administered funding of $114.1 million, down quite significantly on last year as a result of the termination of various programs. It will receive departmental funding of $97 million and capital funding of $7.4 million. In addition, the Clean Energy Regulator associated with the department has been established and it will receive an appropriation totalling $763.1 million, comprising administered funding of $670.8 million and departmental funding of $92.3 million.


The major components of the department's administered funding include the Low Carbon Communities program, energy efficiency measures, land measures and climate change science applications. Measures for the portfolio announced in the 2012-13 budget included $37.1 million for the Greenhouse and Energy Minimum Standards program, $2.8 million for the building energy efficiency program and $3 million for climate change adaptation. Additionally, in the budget the government decided not to proceed with the tax breaks for the green buildings program. That will provide a saving of $405.2 million over the forward estimates.


The budget for the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency is fiscally responsible. It reflects the fact that much of the government's climate change policy is now contained in the clean energy legislation, the policy for which was announced in July last year. The clean energy legislation and its implementation from 1 July in the form of the carbon price mechanism in particular will decouple economic growth from growth in pollution. Our economy will grow but greenhouse gas emissions will fall, reducing the emissions intensity of the economy over time. It will improve Australia's economic competitiveness in the coming decades when clean energy and low-pollution technologies will be a key to competitive advantage. That is particularly going to be the case in the Asia-Pacific region, where our major trading partners are located. The economies that are able to reduce their emissions intensity—the greenhouse gas emissions per unit of economic output—will have a competitive advantage. That is why it is perfectly valid to assert that the introduction of the carbon price mechanism will drive not only emissions intensity reductions in our economy but productivity improvements as well. Those opposite contend quite differently. No doubt that will be part of the debate that we will have in the upcoming period of time.


The Clean Energy Act become law nearly eight months ago. Since that time, the fact of the matter is that there has been record investment in our economy and exceptional economic growth. We are currently growing faster than every single major advanced economy, as illustrated by the figures released two weeks ago. GDP growth is currently running at 4.3 per cent. Unemployment is at five per cent. We have very high levels of business investment, with more than $173 billion in capital expenditure expected in the year 2012-13 and half a trillion dollars in the resource investment pipeline. This is an essential economic reform at a time when the economy is in a strong position. It is in the long-term interests of the country. As 1 July comes closer—it is now less than two weeks away—I think people will have the opportunity to experience the real world rather than baseless fear campaigning in relation to this issue. The economy is strong. This is a reform that needs to be made and the policy measures associated with the clean energy future package are included in the 2012 budget position for the department.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2012-06-18,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (16:25):  I take my beginning from where the minister left off with his reference to the real world, lived experience of the carbon tax. I note in particular the decision of the New South Wales Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal to authorise electricity price rises of 18 per cent from 1 July. I note that, as part of that, in the average case across the state at least 50 per cent of that increase will be as a consequence of the carbon tax and that, in the case of Integral Energy, up to 85 per cent of the price rise will result directly and solely from the carbon tax.


The rise in prices is going to occupy almost the entire amount of the 10 per cent allocated by the government in its modelling. I refer specifically to Strong growth, low pollution:modelling a carbon price: update,from late 2011, and, in particular, to page 12, where it says, 'Over the first five years of the carbon tax'—not just the first day—'the price rise as a consequence of the carbon tax on electricity will be 10 per cent.' Is the minister really saying that there will be no further price rises as a consequence of the carbon tax in the electricity space? I refer to the fact that the government's own modelling shows a more than 25 per cent increase in the carbon tax on electricity between now and 2017. In particular, the most recent budget showed that the rise would be from $23 to $29 on the carbon price by 2015-16.


Will the minister deny that that 25 per cent plus increase in the carbon price will have any impact on future electricity prices? Will the minister deny that the auctioning of forward permits in April 2014 and beyond for the electricity sector will have any impact on electricity prices? This is particularly so given that the Electricity Supply Association of Australia warned last year that this additional forward auctioning of permits would add another 10 per cent to the price of electricity immediately. So I refer to the fact that five years worth of electricity price rises will have occurred on day one. Does the minister believe that there will be no impact from the additional 25 per cent increase in the carbon tax and does the minister believe that there will be no impact from the auctioning of forward permits, which the Electricity Supply Association of Australia has predicted as of April 2014 will have a further 10 per cent impact on prices?

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:28):  The government has a great degree of confidence in the modelling that has been undertaken. It was independent modelling of a very comprehensive nature by the federal Treasury, supported in the case of the energy market by two private organisations that did extensive modelling of the electricity price impact. We stand by what that modelling says, which is a 10 per cent increase in household electricity prices averaged across the country. Different scenarios were contained in that modelling and the government has a lot of confidence in them.


It is interesting and—from a standpoint where the Leader of the Opposition has been saying there would be an unimaginable price impact and at various times has asserted that electricity prices will rise by 25 per cent and then 30 per cent and even more—it is important to note now that in various jurisdictions regulators are examining this issue and what the real-world price impact will be, and they are confirming that the Treasury modelling is accurate. Just last week, the South Australian regulator issued the estimated price impact in South Australia, and it is $1.50 averaged across households in South Australia. In Western Australia, it is averaging $2.50. In New South Wales, IPART has confirmed that it is $3.30. It is important that we keep these things in some perspective. We certainly have a lot of confidence in the modelling. The regulators are now resolving that the electricity price impacts are consistent with what the Treasury said; in fact, in some jurisdictions it is less than what the Treasury had estimated. 


The other important point to make is that the attribution of carbon pricing to everything that is happening with electricity prices has been misrepresented in this debate. In various jurisdictions, electricity prices have risen by over 50 per cent over the last several years. I was in Western Australia last week. Electricity prices have risen by 50 per cent, I think, in two years in Western Australia. None of these things have anything to do with carbon pricing, which commences just from 1 July. My colleague the member for Chifley and I, as New South Wales politicians, are acutely aware that there was, I think, an 18 per cent increase in electricity prices in New South Wales last year This had nothing to do with carbon pricing, and it came off the back of previous significant increases. This has all been driven by the investment in poles and wires in our transmission and distribution system in a host of jurisdictions throughout the country. An urgent investment has been recognised as necessary in those areas. If there is excessive investment—and I note that some commentators are indicating that gold-plating is going on—then that is an issue that needs to be tackled by the relevant jurisdictions and the relevant electricity market regulators. 


It is very important to make that point about what is really driving electricity prices in this country. There has been an underinvestment in the network for quite a significant period. It is important that it be addressed. It is important that it not be gold-plated. We have to do all that we can to help people at a household level deal with the impact of these price rises. Only $9 in every $100 that a household consumer pays in their electricity bill is going to be attributable to the carbon price, averaged across the country. To assist, the government have announced—and it is the only government acting in this way—a significant number of measures to assist households with these cost pressures. Specifically, with the introduction of the carbon price, there is $3.30 a week averaged electricity price impact and $10.10 assistance provided by the Commonwealth through tax cuts, increases to pensions, increases to family tax benefits, payments to many self-funded retirees, payments to many veterans and increases in a host of other Commonwealth entitlements. This is what is important to bear in mind. Clearly the coalition, having failed in its fear campaigning up to this in time and confronted now with some facts about actual increases, are now moving to try to scare people about impacts over the next five years. They cannot have it every way. The facts will out with the fear.

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (16:33):  I thank the minister for his attendance today and for the opportunity to ask him some questions, particularly given the Gippsland-Latrobe Valley region is recognised, I think even by the government, as one of the regions that will be most adversely affected by the carbon price—or the 'carbon tax', as we like to call it in the Latrobe Valley, even though apparently no-one on the other side of the House likes to call it a 'tax' anymore. I will refer specifically to the regional structural adjustment package, which is supposedly being developed as part of the government's carbon tax package. It has been confirmed by the minister for regional development that there are no guidelines in place for the distribution of this $200 million package. Even when you consider that this $200 million package is grossly inadequate to assist the affected regions, it strikes me as staggering that we are only days away from the implementation of the carbon tax and this $200 million structural adjustment package is without guidelines.


Given that there are no guidelines now and that the tax will come into effect in just a couple of weeks time, can the minister explain how regions which are going to be adversely affected by the carbon tax will be compensated for those adverse impacts?


The Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government was in my electorate quite recently—I think it was last Wednesday or Thursday—and he gave the impression that the vast bulk of the money that was allocated under the package would be contingent upon regions demonstrating that they had been adversely affected by the policy through such things as contracts for closure. Given that the government so far has refused to fund even a socioeconomic analysis of the Latrobe Valley to assess what the impacts of the carbon tax or a contract for closure would be, I am interested to know how the government proposes to demonstrate which regions have been adversely affected and how these funds will be allocated. On that specific issue of the contract for closure, given that we are just days away from the implementation of the carbon tax and given that the government was going to make some announcements on 1 July in relation to the contract-for-closure tender process, will the minister deny that the government is going to announce an extension of time for contract for closure?

 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:35):  I thank the member for Flinders for his questions. I appreciate that he has a number of apprehensions, and I hope that I can dispel them to the extent appropriate this afternoon. Sometimes the coalition believe their own propaganda, and I think that is part of the problem we are dealing with here. They have gone around the country—and in particular the Leader of the Opposition—to regions like the Latrobe Valley and terrified the living daylights out of people and created enormous apprehension. I have experienced the same in my own region, which is a coalmining region, where, because the Leader of the Opposition has done the most unconscionable thing and stood before people and said to them, 'You are going to lose your job,' it has created enormous apprehension—



Mr Chester interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The minister is responding.




Mr COMBET:
  One of the first things I learned as a trade union official is that you never, ever, ever mislead people, and the Leader of the Opposition will pay for what he has done. He has created this apprehension in the Latrobe Valley and in many other regions with statements to the effect that Whyalla will be wiped off the map. Just imagine what that means to families in Whyalla—what a disgrace. You have to stand before people and deal with them with some integrity, and that has been lacking in the coalition's approach. As the carbon price comes into effect, this will become clearer and clearer to members of the community, including the Latrobe Valley. 


I do not suggest the question was put in any inappropriate way. I know that the member is genuine in his concerns, but I think that we have to keep things in perspective here. We are acutely conscious of the circumstances that the Latrobe Valley and, in particular, the brown coal generation sector find themselves in. A very significant amount of funding of course was allocated in the form of energy security payments in the package to ensure that there was confidence on the part of the investors, the equity holders and the debt providers, for the brown coal generators in the Latrobe Valley, and I think there is evidence that those payments have been successful by their continuing confidence in the assets that are there. That is very important for people's jobs as well. The government committed significant funds to ensure that there was ongoing confidence in those assets and in the region.


I have visited the Latrobe Valley a couple of times over the last 12 or 18 months to talk to people about this issue, and I can assure the member that I am as concerned as anyone else to ensure the wellbeing of that community. A number of the electricity generators in the Latrobe Valley region did indicate that they would like to discuss, in the appropriate process, the contract-for-closure issue, and those discussions have been continuing in an appropriate way through the department of my colleague the Minister for Resources and Energy. They are commercial-in-confidence discussions. Our public policy announced in July last year, to which we continue to adhere, is that that process would be brought to a conclusion by 30 June, which of course is imminent. That remains our policy position. 


It is not appropriate for me to speculate on the outcome at this point in time, but the process that we initiated should appropriately be continued and a conclusion reached. I can say to people in the Latrobe Valley that we are very mindful of the circumstances there. We have put a lot of resources into supporting them. We are working very closely with the business community and, I might add, with the Victorian government in relation to these issues.

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:40):  I appreciate the question because it gives me the opportunity to put on the record once again a number of the difficulties that are confronting the aluminium-smelting sector in particular. Essentially, there has been a very significant fall in aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange—in fact, a 40 per cent depreciation in prices over the last few years—and that is impacting on the profitability of much of the aluminium industry within our domestic economy. Added to that, given the strength of the economy and the investment in the resources sector in particular, we have been experiencing a high dollar, above parity with the US dollar, for some months, and for an extended period of time the value of the dollar has been well above its historical average. It could be that that situation will be sustained for a significant period of time, given the strength of the economy and the drivers of the high valuation of the Australian dollar in the marketplace. Those two factors alone—low prices, associated with oversupply in the international market, and the high value of the Australia dollar—are impacting significantly.


Added to that, of course, are pressures arising from the fact that long-term electricity contracts that had been negotiated between various state governments or state instrumentalities with the aluminium smelters, as is the case particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, in recent times and in the coming years are expiring. They are contracts that have had perhaps a 25- to 30-year term. Many of those contracts have involved a discounted electricity price for supply for the aluminium smelters involved, and the repricing of those electricity contracts by the relevant generators or state instrumentalities is a very material factor in the viability of these businesses. There has been extensive discussion between the aluminium industry, and the smelters in particular, and the various state governments and state instrumentalities in relation to that issue, including in Victoria. It was one of the key issues behind the decision by Norsk Hydro a month or so ago to close the aluminium smelter at Kurri Kurri in my own region, the Hunter. To put that into a fair historical perspective, it was a decision of the New South Wales government, followed by a decision of the O'Farrell government, that they would not renew the electricity contract on terms sufficiently favourable to Norsk Hydro to allow the continued operation of that smelter.


All of that—low prices, the high dollar and electricity contracts—is yet again being completely misrepresented by the coalition in a misleading way. They are trying to attribute these problems to carbon pricing, which is completely fallacious. To put that in context, aluminium smelting is an industry that in 2012-13 will attract for free an average of 94.5 per cent of the permits it will require under the carbon price, reducing the effective average carbon price in aluminium smelting to $1.30 a tonne. It is a trade-exposed industry, and that is why the government has taken a significant step. That is the assistance that has been provided. Aluminium companies are in constant discussion with the government about these issues and, particularly with my other portfolio hat on, it is not surprising that I would be having discussions pretty regularly with the aluminium sector and others who are feeling some of these pressures—for example, the steel industry—and continuing to monitor the situation.

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (16:44):  I want to pick up on a number of things. The member for Flinders referred to Western Sydney and my home state of New South Wales and what is going to be happening there with power prices. He referred to the fact that power prices will increase by 18 per cent. I think it is important to state that more than half of that is not due to the carbon tax or carbon price but, rather, has a lot to do with the decisions that have been made as a result of approval given by IPART to the pricing movements requested by state owned corporations, which are the responsibility of state governments. I do not recall that there has been any move to provide any sort of household assistance to cover for the increases to power prices that the state owned corporations have had approved through state based regulators.


I understand that there is a household assistance package that will cover households as a result of any move to introduce a carbon price from 1 July, as opposed to what is happening due to the state owned corporations. On top of that, there has been a very active scare campaign about the impact on councils in New South Wales as a result of the introduction of the carbon price which I would like to get some clarity on. So the first thing is to get clarity on the impact, particularly in Western Sydney, of the carbon price on power prices for households. The second thing is the impact on rates and council operations in Western Sydney.


The third thing I want to get clarity on follows from an opportunity I had to visit De Bortoli Wines, which has a distribution centre based in Western Sydney. They have been the beneficiary of assistance to help them shift their operations to a more sustainable footing. I was very impressed when I went out to Glendenning on Friday and met the New South Wales manager of De Bortoli Wines who outlined the types of measures that have been taken to move to a more sustainable footing and use their energy more efficiently. While there has been a lot of focus on the carbon price itself, there has not been enough focus on what measures are being taken by businesses and industry to make themselves much more sustainable, to use energy more efficiently in the way they conduct their affairs. I would like to know, particularly from a Western Sydney focus, what other businesses are able to do and what assistance they are able to tap into to find more energy efficient ways to operate and thereby reduce their own costs.

 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:47):  I thank the member for Chifley for the question because there are some important issues traversed there. I will take them sequentially. It is very important to note that 8.9 per cent, as I recall, of the electricity price rise approved by IPART in New South Wales is attributable to the introduction of a carbon price. That equates to an average household cost of $3.30 a week—exactly what the government said it would be. And of course, with respect to that, the federal government is providing an average of $10.10 per week to households in New South Wales in assistance in the form of tax cuts, family tax benefit improvements and pension increases. In Western Sydney, where I had the privilege to grow up—in fact, in the electorate of the member for Chifley, an excellent representative for that area—this is very important for people. There are many people in New South Wales, in Western Sydney, doing it tough. The tax cuts, the pension increases, the family tax benefits, the help for self-funded retirees, for many veterans and many others are very, very important to them. The federal government is the only government that is helping in these circumstances.


As to the rest of the electricity price rise approved by IPART, there are very significant factors that are within the New South Wales government jurisdiction to deal with. They are providing no assistance. The federal coalition have banged on for the last 12 or 18 months about all the doom and gloom, the fear and the terror that is created by carbon pricing. Do you know, the investment in poles and wires in New South Wales equates to the price impact of carbon pricing coming in, as it does in other jurisdictions—and, not only that, it has been more in previous years. Yet they have been claiming doom and gloom for everything with respect to that, when in fact the federal government is providing $10.10 a week, on average, in assistance. The New South Wales government is not helping people. It is not even actively looking at how it can ensure that there is no gold-plating of these investments, which are going on within its jurisdiction, so that New South Wales Electricity consumers are not placed under even greater pressure. That is a very material factor. It is total hypocrisy for the O'Farrell government to try to attribute the totality of the price rise to the carbon price as the member for Flinders was trying to do in his first question. It is completely fallacious and factually untrue. The New South Wales government is not providing assistance to help people in the way the federal government is.


The other thing that IPART did in recent weeks was to examine in a thorough way the potential price impact of carbon pricing on councils and their costs. There is a very thorough breakdown published on IPART's website which demonstrates very clearly that we are talking about an increase in the range of 0.4 per cent to 0.6 per cent in local government costs in New South Wales—I do not have the material before me, but it certainly was not more than 0.6 per cent. Fortunately, in that jurisdiction IPART keeps a pretty close eye on what the councils can do, along with the state government. Those are the facts of the matter.


I was in Brisbane last week. The Brisbane City Council, which is, of course, under Liberal National Party control, has come up with a completely fallacious claim. Given the same circumstances, they will be putting rates up by 1.9 per cent and ripping people off and having no transparency and accountability about it. These are all material factors.


The member for Chifley is right to point to the importance of programs generally that will assist organisations such as manufacturing businesses and local governments to reduce their energy consumption. Of course, some of the revenue from the carbon price mechanism is dedicated to programs which will assist in this. Last week the government announced a number of recipients among local governments and not-for-profit organisations of energy efficiency grants which will see energy consumption and electricity bills reduced. Last week I visited a food manufacturing facility at Emu Plains called Crafty Chef. A co-contribution by the government is expected to reduce the carbon emissions intensity of Crafty Chef by 54 per cent, deliver CO2 savings, boost its turnover from $20 million to $50 million and increase jobs.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2012-06-18,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (16:52):  I have two sets of questions for the minister. The first is in on the solar hot water rebate program. This program was axed in February, with $45 million lost. Although at the time the government claimed there was no reduction against budget expenditure, on budget night it was shown that the net loss as a consequence for the sector was $45 million, and the budget papers were reduced accordingly. The government has now reinstated that funding, although in a different format. My first question to the minister is very simple: where does that $45 million come from? Within which programs was it contained in the current budget? If it was not contained in any of the programs, will the minister confirm that the government's so-called surplus will be reduced by $45 million?


The second set of questions relates to landfill and the number of liable entities on the government's register of liable entities. Is the minister aware of plans by some landfill operators, and indeed potentially by some councils, to divert waste from consolidated high-quality landfills to smaller regional landfills so as to legitimately avoid the 25,000 tonne limit but in so doing potentially to lead to an increase in overall emissions and a decrease in environmental standards? Is the minister aware of any case where this is occurring, and can he rule out that landfill is being diverted from larger landfills to smaller landfills so as to avoid the liability but in so doing also losing the potential for methane strip and diverting waste to landfills which may not have the same lining and environmental standards?

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:54):  In relation to the solar hot-water rebate, which was introduced in 2007, it is material to point out that the government has now provided over $320 million to help more than 258,000 Australian households replace older, higher emissions related hot-water systems with renewable, lower emissions alternatives. As at 31 May this year, an additional $68 million had been spent on rebates above the budget for the program announced in 2007, and an additional 33,000 systems have been installed above the target announced in 2007. It has been a program with a significant degree of funding expended on it over five years and with a significant number of systems installed—over a quarter of a million. The program has not been closed early; it was always designed to be closed in 2012, and that is what the government has done. We have obviously consulted widely in the industry and with associated stakeholder groups about this issue, but I emphasise that it was always scheduled to end on 30 June this year.



Mr Hunt interjecting—




Mr COMBET:
  On 6 June, just a couple of weeks ago, the government announced through Parliamentary Secretary Dreyfus that the $44.7 million that I think the member for Flinders is referring to, which remained from the Renewable Energy Bonus Scheme, will be used to support two national programs assisting local communities and low-income families to become more energy efficient. This will involve a new $24 million Local Government Energy Efficiency Program, established to help councils install solar or heat-pump hot-water systems in community facilities, and an extra $20.7 million under the Home Energy Saver Scheme, to support low-income households to invest in a bigger range of energy-efficient whitegoods and heating and cooling systems. This does not add to the budget in the way that was implied by the member for Flinders; this is an underspend from the program.




Mr Hunt:
  That is untrue. The budget was corrected and the money was taken out.




Mr COMBET:
  I am afraid that that is the position. I am reminded that it was factored into the budget surplus in a contingency reserve, and perhaps that is why the member for Flinders had not picked that up. 


In relation to landfill, only 34 councils—as of Friday, according to the list based on current data published by the Clean Energy Regulator—have been identified as liable entities on the Liable Entities Public Information Database. That is 34 councils of 559 nationally. The coalition, in yet another example of fearmongering and campaigning and misrepresentation and misleading statements, has been running around trying to terrify local governments about this issue. The fact of the matter is that the government has worked very closely with the Australian Local Government Association for several years—since the previous parliament—about how to structure landfill emissions to minimise methane liability under the carbon-pricing mechanism. Many local governments that operate landfill sites have already invested in methane capture technology, which is what triggers landfill liability. Many local governments, including in my own region, have already invested in methane capture technology in order to either flare the methane, which under a carbon-pricing arrangement will potentially reduce their liability below the emissions threshold that triggers liability, or use it to generate electricity. We have consulted very closely with the landfill sector and local governments about the issue that the member for Flinders pointed to—the potential diversion of waste. It might be recalled that, under the CPRS, mechanisms had been mooted to deal with the potential of that issue. We satisfied ourselves in consultations that that is an issue that it was not necessary to address under the clean energy future package at this point in time.

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (17:00):  I must admit that I was struck by the member for Chifley's question before. It seemed like the 'don't mention the war' episode out of Fawlty Towers, only heslipped up and mentioned the carbon tax. 'I did it once but I think I got away with it'. I am sorry to say, Member for Chifley, that the people of my electorate and right throughout Australia do not feel that you are getting away with it. They know what this tax is going to do to their lives. This is a tax, and all the bribes and the slick advertising will not hide the fact that this tax is going to cascade through the economy and have a big impact on regional communities. It is also a tax that your Prime Minister specifically ruled out ever introducing. But I do thank the minister for his answer previously, and I also acknowledge, Minister, that 1 July is the government's policy in relation to contract foreclosure. But the practical reality of the situation is that contract foreclosure negotiations are going nowhere fast, and I think the minister knows that. My community in the Latrobe Valley is suffering right now because of the uncertainty being created by your government's policy. Your government has no plans in place in relation to structural adjustment. Your Minister for Regional Development, Regional Australia and Local Government has acknowledged that as well. There are no guidelines in place for that particular policy, and there is a crisis of confidence going on right now in the Gippsland and Latrobe Valley region which is directly related to the carbon tax policy which the Prime Minister explicitly ruled out in the lead-up to the last election.


I repeat my question from before, Minister. Will the minister deny that government is going to announce an extension of time for its contract foreclosure negotiations?

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (17:02):  I want to refer the government to the revenue measures contained within the carbon tax, and in particular the gross figures of approximately $36 billion to be raised. Will the minister confirm that if the price of the government's carbon tax falls below the $29 predicted for the first year of a floating price—and I will remind the House that that price is predicted to be $29, multiple times more than the current European price of approximately €6.9 as of today—that there will be a significant budget black hole?

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:02):  I thank the member for his question. This is where the coalition tries to have it every way, of course. On the one hand it is doom and gloom and terrible. I think the Leader of the Opposition today was forecasting the price to go up, and so on, but on the other hand, when it is politically suitable for them, they try to point to the price falling and therefore holes in budgets and all the rest. 


We have confidence in the Treasury modelling, and that is reflected in the budget. I was reminded today in question time in relation to this issue, when the member for Flinders was googling the European Union allowance prices, that in fact in July 2008 the European unit price was, I think, A$56 a tonne just prior to the global financial crisis. It is an emissions trading scheme, it is a market price that is set. Of course, the carbon price mechanism that we have implemented will migrate to a floating price, a market price, from 1 July 2015, and the market will set the price. The Treasury has modelled that, in one of the most comprehensive modelling exercises undertaken for a public policy change, at $29 a tonne in 2015-16. We have confidence in the modelling. If the member for Flinders is a derivatives expert on carbon markets, that is great. However, to be suggesting at this point in time that, in three years, we will still have low prices in Europe is a pretty big call, for a number of reasons. One of them is that we would all share the hope that the current debt crisis that is being experienced throughout the European zone is resolved as expeditiously as possible. That debt crisis has affected many markets, including the carbon market in the EU. I know, through consultations that I have with the EU in relation to this issue, that there is a great degree of concern about that and the need to resolve the debt crisis and restore confidence and stability to markets in Europe, including in relation to the trading of European Union allowances. 


The government has already announced that we are in consultation with the European Union about the potential for ultimately linking the two schemes, which would be an important policy initiative—it is the largest carbon market in the world. The European Union scheme goes into a third phase in the not-too-distant future. There is a lot of discussion in Europe about the application of that phase and whether there would be contemplation of measures to support the price in the EU ETS as part of those changes. That is a matter for the European Union to deal with. The point that I am endeavouring to make is that 1 July 2015 is some period away, and we certainly anticipate that carbon prices and international markets will recover. By the time that we migrate to a floating price, from 1 July 2015, I think the Treasury modelling is going to prove to be as sound as the confidence we have in it.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (17:07):  It gives me great pride to be able to speak in support of the measures contained within the appropriation bills. The 2012-13 budget delivers on the government's commitment to return the budget to surplus. The surplus is growing over the forward estimates. As well as returning to surplus, the budget spreads the benefits of the resources boom to help families and low- and middle-income earners with increases in the cost of living. The return to surplus is the right decision for the Australian economy because it will sustain confidence in the strength of Australia's public finances, it will strengthen the government's balance sheet, to support Australia's capacity to respond to future adverse economic shocks, and it is appropriate for an economy expected to grow around trend and allows monetary policy to respond to economic conditions. 


Australia's budget will return to surplus ahead of any other advanced major economy. Many other advanced economies are still grappling with the task of rebuilding their economies as well as setting their public finances on a sustainable footing. The current European sovereign debt crisis makes maintaining strong fiscal discipline and credibility more important than ever. Australia's strong public finances, very low public debt, solid economic growth, low unemployment and contained inflation make it one of the strongest economies in the world. 


The government will return to surplus despite tax receipts being revised down by $28 billion over four years from 2011-12, relative to the 2011-12 MYEFO, due to parameter and other variations. Relative to the forecast made in the 2008-09 budget, total tax receipts have been written down by around $150 billion over the five years to 2012-13. The government has taken a disciplined approach to both return the budget to surplus and create room for new investments. This has required the government to identify $33.6 billion over five years in savings, with those savings split roughly equally between expenditure and receipt measures. These savings have been designed to be targeted and responsible, ensuring that the most vulnerable Australians and front-line services are protected. In addition to delivering the surplus and spreading the benefits of the boom, the 2012-13 budget contains a number of important initiatives, including establishing the first stage of a national disability insurance scheme; reforming Australia's aged-care system to make the system fairer, more transparent and responsive; delivering additional dental health services; and investing in a number of high-quality infrastructure projects, including funding for duplicating the Pacific Highway, additional funding for Roads to Recovery and Black Spot programs, committing to develop the Moorebank Intermodal Terminal and the Torrens and Goodwood rail project. 


Average real growth in payments over the forward estimates is 1.8 per cent. This is within the commitment to maintain a two per cent annual cap on real spending growth on average, until surpluses are at least one per cent of GDP and while the economy is at or above trend. The budget also sees a fall in nominal payments in 2012-13 compared to 2011-12—the first fall in 42 years for which data is available. This highlights the key role disciplined spending is playing in the fiscal consolidation. The discipline imposed on real spending growth has reduced payments as a proportion of GDP to 23.5 per cent in 2012-13—that is a fall of 1.6 percentage points from 2011-12. In 2012-13 and each subsequent year in the forward estimates, payments as a percentage of GDP are expected to be at their lowest level since the onset of the global financial crisis. Across the forward estimates from 2012-13, payments are expected to be below 24 per cent of GDP. This is the longest sustained period below 24 per cent since the 1980s. 


The budget includes measures to support the integrity, fairness and sustainability of the tax system, such as the removal of tax concessions for golden handshakes and living-away-from-home allowances. Nonetheless, over the forward estimates the tax to GDP ratio is projected to remain below what it was in 2007-08. In 2012-13, the tax to GDP ratio is expected to be 1.6 percentage points lower than the 2007-08 level, which equates to around $24.1 billion worth of tax in 2012-13. Tax receipts are projected to reach 22.9 per cent of GDP in 2015-16, around one percentage point below the levels reached in the mid-2000s. Tax receipts as a proportion of GDP in 2011-12 and the previous two years were the lowest since 1993-94. (Time expired)

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (17:12):  I thank the Assistant Treasurer for his opening remarks. I want to touch on a few things before moving to his specific responsibilities. I would like to focus on the general issues around the budget. There is some confusion surrounding the budget papers and why in a number of cases they were delivered late to coalition people in the opposition budget lock-up. Assistant Treasurer, was it Treasury's responsibility to deliver the budget books to the opposition in the budget lock-up? Were any copies of the budget or related papers, including the portfolio budget statements, shredded at any stage during the printing process in the lead-up to the 2012-13 budget? Copies of portfolio budget statements were not available at 1:30 pm when the opposition budget lock-up started. I wonder whether the Assistant Treasurer could shed any light on that; whether there was any delay in the loading dock. I am curious as to why those papers were not available when they would ordinarily have been available. 


I also want to talk about the clarity within the budget papers and their transparency in accurately reflecting the Commonwealth's budget position. You would be aware of criticisms from Ross Gittins, who was quite vivid in his criticisms of the actual budget position and how that was communicated—the transparency in a range of transactions that have been shifted off budget and the accounting rationale there; a table that aggregates all those transactions under a range of different headings; and their headline and underlying impacts. You would be aware that he was pointing to a budget surplus when, in his words, 'it actually hides an $8.7 billion budget deficit.' He goes on to say:


The hiding of the headline deficit is just one example of the way the budget papers are becoming less informative rather than more, and the way the spin doctors are turning them into an exercise in media management rather than transparency and accountability.


He provides a number of specific examples. I invite the Assistant Treasurer to address himself to those criticisms that Mr Gittins outlined in relation to payments to NBN Co. as an example, and also on the Clean Energy Development Bank and why that is presented in the way it is in the budget papers.


AAP also had a complaint, which Mr Gittins has alluded to:


This year AAP has accused the government of leaking budget information to selected media for broadcast during the budget lock-up. How's that for duplicity.


Has the Assistant Treasurer had those complaints by the AAP investigated, either by the Treasury or the government? What are the outcomes of those arrangements? Does he agree that this in part undermines the whole point of the lock-up, where there is selective release of information? The Assistant Treasurer and I share a spot on a particular television program, where he is fond of saying, 'I won't be drawn on budget speculation,' and then proceeds to talk about the selective speculation he would love to be drawn on and was actively involved in propagating. 


I would invite the Assistant Treasurer to comment on those two very concerning issues about the integrity and transparency of the process and the papers themselves, and on the bewildering reason why key documents were not available to the opposition as they would ordinarily be in the regular course of events.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (17:16):  The first point that the member for Dunkley raised—which goes to the question of documents and materials that were provided or were intended or meant to be provided to the opposition and the timeliness of their provision—is not a matter that has been raised with me previously. Certainly, that is something that I will endeavour to look into and provide the member for Dunkley with further information on. It is my understanding that it is up to the respective individual departments themselves to make available information to the opposition. I am not aware of any instance in which the way in which departments conducted themselves in the most recent budget departed in any way from the way in which matters would ordinarily occur. I have no knowledge of anything untoward in that regard, but I will certainly have a look at the matters that the member for Dunkley has raised.


I welcome the member for Dunkley's interest in transparency, because with a $70 billion black hole the Australian people are going to be very interested in the transparent in way in which the opposition presents its proposals to the Australian people ahead of the next election. The budget papers, in all regards, comply with the usual accounting practice in terms of how budgets are recorded and matters are disclosed. There is no suggestion that that is not the case. It is good to see the member for Dunkley imbibing his daily or weekly element of Mr Gittins's commentary, because I think the opposition could learn a lot from much of what Mr Gittins has said. He has been a very strong critic of the lack commitment to fiscal discipline on the part of the coalition.


On the question of transparency, the government is very pleased to stand behind a budget that is being returned to surplus. We have stated the reasons why it is so important that we return the budget to surplus. We have done so using all of the accounting mechanisms that would ordinarily apply to the way in which these matters are reported. That will show that we are delivering in 2012-13 a $1.5 billion surplus. The surpluses that will be achieved into the out years grow over time. Of course, this is a remarkable result when we consider what is occurring all around the world at the moment. Indeed, these projections are based upon strong growth, growth that is strong by international standards. There is good reason to believe that those projections will be realised. In recent national accounts data released we see that the Australian economy continued to grow more strongly than any other major advanced economy. The Australian economy today is somewhere in the order of nine per cent larger than the economy that existed before the GFC. We are experiencing growth at rates that no other major advanced economy can even come close to, and we are returning our budget to surplus faster than any other major advanced economy. Indeed, as we return the budget to surplus others are still grappling with very large deficits, and we all operate in the current global economic settings with the inherent challenges they bring.


The government are very pleased that in this budget we have been able to spread the benefits of the mining boom, and that is so important. The national accounts data really did show that the growth in this country is occurring much more strongly in some parts than in others and in some sectors more than in others. As we extract mineral resources in this country today to meet the demands of the global economy and the global marketplace, it is absolutely important that we extract a sufficient and appropriate return for the Australian people from those resources. Through the mining tax and the minerals resource rent tax we are doing that, and we are determined to make sure that the benefits of the boom are being spread. I think that is the responsible thing for the government to do, particularly in a climate where the resources boom, which has meant so much bounty for so many, has also provided structural challenges and changes that have impacted on so many others throughout the economy. This is a very good budget, one that has returned to surplus and one that helps spread the benefits of the mining boom.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (17:21):  I want to ask the Assistant Treasurer about the government's decision to return the budget to surplus, but I also want to make a couple of observations in that context about the state of the Australian economy, which is today nine per cent larger than it was before the global financial crisis. Like the Assistant Treasurer, I am a subscriber to the Treasurer's Economic Note, which reminds me that, compared with pre-GFC levels, the Italian economy is now five per cent smaller, the British economy is three per cent smaller and the Japanese economy is one per cent smaller. Other economies have grown, but not by much. The United States economy is up by one per cent and it is the same with Germany; the Canadian economy is up by four per cent. So the Australian economy, having grown by nine per cent from pre-GFC levels, really is in a class of its own.


I also want to raise the recent national accounts figures. As the Assistant Treasurer has noted, the release of those figures really did give the lie to those who argue that Australia's best days are behind us. As the Treasurer put it, the release of those figures was a week when the optimists won over the pessimists. It is important to put in place productivity-boosting reforms and they are reforms that Labor is currently undertaking. The National Broadband Network, the historic investment in schools and boosting the quality of Australian schools are reforms that will pay dividends, but they will not necessarily pay off in the year in which they are implemented. We know this from looking back at past reforms. We can see, for example, that the deregulation of the financial sector and the cutting of tariffs in the 1980s paid off in productivity in the 1990s.


In terms of Australia's debt level, which naturally goes to the question of the return to surplus, it is worth drawing on a number of observations made in the press recently. The Executive Director of the Australia Institute, Richard Denniss, has noted that Australia's level of public debt is among the lowest in the world. In fact, he noted:


At less than 10 per cent of GDP, the Commonwealth’s Net Debt is so low that the financial sector has urged the Gillard Government to issue more government bonds than is actually necessary to ensure the ‘liquidity’ of the government bond market.


Stephen Koukoulas, in the Australian Financial Review on the morning after the budget, noted, 'Not once did the Howard or Fraser governments in about 20 years in office achieve a single year where government spending was cut in real terms, while Labor governments have been able to cut real spending in five years since the mid-1980s.' Mr Koukoulas further notes that in the 2012-13 budget the ratio of government spending to gross domestic product will fall to 23.5 per cent, which is 0.7 per cent of GDP lower than the average of the 12 Howard government budgets. 'In today's dollars, that is around $10 billion less spending.' George Megalogenis, writing last year in the Australian, had this headline: 'ALP best manager of money, history shows'. Mr Megalogenis goes through the average annual real spending increase when the economy was growing at better than two per cent a year. Those figures show that under John Howard as Treasurer growth was 2.3 per cent. Under Peter Costello mark 1, it was 1.9 per cent. Under Peter Costello mark 2, in the salad days, it was 3.3 per cent. Under Wayne Swan, it was 1.0 per cent.


There is a fear campaign being run by those opposite against the debt that we took on in order to save 200,000 jobs and tens of thousands of small businesses, which I am sure that the member for Dunkley is deeply concerned about. Yet we still see those opposite running scare campaigns on things like the debt cap, which we have been advised to increase in order to take account of the fact that there are fluctuations in government revenues through the course of the year. We are raising the debt cap prudently. But those opposite seem keener on taking a leaf out of the playbook of the US Republicans.


My question to the Assistant Treasurer is: why is the government returning the budget to surplus and why is this important for maintaining Australia's economic prosperity?

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (17:26):  I thank the member for his very informed and insightful contribution. I welcome the opportunity to respond to his question. He asked why it is important to return the budget to surplus. There are many reasons why it is important to return the budget to surplus. We as a government should be attempting to live within our means. When the economic circumstances are as strong as they are—and the economic circumstances in this country stand in stark contrast to the challenges that so many other economies are facing around the globe—these are precisely the times in which governments should be attempting to return their budgets to surplus.


What are the indicators to which I refer? When it comes to solid growth, the recent national accounts figures are a testament to the strength of growth in the Australian economy. I often hear those on the other side allege that the government has a preference for redistribution over wealth creation. The strongest endorsement of this government's commitment to wealth creation is the fact that this economy has grown faster in the period since the global financial crisis than any other major advanced economy. As a Labor government, we are committed to ensuring that there is fairness in the way in which taxation and transfer systems operate. But we also believe first and foremost that an economy must grow. Through growth and enlarging the pie, we are able to give more and more Australians the opportunity, with government support and assistance, to realise their potential so that they can make the contribution that our country requires and deserves from them. Our growth is very strong.


We also operate in a context in which unemployment is relatively low. An unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent is relatively low compared to those economies with which we would normally compare ourselves. If we have a look at those economies in Europe and economies such as the US and the UK, what we see is that our unemployment levels are considerably lower. All of those countries to which I have referred would give their right arms—they would give a limb—to have an unemployment rate with a five in front of it. And that is what we have in Australia. In fact, much of the discourse in this country at the moment is positioned around the challenges of confronting labour and skills shortages. And this is a government that has a plan to address those matters as well. We have strong growth and low unemployment, and we have contained inflation. Containing inflation is the best way that any government can attempt to fight the rising cost of living. Containing inflation is, by definition, a government's efforts to contain rising costs of living. With contained inflation, we see strong growth and low unemployment. At the same time, as the member for Fraser rightly pointed out, our net government debt is amongst the lowest of major advanced economies, peaking at 9.6 per cent this year. In fact, if you look at comparable nations and put them all in a basket and work out their average, our net debt peaks at about one-tenth of the average for those countries. We have low net debt, despite the carry-on and the protestations of the opposition. Whenever they have this discussion they firstly do not wish to acknowledge the international realities and the comparisons with other countries. 


The other point that those opposite seem to forget is that we have been through the global financial crisis. They want to forget that because they are ashamed of their record of having voted against so many of those important measures that we as a government implemented to support jobs. I have mentioned all of these indicators, but the 800,000-plus jobs that we have created in our time in office are perhaps the strongest indication of this government's agenda. It is about growth. It is about jobs. We have delivered those jobs. Often we have had to do it without the support of those opposite, because they come into the parliament and vote against these measures. Then they want to pretend that there was not a significant international economic incident and a period of challenge that we have been through. We tackled it. As a result of having tackled it, hundreds of thousands of Australians had a job who would not have otherwise had a job.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (17:31):  The Assistant Treasurer talks about the stimulus measures—I think that is what he is alluding to—which in broad figures saw the budget position expand expenditure by $40 billion in that year. Is it not true that the so-called targeted and temporary measures involving the GFC response were neither temporary nor targeted but that they elevated the floor for Commonwealth expenditure by some $40 billion? It has never turned back. On your analysis, Sir, that would mean that every day that Labor has been in office, we have been in a GFC mode, because there has been no reduction in expenditure or no removal of that GFC stimulus for any of the years that followed. It just represented an elevated floor against which further increases were added. You now claim that those increases were not as substantial as they might have otherwise been, conveniently ignoring the $40 billion uplift in one year under the name of the GFC. Is it not true that those stimulus uplift factors created a new floor for the Commonwealth outlays, that we are now spending $370 billion a year compared to $270 billion a year four years ago, that there has been no restoration of the budget base nor the trajectory that was in place before the GFC, and that all of your comments about modesty in expenditure are completely fallacious because there has been no restoration of the expenditure trajectory prior to the GFC?


On the issue of those outlays and the budget position, may I remind you that you have not delivered a surplus; you have forecasted one. None of your economic forecasts have come within a bull's roar of the end-of-year position. How confident are you that this budget will have some sort of accuracy that belies the track record up to date? What analysis have you done on the sensitivities that you have factored into the budget parameters? I refer to what was a remarkable inclusion under the contingency reserve for budget year 2012-13, which is a sizeable negative number. After some flapping around in Finance estimates, the explanation that was provided for this unusual occurrence was there was a lower than expected March quarter CPI outcome that needed to be factored into the papers and that this was 'received too late in the process to be allocated to individual agencies or functions'. Is this answer accurate and reliable? How is it that this reduced CPI outcome is not reflected anywhere else in the budget or, if it is, can you please point to where it is? Could you give some indication of the size of the downward forecast revision and what this downward forecast revision has meant for revenue? And, to pursue this matter further, in terms of that late revision and the economic parameters that it is supposedly influencing, what are the revenue and growth projections that are now in the budget if you have got that downcast in there covered by a negative contingency reserve amount but it does not appear anywhere else in the budget papers?


I will move on to the budget issue. You touched on debt. If you are claiming it is a surplus, how is it that there is a growth in the debt profile and why are you seeking an increase in the debt ceiling? How is it that the explanation you provided relating to the fluctuations in revenue throughout the year cannot be accommodated by an existing mechanism available to you through the Loan (Temporary Revenue Deficits) Act 1953? How can you credibly say there will be a surplus when you are forecasting a need to increase the debt position? On the issue of the sensitivities regarding the downward revision in GDP, what is the sensitivity to net debt for each year across the forward estimates of a one per cent increase or a one per cent decrease in GDP and where does that leave the final budget position? 


On the issue of taxation, you talk about the taxation measures that are included. When was the decision made to abandon Labor's company tax promise? Less than 24 hours before the Treasurer delivered the budget speech, the Minister for Small Business claimed that that was still part of the budget and, when asked why 92 per cent of small businesses feel that no government policy is helping them, reached for that measure. Being on the Expenditure Review Committee, he must have known that that was not the case, so why was he not being straight with people? That is probably why the member for Deakin has circulated that information. What is the status of the company tax cuts?


Finally, doesn't your budget confirm the abolition of the entrepreneurs tax offset, which will put up the level of taxation on the income of about 400,000 of Australia's smallest businesses? How is that assisting small business, in the manner you claim, in distributing the proceeds of the mining boom?

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (17:36):  I welcome the member for Dunkley's intervention on this occasion. In particular, I welcome his willingness to bring small business front and centre into the debate about what this government is doing. Once again, I am surprised that he would come into this place and seek to draw attention to his own abysmal failure. The member for Dunkley is the shadow small business minister, and he would have to be the only shadow small business minister, certainly from the coalition side, in the history of this parliament who has voted against tax relief for small business. He came into this parliament and voted against tax relief for small business, and then he has the audacity, the hide, to come in here.


But it gets much better than that. He glossed over the fact that he voted against tax relief for small business—the instant asset write-off measure, which will ensure that small businesses all around this country will be able to share in the benefits of the mining boom by getting an upfront deduction, an instant asset write-off for every asset they purchase under $6,500. This will be a massive boost to small business and will give them the capacity to invest in their own capabilities and in their own capital and equipment, making sure that they are able to take advantage of the opportunities that arise in the markets they serve. Not only did he gloss over that point, he had the audacity to come in here and challenge the government when it comes to the question of company tax cuts. Day after day we came into this parliament and those opposite jumped up and down and said, 'We will vote against company tax cuts.' The rationale for that was, they said: 'We don't support the income-generating source. We don't support the minerals resource rent tax. So, because we don't support the minerals resource rent tax, we won't be supporting any of the expenditure measures that are attached to it.' They made that point. They would have an ounce of credibility if they would at least maintain some consistency on that point. But what have they now done? We have handed down a budget where we have made it clear that, despite their determination to block our company tax cuts, we will make sure we spread the benefits of the boom. But we are going to do it by providing some other forms of assistance—in the form of increases to family payments and increases to allowances—to ensure that those individuals and families who are doing it tough share in the benefits of the mining boom. And what did they say? 


All of a sudden they discovered that they were in a position where they could support expenditure measures that were linked to the MRRT. I think the real issue here is that the shadow small business minister does not have the clout in shadow cabinet. When it comes to small business issues, he was not able to get them over the line when it came to supporting a tax cut for business. What a shameful position to be in! He has been the only shadow Liberal small business minister to vote against tax relief for business, but then he got rolled. He got rolled in shadow cabinet on trying to give a company tax cut. For the member for Dunkley to come in here and try to challenge the government when it comes to tax reform, particularly in relation to company tax cuts, not only is really gilding the lily but is beyond the pale. 


The member for Dunkley also made a few points in relation to the global financial crisis. He wants to block it from his memory. We all remember the shameful position that they took when they voted against the stimulus measures that supported this economy—or at least those that managed to turn up to parliament to vote against them. The member for Dunkley voted against them. Hundreds of thousands of jobs have been protected and supported as a result of that. One challenge I hand down for those opposite is that they should come forward and tell us which economy, which country, out of all those economies out there in the world handled the global financial crisis better than Australia.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (17:41):  A bit of coverage on superannuation is important, member for Dunkley. 



Mr Billson interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  He does not need protection; he could take all three of you on. The 2012-13 budget delivers on the government's commitment to return the budget to surplus from surpluses growing over the forward estimates. But, as well as returning to surplus, this budget spreads the benefits of the resources boom to help families on low and middle incomes with the cost of living. The return to surplus is the right decision for the Australian economy because it sustains confidence in Australia's public finances and it strengthens the government's balance sheets to support Australia's capacity to respond to future adverse economic shocks. Return to surplus is appropriate for an economy expected to grow above trend, and it allows monetary policy to return to surplus ahead of any major advanced economy. 


Many other advanced economies are dealing with the very difficult issue of an ageing population and how to make sure that there is enough money for all people who reach 65 to retire. That is why we had some measures in our budget which improve the superannuation prospects of Australians. Unlike the coalition, who consistently vote against increases to superannuation, we on the Labor side believe in boosting Australian's superannuation. We also believe super should be concessionally taxed, and we are making the system fairer for millions of low-income earners by removing the compulsory tax on compulsory superannuation contributions from 1 July 2012. It was also clear to us that a small number of people on very high incomes are getting a better tax deal out of superannuation than millions of Australians on average incomes, because most compulsory superannuation contributions are taxed at a flat rate of 15 per cent, regardless of the person's income. This is why we are making the system fairer by reducing the higher tax concession that the very high-income earners receive on their concessional contributions. Indeed, in this budget we announced that we would take steps to more closely align the tax concession for very high-income earners with the concession received by average-income earners. The government took this step because it is not fair, nor is it good economic policy, to give 128,000 Australians a 30 per cent tax break, excluding the Medicare levy, on their superannuation contributions. We are better targeting the tax concessions for superannuation by reducing the significant concession which very high-income earners receive on their contributions. This reform will affect only people whose income is more than $300,000, which is approximately 1.2 per cent of people contributing to superannuation in 2012-13. We are reducing the tax concession which wealthy taxpayers receive on their contributions from 30 to 15 per cent, so it is more in line with the concession received by people with average earnings. This reform builds on our low-income superannuation contribution, which will make concessions on contributions fairer for about 3.6 million low-paid workers in 2012-13. The low income superannuation tax abolition—that is, getting rid of the 15 per cent tax paid on superannuation by people who earn less than $37,000 a year—will also support, in particular, women. Of the 3.6 million Australians who earn less than $37,000 a year, approximately 2.1 million are women, thus ensuring that they have more money for their retirement, when it is well known that women find it more difficult to save money for their retirement when they have to step in and out of the workforce.


In addition, in 2012-13 and 2013-14, all individuals will be subject to the general concessional cap and will be able to make concessional superannuation contributions of up to $25,000 per year. We are deferring the start date of the higher cap by two years, from 1 July 2012 to 1 July 2014, in light of comments made by industry about the difficulty in administering the higher cap before the new start date. During consultation, the superannuation industry raised concerns in relation to the cost and complexity involved in administering the balance limit and the difficulty some individuals may face in determining whether they are eligible for the higher cap. Deferring the start date will significantly help resolve these issues. It will allow implementation to occur at the same time super funds are making more changes to their systems to report more information to the ATO as part of the SuperStream reforms. In addition, individuals will be able to more easily determine whether they are eligible for the higher cap when the ATO provides access to comprehensive account balance information from early 2014. The Labor government is the only party in federal politics that is interested in improving superannuation for all Australians. (Time expired)

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (17:46):  Could the minister confirm that the superannuation contributions paid by employers that are legislated to increase from nine to 12 per cent are indeed paid for by employers and have been legislated? There has been some suggestion from Labor members that this is subject to some kind of negotiation and wiggle room. That came as news to most people. Could he confirm that that is the case. Could he also turn his mind to a question that has been put to the coalition which relates to the number of small businesses that are suffering at the moment through a 48 per cent increase in small business insolvencies. A number of them point to their business being their retirement nest egg and thank the coalition for the capital gains tax rollover relief and other measures that they had planned to rely upon for their retirement. They point to the lack of appetite for purchasing new businesses or instances where a business has hit the wall and there may be a limited window within which to accumulate a retirement nest egg. Has the minister any plans to examine the contribution cap for mature age people, particularly in light of the reduction that the government has introduced where there might be a limited period of time—say, for the people over the age of 50—to accumulate a retirement nest egg and whether that is on his radar screen?


I move to a related area about the accountants exemption that the minister would be aware of and FOFA changes first announced by then minister Bowen. It was proposed by the government that this exemption would be changed. This has created some uncertainty and concerns for accountants across Australia. Can he update us on progress of the proposed changes to the accountants exemption allowing them to provide advice on setting up or closing SMSF funds? I believe that was to come within weeks back in February. I think the minister was reported as saying that that was forthcoming within the next two weeks. So there is a bit of date slippage, but we are just wondering where that has got to and whether any changes to this measure are being contemplated that deviate from what Mr Bowen had to say. What action is being taken and when will this next two weeks arise as the minister promised? 


I will just more onto another related area, mindful that I suspect the clock will be run down by Labor colleagues. In the investment manager space, can he explain the delay in finalising the investment manager regime legislation? Is one of the issues resourcing of Treasury? I note there was a report of about some four dozen—




Mr Shorten:
  Do you like Treasury? You normally hate them.




Mr BILLSON:
  I am always fond of Treasury. It is Treasurers we have to keep an eye on. We look out for the pre-election budget outcome, because we know your mysterious hand has not gone over those figures and so they have a degree of tidiness about them. Is this an issue of the resourcing of Treasury? Has Treasury received any stakeholder feedback on the delay and is there some reason that that seems not to be 'moving forward', to coin a phrase?


On payday lending, could the minister update us on progress with the proposed payday lending changes contained in the Consumer Credit and Corporation Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Bill 2011? I acknowledge that the minister has appreciated that payday lending is different to microfinance, and there has been some change there.




Mr Shorten:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Owens

Mr Shorten:
  I just want some clarification. Several of the questions asked by the member for Dunkley have nothing to do with the appropriations bill which we are discussing. I am more than happy to answer them but ask that he refer to the part of the budget he is addressing.




Mr BILLSON:
  It is quite simple: Treasury officials are funded by appropriation. You have a football team of them here, Minister. They certainly are related to the budget. I am confident you would be able to cope with them.



Ms O'Dwyer interjecting—




Mr BILLSON:
  I have never seen anything like it before! I hope you appreciate us seeking clarification about how your portfolio is financed, Minister. What is the status of the review of the definition of retail and wholesale clients? The options paper was released in January 2011 and submissions closed over a year ago, on 25 February 2011. It is unclear why it has taken so long. Have any decisions been made to abandon this process or to change the process? When can we expect an announcement relating to that?


Finally, regarding APRA regulated funds, were all of them compensated for losses in Trio? Has the process for providing compensation been finalised? I would be grateful for an answer to a couple of those questions. (Time expired)

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (17:51):  Following on from the Chief Opposition Whip's interest in fishing, the member for Dunkley has decided to do his own form of fishing which cannot be regulated by protection of the Barrier Reef. Fair enough. The most substantial question which the member for Dunkley led off with was about superannuation and who pays it. Let me be very clear on this matter. It is not appropriate for the opposition to spend their time scaring business and misleading people about who pays for superannuation. Superannuation increases are paid for out of the creation of value and wealth in enterprises going forward. For this, I submit the real-world evidence of what happened between 1992 and 2002. Over that time period, where compulsory superannuation was increased from three per cent to nine per cent, we saw at the same time a decrease in the unit labour costs of business, an increase in business profit as a share of GDP, an fall in unemployment from 11 per cent to something around six per cent and a rise in real wages in a continual pattern. It is not good enough that those opposite, who are the shipwreck survivors of the Howard-Costello era, without necessarily the capacity of some of those former members, have forgotten their own party's record on superannuation. What they always do is initially oppose and then they try to own the changes.




Ms O'Dwyer:
  Why don't you talk about your record?




Mr SHORTEN:
  The member for Higgins, who has had a very bad weekend in preselections, is now interjecting. What I recall is that her former boss, the former member for Higgins and the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, acknowledged the benefits of superannuation. I touched a raw nerve there with the member for Higgins. As for who pays, it is paid for out of the creation of productive value in enterprises. The only way you could argue that it is some sort of a cost on business would be to suggest that there will never be real wage increases in the whole period going forward and that the wages in 2013 would, without superannuation, be the same remuneration received by employees in 2019, which is patently false. The question of who pays is clearly and succinctly dealt with. To paraphrase former Prime Minister Keating, 'When conservatives tell you that this is some sort of tax on employers, they are either misinformed or they are lying, and they are wrong.'


Some of the other questions raised by the member for Dunkley include the proposition that superannuation is another impost on small business. Having first established that it is not actually what it has been described as by the shadow minister for small business, I would also remind him of the measures which this government has put in the actual appropriation bill to help small businesses. Of course, that includes not least the loss carry-back provisions. I also remind him of the deduction for motor vehicles which are purchased. I remind him of the tax deduction for purchase of capital equipment. These are real measures which help small business.


Of course, in politics it does not do anyone any credit to practise political amnesia. The reason why small business did not get a tax cut is that those opposite were against it. To quote the Assistant Treasurer in the chamber, the first spokesperson for small business ever in the history—



Ms O'Dwyer interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  The louder you shout, Member for Higgins, your logic does not improve. Does anyone remember a coalition small business spokesperson ever voting against a tax cut for small business? You look through the history. You look through Hansard from 1901. There is only one person who wins that prize, and that is the current member for Dunkley.


He also asked questions about contribution caps. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black! There is only one party in this parliament that believes in increasing the contribution caps. That is the Labor Party; that is the government. We believe in increasing the contribution caps for people over 50. The opposition, as on many things in terms of policy for the nation, have their policy on contribution caps in a witness protection program. We know they cannot afford to be positive and match Labor's policy of lifting it to $50,000 in 2014 for people over 50 with account balances up to half a million dollars. We know that those opposite cannot afford to be positive because they cannot afford to pay the bills. They have done no work in opposition and they do not know how they are going to fund it.



In terms of the other questions asked by the member for Dunkley, the IMR regime legislation will come forward soon, as will legislation on payday lending. We are most interested to see if those opposite will actually support reform of payday lending. In terms of the accountants' exemption, that will be resolved fairly soon after continued discussions with all the relevant bodies. In terms of the APRA-regulated funds within Trio, people who had money which has been lost through malfeasance in APRA-regulated funds have in fact been compensated. (Time expired)

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (17:57):  Obviously this is an opportunity for us to talk about the things that actually matter for real people in real places like the seat of Robertson. If it were not for Labor, with a vision for the future and a capacity to articulate with hope for an Australia where there is an opportunity for people to share in the wealth, there would never have been a superannuation scheme. Right now, at this point of time, in the budget that is before the House at this stage, we see another articulation of what it means to be Labor and to believe in ordinary Australians.


In my seat, there are a number of groups of people who I have particular concerns about, Minister. I would really be very keen to hear how the government's reforms that are being revealed through Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013, which is before us today, will assist these particular groups of people. First of all, I am thinking of people who are roughly at the age of 30. Thankfully, having grown up in a period after Labor brought in superannuation, these young 30-year-olds know the term 'superannuation', and in their lives they will have some experience of the benefits that that has given to people who are older. But, for our 30-year-olds, what does what we are about to implement with the appropriation bill coming to pass actually mean?


Another question I would really like a response on, Minister, is about the commitment that we have to people who manage on a very low income. What is it that Labor is doing in this appropriation bill to make sure that low-income earners in the seat of Robertson are going to get the advantage of having voted in a Labor government, knowing that we are going to honour our word and honour our ideological commitment to making sure all Australians move forward together? What is there for the low-income earners of Robertson?


One of the features of the seat in which I live is that we have a large number of people—over 18 per cent of the population in my seat—over 60. I note that many of them have given great service to this country and have an incredible level of experience that they still want to contribute to the community. Being over 70 does not mean that you are unemployable; it means that you are much more employable in many, many ways than others. What are we doing to help people who are over 70 in my electorate to get their fair share of what is going on in this country?


It would be unsuitable for me not to ask a question about women. Being a working mother myself and having faced all of the wonderful opportunities and challenges that come with being a working mother, I know that Labor has a legislative commitment to advance women's rights and issues, to advance the economic potential for women to provide for their own futures and to have a secure retirement. We know that, currently, women are terribly underfunded in terms of their retirement savings. What is there in this budget that helps and supports women in getting better equity in life outcomes?


I know there has been considerable argy-bargy here this afternoon with regard to small business, but the reality is this is a government that absolutely understands that small business is a major employer. In seats like my seat of Robertson, where there is a large service and retail sector, small business employers really need the advantages of what we can offer them as a federal government at this point in time. I am very interested, Minister, to hear what is in the appropriations bill that we can give to the small businesses in the seat of Robertson.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(

I will therefore let the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation respond, but then I am keen, as chair, to get over to the new minister.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (18:01):  I will try to be brief in answering that question. In terms of the propositions made about superannuation, there have been a range of measures made in this appropriations bill and there has been work done by the Treasury officials funded in this appropriations bill previously and going forward. So, adopting the standard of the member for Dunkley, I will range widely in terms of giving a comprehensive but brief answer to the member for Robertson.


First of all, Labor is the party of superannuation. Without the successive Labor governments, the superannuation system as we know it now—universal and providing retirement nest eggs as part of people's retirement strategies—simply would not exist. It is also fair to advise the electors of Robertson that, whenever the coalition has had an opportunity to increase superannuation, they have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. Again, the latest budget just represents more of the same of their DNA—to make superannuation the preserve of just some, not all.


In particular, the member for Robertson asked me about what is being done to in support for women and their superannuation. I would obviously refer not only to this budget but also to earlier legislation which has seen the abolition of the 15 per cent contributions tax paid by people who earn less than $37,000. As the member for Robertson well knows, a high proportion of the very large number of Australians who earn less than $37,000 are women. What we have done is, basically, provided in the course of this year an almost billion-dollar tax concession to the low paid. That is good news for the people of Robertson, in particular to the women electors who earn less than $37,000.


But that is part of the broader superannuation strategy in which we have been assisted by Treasury. We have increased the rate from nine to 12 per cent—that is good. We have abolished the tax for the low paid—that is equitable. We have put on a slightly higher charge for people who earn over $300,000—that is equitable and it is making sure that tax concessions are falling to those who most need them. We have also been improving the back office. I do acknowledge that the coalition today has voted to support some of our efforts in the back office operation of the SuperStream levy. We have also managed—although we were opposed by the opposition—to abolish the discrimination against people over 70 who are employees. Courtesy of this government, if the member for Robertson has people over 70 who are still employees, they will, from next year, be able to get superannuation on what they earn.


In addition we have propositions in the parliament about better governance of superannuation. We had to take the difficult decision to defer the concession caps—that is the amount of money you put into superannuation above which you do not get the tax concession advantage. We had hoped to make it $50,000 per annum for people over 50. This year, clearly, the need to get back into surplus and the wise economic stewardship of the nation required a deferral of a quite attractive proposition to July 2014. I note also, for the member for Robertson to advise her electors, that we are the only political party interested in having an increase in the concessional caps. Unfortunately, we have heard nothing from the opposition—they are very good on the negative but not so good on the positive—in terms of superannuation.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Oakeshott
):  We have three ministers here at the moment. On the agreement I have in front of me there is only a need for one to be before us, but I will leave it up to those on the jump to test their luck. The member for Higgins.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I have only just taken the chair so I do not know what happened previously. The Federation Chamber is dealing with proposed appropriation for the Treasury portfolio of $4,441,842,000. The question is that the proposed expenditure for the Treasury portfolio be agreed to.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (18:06):  Tonight I have serious concerns about the management of the tourism portfolio. This is an industry, when you combine tourism and hospitality, that employs about one million people or 8.8 per cent of the Australian workforce. The issue I want to start with is the funding for Tourism Australia. When this government came to power the budget for Tourism Australia was $136,269,000. This year the proposed budget is $130,178,000 and in the forward estimates it is $134,556,000. This is the lowest funding level ever for Tourism Australia—the lowest funding ever for an industry that employs a million people. In fact, in real terms, the dollar loss between 2007 and 2012 is $18,949,000 or 16 per cent, and projected through to the forward estimates it is $22,943,000 or 19 per cent less. So, Minister, given that last year Australians spent 132 million bed nights on holidays overseas and that in 2008 Australia dropped from fourth to 13th place in the World Economic Forum's travel and tourism competitiveness index rankings, how do you justify reducing the budget for Tourism Australia when the numbers have dropped off so massively?


The second thing I want to raise with you, Minister, is about your announcement on 2 May, the week before the budget, when you launched the Australian Tourism Investment Guide with great fanfare, yet in the budget—and you must have been aware of this—the MIT withholding rate was increased from 7½ to 15 per cent. Minister, surely you would have understood that that was going to have a massive effect. You got people wound up, geed up and excited about investing in Australia and then, after barely a week had gone by, that confidence for overseas investment particularly in our hotel industry was absolutely destroyed. It is no secret that there is a bed shortage in Australia, particularly of quality hotel accommodation. We both agree on that. So how do you address the fact that you launched the policy knowing what was going to be in the budget? You are a cabinet minister and I can only assume that things affecting your portfolio would have been discussed with you.


The third thing I wish to raise with you, Minister, in the limited time we have here is the passenger movement charge. When you came to government in 2007 the passenger movement charge was $38. It was increased to $47. It is now proposed to increase it to $55. Minister, how do you justify a 45 per cent increase in a tax when this, projected through on the forward estimates, will raise $1.04 billion but the operational cost for Customs in delivering the services is around $239 million? On top of that, how do you justify putting a CPI on the PMC tax going forward from next year? Minister, given that you turned up at the National Tourism Alliance on 2 March, the final line under item 2 of their communique says:


The Minister stated there would be no increase in the passenger movement charge.


And then later on, in discussion on 'passenger facilitation', it said:


The Minister informed the meeting he had heard of no proposal to raise the PMC in the upcoming budget.


Minister, how can an industry have confidence if you are telling them one thing before a budget and doing something different afterwards, or does this equate to the promise that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead' and then you introduce one? You have gone to the tourism industry and told them that there will be no increases in the PMC, and then after the budget they find that they are getting whacked.


I know you are going to say that you are offsetting with the Asia Marketing Fund of $61 million. Minister, your CPI increase alone will collect $156 million just on the CPI increase, and you are giving $61 million back to the industry. How do you justify that when our tourism industry is doing it so tough?

Mr MARTIN FERGUSON
 (Batman—Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (18:11):  Firstly, I note that I was here ahead of time. There was half an hour set aside and I will be leaving at 6.30 because it is in accordance with the scheduled timing of this portfolio.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Oakeshott
):  You can rest assured that the chamber will be moving onto other business at 6.30 pm—




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  I take it from the honourable member's intervention that, based on his reference to the passenger movement charge, the media release that attacked the New South Wales government over its dramatic change last week with respect to the movement of passengers in the cruise ship industry—





Mr Baldwin:
  This is about your government, Minister, and your accountability.




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  Let us have a little bit of consistency when it comes to the question of the movement of Australians in and out of Australia. It is all right when out of the blue the New South Wales government introduces a new cruise ship tax of $20 per person, whereas previously it was an amount levied on each vessel by the appropriate port authorities. 




Mr Baldwin:
  Minister, this is about your tax!




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  If it is good enough for the coalition in New South Wales to do this, then why can't the Australian government similarly adjust taxes as required? 


Perhaps the member for Paterson should also give the House an explanation as to why it was all right for the coalition when in government to increase the passenger movement charge on a regular basis, but it is not all right for the current Australian Labor government to do so. Let us go through a little bit of history in terms of when he was a member of the Howard government over 13 long years.




Mr Baldwin:
  You are not answering the question.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! Is the honourable member seeking to ask a question?




Mr Baldwin:
  No, I am seeking to answer a question, as the minister has actually asked me a question.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No, sit down please.




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  Let us go to the passenger movement charge. Yes, there was an increase in the budget—




Mr Baldwin:
  A rip-off.




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  just as there was an increase in the passenger movement charge in 1999 by the Howard government, from $27 to $30. Then they sought to create the impression that this would just be to cover short-term costs related to the Olympic Games, but all of a sudden we found that increase was to continue—it was set in concrete.


Then we go to 2001. It increased in 1999 and then in 2001we had a further increase from $30 to $38, an increase of 27 per cent. So it is good for the coalition, it is okay to increase the passenger movement charge, but when it comes to a government of an alternative political persuasion it is not appropriate.


Let us also go to what we did as against the opposition. The increase in the passenger movement charge will have a minimal impact on the Australian tourism industry, because it is actually going better than the member for Paterson would like it to go both internationally and domestically. The average international visitor during the 2010-11 financial year spent $4,096 when visiting Australia. The proposed increase in the passenger movement charge of $8, or 17 per cent—a lower increase than the 27 per cent increase in 2001—represents only a small cost in the context of total visitor spend: 0.2 per cent.


I also inform the House that work undertaken in 2011 by the Centre of Economic Policy at the University of New South Wales on behalf of the state and territory governments—overseen by Tourism Research Australia—modelled a 20 per cent increase in the passenger movement charge, higher than what the government proposes. It found that it would have minimal impact on international visitation and potentially a positive impact in terms of Australians not going overseas, which is one of the desires of the Australian tourism industry. At the moment, we have 5.5 million visitors per year from overseas with 7.5 million Australians going overseas per year because of the strength of the Australian dollar—and the strength of the Australian economy.


On the question relating to how the Australian tourism industry is going, the truth is that in relative terms, given the challenges in North America and Europe—and I suppose the opposition spokesman has not noticed that there are major economic challenges in North America and Europe at the moment—international tourism is doing well from an Australian perspective. In 2011, there were 5.9 million international arrivals, a similar result to 2010, which is not bad given the challenges in Europe and North America. Growth in Chinese arrivals was particularly strong, with an increase of 19.4 per cent in one year. Indonesian arrivals were up 13.2 per cent—and people forget the importance of Indonesia. And there was an increase in Indian arrivals of 6.8 per cent. (Time expired)

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (18:17):  I ask the minister if he would not mind switching hats for me—switching from his beach hat to his mining and resources hard hat. I have a great deal of sympathy for you, because you strike me as quite a practical man. I do not know how you manage to sit through some of your cabinet meetings listening to the bulldust about the carbon tax. I know that in your heart of hearts, Minister, you do not actually believe in what you are being forced to implement.


I want the minister to try to explain to me the seemingly contradictory position that he has. He has openly spoken about his support for efforts to clean up brown coal, possibly for export purposes. I think that it was the minister who coined the phrase, 'The Latrobe Valley could be the Pilbara of Victoria.' I believe that that position contradicts and is in stark contrast with your government's contract-for-closure policy, under which you are seeking to force the closure of 2,000 megawatts of brown coal power production and force the owners of those power stations out of business. Perhaps the minister can explain to me the miracle that occurs on the ships as they cross the seas in which this brown coal is somehow cleaned of its carbon content. Minister, I do not believe that you have any love for the contract-for-closure policy. Previously, you have left yourself a fair bit of wriggle room in your comments. You are saying that it is not contract for closure at any price. You are probably the only minister who has left himself a bit of wriggle room in that regard.


On the contract-for-closure policy, given that we are just days away from the 1 July deadline the government has set, will the minister deny that the government is going to announce an extension of time for this process? Isn't it a fact, Minister, that the whole process is completely off the rails and there is no prospect of an agreement within the next couple of weeks and that you need an extension of time to try and salvage something from this policy wreckage? Rather than announce an extension of time, Minister, why won't you do what you really want to do, which is abandon this dud of a policy, a policy that will cost jobs and do nothing to change the temperature of the planet? Minister, we both know that closing coal-fired power stations in the Latrobe Valley will not deliver a single direct environmental benefit anywhere in the world. We both know that contract for closure is a dud policy. Minister, will you deny that the government is going to announce an extension of time on its contract-for-closure policy?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Oakeshott
):  The Minister for Resources, Energy and Tourism. But before I do call him, I would remind the member for Gippsland about parliamentary language. There was one particular word used in that speech with the blank look. I will remind him the word 'bulldust' is certainly in context. It is a word where better words can be found to describe the same concerns. The minister.

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Mr MARTIN FERGUSON
 (Batman—Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (18:19):  Let us, firstly, deal with the nature of the Latrobe Valley. The Latrobe Valley is rich in brown coal reserves. Let us also be frank, historically it is not able to be exported because it of its high moisture content and its combustible nature. The government is therefore absolutely involved with the Victorian government in exploring potential technology opportunities. The opportunities are basically driven by the private sector to which both parties are prepared to make a financial contribution and to assess potential technology, which would reduce the moisture content, and hence make it exportable. Also from an export potential it would represent a further energy opportunity for countries not as rich in resources as Australia in reducing emissions. For example, one of the projects involves Australian proponents in association with a company out of India. The lignite in the Latrobe Valley is akin to the lignite in India—high in moisture content—and if we break through on the technology front we create a new export opportunity.


I am pleased to say that there are a whole variety of potential technology solutions in the Latrobe Valley including carbon caption storage which we also committed money to in trying to guarantee the future of the Latrobe Valley. In terms of the contract-for-closure process, obviously there are a range of issues of a commercial-in-confidence nature. I can also say that a number of the applicants—as has the government—have negotiated in good faith. They are interested in assessing whether or not it is possible within the envelope provided by government to enter into an agreement over time to reduce the emissions in the Latrobe Valley in terms of the high-emitting nature of the Latrobe Valley. No-one can deny that in relative terms the emissions out of a coal fired power station in Victoria are significantly higher than most other coal fired power stations in Australia.


Hence, we also have the approach to technology of how to reduce the moisture content and, in doing so, reduce the emissions. With respect to the contract-for-closure process, if we make the breakthrough in technology, who will know what we will get out of the contract-for-closure process? There is an envelope and I will not go beyond the envelope because our assessment of what is value for money in terms of those existing power stations. Should one power station, for example, close, a change on technology can guarantee the future life and even potentially extend the life of other coal fired power stations because of the potential capacity to reduce emissions.


These processes and negotiations are continuing, including with HRL and Energy Brix. I had further discussions today including, I might say, with the Victorian government to assess all available options. The real issue is: how do we assist the Latrobe Valley in creating a new future. I remind the honourable member that, under a direct action of his own coalition party room's policy at the last election, their intent to close power stations in the Latrobe Valley was absolutely reflected in direct action. I am reminding him of the policy at the last election—he was a candidate at the last election—



Mr Chester interjecting—




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  It would be done by using consolidated revenue, which would close the Latrobe Valley because the coalition at the time also appreciated—



Mr Chester interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order!




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  If possible, we had to work on a technological front to reduce the emissions and to guarantee the Latrobe Valley a future. That is what I am consumed with and that is why I have a close working relationship with my Victorian counterpart, the minister for regional development, and with Mr Ryan the Deputy Premier of Victoria.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Have you concluded your answer, Minister?




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  Yes. If he gets his time, he could ask another question.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Does the member for Gippsland seek to ask a question?




Mr Chester:
  Yes, if that is okay, Mr Deputy Speaker.

Mr MARTIN FERGUSON
 (Batman—Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (18:24):  Consider my answer. I refer to the technology which reduces the moisture content therefore, potentially, makes it exportable because it is no longer combustible. It also means the end use has low emissions, be it in Australia or overseas. My answer also referred to the fact that, if you get the necessary break from technology for whatever power stations that may continue operation in the valley, it makes them lower emitting; therefore, more viable under a carbon tax regime.

It's actually impossible to spend that amount of money responsibly.


Does the minister agree with that statement? If he does not agree with that statement, can he explain to the House exactly what control he and his department have over the expenditure of the institute, which according to an article written by Lenore Taylor—who I am sure the minister has respect for because Lenore gets things right—describes a lavish lifestyle of that committee as it travelled first-class around the world having meetings at exorbitantly expensive venues. The questions are: does he agree with Brad Page that it is actually impossible to spend that amount of money responsibly, and can he explain what control he has over the institute to stop it wasting money?

Mr Ian Macfarlane interjecting—




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  I might have had other issues to attend to over the weekend. The total Australian government funding for the institute is $315 million to 2016-17. You will find that, since the institute was first established through normal budget processes, I as the minister have been part of the process of winding back, in my opinion, the institute's allocation of funding to what we believed was appropriate. I was part of that process. The initial figure raised is no longer the figure, as the honourable member appreciates.


The current funding allocation enables us to pull our weight internationally as the major coal-exporting nation in the world, to participate in other countries in terms of the research and learning processes potentially related to how we reduce the cost of carbon capture and storage. The technology is not proven; the issue is how to reduce the cost to commercialisation. In the same way we have to work out how we reduce the cost of every other form of clean energy, be it nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal or whatever. Our responsibility as a nation is to invest in R&D in these alternative forms of clean energy with one exception. We are not investing in nuclear because, frankly, we do not have to. If Australia at some point decides to go nuclear, there are further technological advances being made by other countries, who are responsible for this technology, which we will buy off the shelf at a point in the future if the community so decides. For other forms of clean energy such as carbon capture and storage, we have to pull our weight.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (18:30):  It is good to be here in the Federation Chamber with my friend the member for Mayo. I look forward to his contribution as always.




Mr Griffin:
  What about me?




Mr CHAMPION:
  And we can all hope that we are Griffinesque. That is all I can say. I would like to congratulate the member for Fraser on his motion. It is a good motion. It looks at the economic situation, and there is much to be positive about—800,000 jobs since 2007 and an unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent, lower than all but one of the major advanced economies. We are beating the rest of the world, whether you look at the United States, the United Kingdom or Europe generally. We have a very good news story to tell on jobs. We have a very good news story to tell on inflation, which is low. We have a very good news story to tell on wages growth, which is faster than CPI. We know that the best way to deal with the cost of living is to have growing wages and, if you have not got a job, to get a job and, if you got a job, to get a better job. That is always the best way of dealing with the cost of living. We have got low interest rates, which of course are a major contributor to family and household budgets. We have got low debt—not high debt but low debt—and we have got an investment pipeline, which, according to the Treasurer tonight, increased by 12.3 per cent in the March quarter, to reach a record of $1.086 billion, the first time more than $1 billion has been spent on mineral exploration in a single quarter. That exploration has risen by 35 per cent since the price of carbon was announced, and 80 per cent since the minerals resource rent tax. So we have a stunning investment pipeline, which will basically underwrite future economic growth. We have doubled investment in schools. We have an extra 116,000 university places, which we know are a major contributor to future economic growth. We have a record number of people in training and apprenticeships. We have some 460,000 Australians currently in trade apprenticeships or vocational training nationwide.


So we have got a very good news story, particularly when you look at the rest of the world. The US recovery is slow due to the housing overhang and the results of the household debt and banking debts that were incurred during their crisis. Europe is having a political crisis which has economic implications, which is all basically around the security of debt and who is going to be responsible about it. We see them pursuing damaging and counterproductive short-term austerity programs, very similar to what the coalition would advocate for Australia. We know that in Europe the only solution is a guarantee of all European debt, followed by short-term growth policies and finally a program of long-term austerity, not short-term austerity. That is what will fix Europe.


We know what is going to come up next. The member for Mayo is going to stand up here and pour scorn on Australia's economic record. We know that the opposition like going overseas and talking about how good Australia's economy is and then, when they get in front of a hometown audience, they will have you believing that black is white and up is down. They will be talking the place down, trying to damage consumer confidence and pretending that Australia's economy is like the rest of the world's. This is very damaging speculation. We know that the member for Mayo has speculated about mining investment in my state, South Australia. He will do so again—talking the state down, talking mining down in the state.

  The Kim Carr collection—the member for Wakefield has just revealed his true colours! I thought the member for Wakefield was from Don's right, but it turns out he is from Kim's left, so that is a bit of a shock. That is a revelation in this chamber this evening. It is coming back in the new line.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Oakeshott
):  Order! This is about the national economy, not about fashion. Can we get on to the debate, please.




Mr BRIGGS:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. This is a motion moved by the member for Fraser. I think it is the second or third time the member for Fraser has tried to use a motion in the chamber on the economic situation to prove his economic prowess to the current Prime Minister—although he does spend a fair bit of time up in that back corner talking to the former Prime Minister and potentially future Prime Minister about seeking promotion, no doubt. I think the last point is a very important aspect of the motion. It calls upon members to approach economic debates with 'facts rather than fear'. That is true, and I agree with that provision of the motion. My good friend the member for Wakefield said in his contribution that I had raised questions about mining investment in South Australia and the potential risks to it. Actually, it was not me. As much as I would like to be the chairman of BHP at some stage in the future, I am not; that position is held by a man called Jacques Nasser—who used to be, of course, in charge of one of the member for Wakefield's beloved car companies in this country, so I would have thought he would be quite supportive of Mr Nasser. 




Mr Champion:
  He was a Ford man!




Mr BRIGGS:
  He was a Ford man, rather than Holden. Unfortunately, the member for Wakefield has launched a vicious attack on Mr Nasser in suggesting that Mr Nasser is raising fear and scare tactics on the Australian economy by saying that the absolutely vital investment for our state in Olympic Dam, the expansion of that project and the huge opportunities is brings—we have seen in the state budget that 0.5 per cent of the lowly growth predicted in the state budget will actually be contributed by the Olympic Dam expansion—are all at risk because of four factors. Three of those factors are in the hands of—

  Don't abuse me like that! 




Mr Champion:
  You would make a great premier!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! Can we keep the debate civil.




Mr BRIGGS:
  Civil—thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. You know how abusive that threat is! Three of the four policy decisions that are putting at risk this investment for South Australia's future are in the hands of the federal government. We know that includes the reregulation of the Australian workplace and the empowerment of the union thugs back on the work sites. We have seen that with strike after strike, with coalmines shut down in Queensland. Those opposite want to blind themselves to this, because of course they receive such significant donations. But we know that this is causing such problems with the Australian economy. We read it day in, day out. We know that Mr Nasser also pointed to the inconsistent policy approach when it comes to tax—the mining tax debate which has caused so much sovereign risk to our country. The Labor Party pretend that we are the only country in the world with—




Mr Champion:
  Why is there such a big investment pipeline?




Mr BRIGGS:
  It is an investment pipeline. It has not been fulfilled yet, mate. That is the bit we want. We want tomorrow's prosperity. Economic figures today reflect yesterday's performance. Today's reforms will reflect tomorrow's prosperity, and this is the bit the Labor party do not understand. They want to treat our mining industry as if we are the only country in the world that has resources. Of course, that is not true. The world is awash with resources. If we make it harder to compete on the international stage with our resources industry that investment, that pipeline they like to talk about, the $20 billion potential investment at Olympic Dam in South Australia will not go ahead and tomorrow's prosperity is then at risk. This is the risk of the Labor Party and their legacy to this country. Do not worry about the sleaze and the incompetence. The real insidious legacy of this government, when they finally finish off the current Prime Minister and go back to the former Prime Minister, will be the economic reform record of this government. It will leave Australians with a debt legacy for a generation and with a prosperity problem for a generation.

Imagine the way the political discourse would be carried on in this country if we were loaded up with the number of jobless that exist in those countries. Certainly no-one wishes that on anyone but having that level of unemployment, not only as an economic issue but as a social one as well and its massive distortion on politics, would be phenomenal if it were to occur in this country. If anything, in terms of this debate, it is not so much that we talk about facts themselves; it is more getting a recognition of facts from those opposite. When you look at where our economy is relative to others, our economy has done phenomenally well. We are right to be proud. 



Mr Briggs interjecting—




Mr HUSIC:
  There are a lot of people that, I would say, Member for Mayo, seek to be gracious about the contribution of those opposite. It is easy to flog off a major asset like Telstra and use that money to retire debt, but where were you when we needed investment in education?




Mr Champion:
  Why have we got a skills shortage?




Mr HUSIC:
  And let us talk about health.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! There is one member who is on his feet. Please respect him.




Mr HUSIC:
  Instead of actually investing in health care, there was a massive dole out of funds through private health insurance. There was not an investment in hospitals; there was an underinvestment in health. In terms of education itself, instead of putting money into TAFE, those opposite sought to duplicate the TAFE system by setting up their own rival TAFE system and underfunding TAFE. Yes, you did get a surplus—everyone acknowledges that. It is the way that you got there and the underinvestment and what was left as a result of that and the type of issues that we have to deal with now. The Reserve Bank was saying from the early part of the last decade that capacity constraints were the biggest threat to the economy, that those capacity constraints were in the form of skills shortages and infrastructure constraints that needed to be addressed and were not. I have already talked about what happened in education. Where were you on infrastructure? You pretty much abandoned, for instance, anything to do with urban planning or involvement in urban infrastructure—not only making cities liveable but ensuring the fluid movement of people and goods within cities. 


I will give credit to those opposite. The one bit of infrastructure that you did get to was the M7, and you only got to it because you put a toll on it. I am first to admit that the M7 was certainly—



Mr Briggs interjecting—




Mr HUSIC:
  Well, my preference is not that we have to rely on tolls, but that we are able to invest without putting the imposition of tolls. Most of the infrastructure in this country has not been developed simply as a result of putting a toll bucket on the end of it. Again, if you look at unemployment, at inflation and at growth, we have a great advantage relative to others. My biggest concern is not just about our recognising the strength of this economy but about making sure that we continue to ensure that this is an open economy, one that connects within the region, that maintains, for example, a commitment to recognising the value of Australian investment, along with foreign investment; that we are able to take advantage, for example, of what we have as a result of the NBN and take advantage of our IT sector and what that can do in connecting us, not only internally but within our region. As much as this is a discussion for here and now—and what I will pick up on in terms of what the member for Mayo is saying—the reforms that we make now generate prosperity down the track. I am certainly proud of being part of a government that has put us in a position where we are able to leap off the advantage that has been given to us.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (18:45):  What we are seeing in this motion and in all of those opposite who speak on it is so typical of this government's approach: they automatically think that the good aspects of the Australian economy have something to do with them. I would not be so churlish as to say that the past reforms of past Labor governments have not contributed to Australia's economic performance today, just as the past reforms of the coalition government. But those opposite—




Mr Griffin:
  That would be your ex-boss.




Mr TONY SMITH:
  belong to a government that has done so badly in so many areas. There is no shame; repeatedly, week after week, day after day, there are motions of self-congratulation when, really, if you look at what this government has done and the way it goes about it, it is very, very obvious to Australians that not only is this a bad government but it is a government that will claim credit for things it has not done. It is a government that, still, with every breath, with every day and with every act will not be straight with the Australian people. My friend and colleague the member for Mayo articulated very eloquently the government's failings on some major policy areas. If you take this long motion from Dr Leigh, it calls, amongst other things, for debates with facts. Now, this motion is coming out at a time when the government is sending letters to pensioners about cash for the carbon tax, and the Prime Minister's office is tweeting 'cash for you'.


The public rightly see through this. There are letters such as the one I have here with the headline 'Extra cash for you' and reads: 'Cheaper than a $2 shop, extra cash for you. P.S. This is just part of the extra help the government is giving millions of Australians.' Extra help for what? 'Extra help to deal with the carbon tax, compensation to help with the injury we are causing you with the carbon tax.' Dr Leigh says there should be debates about facts. What about some facts on a letter headlined 'Extra cash for you'? What about another P.P.S saying: 'All of this is borrowed money.' That would be one fact that, if you were upfront with the Australian people, you would put in a letter that you were sending out. What about explaining to the Australian people that every dollar that the government is giving is borrowed and they will have to pay it back, and their children will have to pay it back? But, no, you do not get that from this government or from those who support this government—those who prop it up.


As I mentioned at the outset, we saw on the weekend the hashtag from the Prime Minister's office, 'Cash for you'. Quite rightly, the Twittersphere responded as you would expect. One tweet likened it to an African bank scam, as you would expect: '#cashforyou. Urgent business relationship. First, I am a Nigerian prince and must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction.' This government that seriously stands before this parliament is sending out letters with 'cash for you' and twee hashtags, as I have said, and is expecting the public to take them seriously. What the Australian people know is that this money that is being sent out is borrowed money. There is $100 million a day being borrowed. In your personal life, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Oakeshott, because you are a normal family guy, if you spend on your credit card you get the bill. With the government, they have got the card, but it is the families that get the bill. They pay the bill. This government borrows money on their behalf to send out to them and then writes them a letter congratulating itself on sending the money out, headlined, 'Extra cash for you'. We have all the oratory from the Prime Minister. That is what it has come to for the Labor Party. From Curtain to Chifley, I would even say the oratory of Whitlam, down to this Prime Minister: 'Cash for you.' That says it all about this government, and to have a motion from Dr Leigh on serious economic issues— (Time expired)

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (18:51):  The member for Casey talked a bit about history. I was very interested to read the recent book by George Megalogenis and to read about Billy Snedden, then opposition leader, in about July 1973 summoning the coalition leaders to Sydney to talk about the fact that the Whitlam Labor government had failed, that the experiment was wrong and all these jeremiads about how bad it was. When I read the book it was like reading a speech from the current Leader of the Opposition. It was the fact that those opposite never, ever accept the legitimacy of a Labor government. It is the divine right to rule that is in their heads and in their hearts.


What you really should believe is what they say when they go overseas, not what they say when they are campaigning here. We have had the Leader of the Opposition running around like some sort of Old Testament prophet saying, 'We're all doomed,' like Sodom and Gomorrah or something like that. The whole thing is about to collapse. Australia is like Sodom and Gomorrah: it is going to collapse; the economy has completely had it. But when they go overseas it is a different story. When they are speaking to an international audience they endorse the direction and the strong economic fundamentals of the economy. In fact, in his budget-in-reply speech, the opposition Treasury spokesperson said that economic growth under this government had been poor. But he went on Bloomberg TV and conceded that the economic fundamentals of the economy were strong. The Leader of the Opposition declared that the federal Labor government would never return the budget to surplus, as we projected and Treasury projects, but he actually recalibrated his message, with his Treasury spokesperson talking up the Treasurer's steps to deliver a surplus when he was overseas. When he is overseas he says, 'Yes, it's going to happen.' But, when he is in Australia, it is a different story entirely because it does not suit their narrative and their campaign purpose. Last year when he was in London, the Leader of the Opposition claimed that Australia had serious bragging rights, but now there is a sovereign risk with a Labor government.


All we can say about those opposite is that they are inconsistent. They have a mercurial if not schizophrenic approach to economic management that is governed by 30-second sound bites. But I prefer to listen to what the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development have to say about our economy. When those opposite are in power they say that they are great managers of the economy, but when Labor is in power and the economy is going well it has nothing to do with the government; it is all to do with other events and other people. But when they are in power you hear the exact opposite.


If they had bothered to go to the recent forum in Brisbane, they would have heard firsthand what the participants at the forum said. But they called it a talkfest. The Premier of my state did not even bother to turn up to it in his hometown. It was a missed opportunity to meet with the captains of industry and leaders of the unions to talk about how to improve the economy and improve the productivity of the country. We know when you have a look at the economy, you see the five per cent unemployment rate. About 835,000 jobs have been created since we have been in office, while 27 million jobs have been lost in the Western world. We have low interest rates—lower than when those opposite were in government. I distinctly remember being a candidate in 2004 when former Prime Minister John Howard talked about interest rates always being lower under a coalition government. It is completely untrue. We have a growing economy. We are one of the few countries to actually avoid a recession and it is because we were not asleep at the wheel when it came to the global financial crisis. We invested in timely, stimulus events and it had to be done. Those opposite failed. They would have taken us to unemployment and recession. We invested in road infrastructure, school infrastructure, health infrastructure and community infrastructure. Why? We wanted to keep jobs going. That is why we have an unemployment rate of about 4.6 per cent in Ipswich. Traditionally, Ipswich has almost double the national average rate of unemployment during times of hardship and decline. We invested in great projects like the Ipswich Motorway, where about 10,000 people had jobs. We invested in those projects; those opposite spent three campaigns campaigning against that. That is an indication of why the economic fundamentals are strong in this country.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2012-06-18,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (18:56):  I rise also to speak on this thesis of Dr Leigh's, and quite a thesis it is. I just hope that the one that got him his doctorate had a little more substance than this one. He talks about the key issue being whether we want the economic discussion to be about fact or fiction. My view of this thesis of emotion is that really it is Dr Leigh's motion of no confidence in the Treasurer. It is saying that the Treasurer's record cannot stand on its own; therefore we need all members of the Labor Party to stand up and hail the Treasurer for the wonderful job that he has done, whereas they all know and see it in question time everyday that this Treasurer has no credibility whatsoever. He can take credit for nothing because he has done nothing of substance as Treasurer to in any way improve the productivity of this nation. 


This no confidence motion in the Treasurer, as set out in this thesis by Dr Leigh, has no substance to it. Let us look at what is fact. Let us look at the fact that the Labor Party will not call the carbon tax for what it is: a tax. It always says 'carbon price'. Yet the Prime Minister, under duress, admitted that it is a carbon tax. So now they must not dare mention carbon tax in anything that goes out; it has to be carbon price. Let us get some facts. Let the Labor government tomorrow in the chamber come out and use the words 'carbon tax'—call it for what it is. Let us see some facts. 


Let us also see them detail the real impact that it is going to have on the Australian community. I do not think that Dr Leigh or the others we have heard from today will do that. The memo has gone out to the Labor Party: 'You cannot use the term ""carbon tax"", even though the Prime Minister admitted that that is what it is. You have to use carbon price.' Not only do they have to use carbon price; they then use bribes to try to overcome the detrimental impact that it is going to have on the Australian people. They will use those bribes and market them under this '#cashforyou'. I must commend the member for Mayo for the wonderful press release that he put out last week on this '#cashforyou', where he demonstrated magnificently what it is all about: cash being taken from future generations of Australians to bribe the current generation of Australians to try to forget about the impact that this carbon tax will have on them. He referred to it as being very similar to an African Ponzi scheme, with the emails we all get trying to rip off the Australian public. It was extremely apt and hit the nail on the head when it comes to fact versus fiction with this government.


We also have other examples. Let us look at the budget surplus—the budget surplus which the Treasurer has said that he will deliver. Why then, on the nation's credit card, did he sneak through a rise from $250 billion to $300 billion? And why, when we sought to make this clear in the budget papers, would he have nothing of it? We wanted to get the fact in that, even though he was budgeting for a surplus, he wanted a $50 billion extension on the nation's credit card. Would he allow that fact to be revealed in the budget papers clearly? No, he would not. 


Let us look at cost of living. I do not see any mention of cost of living in Dr Leigh's motion before us. Since this government came to power, electricity costs have increased by 65.7 per cent; water and sewage, 59.1 per cent; utilities, 58 per cent; gas, 38.7 per cent; insurance, 33.4 per cent; education, 31.1 per cent; medical and hospital services, 28. 8 per cent; and rents, 25. 8 per cent. The list goes on and on, and I have not even got to child care. The government has done nothing to address these cost-of-living issues and it is about to make it worse when it introduces the carbon tax on 1 July. 


We on this side are happy to talk about facts until we get to the next election and we can get rid of this incompetent Labor government.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (20:33):  Marriage is a cultural institution of long standing, and the prospect of change is unsettling to many people. But we should remember that society is always changing, that it has undergone great change even in a nation as relatively young as ours, and that the changes we have made over the last 100 years or so in addressing discrimination on the basis of gender, race and sexual orientation, though in almost every instance slow, difficult and hard-won, have been profoundly beneficial. 


In 1902 Australia became the first country in which women could both vote in federal elections and contest those elections as candidates. But it was not until 1962, only 50 years ago, that the Commonwealth Electoral Act extended the franchise to all Indigenous people. In the early part of the 20th century there were Commonwealth ordinances that restricted the marriage of Indigenous Australians, and in places like WA the permission of the Chief Protector was required before an Aboriginal person could marry a non-Aboriginal person. It was not until 1966 that we scrapped the rule that had forbidden the permanent employment of a married woman in the Commonwealth Public Service. It was not until the 1970s that the efforts of organisations like the Women's Electoral Lobby and the work of people like Jocelynne Scutt began to bring about legislative reform to address the common-law immunity for a man charged with the rape of his wife. Less than 50 years ago, a woman, by virtue of marriage, could not be a permanent employee of the Public Service and could be legally raped by her husband.


I cannot imagine anyone looking back at those circumstances and wanting to return to them today. But nor should we imagine that reform occurred easily. Some of these changes were fiercely resisted, and all of them took a long time to achieve, even after the terrible discrimination that they represented had been identified, and even though removing that discrimination now seems a matter of plainest common sense. The restrictions on who could marry whom and the abrogation of certain rights or protections within marriage did not stand alone as discrete instances of discrimination but rather stood as manifestations of a widespread discriminatory malaise that applied to Australian women and Indigenous Australians. 


Within a marriage—as within society as a whole and its laws, institutions and culture—Australian women had fewer rights and lesser standing than men, and Indigenous people had fewer rights and lesser standing than non-Indigenous Australians. Despite the progress over the past 50 or 60 years, that broad inequality has not yet been fully erased. The same is true of gay men and women today. Same-sex couples being excluded from the opportunity to choose the category of relationship that we generally regard as representing the greatest degree of love and commitment is a form of pure discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. For that reason, it is illogical, unfair, intolerant and intolerable. Just as the discriminatory aspects of marriage as it applied to women and Indigenous Australians bespoke a larger and connected set of inequities, so does marriage discrimination against same-sex couples. 


The journey we have made over the last 100 years, on the road to being a more tolerant, more cohesive and more egalitarian nation with each passing decade, has delivered benefits in which we have all shared. As part of that, the reforms introduced by this government in 2009 represented a huge leap in the legal and administrative recognition of same-sex couples, with all the rights, security and peace of mind that attend those changes. Those reforms built on the wider cultural shift that has occurred. While gay men and women have made their contributions to Australian life from the outset, for much of our history gay Australians, ordinary and extraordinary alike, have been personally, socially and economically constrained through intolerance and discrimination. 


Once upon a time it would have been unusual if not practically impossible for a new senator, like Dean Smith, or for the leader of a political party, like Bob Brown, to be openly gay. It would have been unusual for a High Court justice, like Michael Kirby, to be openly gay or for a CEO, like Alan Joyce, or for a sportsperson, like Matthew Mitcham or Ian Roberts or Natalie Cook. It would have been just as unlikely and in many ways even more difficult for a bricklayer in Donnybrook, a school teacher in Hamilton Hill or a GP in Port Hedland, let alone a year 9 student or the captain of a school footy team. Those difficulties continue to be very real, because discrimination against gay Australians is very real and often very cruel. The consequences of that discrimination, especially for young people, include bullying, severe alienation, violence and mental illness.


Families and households come in all shapes and sizes and yet the most important things remain the same: the sense of belonging, love, happiness and wellbeing. Happiness shared is not happiness diluted. I support this bill and the change it represents because there is no reason or evidence to believe that sharing the benefits of marital commitment more widely heralds anything other than greater tolerance and stability and love in our community.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2012-06-18,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (20:38):  I rise to speak about the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 and an issue I am very passionate about, marriage equality. I realise that this issue is highly contentious and affects all communities. The electorate of Wright, which I serve, is no different. I am a firm believer that, if a fellow politician wants to be brave, they should stand up before an election and use this issue as a platform in order to try and win government. I do not agree with the wider view that marriage in Australia has changed since the 2010 federal election. I wholeheartedly support the coalition in believing that the definition of marriage contained in the existing provisions of the Marriage Act of 1974 appropriately affects the common understanding of marriage in the Australian community: 'The union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.' I am not persuaded that this definition should be changed. It is not a piece of legislation that can or should be considered lightly. The effect of making any changes to the Marriage Act as it currently stands will have many psychological and social implications, which at this point in time are not well researched and understood. I am not just talking about the welfare of children.


Firstly, I must highlight to this parliament that I was brought up in a family with strong Christian values. While I am no saint, I stand by these values because they have been and continue to be a fundamental moral compass for my life. In a speech on 13 February 2012, the member for Melbourne spoke about love, stating that it has no boundaries and no limits. However, I say that love is a feeling, just the same as anger, frustration, confusion and hate. I certainly do not feel it necessary to try and convince the parliament that I should be allowed to act upon it with anyone I meet. The same Christian values that I was brought up on have helped me to understand that. Can you imagine the consequences for society if we were to legislate acts of violence, for example, due to the feelings of hate? It would be a disaster.


Secondly, I made a commitment to the preselectors of Wright before the last election that I believe marriage should be between a man and a woman and that I intend to honour that commitment—a concept sometimes foreign to the people on the other side of this House. Thirdly, I question the long-term effects the amendments to the Marriage Act will have on children who will become the innocent victims should we fail to ensure that we accurately know and understand the psychological and social effects of growing up with same-sex parents. This is not an area where we should be allowing experimentation. In a speech for the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2010 on Friday, 4 May 2012, Professor Tom Frame highlighted that same-sex marriage cements an alienation of one children from one or both biological parents.


My last point is in relation to the perception that some of the arguments against the bill are discriminatory. My decision to not support this bill is not aimed to discriminate or separate those who choose to have a same-sex relationship, because I am convinced that the changes to the Marriage Act as it currently stands will do far greater harm to our society. The Prime Minister pointed out on ABC's Q&A on Monday, 11 June, that there is no practical discrimination against same-sex couples in Australia. In 2008, 85 laws were changed in favour of those same-sex relationships and was supported unanimously by Labor and the coalition removing all discrimination in Commonwealth law. State law was genuinely ahead of the Commonwealth on this but relationship registers or their equivalents in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the ACT ensure that there is no discrimination at state or territory level.


I also bring to the attention of parliament the speech of 13 February. The member for Melbourne made an inaccurate statement when he said that a change in the Marriage Act will make it clear to those same-sex relationships that the parliament believes that their love is equal. The parliament has never, to my knowledge, stopped everyone from falling in love. However, marriage is not an automatic action just because I or someone else had fallen in love. If that was the case, I am sure that the majority of society would be married several times over to many people, and think what would happen to those people who love their pets.


In a submission to the Senate inquiry into the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012, family law expert Professor Patrick Parkinson said that in Australia functional equality has already been achieved. He said:


I am not aware of any legal rights and obligations that arise from marriage that do not also apply to registered same-sex unions, other than the right to call the relationship a marriage. Certainly that is so in federal law. For example, there is complete equality in terms of rights in relation to the division of property and the payment of maintenance on relationship breakdown.


In conclusion I say that, on issues as significant as this, we want to take it to a federal election. Let the people have their turn. I believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Minister for Health) (20:43):  I speak in support of the member for Throsby's motion because the time for marriage equality in Australia has come. This is a recognition of the basic equality of all Australians, regardless of sexuality or sexual identity. All Australians should have the right to legal recognition of their relationships and the advantages and responsibilities that such legal recognition brings with it. All Australians deserve the full social acceptance that removing discrimination symbolises.


I am proud of the reforms that this Labor government has made in removing those 85 pieces of discriminatory legislation, removing every piece of discriminatory Commonwealth legislation bar one. It is time to remove this last piece of discriminatory legislation. Some have said that this change is a threat to marriage, but I believe that the opposite is true. This change reinforces that marriage is a legal and social bond that many Australians aspire to in order to demonstrate their commitment to their partner. Even for those gay men and lesbians who do not want to get married, the message that this change sends is a powerful one. The message is: you are equal before Australian law and you are equal in the Australian community. No young man or young woman should feel that their same-sex attraction marks them out as a second-class citizen.


It is also about time that someone said marriage is about more than sex. This debate has focused so much on the agenda of the couple and, by implication, on the sex act itself that I think we have lost the real meaning of marriage. Marriage is about a lot more than the sex act or the gender of the couple. It is about bringing two families together and creating a third family. It is about stability, commitment, mutual love and support. It is about friendship and companionship. For many people, of course, it is a religious sacrament; for others it is a secular, social and legal commitment to their partner; and for others it is the ultimate romantic gesture.


The member for Wright spoke about the innocent victims of same-sex marriage being the children of such relationships. I find it disturbing that there are so very many children who are already the children of same-sex relationships. When they hear things like, 'They are the victims of their parents' relationship,' what do they think? Those children should not be brought up thinking that the loving, committed relationships of their parents are worth less than the loving, committed relationships of their friends' parents.


If marriage were just about sex and procreation, we would not let people who cannot or will not have children marry. But, of course, we welcome and celebrate marriage for all of the reasons I have described. I understand that many, though not all, church leaders are concerned about this change. This bill makes it clear that churches will not be forced to solemnise same-sex relationships.


I have been overwhelmed with support from my constituents for this change—not just my gay and lesbian constituents but many, many straight constituents who are opposed to discrimination. Of course I have heard from opponents as well. But, when I ask myself whether I should be on the side of change or on the side of discrimination, there is only one answer that I can reasonably give: I have to be on the side of change and equality.


I hope that in years to come, when all Australians are able to formally recognise their love without discrimination, we will look back on this debate with the same wonder we now feel that there was ever a time when couples of mixed race were prevented from marrying or when couples of mixed religion were discouraged by their families from marrying. As I have said before, it is not good enough to say to one group in our community: 'You're almost equal; you should be content with that.' We do not say to women: 'You're almost equal; you should give up the fight for equal pay.' We do not say to people living with a disability: 'You're almost equal; you should stop campaigning for greater access and support.' And we should never say to gay and lesbian Australians: 'You're almost equal; that is good enough.' Almost equal is not good enough.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (20:48):  I rise to speak against the current bill before the House and to inform the House that the coalition will not be voting for the bill. The coalition will honour the policy it took to the 2010 election to maintain the Marriage Act as relating to marriage between a male and a female. We took that to the election and people voted for us on the basis of that platform. We will honour that commitment and we will vote on policy, en bloc, as one, as a coalition against this and a similar bill that I spoke on this morning introduced by the Greens deputy leader, the member for Melbourne.


Can I just get rid of some shibboleths that exist out there, the first being that this is an issue of discrimination—that we need to remove the discrimination that exists within the Marriage Act. Having been here in 2008 and having voted for the legislation that removed 85 pieces of discrimination from 85 bits of legislation, I can say with some authority that there is zero discrimination right now in the law with respect to same-sex couples. The Prime Minister pointed this out on ABC's Q&A on Monday, 11 June, when she made this same point. Family law expert, Professor Patrick Parkinson, in his submission to the Senate inquiry, said: 'In Australia, functional equality has already been achieved. I am not aware of any legal rights and obligations that arise from marriage that do not also apply to registered same-sex unions.' The so-called marriage equality campaign that some people have entered into and engaged with with the best of intentions, to their credit, unfortunately has been deceptively hijacked by an aggressive Left-Greens agenda.


The other way that this is unfortunately being hijacked is that it is now being aggressively pushed as an anti-freedom of speech issue. The campaign has depended on first driving alternative voices out of the debate by public demonisation and then filling it with a range of disinformation. The terms 'extremist', 'hater', 'bigot' and 'propagators of hate' are some of the labels used in the media recently against the Australian Christian Lobby and against other supporters of marriage. How is it that the debate has degenerated to such standards of speech? Victoria's deputy chief psychiatrist, Professor Kuruvilla George, was forced to resign as commissioner on the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission because he participated in a submission to the Senate's inquiry which supported retaining the definition of marriage. There were calls by numerous gay activists for tennis great Margaret Court's name to be removed from an arena at the Melbourne tennis centre because of her disagreement over same-sex marriage. The ACL submission to the Senate inquiry documents numerous other cases around the world of freedom of speech on this debate being infringed.


In every jurisdiction where marriage or something able to be described in law as the same as marriage has been given this situation has only worsened. Proponents of marriage equality have tried to assure that the church will not be forced to provide marriage equality to same-sex couples. Yet, Denmark, the first country in the world to recognise civil partnerships for same-sex couples, this month legislated to force the church to provide same-sex weddings. The rights of parents to determine what their children are taught in the area of sexuality has been dramatically curtailed in places like Massachusetts in the United States, where gay marriage has been legislated because it must be presented as equal once given the same status as marriage. Parents have been fined by the state for objecting to socialising even their preschoolers. This is almost certain to follow such legislation here in this country when the Australian Education Union already has in its 2006 policy on gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and intersex people on page 3 that it is determined to teach that heterosexism is discriminatory.


With those sorts of radical forces at play in our community, this is not a debate about whether loving couples can marry. This has nothing to do with that. There are many genuine people who are seeking that debate but this debate has been radicalised. This is about reshaping the national conscience and the law in the image of some people who want to see a radical agenda in place. The coalition will have no bar of it. We went to an election promising that marriage will be between a male and a female. We actually honour and hold our election policies. We do not change them on a whim and we will not change this one.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (20:53):  This is the fourth occasion on which I find myself speaking on same-sex marriage. I spoke in favour of same-sex marriage in this place on 13 February of this year, the day before Valentine's Day; on 24 August last year I reported back to parliament on the views of my constituents; and on 30 July last year I spoke to the ALP ACT national conference on the issue. So I wanted to use the opportunity today to read into Hansard some of the stories of my constituents which I have received over recent months. Daniel Edmonds wrote to me:



When I was young, I asked my grandmother what her view would be on having a gay grandchild. Her response was steadfast: ""I could not support it,"" she said. ""It would be against God, and against everything I believe in."" Years later, I came out to my family before leaving home to move to university (an economics degree!). My grandmother was unsteady in the knowledge that she now had a gay grandchild, something that was seen as uncommon in North Queensland at the time. It was years before she was able to bring it up in conversation with me. However, when she finally did, it really moved me. ""I want you to know that I will always support you, and love you, no matter who you love."" Ever since, she has met my partners, opened her arms to them as part of the family, and consoled me when those relationships didn't last. I am very lucky to still have my grandmother, but I only regret that in all likelihood my grandmother will not be able to attend my wedding day. I appreciate you fighting for the right of future grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, brothers and sisters to be able to attend the wedding days of their beloved family members.


Ian Brown wrote to me:


My partner, Roger, and I have been together for (gulp) 40 years and were 'civilly united' in 2006 under UK law, as he holds a UK passport.


We had our ceremony in the British consulate in Sydney—they said we could have a maximum of six guests so naturally we invited 30!


It was one of the most exciting days of my life and I will always remember my late mother's tears of joy on our finally being 'married' after a 34 year 'engagement'!


Another constituent, Bill, from Ainslie, wrote to tell me of his experience watching an interview with Bishop Pat Power on 7.30last Friday. In that interview Bishop Power said:


... where two people have that definite commitment to each other and if they make the decision before God well I would say that their blessed in that life that they're living and they do that with honour and respect for one another ... I would want those people to feel at home within the life of the church.


Bill had written to me previously to say that he did not support same-sex marriage. He wrote to me after seeing that interview and said:


Good Morning Andrew,


For what it's worth and just to let you know, after hearing Bishop Power speak and having met and spoken to several Gay people myself I have now changed my mind and support Gay marriage.


I felt that you treated my position then with respect and I appreciated that. I'm sure there are many others in the community who are wrestling with this issue and who will, with time and reflection, come to see the justice of the homosexual case.


There are many people of faith who have taken the view that we should support same-sex marriage. Writing in the National Times, the Reverend Harry Herbert, the Executive Director of UnitingCare NSW/ACT, refers to the fact that in the latter part of the 19th century there was a campaign to remove from marriage acts the restriction that a man could not marry a sister of his deceased wife. When it was proposed by colonial governments in Australia to remove the restriction, churches led the charge against it. Reverend Herbert quotes the Reverend Adam Cairns, who at the time described the proposed change as a 'deliberate treachery to the cause of truth' and said, 'By the unchangeable word of God such marriage is incestuous.' Reverend Herbert points out that this seems to be a selective reading of the Bible because the Book of Deuteronomy in fact enjoins a man to marry his deceased wife's sister. But the broader point that the Reverend Herbert makes is that churches should not impose on nonbelievers a vision based on faith.


In his I have a dream speech, Reverend Martin Luther King spoke of the promissory note that African-Americans were bringing to be cashed. In that speech he said that America had defaulted on her promissory note as far as her citizens of colour were concerned but that they did not believe that the 'bank of justice is bankrupt'. The same principles bring gay and lesbian Australians to this House to call for us to support same-sex marriage laws. I do so with a respect for those who disagree but with a passionate belief in the justice of this cause.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (20:33):  Marriage is a cultural institution of long standing, and the prospect of change is unsettling to many people. But we should remember that society is always changing, that it has undergone great change even in a nation as relatively young as ours, and that the changes we have made over the last 100 years or so in addressing discrimination on the basis of gender, race and sexual orientation, though in almost every instance slow, difficult and hard-won, have been profoundly beneficial. 


In 1902 Australia became the first country in which women could both vote in federal elections and contest those elections as candidates. But it was not until 1962, only 50 years ago, that the Commonwealth Electoral Act extended the franchise to all Indigenous people. In the early part of the 20th century there were Commonwealth ordinances that restricted the marriage of Indigenous Australians, and in places like WA the permission of the Chief Protector was required before an Aboriginal person could marry a non-Aboriginal person. It was not until 1966 that we scrapped the rule that had forbidden the permanent employment of a married woman in the Commonwealth Public Service. It was not until the 1970s that the efforts of organisations like the Women's Electoral Lobby and the work of people like Jocelynne Scutt began to bring about legislative reform to address the common-law immunity for a man charged with the rape of his wife. Less than 50 years ago, a woman, by virtue of marriage, could not be a permanent employee of the Public Service and could be legally raped by her husband.


I cannot imagine anyone looking back at those circumstances and wanting to return to them today. But nor should we imagine that reform occurred easily. Some of these changes were fiercely resisted, and all of them took a long time to achieve, even after the terrible discrimination that they represented had been identified, and even though removing that discrimination now seems a matter of plainest common sense. The restrictions on who could marry whom and the abrogation of certain rights or protections within marriage did not stand alone as discrete instances of discrimination but rather stood as manifestations of a widespread discriminatory malaise that applied to Australian women and Indigenous Australians. 


Within a marriage—as within society as a whole and its laws, institutions and culture—Australian women had fewer rights and lesser standing than men, and Indigenous people had fewer rights and lesser standing than non-Indigenous Australians. Despite the progress over the past 50 or 60 years, that broad inequality has not yet been fully erased. The same is true of gay men and women today. Same-sex couples being excluded from the opportunity to choose the category of relationship that we generally regard as representing the greatest degree of love and commitment is a form of pure discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. For that reason, it is illogical, unfair, intolerant and intolerable. Just as the discriminatory aspects of marriage as it applied to women and Indigenous Australians bespoke a larger and connected set of inequities, so does marriage discrimination against same-sex couples. 


The journey we have made over the last 100 years, on the road to being a more tolerant, more cohesive and more egalitarian nation with each passing decade, has delivered benefits in which we have all shared. As part of that, the reforms introduced by this government in 2009 represented a huge leap in the legal and administrative recognition of same-sex couples, with all the rights, security and peace of mind that attend those changes. Those reforms built on the wider cultural shift that has occurred. While gay men and women have made their contributions to Australian life from the outset, for much of our history gay Australians, ordinary and extraordinary alike, have been personally, socially and economically constrained through intolerance and discrimination. 


Once upon a time it would have been unusual if not practically impossible for a new senator, like Dean Smith, or for the leader of a political party, like Bob Brown, to be openly gay. It would have been unusual for a High Court justice, like Michael Kirby, to be openly gay or for a CEO, like Alan Joyce, or for a sportsperson, like Matthew Mitcham or Ian Roberts or Natalie Cook. It would have been just as unlikely and in many ways even more difficult for a bricklayer in Donnybrook, a school teacher in Hamilton Hill or a GP in Port Hedland, let alone a year 9 student or the captain of a school footy team. Those difficulties continue to be very real, because discrimination against gay Australians is very real and often very cruel. The consequences of that discrimination, especially for young people, include bullying, severe alienation, violence and mental illness.


Families and households come in all shapes and sizes and yet the most important things remain the same: the sense of belonging, love, happiness and wellbeing. Happiness shared is not happiness diluted. I support this bill and the change it represents because there is no reason or evidence to believe that sharing the benefits of marital commitment more widely heralds anything other than greater tolerance and stability and love in our community.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2012-06-18,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (20:38):  I rise to speak about the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012 and an issue I am very passionate about, marriage equality. I realise that this issue is highly contentious and affects all communities. The electorate of Wright, which I serve, is no different. I am a firm believer that, if a fellow politician wants to be brave, they should stand up before an election and use this issue as a platform in order to try and win government. I do not agree with the wider view that marriage in Australia has changed since the 2010 federal election. I wholeheartedly support the coalition in believing that the definition of marriage contained in the existing provisions of the Marriage Act of 1974 appropriately affects the common understanding of marriage in the Australian community: 'The union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.' I am not persuaded that this definition should be changed. It is not a piece of legislation that can or should be considered lightly. The effect of making any changes to the Marriage Act as it currently stands will have many psychological and social implications, which at this point in time are not well researched and understood. I am not just talking about the welfare of children.


Firstly, I must highlight to this parliament that I was brought up in a family with strong Christian values. While I am no saint, I stand by these values because they have been and continue to be a fundamental moral compass for my life. In a speech on 13 February 2012, the member for Melbourne spoke about love, stating that it has no boundaries and no limits. However, I say that love is a feeling, just the same as anger, frustration, confusion and hate. I certainly do not feel it necessary to try and convince the parliament that I should be allowed to act upon it with anyone I meet. The same Christian values that I was brought up on have helped me to understand that. Can you imagine the consequences for society if we were to legislate acts of violence, for example, due to the feelings of hate? It would be a disaster.


Secondly, I made a commitment to the preselectors of Wright before the last election that I believe marriage should be between a man and a woman and that I intend to honour that commitment—a concept sometimes foreign to the people on the other side of this House. Thirdly, I question the long-term effects the amendments to the Marriage Act will have on children who will become the innocent victims should we fail to ensure that we accurately know and understand the psychological and social effects of growing up with same-sex parents. This is not an area where we should be allowing experimentation. In a speech for the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2010 on Friday, 4 May 2012, Professor Tom Frame highlighted that same-sex marriage cements an alienation of one children from one or both biological parents.


My last point is in relation to the perception that some of the arguments against the bill are discriminatory. My decision to not support this bill is not aimed to discriminate or separate those who choose to have a same-sex relationship, because I am convinced that the changes to the Marriage Act as it currently stands will do far greater harm to our society. The Prime Minister pointed out on ABC's Q&A on Monday, 11 June, that there is no practical discrimination against same-sex couples in Australia. In 2008, 85 laws were changed in favour of those same-sex relationships and was supported unanimously by Labor and the coalition removing all discrimination in Commonwealth law. State law was genuinely ahead of the Commonwealth on this but relationship registers or their equivalents in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and the ACT ensure that there is no discrimination at state or territory level.


I also bring to the attention of parliament the speech of 13 February. The member for Melbourne made an inaccurate statement when he said that a change in the Marriage Act will make it clear to those same-sex relationships that the parliament believes that their love is equal. The parliament has never, to my knowledge, stopped everyone from falling in love. However, marriage is not an automatic action just because I or someone else had fallen in love. If that was the case, I am sure that the majority of society would be married several times over to many people, and think what would happen to those people who love their pets.


In a submission to the Senate inquiry into the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012, family law expert Professor Patrick Parkinson said that in Australia functional equality has already been achieved. He said:


I am not aware of any legal rights and obligations that arise from marriage that do not also apply to registered same-sex unions, other than the right to call the relationship a marriage. Certainly that is so in federal law. For example, there is complete equality in terms of rights in relation to the division of property and the payment of maintenance on relationship breakdown.


In conclusion I say that, on issues as significant as this, we want to take it to a federal election. Let the people have their turn. I believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Minister for Health) (20:43):  I speak in support of the member for Throsby's motion because the time for marriage equality in Australia has come. This is a recognition of the basic equality of all Australians, regardless of sexuality or sexual identity. All Australians should have the right to legal recognition of their relationships and the advantages and responsibilities that such legal recognition brings with it. All Australians deserve the full social acceptance that removing discrimination symbolises.


I am proud of the reforms that this Labor government has made in removing those 85 pieces of discriminatory legislation, removing every piece of discriminatory Commonwealth legislation bar one. It is time to remove this last piece of discriminatory legislation. Some have said that this change is a threat to marriage, but I believe that the opposite is true. This change reinforces that marriage is a legal and social bond that many Australians aspire to in order to demonstrate their commitment to their partner. Even for those gay men and lesbians who do not want to get married, the message that this change sends is a powerful one. The message is: you are equal before Australian law and you are equal in the Australian community. No young man or young woman should feel that their same-sex attraction marks them out as a second-class citizen.


It is also about time that someone said marriage is about more than sex. This debate has focused so much on the agenda of the couple and, by implication, on the sex act itself that I think we have lost the real meaning of marriage. Marriage is about a lot more than the sex act or the gender of the couple. It is about bringing two families together and creating a third family. It is about stability, commitment, mutual love and support. It is about friendship and companionship. For many people, of course, it is a religious sacrament; for others it is a secular, social and legal commitment to their partner; and for others it is the ultimate romantic gesture.


The member for Wright spoke about the innocent victims of same-sex marriage being the children of such relationships. I find it disturbing that there are so very many children who are already the children of same-sex relationships. When they hear things like, 'They are the victims of their parents' relationship,' what do they think? Those children should not be brought up thinking that the loving, committed relationships of their parents are worth less than the loving, committed relationships of their friends' parents.


If marriage were just about sex and procreation, we would not let people who cannot or will not have children marry. But, of course, we welcome and celebrate marriage for all of the reasons I have described. I understand that many, though not all, church leaders are concerned about this change. This bill makes it clear that churches will not be forced to solemnise same-sex relationships.


I have been overwhelmed with support from my constituents for this change—not just my gay and lesbian constituents but many, many straight constituents who are opposed to discrimination. Of course I have heard from opponents as well. But, when I ask myself whether I should be on the side of change or on the side of discrimination, there is only one answer that I can reasonably give: I have to be on the side of change and equality.


I hope that in years to come, when all Australians are able to formally recognise their love without discrimination, we will look back on this debate with the same wonder we now feel that there was ever a time when couples of mixed race were prevented from marrying or when couples of mixed religion were discouraged by their families from marrying. As I have said before, it is not good enough to say to one group in our community: 'You're almost equal; you should be content with that.' We do not say to women: 'You're almost equal; you should give up the fight for equal pay.' We do not say to people living with a disability: 'You're almost equal; you should stop campaigning for greater access and support.' And we should never say to gay and lesbian Australians: 'You're almost equal; that is good enough.' Almost equal is not good enough.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (20:48):  I rise to speak against the current bill before the House and to inform the House that the coalition will not be voting for the bill. The coalition will honour the policy it took to the 2010 election to maintain the Marriage Act as relating to marriage between a male and a female. We took that to the election and people voted for us on the basis of that platform. We will honour that commitment and we will vote on policy, en bloc, as one, as a coalition against this and a similar bill that I spoke on this morning introduced by the Greens deputy leader, the member for Melbourne.


Can I just get rid of some shibboleths that exist out there, the first being that this is an issue of discrimination—that we need to remove the discrimination that exists within the Marriage Act. Having been here in 2008 and having voted for the legislation that removed 85 pieces of discrimination from 85 bits of legislation, I can say with some authority that there is zero discrimination right now in the law with respect to same-sex couples. The Prime Minister pointed this out on ABC's Q&A on Monday, 11 June, when she made this same point. Family law expert, Professor Patrick Parkinson, in his submission to the Senate inquiry, said: 'In Australia, functional equality has already been achieved. I am not aware of any legal rights and obligations that arise from marriage that do not also apply to registered same-sex unions.' The so-called marriage equality campaign that some people have entered into and engaged with with the best of intentions, to their credit, unfortunately has been deceptively hijacked by an aggressive Left-Greens agenda.


The other way that this is unfortunately being hijacked is that it is now being aggressively pushed as an anti-freedom of speech issue. The campaign has depended on first driving alternative voices out of the debate by public demonisation and then filling it with a range of disinformation. The terms 'extremist', 'hater', 'bigot' and 'propagators of hate' are some of the labels used in the media recently against the Australian Christian Lobby and against other supporters of marriage. How is it that the debate has degenerated to such standards of speech? Victoria's deputy chief psychiatrist, Professor Kuruvilla George, was forced to resign as commissioner on the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission because he participated in a submission to the Senate's inquiry which supported retaining the definition of marriage. There were calls by numerous gay activists for tennis great Margaret Court's name to be removed from an arena at the Melbourne tennis centre because of her disagreement over same-sex marriage. The ACL submission to the Senate inquiry documents numerous other cases around the world of freedom of speech on this debate being infringed.


In every jurisdiction where marriage or something able to be described in law as the same as marriage has been given this situation has only worsened. Proponents of marriage equality have tried to assure that the church will not be forced to provide marriage equality to same-sex couples. Yet, Denmark, the first country in the world to recognise civil partnerships for same-sex couples, this month legislated to force the church to provide same-sex weddings. The rights of parents to determine what their children are taught in the area of sexuality has been dramatically curtailed in places like Massachusetts in the United States, where gay marriage has been legislated because it must be presented as equal once given the same status as marriage. Parents have been fined by the state for objecting to socialising even their preschoolers. This is almost certain to follow such legislation here in this country when the Australian Education Union already has in its 2006 policy on gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and intersex people on page 3 that it is determined to teach that heterosexism is discriminatory.

Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (20:58):  I rise tonight to speak about the escalating electricity prices in South Australia with the recent announcement of an 18 per cent increase and the effect that government policies in the renewable energy area are having on our electricity grid. Retail electricity rates are set to rise by 18 per cent. The Energy Users Association of Australia has said that after 1 July—that is, carbon tax day—the retail price of South Australian electricity is set to become the dearest in the world, with an average retail price in excess of 31c a kilowatt hour.


South Australia is home to more than 50 per cent of Australia's installed wind generation capacity, more than 1,200 megawatts. The photovoltaic rooftop solar subsidies and state based feed-in tariffs have been spectacularly successful in South Australia, with one in seven houses having PV cells installed and an installed capacity of 120 megawatts in total. That is, six in seven households that do not have rooftop solar are in effect subsidising these systems through feed-in tariffs. The theoretical total generation available to the grid, including the interconnectors, is about 3,400 megawatts. 


Historically, the Playford power station of 240 megawatts and the Northern power station of 540 megawatts—these are brown coal power stations, I might add—operated by Alinta Energy at Port Augusta have provided around 40 per cent of the state's electricity. In recent years this has been supplemented by two interconnectors to Victoria—Murraylink, 220 megawatts, and Heywood, 460 megawatts. On average, the Alinta power stations still produce more than 30 per cent of the state's demand. On 1 July both power stations will be taken off line by Alinta. 


South Australia's electricity demand fluctuates from less than 1,000 megawatts to about 3,500 megawatts. Prices fluctuate from minus $500 up to $12,000 a megawatt hour. Normally, this electricity retails at around $250 to $300 a megawatt hour. The Essential Services Commission informs us that 194,000 South Australian householders are seeking assistance with their power bills. A further issue—it is a side issue but I must bring it up, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott; I know you will understand about this community—is that the Coober Pedy Council, which operates an off-grid generator, is being forced to raise electricity prices for commercial customers by more than 30 per cent from 1 July.


Those are the facts. I believe that the South Australian electricity grid is, at best, in an uncertain state and its problems are almost all caused by a mishmash of government policy overlapping and double-dipping on the back of the push to reduce our CO2 emissions. The RECs, the solar PV subsidies, the solar PV feed-in tariffs and now the off-budget Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the carbon tax are effectively a double triple whammy on the industry. If Labor should win the next election—I certainly hope they do not—and keep the carbon tax in place they should wind back the other expensive renewable schemes and provide a far simpler signal to the marketplace.


Let us just for a start have a look at Alinta Energy's coal fired power stations at Port Augusta. Since 1954, 58 years ago, first Playford A then Playford B and later the Northern power station have provided a substantial part of the state's electricity. As at the end of this month that will cease. Playford will be permanently closed, so 248 megawatts off the system, and the Northern power station will be operated for only six months of the year—the winter months—so 540 megawatts off this system. Many will cheer this in Australia as evidence that we are moving away from fossil fuels. However, the questions are: what kind of future do we move to, is it sustainable and what is the price? The closures are being forced on Alinta by the depressed prices brought about by the very high levels of wind generation in South Australia.


I have spoken about the wind generation in this place before, but I want to go back over some of the facts. More than 50 per cent of Australia's installed capacity in wind generation is in South Australia. Even more importantly, about 35 per cent of the state's installed capacity on the electricity grid is wind. For those who do not fully understand 'installed capacity', before we had such things as renewable energy and intermittent power supplies we just talked about the capacity of a power station. Now we talk about installed capacity because it may or may not be available, depending on the weather conditions. With a solar cell, for instance, it is not available at night but it is available during the day, and then it depends on the intensity of the sunlight. So it is with the wind—it may blow, it may not.


With more than 1,200 megawatts of installed capacity being provided by wind, that means that it is capable of providing more than 100 per cent of the demand on a windy day in winter. So when we have low demand it can provide over 100 per cent of the demand—and as little as two per cent on a still day in the middle of summer. So the grid has become unpredictable and difficult to market and to operate in for baseload generators, who are by their very nature incapable of load chasing. There are plans in South Australia to build another 1,000 megawatts of wind energy. Renewable energy always sells first on the grid, because of the RECs, which add around $38 or $39 a megawatt hour or 38c or 39c a kilowatt hour in returns to the generator, on top of what they can sell their electricity for. Of course, the industry is being forced by the regulations and the laws of this parliament to move towards a 20 per cent renewable target. So I am seeking more information at the moment from the Australian electricity market authority as to the sustainability of the grid and what the 760 megawatts coming offline at Port Augusta as of 1 July is likely to mean to the operation and supply of electricity in South Australia.


Even more important than the price is the question: when workers get home after a hard day, at whatever the coalface might be for that particular person, and flick the switch will the light come on? Or will that industry be rationed because the grid is not able to supply the power? So the real question is: to what extent is the concentration of renewable energy in South Australia leading to what will be, according to the Energy Users Association of Australia, the world's highest price for retail electricity by 1 July. It is difficult to see that South Australians are not making a larger contribution to reaching the MRET targets than the rest of the nation. Even further, what are the risks of brownouts in the middle of winter if we get a cold, frosty string of days? One of the things not everybody understands is that the other baseload generator in South Australia is gas fired. Gas power stations do not have big containers of storage; they use their pipelines. So, if we get a cold snap of weather, the pipelines actually depressurise over a period of days, because that is the holding tank. The generators crank up the power station at Torrens Island, people come home and turn on their gas fired heating and will run down that supply. Should the weather continue, that is where we are likely to face shortages. And AEMO, the Australian Electricity Market Operator, have the ability to command Alinta to turn the generators back on. That sounds all right, except it takes two weeks to fire them up. I have read the legislation closely, and I have talked to the industry, and there is absolutely no understanding in the industry as to who would pay Alinta to restart these generators.




Mr Perrett:
  That is why we have peakers.




Mr RAMSEY:
  We have people to make good—




Mr Perrett:
  No, peakers—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  The member for Moreton will cease interjecting. The member for Grey has the call.




Mr RAMSEY:
  I will have a talk with the member for Moreton afterwards. In closing—I did raise the issue before and I will seek some more time in the House to speak on Coober Pedy—with a 30 per cent increase in electricity, it is appalling. South Australia is the only state in the nation that does not provide subsidies to remote communities to have electricity at grid prices. The South Australian government have withdrawn support and yet the support they do give to the Coober Pedy council is contingent on them supplying household power within 10 per cent of the grid. So it is being passed on.

Mr Oakeshott
  asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 8 February 2012:


Has she responded to recent claims that (a) the Government (i) spent more than $9.7 million using a grant from her department's Counter Violent Extremism Fund to promote the Islam religion in Australia, (ii) has developed and implemented activities that assist the Islamic Society of Victoria to dispel myths and misconceptions about Islam and Muslims, and (iii) is funding overseas religious workers, paying them a salary of $66,000 per year to spread Islam in Australia, and (b) no such government program has ever been run for any other religious group, and no other religion has ever received a penny from the government; if so, what was her response.

"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2012-06-18,"



Ms Roxon:
  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 


(a) (i). In the 2010-11 Budget the Australian Government committed $9.7 million over four years to countering violent extremism in Australia. The Building Community Resilience (BCR) grants program is one component of the overall strategy across all levels of government to address extremist influences before they pose a threat to our security. The grants program supports community-based projects that assist individuals and groups to resist or disengage from intolerant and radical ideologies, and encourage positive and constructive community participation. Projects include work across the areas of education, skill building and developing counter narratives to challenge violent extremism and extremist ideologies. Through the BCR grants program, 29 projects have been funded (to the total value of $2.8 million).


(ii) The Islamic Society of Victoria is not a recipient of funding from the BCR grants program and has not been funded to undertake any other activities through the $9.7 million allocated from the 2010-11 Budget to counter violent extremism.


(iii) The Government's CVE program, including the BCR grants program, is not funding anyone, including overseas religious workers, to spread Islam in Australia. In July 2011, Darebin City Council was awarded a BCR grant of $100,000 including $66,000 for the employment of an outreach officer based in Australia. The role of the outreach officer is to build stronger relationships between Muslim and non-Muslim communities within Australia by supporting and delivering opportunities for interfaith dialogue and education. 


(b) The CVE Program is directed at all types of violent extremism, regardless of the motivation or ideology. The aim of the Building Community Resilience grants program is to support local initiatives that actively address and discourage violent extremism in all its forms. Neither the broader CVE strategy nor the grants program promotes an ideology of any kind, be it religious, political or otherwise. The BCR grants program is open to all communities in Australia.
