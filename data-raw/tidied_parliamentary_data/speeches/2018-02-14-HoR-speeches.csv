4 MR PERRETT: To move:


   That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) both the Building Code 2013 (2013 Code) and the Code for the Tendering and Performance of Building Work 2016 (2016 Code) require code covered entities to protect freedom of association on building and construction worksites;


(b) the 2016 Code includes requirements in respect of building association logos, mottos or indicia; and


   (c) the Australian Building and Construction Commission's fact sheet Freedom of Association—Logos, Mottos and Indicia specifies that 'logos, mottos and indicia' that would breach the 2016 Code include 'the iconic symbol of the five white stars and white cross on the Eureka Stockade flag';


(2) recognises that:


(a) the Eureka Stockade flag was:


   (i) first used in 1854 at Ballarat; and


   (ii) a symbol of resistance of the gold miners during the rebellion;


(b) beneath the Eureka Stockade flag, the leader of the Ballarat Reform League, Peter Lalor, said 'We swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties';


(c) the people at the Eureka Stockade defending the original flag came from nearly forty nations from around the world; and


(d) the Eureka Stockade flag design has gained wider acceptance in Australian culture as a symbol of democracy, protest and the notion of the Australian 'fair go';


(3) further notes that:


(a) freedom of speech and freedom of association are valued by all fair-minded Australians;


(b) the Eureka Stockade flag has been a symbol associated with building and construction unions for over 40 years;


(c) restricting an individual's right to wear union logos or preventing a construction site from displaying a union flag implies that workers cannot join a union; and


(d) it is an attack on:


   (i) an individual's freedom of association to prevent them from wearing the Eureka Stockade flag on their clothing; and


      (ii) freedom of association to prevent a construction site from displaying the Eureka Stockade flag; and


(4) calls on the Government to immediately act to protect the rights of workers in the construction industry by making clear that displaying the iconic symbol of democracy, the Eureka Stockade flag, is not a breach of the 2016 Code.

4 MR PERRETT: To move:


   That this House:

(a) both the Building Code 2013 (2013 Code) and the Code for the Tendering and Performance of Building Work 2016 (2016 Code) require code covered entities to protect freedom of association on building and construction worksites;


(b) the 2016 Code includes requirements in respect of building association logos, mottos or indicia; and


   (c) the Australian Building and Construction Commission's fact sheet Freedom of Association—Logos, Mottos and Indicia specifies that 'logos, mottos and indicia' that would breach the 2016 Code include 'the iconic symbol of the five white stars and white cross on the Eureka Stockade flag';


(2) recognises that:


(a) the Eureka Stockade flag was:


   (i) first used in 1854 at Ballarat; and


   (ii) a symbol of resistance of the gold miners during the rebellion;


(b) beneath the Eureka Stockade flag, the leader of the Ballarat Reform League, Peter Lalor, said 'We swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties';

(3) further notes that:


(a) freedom of speech and freedom of association are valued by all fair-minded Australians;


(b) the Eureka Stockade flag has been a symbol associated with building and construction unions for over 40 years;


(c) restricting an individual's right to wear union logos or preventing a construction site from displaying a union flag implies that workers cannot join a union; and


(d) it is an attack on:


   (i) an individual's freedom of association to prevent them from wearing the Eureka Stockade flag on their clothing; and


      (ii) freedom of association to prevent a construction site from displaying the Eureka Stockade flag; and


(4) calls on the Government to immediately act to protect the rights of workers in the construction industry by making clear that displaying the iconic symbol of democracy, the Eureka Stockade flag, is not a breach of the 2016 Code.

"Porter, Christian, MP",LP,2018-02-14,"



Mr PORTER
 (Pearce—Attorney-General) (09:33):  I move:


That this bill now be read a second time.


This bill amends the Bankruptcy Act 1966 to comprehensively reform Australia's debt agreement system.


Debt agreements are a statutory alternative to bankruptcy for eligible insolvent debtors. They provide a viable solution for managing personal debt. Debtors can regain and maintain control over their personal affairs and creditors can receive a portion of what they are owed.




Modernising the debt agreement



This bill is the first major reform of the debt agreement system since 2007. Since the last major debt agreement reforms in 2007, the system and its popularity have significantly increased. Between 2007 and 2016, new debt agreements increased from 6,560 to 12,640 per year. Over the same period, new bankruptcies declined from 25,754 to 16,842 per year.


To respond to increasing usage of debt agreements and evidence of consumer exploitation by the debt agreement industry, the government is proceeding with a comprehensive reform of Australia's debt agreement system.


It will boost confidence in the professionalism of debt agreement administrators, deter unscrupulous practices and enhance transparency. This bill will ensure that the debt agreement system is accessible to debtors who have the financial capacity to enter into debt agreements.


The amendments in this bill include measures to modernise debt agreements to suit today's financial environment. In light of the increasing value of Australia's property market, we are doubling the asset threshold at which debtors can access the debt agreement system. The higher threshold will open the system to debtors with some equity in their family home. However, the system will also require appropriate safeguards.




Appropriate safeguards for debtors



Under current arrangements, debt agreements can be proposed or extended to well beyond the five-year mark. In some cases, they can extend beyond seven years. Longer debt agreements and subsequent variation of debt agreements are a sign that a debtor is unable to meet or maintain their obligations under the agreement.


This bill will now require debt agreement proposals to include a payment time frame that is three years or less. This measure will allow debtors to manage their debts in the short term and work towards a fresh start.


Despite the benefits of the debt agreement system to both debtors and creditors, a minority of debt agreements propose to pay amounts which significantly exceed the debtor's income, imposing substantial financial stress on the debtor and their family. This is a contributing factor to the repeated variations and extensions to debt agreements that the existing scheme permits, keeping debtors in financial stress for longer periods. 


This bill will address this concern and issue in a number of ways.


Firstly, we're introducing the concept of a payment-to-income ratio,  which will ensure proposals to set up or vary a debt agreement include an affordable payment schedule, whereby the total payments to be made do not exceed the debtor's income by a prescribed percentage.


To ensure the ratio is balanced and suited to the market, it will be determined by legislative instrument in close consultation with the debt agreement industry, consumer advocacy groups and creditor representatives.


Secondly, we are bolstering the authority of the Official Receiver in bankruptcy to intervene in exceptional cases and refuse to accept debt agreement proposals which would cause undue financial hardship to vulnerable debtors.


The reforms will also deter unscrupulous practices of a small minority of debt agreement administrators, by setting stricter practice standards, introducing tougher penalties for wrongdoing, and granting the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy additional investigative powers to address administrator misconduct.


To mitigate the risk to a debtor of debt agreement administrator error or malpractice, we are now requiring administrators to take out and maintain professional indemnity and fidelity insurance as a requirement of their registration.


This brings requirements for debt agreement administrators into line with registered trustees and provides a safety net for affected debtors and creditors.




Debt agreement administrators



Debt agreements should be administered by appropriately skilled people to achieve the best outcomes for both debtors and their unsecured creditors.


To boost confidence in the professionalism of the system, the bill introduces a requirement that only those who meet enhanced registration benchmarks will be eligible to administer a debt agreement. 


An unregistered administrator will have 12 months from royal assent to the bill to register as a debt agreement administrator or trustee if they wish to keep administering debt agreements.


The bill also enhances transparency, providing clarity to debtors and creditors about an administrator's financial and organisational arrangements. 


It is essential that debtors and creditors have the opportunity to review any business practices of an administrator that might affect a debt agreement—for example, the administrator's expenses arrangements or any relationships with debt management brokers or referrers that an administrator might have. 


Requiring administrators to disclose their relationships is important because any money paid to brokers or referrers is money that could have been paid to creditors.


These amendments provide that a debt agreement proposal must disclose any relationships between administrators and brokers, and detail the types of expenses the administrator can recover, allowing debtors and creditors to make informed choices in proposing or accepting a debt agreement.


The enhanced standards for debt agreement administrators will be further enhanced by the development of industry-wide conditions, to be implemented by legislative instrument in conjunction with this bill.


These conditions will be developed in close consultation with the debt agreement administrator industry, consumer advocacy groups and creditor representatives.


As a whole, these measures will ensure the debt agreement system is an effective, fair and functional debt management option for debtors and creditors alike. 


The bill will commence six months after royal assent, giving the debt agreement administrator industry enough time to prepare for the changes.


The bill has been referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 19 March 2018, and I look forward to the consideration of the committee's findings on this important piece of legislation.


These long-awaited reforms will revitalise the debt agreement system, providing better outcomes for creditors and supporting Australians living in financial distress to control their personal affairs. I commend the bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

Ms CATHERINE KING
 (Ballarat) (13:29):  This week I had the privilege to take part in the public launch of Keeley's Cause, a new initiative in my electorate started by Keeley, a 13-year-old who has autism spectrum disorder as well as an intellectual disability. Keeley's Cause works to provide iPads to school students and others with similar conditions to Keeley. This project was inspired by Keeley's own experiences, where she found that this technology helped her to interact and communicate with others as well as getting her school work done. Some of the recipients of the iPads so far are diagnosed with autism, cerebral palsy, ADHD and Tourette's, amongst other conditions.


IPad technology provides the opportunity for young people with these learning challenges to engage more fully in learning. For those children and adults who are nonverbal, iPads allow them to communicate without words, enabling them to express their opinions and feelings when previously they may have been left more isolated. Where young people are not able to access these aids through the NDIS, Keeley works with local businesses and community organisations—in particular, the Ballan Lions Clubs—to get these children the tools that can help them to achieve at the highest level. Into the future, Keeley's Cause is looking to expand state wide, nationally and even internationally through the Lyons club. I commend Keeley and her family for a terrific local initiative. It's inspiring to see a 13 year old doing so much. Imagine what she is going to be doing at 20!

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2018-02-14,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (15:17):  I've just checked SportsBet, and I can confirm that the member for Flynn has now emerged as the leading contender to be the next leader of the National Party and, after his question time performance, I think we can safely say he'll be better than the current bloke.


To have a strong national economy, you have to have strong regional economies. It's a statement of fact that it's been a tough four years for rural and regional Australia under the Abbott and Turnbull governments, whether we talk about hospitals policy, schools policy, higher education policy, energy policy, infrastructure investment and, of course, the biggie: the NBN. 


It is also a statement of fact that, when you cut funding to physical infrastructure or to services, the impact falls disproportionately and adversely on rural and regional Australia. That's exactly what has been happening over the last four years. Every time the government grabs money to pay for its $65 billion worth of tax cuts to the big end of town, the big corporates in this country, there is a cost and that cost falls harder on rural and regional Australia than it does on our capital cities. 


Let me give you just one example: the schools policy. In the first two years, the impact on schools in Wentworth will be about $10 million but the impact on schools in New England, the electorate of the Deputy Prime Minister, will be more like $20 million—double the impact. Of course, it goes without saying that, when you have cost blow-outs and a hopeless and underserviced NBN, the impact is greatest on rural and regional Australia where we rely so heavily on a decent NBN to narrow the gap between city and country. 


I want to leave it to my colleagues who will follow me to focus more on some of those issues, as I am sure they will, and I've no doubt that my colleagues from Tasmania will have something to say about the biosecurity concerns in their state as a result of the failures of this government. 


I want to use the time remaining to focus on my own portfolio: agriculture. I want to begin by citing a contribution in the Australian Financial Review today. The headline warns 'Competition slashes wheat exports'. It then reads:


Australian wheat exports have slowed to a trickle as traditional markets in south-east Asia turn to cheaper alternatives.


Why would I quote that story here today? There are two reasons. One, it stands in stark contrast to what we hear on an almost daily basis from the Deputy Prime Minister, who likes to come to the dispatch box and attempt, at least, to claim credit for higher commodity prices where commodity prices are high. The funny thing about that is that everyone in this place and everyone outside this place knows that the member for New England can make no claim for impacting upon those commodity prices. He likes to talk about the beef, sheep and goat sectors. These higher prices are a direct result of drought and a small herd—simple supply and demand. What he doesn't do is talk about the commodities which have fallen—and there are very many of them. He certainly doesn't talk about the crisis in the dairy industry—not only in Murray Goulburn in Victoria, for which he did nothing, but generally across that sector, which is facing some very significant challenges.


But I also quote the article to remind people how dumbed down agriculture policy has become under the tutorage of the Deputy Prime Minister. Thank goodness he has gone. I always said he'd wreck the joint and move on and leave it for someone else to clean up. I wish David Littleproud well, because there is plenty to clean up. I've said it before here and I'll say it again: there is no doubt in my mind that the member for New England is the worst agriculture minister in the history of our Federation, and I think that will become even clearer over time. All we saw from the member for New England in this portfolio is boondoggle after boondoggle and pork barrel after pork barrel—most of them, of course, not benefitting farmers but benefitting the Deputy Prime Minister in his own electorate.


Our regional economies are very diverse—and we welcome that—but you can't have strong regions, at least in most of our regions, if you don't have a strong agricultural sector. Surging demand globally for high-quality, safe, clean green food provides us with many, many opportunities as an agriculture sector. But it also offers many challenges. The so-called dining boom won't come to us; we need to go to it. We need to be prepared for it. There is competition out there. I want to outline 10 things—it is not an exhaustive list—that government must do if we're to make the most of those opportunities. We need to establish high policy guidelines, something you do not get from this government—and the agriculture white paper was a joke. We need to restore a genuine and effective COAG process, where we have the Commonwealth and the states working together once again. We need to protect our great reputation as a provider of clean, green, safe high-quality food, our key competitive advantage—and you can't do that when you've got biosecurity failings, as we've had from this government and as we've seen most recently with white spot in prawns in Queensland and now fruit fly in Tasmania. We must adapt to a changing and harsher climate and we must tackle drought. We haven't had any progression in drought policy over the last four years. We must pursue a vigorous productivity agenda; embrace more efficient and more sustainable land use practices; further develop market mechanisms for the maximisations of the allocation of natural resources; and encourage the pursuit for higher value products. We can't be doing more and more in a commodity market where we're simply price takers. It's not the future for Australian agriculture. We must give higher priority to non-tariff trade barriers. We have free trade agreements but no access because the protocols haven't been complete by this government. And we must lift our research, innovation and extension efforts. There are many other areas of government responsibility, like infrastructure—which, as the member for Grayndler so successfully pointed out, has been so underdone by this government.


I want to quickly take us to the member for New England's performance. I'm going to read this as quickly as I can. There are so many to talk about. He forcibly relocated the APVMA to his own electorate—a disaster for Australian agriculture. He abolished the COAG committee, which was doing so much work to bring the states and the Commonwealth together. He sacked his departmental head, destroying the culture, trust and motivation of those who work in the department. He doctored his Hansard. He ditched drought assistance. He tried to move the Regional Investment Corporation to Orange without any governance, giving him full flight to do whatever he wanted with his pork-barrelling exercise. He's destroyed trust in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, a real threat on the water front and in our food bowl. Biosecurity has been a disaster. He tried to abolish the Inspector-General of Biosecurity. It was only our resistance that prevented that from happening.


When the Murray-Goulburn fell over, I offered to help him—nothing! He did nothing for the farmers who suffered from the Murray-Goulburn collapse. He reregulated the sugar industry. He's giving money to leadership groups in the agriculture sector for no apparent reason. Taxpayers' money is funding these leadership groups. He failed to address leadership issues in the red meat industry, something he promised solidly before he was elected. He introduced a backpacker tax for the first time in this country, and now our growers can't get pickers. I heard the minister at question time talking about 457s. We now have people coming from other countries to work at the APVMA because the local staff won't go to Armidale. He had a multiperil crop insurance boondoggle in his white paper, which failed at the first hurdle. He abolished federal leadership at the Animal Welfare Strategy. He ignored the plight of our thoroughbred breeders when they had a disease problem in the industry. He also misled the community on the implementation on the carp eradication virus. Do you remember the carp? Have you heard anything about it since?


The member for New England is hopeless. He was a failed minister. As a result of many government failures across those four years, rural and regional Australia is struggling. There is no doubt it is time for a change of government.

"McVeigh, John, MP",LP,2018-02-14,"



Dr McVEIGH
 (Groom—Minister for Regional Development, Territories and Local Government) (15:27):  The coalition has an unrivalled commitment to regional Australia. It fascinates me that the member for Hunter overlooks the fact that his very own electorate under the coalition got: $950,000 from NSRF towards the Cessnock Civic Precinct Revitalisation; $1.25 million from BBRF for Hunter Valley Wine Country tourism; $27.2 million from Roads to Recovery between 2014-15 and 2018-19; and over $4.4 million through Bridges Renewal. It surprises me that the member for Hunter ignores that.


We are focused on supporting the nearly eight million people who live outside of our capital cities. In 2016 our agricultural, forestry, fishing and mining industries made up 57 per cent of the value of Australian merchandise exports. Forty-five cents in every dollar is spent by international and local tourists in regional Australia, and that's why we're laying down the foundations that are required to capitalise on the immense opportunities that we in regional Australia have. We've been delivering jobs in record numbers—over 403,000 jobs in the last 12 months. Well over 100,000 of those are in regional Australia, the highest on record. This is the equivalent of every person in Sale, Port Lincoln, Warwick, Parkes, Grafton, Gympie, Muswellbrook and Burnie all getting a new job in just 12 months.


We're delivering lower taxes through the Enterprise Tax Plan and a structured decentralisation approach to Australian government jobs from Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne because regional Australians deserve those opportunities as well. We're moving jobs via the Regional Investment Corporation into Orange; the Murray-Darling Basin Authority into Toowoomba, Albury-Wodonga and Adelaide; Grains Research and Development Corporation into Toowoomba, Dubbo, Adelaide and Perth; and, of course, APVMA to Armidale. That process means that we will have significant new opportunities—job opportunities, family opportunities—throughout regional Australia as a result of the efforts of the coalition government.


But private enterprise should be encouraged to decentralise as well, and we are doing that through the Regional Jobs and Investment Package. An example of a transformational project that is receiving funds through this package is a company called Adaptapack, from the electorate of the member for Page, in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales. Over $1.5 million is being delivered to assist this great company to do fantastic things in advanced packaging technology, with a focus on robotics. The family involved have seen the opportunity to move to the Northern Rivers. And what happens therefore is that, thanks to the support of the coalition government, we see a company expanding their business from Sydney into the Northern Rivers, into Lismore in northern New South Wales—60 highly skilled, good-paying jobs coming into that member's electorate.


Our focus on regional jobs is driven by our $75 billion infrastructure investment program right across the country, much of which is invested in regional Australia, as it should be: $6.7 billion for the Bruce Highway, $5.6 billion for the Pacific Highway, $8.4 billion for inland rail—that iconic project that will bring opportunities right across the eastern seaboard of Australia and, via links to the west, the rest of the country as well. I'm particularly proud of the transformational $1.6 billion project that is the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing; $4 billion, including in the electorate of member for Hunter, in Roads to Recovery is I think significant indeed.


In terms of the Regional Jobs and Investment Package, we've also supported recently—amongst many other announcements that I've overseen in just six weeks or so as the minister—projects in the Northern Rivers, including the Tweed Valley Rail Trail project. I think this is particularly interesting because, whilst those opposite don't get regional development, the Tweed deputy mayor, the Labor-aligned Reece Byrnes, said that the project will be of significant benefit to his region. He said, in the Byron Shire Echo:


I welcome today's announcement by the federal government of Tweed Shire Council's success under the latest funding round for the Tweed section of the Northern Rivers Rail Trail,' Cr Byrnes said. 'The rail trail will be a great injection into our tourism and small business sector, particularly in Murwillumbah.


Perhaps there's one Labor person in this country who gets it. It is an example of successful development in the Northern Rivers.


We've invested close to $1 billion in grant funding for vitally important community infrastructure projects—$5 million towards the upgrade of Bendigo Airport; $7 million for the Rockhampton riverfront redevelopment; $5.3 million for Ronald McDonald House in South Brisbane, which supports regional families, particularly those with sick children; $2.8 million for the Kingston Park community hub in the electorate of the member for Franklin; and $4.6 million for the Moss Vale Enterprise Corridor in the electorate of the member for Whitlam. And there is $620 million for the Black Spot Program, $600 million for the Northern Australia Roads Program, $500 million for regional rail in Victoria, $360 million for Bridges Renewal, as I've said, and $272 million to invest $10 million or more in major projects, individually, to unlock the future potential of regions.


Now, $120 million for these regional projects—the 10 pilot regions that are in the regional growth fund—will mean that we'll be seeing significant development through regional areas. We're rolling out, through these projects that have been announced in the Regional Jobs and Investment Package, 500 in construction and 500 ongoing jobs on the north coast of the New South Wales. The list goes on and on. It's similarly the case in the Geelong Regional Jobs and Investment Package: 600 ongoing construction jobs—great benefits for the member for Corio as well as the member for Corangamite—with $2 billion in Sky Muster satellite services and an estimated $58.5 billion in recurrent funding in 2018-27 for regional and remote schools. As I said, the list goes on.


I want to particularly focus on the 765 upgraded and new base stations through the mobile Black Spot Program. That helps regional families, regional businesses and regional opportunities that are being addressed by our government. Of course regional Australians also now have increased access to psychological services via telehealth.


The contrast is stark. Labor can't be trusted because they simply do not have a plan for regional Australia. The Leader of the Opposition, as I've said previously, will do anything to score a headline and try and grab Green preferences in Batman and capital cities. As the opposition leader lurches to the left, regional Australia would be junked by those opposite—just like the live cattle export trade that they nearly killed some years ago. That they wanted to risk that industry showed a total ignorance of the beef industry, our most significant agricultural industry in this country. Labor just doesn't get it.


If the member for Whitlam, as shadow minister, is the closest thing that Labor has to having an MP with a rural or regional background, it is no wonder they have no idea. Let's face it: the member for Whitlam's career highlights before entering parliament included being national secretary of the Community and Public Sector Union and spending time as a lawyer for the Australian Council of Trade Unions. That's it! That background, given he's the opposition spokesman, shows that he has no understanding of regional Australia. He has no understanding of the struggle in regional communities, the distress caused by a failed harvest or the long, lonely commute on country Australian roads just to access medical treatment—the sorts of challenges that our government is focused on supporting.


Regional Australia needs more than a weak opposition leader's weasel words—crab walking, if you like, from one position to another. They want jobs. They want opportunities. They, like the rest of us, want a standard of living that is appropriate for families. It's the coalition that has focused on regional and rural Australia. It's the coalition that is driving jobs growth and opportunity growth in regional Australia. Those opposite simply have no idea.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (15:36):  I enjoyed the minister's contribution. I also have to make the comment that he is the third minister for regional development in three months! So committed are they to regional development that they've had a rotating door of regional development ministers, because they can't make up their minds! While these parlour games have been going on, inequality in regional Australia is growing. Not only is inequality growing between the cities and the bush; it is growing within the bush as well. While health and life expectancy outcomes are going backward in regional Australia, while incomes are going backward in regional Australia and while education outcomes are going backward in regional Australia, we have members of the National Party and Liberal-Country Party members coming into this parliament and acting like Liberal lapdogs and voting in favour of every single Liberal Party proposal that holds a knife to the throats of the people that they are supposed to represent. Well, Labor doesn't believe that this is the right thing to do by people in regional Australia. We think that the current facade that is going on in the National Party room has to stop. It has to stop.


Before question time today we called on the Prime Minister to do the right thing. If the members of the National Party can't make up their minds about who is going to be the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia on Friday then the Prime Minister must step in and do something. We've got the deputy leader who says that 100 per cent of the members of the National Party caucus are behind the Deputy Prime Minister. Well, we know that is not true. We know that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has the numbers, even though he doesn't have the ticker to do the right thing by his party and by the people of regional Australia. He's got the numbers, but he doesn't have the ticker. Perhaps the bulldog—the member for Flynn—is the guy who's going to push him off the line. Didn't he give a leadership-type performance during question time today!


The real tragedy of this is that the people of regional Australia cannot wait for the hapless lapdogs of the Liberal Party in the National Party room to make up their minds about the future direction of this country. Already there is $500 million—that's right: over half a billion dollars—worth of projects in regional Australia that have stalled because these jokers can't make up their minds and they're too distracted by the sorts of things that are going on—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Coulton
):  Order! The member for Whitlam will withdraw that remark. It's unparliamentary.




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  Which remark?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You know what it was. It was a sentence ago.




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  I withdraw. The members opposite cannot make up their minds, so the people in regional Australia are having to suffer. The minister mentioned the Regional Growth Fund—$270 million was promised nearly 12 months ago. There are no guidelines and not a cent has flowed from this fund, because the members opposite, and particularly the National Party members opposite, cannot make up their minds. They are so distracted by their own internal intrigue and their own problems that they can't even issue guidelines to their own fund to ensure that the people of Australia can have their projects funded.


On the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages that the minister mentioned: $220 million worth of funds earmarked to kickstart jobs investment projects in regional Australia. Eight of the 10 projects have not yet even started, because these guys are so tied up with their own internal problems that they can't get around to the job that they're paid to do. He mentioned decentralisation—well, there is a fraud if ever Australians have seen one. They talk about decentralisation at the same time as they are axing public sector jobs from regional Australia. I present Townsville as one example, but we also know that it is happening in Tasmania, and I'm sure the Tasmanian representatives will talk about that. Jobs were cut from CSIRO, jobs were cut from the tax office and jobs were cut from the Department of Defence—40 from Townsville in the last week alone, and over 400 since this government came to power. The people of Australia know a fraud when they see one. As I said before, it is time for the Prime Minister to end the farce. The battle between the Hatfields and the McCoys has to stop. The people of regional Australia need something better than this. The Prime Minister needs to step in. The Deputy Prime Minister needs to be axed. If the National Party can't do it, the Prime Minister should. (Time expired)

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2018-02-14,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper—Assistant Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment) (15:42):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate. Don't leave, Member for Hunter! Don't walk out on your own MPI. He has a bit of hide putting in this MPI. We've got old 'No Coal' Joel, who actually works against his own constituents—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Coulton
):  Order! I remind the assistant minister to refer to members by their titles, and ask him to withdraw.




Mr HARTSUYKER:
  I withdraw. We do know that he is a member who, along with his colleagues, is working against the people of regional Australia. I hope he goes down the street in his own electorate, goes to Kurri Kurri or Cessnock, and says to the people down there: 'I'm here to put you out of a job. I'm going to Canberra every day to shut the coal industry down and to put you out of a job.' This member has the hide to come in here to feign concern for the people of regional and rural Australia. He's quite happy to sell them down the river so that they can win the Batman by-election. No wonder he has that tag that I won't refer to again—but the reality is that it is true.


By contrast, we are a government that supports regional Australia. We are a government that supports farmers. The white paper has had great success in improving farm gate prices and in supporting farmers. If you look at the achievements of the Labor Party in relation to the farming sector, it is a very short list indeed—in fact, I think it barely exists. Look at the work that we're doing on the Pacific Highway: $5.64 billion invested by the coalition government to restore the 80-20 funding split so that the duplication of the Pacific Highway can be completed some seven years faster than if the Labor government had remained in power. We are seeing duplications rolled out from Sydney almost to Grafton. There are two small sections to be completed and then we will have in the order of 600 kilometres of dual carriageway from Sydney almost to Grafton, a massive achievement. We've recently seen the opening of the Kempsey to Kundabung section of the highway, the new Hastings River Bridge, the Port Macquarie section of the highway, the Macksville bypass and the opening of the Phillip Hughes Bridge—a massive achievement and a massive investment in regional Australia. I'm certainly working hard as the local member in the seat of Cowper to move towards the commencement of the Coffs Harbour bypass.


We've introduced the jobs and investment package, a $220 million package, with $25 million being invested on the North Coast of New South Wales. Two million dollars is going to a great air-conditioning company, Faircloth & Reynolds, to build a facility to manufacture air-conditioning duct work, to construct a testing facility and for software upgrades. OzGroup received a million dollars under the regional jobs package to help them become more export-ready and to allow them to invest in research and development and advanced technology and robotics. We saw $338,000 for Stonelake to establish an advanced manufacturing facility to commercialise their patented facade system. This great local company has patents in 50 countries around the world. Those three projects will produce 60 jobs during the construction phase and 140 ongoing jobs. In Port Macquarie, Biodiversity Solutions received a grant of some $300,000 to assist that company establish a facility for the trading of biodiversity credits. There will be six jobs during the construction phase and 12 ongoing jobs.


We are a government that supports our farmers through free trade agreements. We've negotiated high-quality free trade agreements with China, Japan and South Korea. Only on Monday this week we saw the signing of the Peruvian agreement, or the PAFTA, which reduces beef tariffs down to zero over five years and provides access for our local universities into the Peruvian market. Education is our third-largest export industry. On mobile phone black spots, our Mobile Black Spot Program is delivering for regional Australia. Labor did not spend one cent on mobile phones in six years in office—not one cent!


We are a government that supports regional and rural Australia. We are providing the infrastructure that is so needed, like the Pacific Highway upgrade and the Inland Rail. We are providing programs like the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages to support greater job opportunities in regional areas. We're assisting our farm sector through drought support, through free trade agreements and through negotiating access to markets for our products. We support regional Australia, and the member for Hunter didn't even stay for the debate.



An opposition member:  Neither did yours.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Before the member for Wakefield starts, I remind members present that this is not a team sport. It's only one at a time.

"Champion, Nick, MP",ALP,2018-02-14,"



Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (15:47):  It's interesting following the member for Cowper's audition for a return to the National Party frontbench. There's a bit of stuff going on in this building. We all know the National Party's got their delegations out. They're roaming around the place.



A government member interjecting—




Mr CHAMPION:
  I hear a bit of feedback from up there. We all know that this is a government that has been divided against itself for so many years—a divided Liberal Party and now a divided National Party. They're divided on a couple of things. They're divided on their capacity to deliver for this country. They come in here and they always reduce rural Australia down to National Party seats. They don't want to talk about regional seats in South Australia, the Northern Territory, Western Australia or anywhere else.


The member for Cowper talks about telephone towers and mobile phone reception. My seat is in an area which was devastated by the Pinery fires. When I wrote to the Prime Minister and the minister about a mobile phone tower, guess what response I got?



Mr Rick Wilson interjecting—




Mr CHAMPION:
  Zero! I hear the member's interjection. He asked me about the South Australian government. Even in the second round, when the South Australian government did stump up some cash, guess what you provided? Zip, zero, in my seat; zip, zero, in the seat of Mayo. You only funded Liberal Party seats in South Australia. So don't talk to us about mobile phone coverage, because you're driven only by your own electoral prospects. That's the whole driver of the Liberal Party's or the National Party's approach to rural Australia. They just seem to get out the pork barrel—and it's a pretty limited pork barrel; it's a pork barrel that's only aimed at a seat at a time.


People in rural Australia need the same things that people in cities need. They need good roads, jobs, hospitals and good schools. I know because I've lived in country towns. I grew up in a country town. It's not that different to the city. People are always trying to make this difference. They need the services. They need the jobs. They need the schools. They need health. That's as simple as it gets.



Mr Tudge interjecting—




Mr CHAMPION:
  I hear the member at the box. He's interjecting in my speech, 'City boy!' But let's look at the record of the Abbott-Turnbull government. Investment in infrastructure has fallen by 17 per cent, and, in terms of roads, bridges, railway, ports and harbours, it has declined by 22 per cent in transport infrastructure. If we look at the underspend, on major road projects, it is 17 per cent. On major rail projects, it is 11 per cent. On northern Australian roads, it is 46 per cent. On the Bridges Renewal Program, it is 38 per cent. In terms of the Black Spot Program, which is very important in the country, there is an underspend of 33 per cent over the last four budgets. On the Northern Australia Beef Roads Program, it is 51 per cent.



Mr Tudge interjecting—




Mr CHAMPION:
  I hear the member opposite talking about everybody's sartorial splendour. That's not really the topic at hand. He's treating this like a joke. I can't blame him, because his National Party partners are a joke. We all know how concerned you are about them. You are held hostage to them and their whims and desires in terms of rural policy. You come in here and you're laughing about it, but it's no laughing matter.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member of Wakefield will refer things through the chair.




Mr CHAMPION:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will talk about infrastructure in South Australia. Over the next four years, federal infrastructure funding in the state will plummet by 90 per cent. It will fall from $921 million to $95 million over four years. You have to remember what will happen and where that won't get spent, and that's on South Australian country roads. That's where it's not going to get spent—that's South Australian infrastructure. Yet you have the temerity to come in here and joke about it and laugh about it; you think it's a big joke. The National Party slings insults all over the place, but anybody who has lived in regional Australia knows they need the NBN, jobs, roads, hospitals and schools—the exact same things that Australians need across the country.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2018-02-14,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (15:51):  My electorate is a big piece of western New South Wales. When I talk about rural and regional Australia, I often make the point—as I know you do, because you're my neighbour and friend—that 85 per cent of Australians live within 50 kilometre of the coast. That's exactly where the member for Hunter, the member for Whitlam, the member for Wakefield and, no doubt, the other members speaking in this debate live—less than 50 kilometres from the coast.



Mr Champion interjecting—




Ms LEY:
  It may be a few kilometres either way, member for Wakefield. But the point I make, Deputy Speaker—



Mr Rob Mitchell interjecting—




Ms LEY:
  Please don't interject. The point I make is that, to represent rural and regional Australians, you have to have lived a life in rural and regional Australia. The way the Labor Party talks about agriculture and regional and rural issues, as something separate from the rest of Australia, always amuses me. I'm a rural Liberal and I believe in uniting Australia, because when we get the city to take on the country's views as their own, as they do, then we really will achieve the best for our nation. But Labor tiptoes nervously around this space because they don't really understand it. Their members have not lived their lives in rural and regional Australia.


The important thing I really want to get across in the MPI is: why on earth would Labor bring it on on a day like today? Today is very important for my constituents. It's vital, because today there is a disallowance motion sitting in the Senate about the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. You would understand that, Mr Deputy Speaker Coulton; you represent part of the basin. If that motion lapses, then the New South Wales and Victorian governments have said that the plan will, in effect, fall over. What's Labor doing about this plan that they signed on to in a bipartisan sense, the plan that was half theirs and half ours, the plan that, between us, we negotiated with our rural communities who suffered such great pain, and still do?


The people listening to this broadcast will listen to the to and fro. But now they can actually be certain that Labor is prepared to trade off rural and regional Australia for its own base political advantage. That's happening right here today, because, if by six o'clock tonight this motion lapses, that effectively cruels what we call the northern basin review. That was a scientific review undertaken under the auspices of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, not government, which actually made a very commonsense recommendation. It was signed on to by Labor, but now they're walking away from it. Why are they? It's very simple: because they're appealing to just one seat—the seat of Batman in Melbourne.


I know that, privately, the member for Watson, the opposition spokesperson, has indicated—because he's actually a decent fellow and he's honest about this—that it is a political exercise. What else could it be for an entire party to reject its own policy on something as important to every Australian as the Murray-Darling Basin Plan? That's exactly what they're doing with the one small seat of Batman, with people whom we love, but they don't really visit our areas and they don't understand what's happening in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys. I do. I live there. I represent them, and I know that right now they cannot believe what politicians in Canberra, in the Labor Party, are going to do to them. They expect it from the Greens. It's the Greens' philosophical base and they understand that, but to see the Labor Party doing this to them is particularly extraordinary. Remember this, everyone listening to this debate: if you want to trust the outcomes policy-wise for people in rural and regional Australia, there isn't an alternative to the Liberal and National parties. We meet as rural and regional Liberals, and there are about 30 of us. I know that, with the Nationals, there are another 20. That's a substantial proportion of all of our members. All of us are kicking goals for our people. All of us are conscious that roads, bridges, child care, education, access to university, access to TAFE, access to skills and everything that makes life in our part of the world so special is understood intrinsically and delivered by people who, as I say, have lived their lives in this environment.


I must focus on the NBN because the member for Whitlam has raised that, and he and I are both on the committee. Remember, this was a government that prioritised access to the NBN for people who weren't disadvantaged, and they are people in rural and regional Australia. So we're getting the NBN in rural and regional Australia before many people are in the cities. The entire rollout will be completed by 2020, but we're getting it first because this is a government that understands where the needs are. (Time expired)

"Keay, Justine, MP",ALP,2018-02-14,"



Ms KEAY
 (Braddon) (15:57):  That was quite extraordinary. I will have to try to control myself. Never before has rural and regional Australia been so badly treated by this government. As the people who purport to represent regional Australia descend into chaos before our eyes, it is the people who live in regional Australia who are paying the price. It is little wonder that around this place the blue signs are appearing once again in office windows: 'Liberals for regions'. I think those signs say more about the National Party than they do about the Liberals.


It is the coalition that is failing regional Australia and my state of Tasmania. I am astonished that not one member on the other side has ever, ever, in my whole time in this place, talked about Tasmania with any knowledge at all. I'm not going to offer a map of Tassie; I'm sure the member for Lyons can do that. I guess it's because there's not one member over there from Tasmania. And that is because this government has trashed health, education, skills, biosecurity, infrastructure, the NBN, access to markets, and the list goes on for my state. Under this government there has not been one infrastructure project commenced in Tasmania. They cut $100 million out of the Midland Highway. They have not stumped up one extra cent in any budget for additional Tasmanian infrastructure.


I do welcome the return of Senator Colbeck to this place, but let's remember what he did as tourism minister for the state of Tasmania, his own state. At the last election, all he could find was $5 million for tourism infrastructure for Tasmania. When we have a tourism boom, he gives us a tourism bust. Absolutely extraordinary. For Cradle Mountain, the single biggest infrastructure project in tourism, he could only manage $1 million for a report for a $160 million project. When it comes to water infrastructure, which the Deputy Prime Minister likes to bang on about, not one new project has commenced, and every single water infrastructure project in Tasmania was started and completed by state and federal Labor governments.


Then, of course, there's the mythical $272 million Regional Growth Fund that the Deputy Prime Minister has gone missing on. Announced in last year's May budget with great fanfare, it's meant to provide grants of up to $10 million for major projects to support economic growth and create jobs in regions. The fund hasn't even opened up for applications, nine months after the budget. How typical this is of the Deputy Prime Minister—all talk, no action. In the Nationals party room they lurch from one regional development minister to the other, taking turns as to who the next minister will be. Three ministers in three months—not good enough!


But it gets worse. This government and Tasmania's Hodgman Liberal government have abrogated their responsibilities when it comes to protecting Tasmania's all-important brand. Under the watch of the former agriculture minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, Tasmania's reputation for being relatively pest and disease free has been put at risk. Our agricultural, horticultural and marine sectors have worked so hard to establish a national and international reputation for the Tasmanian brand, but we have seen Norwegian salmon on supermarket shelves, blueberry rust, Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome, and now a fruit fly emergency. Fruit is being dumped and farmers are locked out of markets. The Liberal Premier of Tasmania cut $1 million from Tasmania's biosecurity budget in his first term. The Prime Minister, aided and abetted by the Nationals, has abolished the COAG Standing Council on Primary Industries, failed to respond to the recommendations of the Plant Biosecurity CRC's fruit fly report and the Intergovernmental Agreement on Biosecurity Review, and attempted to abolish the position of Inspector-General for Biosecurity. So much for standing up for regions and our farmers.


I could go on, but I have run out of time. I'll probably need another 10 hours to keep going on about how this government has failed not only people in regional Australia but in my whole state of Tasmania. The people of all electorates in Tasmania voted them out last time, and there is a good reason why. Labor here will make sure that regional communities in Tasmania will have the best result possible, and we need a Labor government to do that.

Mr LLEW O'BRIEN
 (Wide Bay) (16:01):  It gives me great pleasure to take part in this MPI today as a regional member who is very privileged to stand here looking after regional Australians and as a proud member of the coalition and the National Party. We went to the last election with a clear message of jobs and growth, and do you know what we've done? We've delivered them. We have delivered jobs and growth—indeed, 400,000 jobs in the calendar year 2017. That far surpasses anything the Labor Party has come close to, but very proudly I can say that 100,000 of those jobs were created in rural and regional Australia. That is success. The Barnaby Joyce-Malcolm Turnbull government is successful when it comes to looking after regional Australia. That's why the eight million regional Australians predominantly vote for us: because they know what the fate of a Labor government is. They know full well that a Labor government looking after regional Australia will be stopping the live export trade and absolutely slaughtering the bush and those associated industries and businesses that were supported—you know what: you'll do it again when you get in. All your greenie mates, who you'll rush to support, like you will in Batman—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! I remind the member for Wide Bay that he should be addressing the debate through the chair. 




Mr LLEW O'BRIEN:
  Like the Labor Party will in Batman, as they are already sucking up to the Greens. Regional Australia understands that voting in a Labor government also means a 50 per cent renewable energy target. That will destroy rural Australia. Energy costs for our rural producers will destroy—and we won't do that. We'll guarantee energy for our rural producers—our sugar farmers, our beef producers, our business people. Labor, sucking up to their Green mates, will not do that. 


So what are we doing to have this great success in the regions? I'll tell you what we're doing. We are creating policies in relation to tax, infrastructure, trade and communications that support people in the regions. We're not crucifying them. When it comes to taxation and economic policy, we've introduced the Enterprise Tax Plan, where we are making it easier for regional small businesses. We're bringing the tax rate down to 27.5 per cent for those little cafes, little shops and corner stores in regional Australia. We're helping them, and we're giving them more money. Do you know what they'll do with that extra money? They'll grow their businesses. I know this is hard for the Labor Party to understand, but, when businesses grow, they employ more people—they employ more regional Australians. And that's how you grow the economy. And we are doing other things. We are introducing sensible policies like the $20,000 immediate depreciation on assets—what an eminently sensible idea—so that farmers can buy that piece of agricultural equipment and immediately depreciate it so that they have that money to invest back into their business, grow their business and employ people. Members opposite just don't know what I am talking about!


I will tell you what else we're doing to support regional Australians and regional business. Decentralisation is a wonderful concept—one I and the National Party fully support—but it's more than moving jobs out there; it's also building the infrastructure that encourages people to go to regional Australia. That's why we have a $75 billion infrastructure program that will deliver for regional Australia—like the $6.7 billion we're spending on the Bruce Highway to save lives. That's what we do. Recently I stood on the side of the highway with my leader, Barnaby Joyce, and spoke to him about saving lives. That's what he's interested in. He is interested in regional Australia. He is not interested in issues like the waste-of-time issues that the Labor Party are carrying on with at the moment—issues that Australians are not interested in. (Time expired)

Mr BRIAN MITCHELL
 (Lyons) (16:06):  You know the place is in trouble when the National Party, that party of agricultural socialists, has been captured by Trump trickle-down economics—the failed economics of the far right, of the HR Nicholls Society. This confirms the fact that the National Party of Australia is now just a bunch of Liberals in big hats. That's all you are—Liberals in big hats. You've lost your country roots completely. To think that these characters over there think that a $65 billion corporate tax cut is going to do anything for people on the ground in country Australia is absolute madness.


There is no better example of this government failing rural and regional Australians than in my own electorate of Lyons, with just 55.3 per cent of 16-year-old kids in the suburb of Brighton in full-time education; youth unemployment at 23.5 per cent; wages averaging $45,000—far lower than the national average; digital inclusion at 45.7 compared to 54.5 for Australia; and a median life expectancy of 70 years of age for men in the Central Highlands in my electorate—14½ years less than those in the Prime Minister's electorate of Wentworth can expect to live. These are big gaps. What is this government doing to address them? It is going to cut $68 million from schools in Tasmania over the next two years; cut $58 million from the University of Tasmania; and keep the Medicare freeze rebate, which makes going to the doctor more expensive and more unaffordable in an electorate of low-income people which has some of the lowest rates of bulk-billing in the country.


In 2014-15, this government spent $910 on Medicare services per individual nationwide, compared to $536 for people in the regions. That is failing regional Australia. Patients presenting to emergency departments requiring urgent medical attention are being left in emergency departments longer. Only 66 per cent of urgent emergency department patients in Tasmania are seen within the recommended 30 minutes. More than half of all public hospital doctors are working unsafe hours, putting them at significant risk of fatigue, including 75 per cent of intensive care specialists. That's failing the people of Tasmania. The Australian Medical Association says:


… the strain and the pressure on our public hospitals is having a detrimental impact on the health of our doctors.


So what's this government's answer to health? To get in the back pockets of the private health insurance lobby.


Pre-tax profits of private health insurers increased 7.3 per cent in the 12 months to 2017. They're raking in $1.86 billion before tax. At the same time, out-of-pocket costs for ordinary Australians and Tasmanians continue to soar. Also, the premiums are going up, but what you can claim is going down. More than 12,000 Australians dropped their cover for hospital treatment in the last three months of 2017. They've been paying for private health insurance, but they know that when they come to claim it they're not going to get what they thought they were paying for. That's failing regional Australia. Out-of-pocket costs on private health insurance claims jumped by 31.7 per cent in just 12 months.


The list just goes on, as the member for Braddon said. We could spend hours here talking about how this government fails regional Australia. The NBN roll-out—where do I start? It's an absolute farce. Under Labor, the fibre-to-the-premises rollout would have covered 93 per cent of premises. It would have been a rollout that would not have left regional Australia behind and that would have seen medical and educational services available to people in regional Australia. What we are seeing under this government is a rollout where people in the town of Lachlan in my electorate—a town of 800 people—can't even get onto the internet in the afternoon when the kids get home from school. It's so slow, at one megabit per second, that they can't even do a speed test to see how slow it is. That's how bad it is under this government.


They are failing on industrial relations—kids not being paid properly for work, the PaTH rip-off for young people. It just goes on. What about biosecurity and the fruit fly incursion in Tasmania? What a massive failure of government it is to allow fruit flies to emerge in our state for the first time ever.

Mr RICK WILSON
 (O'Connor) (16:11):  Seeing we have a Tasmanian contingent here this afternoon, I'm sure the member for Tangney would join me in wondering why we didn't get an acknowledgement that WA's GST is helping the Tasmanian economy considerably. When we get 34c in the dollar, Tasmania gets $1.83. It would have been nice to have an acknowledgement for Western Australians that we contribute massively to the Tasmanian economy.


This my second term in this House, and I've seen two firsts here today. I saw the opposition direct one of their questions to a chairman of a committee, and they were bulldogged by the member for Flynn. That was something I never thought I'd see, but I'm looking forward to seeing it again. The second 'first' was that the opposition used the MPI to ask a Dorothy Dixer. The member for Hunter didn't really seem to have his heart in it, and I can understand that. You're drawing the short straw when you are sent out to put up an MPI about regional Australia and the performance of the government in regional Australia.


I just want to run through a few of the great things that we've done in regional Australia. I'll start with agriculture, which is very close to my heart. We've seen agriculture's gross domestic product grow to $67 billion since we came to government. I give great credit to the government and particularly the member for New England, who was the agriculture minister through that first term in government, for this result. The agricultural competitiveness white paper made some very important investments in agriculture, and we're now seeing that come to fruition.


Alongside the free trade agreements that we signed in the first term of the Turnbull government, we have seen massive increases in our agriculture export products, which is being reflected in higher prices returning to growers. We're seeing wool prices at record highs, as I'm sure you'd be aware, Deputy Speaker Coulton, as a representative of a great wool-growing electorate. Today the eastern market indicator sits at 1,880c, which reflects about 1,200c per kilogram greasy, and that's a very strong return to the woolgrowers across your electorate and my electorate and the rest of Australia.


We also are seeing record red meat prices. We've seen record beef prices in the last 12 months, and we're currently seeing record sheepmeat prices. I believe that is to a very large extent a result of our free trade agreements, particularly the China, Japan and South Korea free trade agreements.


On the tax side: for the 18,000 small businesses in my electorate of O'Connor and the millions of small businesses across Australia, we've reduced the tax rate to 27.5 cents, on a trajectory down to 25 cents. We've also included instant asset write-offs. For assets up to $20,000—and farmers buy many of those assets—they can write them off immediately. We've also increased the upper limit for farm management deposits from $400,000 to $800,000 to better allow farmers, now that we are seeing some profits being made in the industry, to prepare for the tougher times.



There's a 6.7 per cent increase in school funding across the board in my electorate under Gonski 2.0—a great result for regional schools. I will get to what the WA Labor government have done to regional schools in a moment. In aged care, we've provided capital funding for many of the community-run organisations across the electorate. I would run out of time if I were to name them all, but that's another area where we have performed very strongly. I am going to run out of time, but I want to talk about what WA Labor, elected in March 2017, have done in regional WA. The first thing they were going to do was increase the gold royalty tax by 50 per cent to rip $392 million out of the industry, which was estimated to cost 3,000 jobs. We've had $64 million of cuts to education, which included, if you can believe it, an attempt to close the School of the Air. That is the iconic Australian outback organisation which educates kids across the outback of Western Australia. They attempted to close that down. They have now backflipped due to community pressure. But they are still going to cut school camps—two of them in my electorate, in Kalgoorlie and Pemberton. When I go around to the end-of-year school awards, I hear that the highlight of the year for the year 6 students was going to the Pemberton Camp School. The Labor government in WA will cut that school camp. Member for Hunter, please don't come in here to lecture us about regional Australia. (Time expired)

Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (16:17):  I rise to speak in support of the Proceeds of Crime Amendment (Proceeds and Other Matters) Bill 2017. I speak on behalf of the opposition today, and I can tell the chamber that Labor will be supporting the amendments in this bill. In my role as the shadow justice minister I have the great privilege of spending a lot of time with people who work in law enforcement. When I ask them what is the one thing that the federal parliament can do to assist them in keeping the Australian community safer, they always tell me that the best thing we can do is try to take more of the profit out of crime. That's why we're so supportive of the amendments that are before the chamber today, which make some technical, although quite important, adjustments to the regime that exists in Australian law.


The notion of attempting to take the profit out of crime is one that has existed in law for a very long time. In fact, if we look right back to feudal times, there were laws in place that attempted to do this. Then, in more recent times, the English had in rem forfeiture laws. The Proceeds of Crime Act is derived from that long history. The object of our proceeds of crime regime is to deny the perpetrators of crime the profits and the instruments of their crimes. In doing so, it suppresses criminal activity and returns the proceeds of crime back to society. We're the great beneficiaries of that in representing communities around Australia. Each year we see the federal government retain somewhere in the tens of millions of dollars from the proceeds of crime. Some of us have been lucky enough to see that money redistributed in our communities to keep those communities safer.


Labor always takes the opportunity to speak when the Proceeds of Crime Act comes before this chamber, because this was actually a Labor government invention. The Proceeds of Crime Act was first introduced by the Hawke Labor government. At the time, the then Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen, aptly noted that:


… major crime, particularly drug trafficking and serious fraud on the revenue, is growing and is becoming increasingly international in scope. Traditional methods of punishment by imprisonment and fine are not enough.


Mr Bowen was quite right. Since the Proceeds of Crime Act was first introduced by Labor just over 30 years ago, serious and organised crime has become truly transnational in scope, perhaps more so than Mr Bowen could ever really have imagined. Today, criminals use technology to coordinate and commit crimes across the globe and to evade law enforcement. They exploit the massive increase in the international movement of people and goods to transfer assets, and they wash money through accounts across the world. This is making the job of law enforcement harder than ever.


In my meetings with police they often talk about the increasing complexity they see in the financial and legal arrangements that are made to hide the proceeds of crime. If there is any hint of a loophole or a vulnerability in the laws that relate to seizing the proceeds of crime, there are people committing crimes in this country who know about it and are exploiting it. That's why it's so important that we continue to make updates to the Proceeds of Crime Act. In fact, this is the second since I took on the role of shadow justice minister.


The bill before us would make a number of technical amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act to close loopholes in our regime that have been identified in recent case law. There are two specific cases that adjustments in the bill before us seek to take account of. The first is the Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Huang in the Western Australian Supreme Court. The second is the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police v Hart in the Queensland Court of Appeal.


The bill before us would, firstly, ensure that the Commonwealth unexplained wealth regime covers situations in which wealth is derived or realised directly or indirectly from certain offences. Secondly, the bill would clarify that property becomes proceeds or an instrument of an offence under the act when proceeds or an instrument are used to improve the property or discharge an encumbrance or security or liability incurred in relation to that property. That's probably a pretty complicated way of getting to the legislative issues at hand, but what it really means is that, if someone uses legal means to provide, for example, a down payment on a house but then uses the proceeds of crime to pay off the mortgage on that house, the amendments before us clarify that that house would indeed be considered the proceeds of crime. Before these amendments were made, it was a bit unclear about whether the house itself could be considered proceeds of crime, even if, for example, 70 or 80 per cent of the house was paid off in mortgage repayments that were clearly the proceeds of crime.


There were some issues raised through the committee process that considered the detail of this bill. One of the points that I think was made quite well in the report that came from that committee process was that there are quite a lot of protections under the Proceeds of Crime Act that will assist in making sure that the adjustments being made in this bill don't adversely affect members of the community. For example, courts will still have the powers that they had previously to refuse to issue a restraining order on property if that would not be in the public interest. It is, in a sense, a catch-all for the interests of justice. The court still retains the power to revoke a restraining order where the restraining order was made without the respondent being present, and allowances can be made for expenses to be made out of property covered by a restraining order. Most importantly, the Proceeds of Crime Act covers a general protection under subsection 34(3), which means that people who are using the proceeds of crime but don't know they are using the proceeds of crime are protected under the act. The common example that's used in this situation is perhaps a partner who is in a relationship with someone who is committing crimes that they are not aware of. If they have somehow benefited from property, then that property generally isn't considered to be the proceeds of crime. That's important, because the intention of this act is to target criminals and not other people who are in their world.


The main concerns about the amendments that are before the House were raised by the Law Council of Australia, and I want to make a few comments about the submission that they made to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. Labor has the greatest respect for the Law Council of Australia. We work with them very closely on lots of aspects of the work that we do. That's why I want to talk about the concerns that they raised. The Law Council queried the adequacy of the existing protections in the Proceeds of Crime Act, and I mentioned some of those previously in my statement. Specifically, their concern is the prohibition on compensation orders in circumstances in which property is an instrument of an offence. They also expressed concerns about the absence of the proportionality test between the benefits said to be derived from an offence and the point at which something is therefore regarded as proceeds or an instrument of an offence.


It's getting pretty technical, and the reason for that is that it's a very technical area of law. But what it really means is that the Law Council is concerned that, if someone uses 80 per cent legitimate means to fund a house but 20 per cent illegitimate means, then that whole house will then be considered proceeds of crime. We had a very constructive meeting with the department, with the government and with law enforcement about these issues, and I believe that the government has adequately dealt with some of the concerns that were raised by the Law Council. For this reason, we are going to support the bill unamended. Labor believes that, just as it is important to ensure that there are no loopholes in our proceeds of crime and unexplained wealth orders, it's also important that we ensure that there are no loopholes in the protections that we afford to individuals who are affected by the operation of this scheme. So, we're very open to continued improvements for the proceeds of crime regime and will be happy to work with the government on any further improvements that come through their processes.


I want to make some brief comments about the general issue of how crime's being prosecuted in Australia. We do support the objects and measures contained in this bill because the profit of crime comes at the expense of all Australians. We know that serious and organised crime in Australia is estimated to cost somewhere around $36 billion each year. The Australian Crime and Intelligence Commission has estimated that it is somewhere around $1,500 out of every Australian's pocket every year, due to people who are in many instances committing fraud on a grand scale. Preventing serious and organised crime is not just a question of community safety but also one of basic fairness. We are all paying taxes into the tax system. We just cannot allow that tax system and the expenditure that comes from it to be so corrupted.


If we want to close this gap and if we want to take the profit out of crime, we need more than just strong laws. And, if there's one crucial thing that I've learned in the justice portfolio, it is that having strong laws is simply not enough to take the benefits out of crime and to make our community safe. We also need sufficient resourcing to law enforcement to make sure that these laws work. I have constant discussions with stakeholders in which the tone of the conversation is, 'We don't want law reform; we don't want the parliament to put more things down on paper; we actually need more police so we can make sure that the provisions which are there to protect Australians are being properly utilised.'


That's why Labor has been so deeply disappointed to see the government's cuts to the Australian Federal Police. We saw in the last budget $184 million cut from the Australian Federal Police, and in that last year alone we lost 151 AFP personnel. When I talk to law enforcement across the country I hear a really clear message, and that is that their job is getting more difficult, not less difficult, over time. One of the biggest challenges they face is responding to this increasingly sophisticated use of technology that crime syndicates are undertaking. And I think it's extraordinary that the government has decided to cut funding and staff to the AFP at this very challenging time for law enforcement. Unlike the government, we believe it's more important than ever to ensure that we support the expertise and incredible dedication that we see from AFP officers. I think there'll be more of this to come in the year ahead.


But, returning to the Proceeds of Crime Act amendment, Labor's very proud to support this bill and the measures it contains to close loopholes in our proceeds of crime regime. We believe that no person should be entitled to profit from any unlawful or criminal conduct. When the Proceeds of Crime Bill was first introduced, in 1987, Lionel Bowen described it as 'the most effective weaponry against major crime ever introduced into this parliament', and Labor is committed to making sure it remains so.

3 MR CREWTHER: To move:


   That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) genocide is a crime under international law, which has been enacted into Australian law through Division 268 of the Australian Criminal Code;


(b) the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic found that ISIL committed, and is continuing to commit, genocide against the Yazidis; and

(a) both the Building Code 2013 (2013 Code) and the Code for the Tendering and Performance of Building Work 2016 (2016 Code) require code covered entities to protect freedom of association on building and construction worksites;


(b) the 2016 Code includes requirements in respect of building association logos, mottos or indicia; and


   (c) the Australian Building and Construction Commission's fact sheet Freedom of Association—Logos, Mottos and Indicia specifies that 'logos, mottos and indicia' that would breach the 2016 Code include 'the iconic symbol of the five white stars and white cross on the Eureka Stockade flag';


(2) recognises that:


(a) the Eureka Stockade flag was:


   (i) first used in 1854 at Ballarat; and


   (ii) a symbol of resistance of the gold miners during the rebellion;


(b) beneath the Eureka Stockade flag, the leader of the Ballarat Reform League, Peter Lalor, said 'We swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties';

(d) it is an attack on:


   (i) an individual's freedom of association to prevent them from wearing the Eureka Stockade flag on their clothing; and


      (ii) freedom of association to prevent a construction site from displaying the Eureka Stockade flag; and


(4) calls on the Government to immediately act to protect the rights of workers in the construction industry by making clear that displaying the iconic symbol of democracy, the Eureka Stockade flag, is not a breach of the 2016 Code.

",HoR,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,15,2
"Burney, Linda, MP",ALP,2018-02-14,"



Ms BURNEY
 (Barton) (19:30):  This week the parliament and the nation marked the 10-year anniversary of Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd delivering the apology to the stolen generations—a historic and unifying moment for our country, because it acknowledged the horror, pain, humiliation and injustice of the forced removal of Aboriginal children from their families and communities. The meaningfulness of the apology was that, for the first time, pain, hurt and the consequences of the stolen generation transcended generations and can still be felt today—that they were believed, and their reality was legitimised and recognised. It was an exercise in truth-telling. The apology was meaningful in that it marked the beginning of the great national effort to close the gap in quality-of-life outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. For the apology to be fully realised, we as a nation must work to ensure that we don't repeat past injustices, because 'sorry' means you don't do it again.


On Monday night, on the eve of the 10th anniversary of this historic apology, I attended a screening of a film titled After the Apology, screened here in the parliament. The film shone a light on the alarming and truly incredible rates of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care. The number of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care has almost doubled in the past decade. The percentage of children in out-of-home care who are Indigenous rose from 20 per cent to 35 per cent. And the number has risen from 9,000 or so to over 17,000. It is inexplicable that this figure has doubled, and the principle of the Aboriginal child placement seems to have been meaningless.


We heard stories of hurt and pain. We heard stories of humiliation. We heard stories of frustration and a lack of cultural understanding of Aboriginal culture and communities and child-rearing practices—our policy, our policymakers and the people responsible for enforcing these policies. We heard stories of young Indigenous children being removed from their families, their communities, their country and their culture. We heard stories all too reminiscent of the stories from the Bringing them home report—stories from survivors of the stolen generation. At the existing rate, by 2025 the increase in the number of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care will surpass the total of number of Aboriginal children removed as part of the stolen generation. In fact, on the night, one woman at the screening said, 'This is not a new stolen generation, but the stolen generation is never finished.'


The apology will be meaningful only if we as a nation work to ensure that there is no repeat of past injustices, because 'sorry' means you don't do it again. Of course, there are some cases where children need to be removed We recognise that. But the film made it clear that, in cases where children did need to be removed, little effort was made to have the child appropriately placed. I thank the writer and the producer of the film, Larissa Behrendt and Michaela Perske, for this very insightful and moving film. And I thank all those who were involved and brave enough to share their painful stories as well as their hope and optimism for a better future for Aboriginal children.


I strongly recommend that members of this House make the time to watch the film. It not only gave the opportunity for all of us here in the parliament to listen to these stories. It also gave those who have been removed and those who had children taken from them the opportunity to share their stories, their experience and their pain. This week Labor announced that a Shorten Labor government will host a summit on first-nations children. We have committed to a national justice target to reduce the disproportionately high numbers of Aboriginal people in incarceration.


I also want to use this time to briefly respond to the Prime Minister's comments about an Indigenous voice to the parliament. I am concerned that the description by many of this voice has been as a third chamber for the parliament. This is simply not true. The body would be advisory and would also have no veto powers. I'm concerned by the Prime Minister's threat to turn this into an election issue. I caution the Prime Minister—and therefore the government—to be very careful in using these kinds of threats. We are committed to bipartisanship, but the highest bar needs to be set. It is not a race to the bottom.

Ms MADELEINE KING
 (Brand) (10:00):  I've never been known as a revhead, and so a Perth car club's invitation to join them on a Sunday afternoon to witness a world record attempt was always going to be a new experience for me. And this record attempt was something else indeed! Alongside a crowd of enthusiasts at a warehouse in Kwinana, I watched more than 60 electric cars—including Tesla, BMW, Mitsubishi and Nissan models—attempt to break the world record for the biggest electric vehicle charge. The attempt was the first of its kind and all of those involved worked hard to make the day a success. 


Jon Edwards from the Tesla Owners Club of Western Australia is one of those people who are passionate about what they do. He is passionate about the difference electric cars and electric vehicles can make and is keen to share their benefits with the wider public. On this particular day, he invested his time and money in ensuring the event went off without a hitch—which it did. He worked hard to get all the cars there and to make sure there were enough power points for the cars. 


On the day, 62 electric vehicle owners from around Perth gathered to try and set the world record for the biggest electric car charge, with the most vehicles charged simultaneously in the same place. I'd like to thank Jon Edwards as well as David Lloyd, also from the Tesla Owners Club of Western Australia, who have been most generous in taking me out for a couple of rides in their respective Tesla cars—remarkable vehicles, including the 'insane mode', which absolutely takes your breath away. I have no doubt electric vehicles are the future. It's up to parliaments likes ours, as well as others around the world, to measure up to that future and make positive policy settings that embrace and encourage electric vehicle ownership. 


On the Australia Day weekend, I was very fortunate to go out to the Sandgropers Land Yacht Club to sail on a land yacht on a 430-hectare dried out salt lake known as Lake Walyungup in my electorate. The lake is between Warnbro, Waikiki and Baldivis. The Sandgropers club meet on Sunday afternoons when the lake is dry in the summer. People from all ages come from around the state to sail or pilot their land yachts on this lake. People even came from Kalgoorlie for this Regatta. I'd really like to thank Jay, who took me out on a double-seater land yacht for the first time. I've driven past this salt lake and witnessed the sailing for years—since I was a child growing up in Baldivis—but I had never taken the journey out to where they sail and I had certainly never sailed on that wonderful salt lake. So I was very pleased to do it. It was a little bit frightening and a little bit thrilling. I really hope the members of that club continue to enjoy it. They've been there since 1979, and they get many new members to enjoy the speeds of up to 100 kays an hour that these land yachts can travel at.

Mrs SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (10:31):  It is now 10 years since the eventful day when the national apology was made to our nation's first people. I was sitting in Macca's, Goulburn, and there were many Indigenous people stopping, talking and, in some instances, crying. The day was eventful and significant, and it was not just a symbol; it was the beginning of a new consciousness that would—and it continues to this day—make our nation a better place, filled with acknowledgement that what had gone on before was not the way we should keep going. 


This year, 2018, closing the gap remains a shared commitment. This is a shared journey that I hope will always draw on the wisdom, strength and resilience, learned over thousands of years, of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander civilisation, as well as the learning of present Australians and those yet to come. There is a statement that we should not have to reinvent the wheel. While that is not the complete case here, it should be noted that effective programs and services need to be designed, developed and implemented in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This should not surprise us. It's blatantly obvious. 


In addition, and also of great importance, is that governments must take a far more holistic approach, involving agencies from different departments to develop policies and deliver services to First Australians. And, although that phrase is taken directly from the report, I actually argue with the idea of delivering services to our First Australians. It should rather be with our Indigenous family. The lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have improved, but there's still a lot more to be done. 


There are four main pillars in any community, and the Closing the Gap targets are no different: health, education, employment and community safety. Each is clearly inter-related. For instance, improving education standards helps to increase employment rates and levels of health. And community safety is fundamental to making sure children attend school and adults maintain employment. Three targets for closing the gap are on track. The first is halving child mortality by this year. Improvements in key drivers of child and maternal health over the past few years suggest that we could even do better. The second target is to have 95 per cent of all Indigenous four-year-olds enrolled in early childhood education by 2025. Personally, I see this as one of the foundation stones for long-term change, and I believe it is the indicator in the community for the greatest development potential. Finally, the target to halve the gap in year 12 attainment by 2020 is definitely on track. Nationally, the proportion of Indigenous students aged 20 to 24 who have achieved year 12 or equivalent has increased from 47.4 per cent in 2006 to 65.3 per cent in 2016. 


In Gilmore especially, I am so very proud of our young Indigenous students, the schools they attend and their teachers. Along with their families, they are making huge inroads of change and achievement. Special mention is deserved for Batemans Bay High, Ulladulla High, Shoalhaven High, Vincentia High and Bomaderry High. With special reference to culture and confidence building, we are getting great outcomes. I'd like to thank some Indigenous leaders in my community in particular for all their efforts to close the gap: Uncle Tom and Aunty Muriel Slocky, Aunty Nell Mooney, Uncle Fred Carriage, Aunty Ruth Simms, Aunty Pat Lester, Aunty Delia Lowe, Alfred and Noel Wellington and Greg Peterson. There are many others, but these individuals I have come to know and I have a very deep respect for them.


We still have to work on overall attendance rates for Indigenous students, and I suspect that we need to develop different strategies to get to that target. Numeracy is on track for year 9 students across the nation, but, gosh, there's a lot more to do here. We do see the gap in NAPLAN results narrowing in reading in years 3 and 5 and in numeracy in years 5 and 9, but we still need to work there. Halving the gap in employment by this year didn't quite come together, so we've still got work to get on with in that area. The last measure is to close the gap in life expectancy by 2031, and I believe we all recognise that it's going to take more than a decade to bring that together.


Developing collaborative working relationships between government agencies and other organisations, and delivering services and programs in consultation with the Indigenous community will be essential in identifying the key social and economic determinants. A necessary part of this is valuing Indigenous knowledge and cultural beliefs and practices that are important for promoting positive cultural identity and social and emotional wellbeing for all Australians. Just this morning I visited the National Museum of Australia and was guided by the enthusiastic Indigenous curator, Margo Neale, to share in our Australian story of the Seven Sisters—the meanings, the evolution and the essential message that should be shared by all Australians. We really must build Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander capacity, involving good and positive mentoring for staff, and making sure their ideas and cultural influences are fully integrated in program design, delivery and evaluation.


Recently, one of my successful Gilmore Indigenous organisations sent me a bit of a report, and this is an excerpt from it:


Waminda's work in the community is driven by its vision for women and their Indigenous families being positive, happy and healthy. Waminda is guided by a vision where Indigenous women are admired and proud of their achievements in their own community …


Their service model is a 'comprehensive and holistic care' model, 'enabling a focus on the social determinants'. They're very successful. Glen Ella of sporting fame is trying to establish a program for sporting development that incentivises students to attend school on a more regular basis. His program is for both boys and girls. There are, in fact, dozens of small-scale programs that are working and making a difference for Indigenous children and their families, including the team at Cullunghutti and the community of Jerrinja. These are huge changes in attitude and expectations of change in themselves.


As education has been and continues to be a priority for me, I see many of the recommendations from the report of the last inquiry, The power of education: From surviving to thriving, presented by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Indigenous affairs, which I now chair, as great stepping stones for change. These steps will help to close the gap. We should collect the data relating to successful programs and figure out what's working and what's not. How good would it be to have school-age Indigenous young mothers still attending school while we help them with their maternal responsibilities? We need to alleviate the difficulties of learning where there are hearing impediments for children—or perhaps we should prevent them in the first place. We must work with the states and territories to have a clear strategy in relation to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, as well as having appropriate screening so that learning disorders can be identified and steps taken to remediate these children. How wonderful it would be for some health interventions to be available close to our primary schools, just as Nowra East Public School is developing. In addition to their plan, the school parents and neighbours will be constructing a community kitchen in the garden next to their mini health unit. It's a terrific concept, and I'm only too pleased that we've been able to negotiate a grant of $12,000 to assist them. Ultimately, if we have a cooperative model of information exchange between education and health, what a great advantage that would be for the nurses, the teachers and the other professionals trying to help Indigenous children and their families.


It's wonderful to see the emergence of language in our schools and also that all students are learning language. But what about the rural and, importantly, the remote schools where English is in fact the second language? We really must train the teachers to be proficient in English as a second language. It's not the same as somebody who's trained to improve language, literacy and numeracy. They're actually quite different techniques.


I mentioned the possible Ellavation program in my area, but there truly need to be sporting opportunities for our Indigenous girls. The pride on the faces of our PCYC-sponsored Yuin Snake Teams was magic! Their parents were proud, the young women were proud, and it just showed what potential such a scheme has to change the self-confidence of our Indigenous young women. But other programs besides sport need to be explored to help our young girls. I'm especially thinking about encouraging them towards robotics and STEM subjects. In the report of the inquiry there's a strong call to review Abstudy. It observes how, in many cases, it is acting as an educational barrier. Let's bring in a review, as this too, once remedied, will surely help with closing the gap of Indigenous difference.


I say with pride that today the annual growth rate of Supply-Nation-registered Indigenous businesses is an average of 12.5 per cent. It is actually the envy of all other sectors in the Australian community.


Around 14,700 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are enrolled in early childhood education, which, as I said before, is in fact one of my priorities for all children. Each time I'm a guest at the VET awards night for our Indigenous students, I quietly burst with pride. Each successive year there's been an increasing number of students completing year 12 with a VET qualification. They're proud of themselves, and our entire community is proud of them.


We are closing the gap in Gilmore, and I believe we can upscale all the different and successful programs, not only in my region but across the nation, so that in the next 10 years we'll have six out of seven of the targets met and only the last one to work on. As we know, it will probably take a couple of decades to bring us closer in lifespan, because there are some entrenched health issues that have arisen in the past that we need to address in the future. I think we're doing well, but we can do better.

Ms CHESTERS
 (Bendigo) (10:41):  I rise to speak to the Closing the Gap report that's been tabled in parliament. I will begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land on which we meet and paying my respects to their elders, both past and present. I also acknowledge the Dja Dja Wurrung people, who are traditional owners of my electorate of Bendigo in Central Victoria, and pay my respects to their elders, past, present and future.


'Closing the gap': it is language that is commonly known now, which is about bridging the gap between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and non Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. All of us in this place have a responsibility. Our governments—our local, state and federal governments—have a responsibility, as do our communities, and in this contribution I'd like to acknowledge some of the great work that is going on in my community to help close the gap.


In that spirit, I'd like to start with some of the words of Aunty Julie, who has kindly let me share some of her Australia Day speech from 2017. Aunty Julie was the Mount Alexander citizen of the year for 2016, and in her Australia Day address in 2017 she reflected on the year she had been the area's citizen of the year. She said:


I have run formal cultural awareness days where we can share and yarn about issues. One of the activities I do when taking cultural awareness days is a timeline of the Dja Dja Wurrung history in the Mount Alexander shire. I have historically significant events on cards and ask participants to put them in order …


One of the cards explains how two-thirds of the Dja Dja Wurrung population was wiped out before a white person set foot in Central Victoria. Who knows why? The timeline shows what it was like before the arrival of others. It was basically a paradise, plenty of food, plenty of water, amazing sites to held Ceremony, et cetera.


Then came disease, massacres, poisoning, dispossession of land. Of the whole Dja Dja Wurrung nation in the Mount Alexander shire, which numbered around 2,000 before invasion, only 70 were left on country by 1863. In less than 30 years nearly a whole nation of proud people was decimated by greed. This is part of the history which must be understood, not dwelled on, but understood so that we, as a People, can be understood.


Those are powerful words by Aunty Julie, and I thank her for allowing me to share them with this place. It goes to the heart of why we must continue to work to close the gap.


We are fortunate in Bendigo and Central Victoria that we have reached settlement without having to go to the High Court. On 15 November 2013, the Dja Dja Wurrung people and the state of Victoria celebrated recognition and settlement. I want to acknowledge the great spirit in which the Dja Dja Wurrung people approached this. The settlement acknowledged that, before European colonisation, the natural places within the Dja Dja Wurrung country were well known, and names and songs were celebrated as part of their culture.


Their vision is for the health and wellbeing of those people to be strong and underpinned by their living culture. As the first peoples of the land, their vision is to be included and politically empowered, establishing a place in society and being capable of managing their own affairs from a strong and diverse economic base. They are working with the Bendigo community and businesses to achieve their own economic independence.


It's always inspiring to catch up with the Dja Dja Wurrung, to learn of their successes, the way in which they're working, the pride that they have in restoring country, their businesses, their enterprises and what they're achieving. They're a demonstration of what can happen when we do stand to the side and allow them to be empowered and to work collectively and collaboratively together.


We've also had amazing success with BDAC, Bendigo & District Aboriginal Co-operative, and the work that they're doing in regard to health, wellbeing, and family and community services. It's important, when acknowledging Closing the gap, to note the tireless work that they do in our community to ensure that the people who they support the most are achieving the best outcomes. But they're also pragmatic and realistic about the challenges that they have.


BDAC now employs more than 50 people, and 80 per cent of their staff identify as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander. They have been honest and frank with me in the way that only they can about the struggles that they've had with a number of government programs. They say that their clients and their community struggle with the changes to My Aged Care, with packages that are unfair and which don't meet the costs of support. They say that they struggle to help make sure that their clients and their community aren't ripped off by people who charge exorbitant administration fees. By that I mean that their clients and community aren't receiving the best support that they need. This is an example of where government policy is making it hard for us to close the gap.


The Dja Dja Wurrung community includes regional Bendigo, where just under 2,000 Aboriginal people live. They reside in districts like Boort, Redesdale and Creswick. More than half the Aboriginal people in Bendigo are under 24, and therefore there are a number of programs BDAC are working on, such as the men's shed, the youth service facilities, and making sure that we have record numbers of health checks and ongoing health care. Their Prouses Road development is another way in which they're helping to close the gap.


Another program is the way in which BDAC is working to reduce the number of children in out-of-home care. It is quite innovative; it is an Australian first and it was recognised last year. In Victoria, the number of children in the Victorian child protection system has risen 70 per cent over the last three years. According to the Australian Institute of Family Studies, the rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care was 10 times higher than the rate of non-Aboriginal children. This is an overrepresentation of children, and the reason why a new approach was called for by Aboriginal leaders. Raylene Harradine, the chief executive of BDAC, said to her staff and to the community:


It's around trying to keep our kids in our community and in the care of our own people …


So they stepped up. It's about having a range of services across an organisation that enable options for children in our community.


One couple shared their experience with a dramatic new child protection approach being trialled in Bendigo, known as section 18, or Aboriginal guardianship. Yorta Yorta man Simon Penrose said it was important that Aboriginal foster children had access to culture. Mr Penrose and his partner have fostered children for just over two years, and in the past six months have been fostering local Aboriginal children into their family. This new trial and approach towards Aboriginal children is, basically, the state government, through the Department of Health, saying, 'We will work with BDAC and these local families to take care of their own.'


But, for all the successes, there is still a lot of work to do. Incarceration rates of Aboriginal people in Victoria remain too high. Statistics for 2016 show that Aboriginal men make up eight per cent of the male population in the corrections centre. The prison rate for Aboriginal women is 10.3 per cent of the female population, and it's high for youth. A lot of these prisons are in my electorate. We have prisons in our electorate for youth, women, and men.


We must do more as a society. We must do more as a community. We must do more as parliamentarians to help close the gap. It's not enough just to have rhetoric saying that we will work with them. We need to demonstrate it through funding. We need to demonstrate it through empowerment. We need to make sure that we're doing all we can to help close the gap.

"Gee, Andrew, MP",Nats,2018-02-14,"



Mr GEE
 (Calare) (10:51):  In parliament this week, the tenth annual Closing the gap report was delivered, revealing that four of its seven targets to improve Indigenous health and welfare were not on track. Whilst there has been some progress to acknowledge, it needs to be said that there is also a palpable sense of disappointment. This year, the categories of progress include the target to halving the gap in year 12 attainment by 2020, halving the gap in child mortality by 2018, and having 95 per cent of all Indigenous four-year-olds enrolled in early childhood education by 2025. Those are the targets reported to be on track. The areas the report declares to be off track include school attendance, literacy and numeracy, employment and the key target of closing the 10-year gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians by 2031.


In Calare, I consider myself fortunate to be representing an electorate that is, from border to border, Wiradjuri country. It has been a privilege to get to know the Wiradjuri elders in the various communities of the Central West. I've known some for a number of years and I've worked with some more recently, since coming to this place. One of the inspiring things about all of them is that they constantly look to the future, striving to make life better, not only for Indigenous communities but all in our country towns and cities. I could tell this House of many remarkable people working to close the gap in central western New South Wales. They are the teachers in our schools; the men and women of the Clontarf academies and girls' academies; doctors, nurses and allied health professionals; sporting coaches and service club members; lawyers and community workers—the list goes on, and it is as long as it is distinguished.


After a decade, we all know that there is no easy answer to closing the gap, no panacea. However, I'm grateful that in our communities the work by so many unsung community heroes goes on. In the work that they do there are challenges and there is difficulty. There is tragedy and sometimes even heartbreak. But through the efforts of these people there are success and triumph as well. I've seen it. Time doesn't permit me to speak today of all of their individual contributions to closing the gap, but they are out there in our communities today, even as we speak, working in so many different ways. Today, I express to them the thanks of a grateful electorate and region.


While we all acknowledge that there are no simple answers, I mention Stan Grant, who said this week:


Clearly there is a need to create meaningful links between Indigenous communities and individuals and the mainstream Australian economy.


I think it's a point well made.


The overall findings contained in the Closing the gap report are unsatisfactory. The gaps in key areas still exist and, in some cases, they're getting wider. In the Australia of 2018, it's not good enough. It's not good enough by a long shot, and all of us here need to recommit ourselves to closing those gaps. I thank and acknowledge all in Calare who are working so hard to do just that.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2018-02-14,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (10:55):  I acknowledge the traditional owners of this land, the Ngunawal and Ngambri people, here in Canberra and pay respect to elders, past and present. I want to recognise too, back at home, the traditional owners, the Dharug, in which the electorate of Chifley sits. I want to pay my respects to them and thank them for their custodianship.


Today I particularly want to acknowledge the surviving members of the stolen generation who, for so many decades, spoke their truth without recognition. That they persevered to expose the injustices they suffered deserves our utmost respect but also our thanks. As a country we are better and stronger when we acknowledge our history, imperfect as it may be, and work together to build something better. The Leader of the Opposition expressed this so well the other day, when he said:


If you just talk about the problems you're accused of not looking at the successes, if you talk about the successes you're accused of not understanding the problems. It is a mixed record, I understand that.


But one thing I know is that when we work with First Australians, when we genuinely empower First Australians to take control of their lives, when we don't have top-down but bottom-up decision-making we will get it right more than we will get it wrong.


We can't be afraid of change if we intend to act; we will only fail if we don't. When there is so much to improve, action is essential.


I also want to recognise the determination and decency of many in the previous Labor government who were absolutely focused on the need to ensure that we did not just say sorry but that we acted to improve the lives of so many who had been affected. I want to place on the record my thanks to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and also the support that he got from the member for Jagajaga, Jenny Macklin, who had for many years been championing this cause. As I reflected with her the other day, it would be tremendous to be part of a national milestone, in the way that so many people were, but also to do something that was right and was a long time in coming.


This parliament is at its best when it speaks with a sense of unity and respect, when it's acting for all Australians and when it's looking to the future. I believe that as we reflect on the apology we see parliament doing just that. The apology acknowledged our past. It was a crucial step in moving forward together. Recognition by the Prime Minister allowed and encouraged more Australians to share and voice the same sentiments. The apology is a moment in our country's history that I certainly hold close to my heart, as many others do, and I've had the honour of representing the Chifley electorate during that period.


I've never failed to be amazed and inspired by the work of a variety of Aboriginal groups in the Chifley electorate. There are the traditional owners of the land, the Dharug people, but also Indigenous peoples from all over Australia who now call the suburbs within Chifley home and contribute to our vibrant community. I'm honoured to call elders like Uncle Greg Simms, Uncle Wes Marn, Auntie Jenny Ebsworth and Auntie Rita Tobin my friends, and people who I rely upon for counsel and advice. As I reflect on the apology, 10 years on, I can't help but think of the generous response from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, which is, in some ways, the more remarkable act. These proud communities have led the spirit of healing over many years and provided a true service to our nation. In Chifley, this exemplary leadership has been demonstrated in many ways. I'd like to touch on some of these now.


A big event is the reconciliation walk and concert every May, which spreads the message of reconciliation, gives a meeting place to honour Indigenous elders, provides a stage for artists and encourages young people to enjoy a few moments to display their blossoming talents.


Chifley's got the largest urban Aboriginal population in the country. Many Aboriginal people in the electorate are either members of the stolen generation or their direct descendants. The apology made by former Prime Minister Rudd was an enormously healing moment for many in our electorate and they continue to commemorate this historic occasion. This year the walk will take place for the 21st time, led again by Mount Druitt and District Reconciliation Group and its many volunteers. The spirit of the event makes it one of the most significant dates for me personally every single year. I look forward to continuing my involvement, and I would certainly encourage people that live within the electorate of Chifley to get involved and share in the celebration. While recognising our past, I'd also encourage local businesses to get behind the event, which attracts so many people each year; it's such an important date in our community calendar.


Every day in Chifley there are programs and people working to support our Indigenous population and our community more broadly. Ngallu Wal centre, for example, provides outreach services, Centrelink support, financial management support and legal advice. There is also a supported playgroup with activities and engagement for parents and children. It's reaching out further into the community as it develops its new youth drop-in centre. It will provide arts, crafts and indoor and outdoor sport and supervision for young people in our area. It will no doubt be very successful and I wish them all the best with this project. They recently expanded to offer mental health services as well as a baby health service, which is fantastic. These are invaluable services and I congratulate them. 


Marrin Weejali is another instrumental organisation, supporting the community by providing one-on-one and group addiction services, combating addiction for people struggling with that in our community. They are providing chronic care for those suffering long-term illnesses. I also want to mention Butucarbin, who are continuing their great work providing TAFE accredited access to work and training, and Aboriginal cultural arts courses. They're also holding a debutante ball, which will return this year. I know it's an event the community enthusiastically gets behind. 


Baabayn Aboriginal Corporation, founded by five Aboriginal elders from Western Sydney, is another group providing an incredible service. It was set up with the purpose of connecting individuals and families in a welcoming environment. It provides counselling and advocacy, and hosts invited speakers and a homework club as well, which is a terrific initiative. This is by no means all the excellent work being undertaken in the electorate, but I do want to place on the public record my thanks and the thanks of many grateful people for that work. 


With the release of the Closing the gap report there are positives to be drawn from outside the Chifley electorate. I welcome some of those improvements that have been celebrated in this year's report. It has been said already that it's heartening to see the reduction in child mortality and the improvements in childhood education back on track. Year 12 attainment remains strong. But these improvements simply aren't enough. We know the statistics are far worse for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community than for the rest of society. For the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population, the education rate is lower, life expectancy is lower and income rates are lower. At the same time, chronic disease rates are higher, the percentage of the prison population is higher and the percentage of homelessness is higher. So we have a lot to do. 


That's why I welcome the announcement by federal Labor on approaches we have set ourselves. For example, we have said that we'll establish a stolen generations compensation scheme to support intergenerational healing. We have listened to First Australians who have called for justice targets to reduce incarceration rates and we have called on the government to urgently sign up to the remote Indigenous agreement with the states. We will also hold a national summit for our first-nation children. 


I want to make these closing remarks. Closing the gap is not a statistical ambition. It is designed to bring the nation together with a sense of unified purpose to right wrongs and build better futures. It is important we all work together on this, but I cannot fail to reflect on two unfortunate events that occurred this week. First, when the parliament was supposed to be together in the House of Representatives to hear the Prime Minister's speech, we had a near full representation from the opposition and we had a strong representation from the coalition. As soon as that speech was over, the bulk of the coalition left, and that was disheartening. I said 'bulk'; I noted the presence of certain members during that speech. As I said, this is about national unity; it's not a time for partisan politics. We should all be there together.


The other thing—and I think the Prime Minister's well aware of this—is that his failure to attend the national breakfast yesterday recognising the 10-year anniversary of the apology was something that saddened a lot of the participants there and was reflected upon publicly. Again, it doesn't matter what your politics are. The Prime Minister and the coalition are doing some good things to address closing the gap. There are other things we can do better. But it doesn't matter about your politics. This is a sense of national purpose, that something that had been done badly in the past will be committed to by all of us to be corrected in the future. That's all I'd say on that, but, again, we look forward to better outcomes down the track. (Time expired)

Last Thursday, a very powerful presentation was made by the Social Justice Commissioner, June Oscar, in her capacity as one of the co-convenors of the Close the Gap committee, to those who were in attendance at the breakfast and presentation meeting around some of the very profound concerns that first nation peoples have in Australia with regard to the progress or, indeed, probably more accurately, the lack of progress that is being made on a number of fronts. This was not a platform for politicians to speak at—that was made very clear—it was an opportunity for Indigenous people to stand and speak freely to all of us who were able to be present there. I know the Prime Minister had some other commitments and had to leave early, and that was a shame, but a good number of us remained to really try to just listen. Indeed, that was the profound message that came from that event. As I said, it was shaped by Aboriginal people. The message very clearly back to politicians was, 'You need to sit down, be quiet, listen to what we have to say, reflect on this and be serious about a genuine partnership with first nation peoples to develop a pathway going forward and mechanisms to redress what can only be described as a grossly inadequate response to date to the challenge of closing the gap.' That was the profound message I took home. Closing the gap on Indigenous health, education and wellbeing in general must start with a profound commitment to close the gap, but it must also be founded on a respectful and genuine partnership with first nation peoples.


I'd like to turn now to the Close the Gap statement that was presented. As other speakers before me have acknowledged, there have been a few wins in the sense of some gains in some of those targeted areas. We are on track, as others have mentioned, towards halving the gap in child mortality. The most recent data showed that by 2016 that gap had shrunk by 32 per cent, which is an excellent outcome. The goal of achieving 95 per cent enrolment of Indigenous four-year-olds in early childhood education by 2025 is also on track. That rate is now at 91 per cent. Halving the gap in year 12 attainment by 2020 is on track. That gap has shrunk to 23.8 per cent. None of those gaps, despite the progress, mean that we should rest on our laurels, of course. We should not be satisfied until there is complete equity in all of these goals.


The very disturbing part of the Closing the gap report is seeing the consistent failure that we have had in the remaining targets. They are, of course, really critical targets around literacy and numeracy and closing the gap on employment. We've seen Indigenous unemployment rise. We are not closing the gap there. That is going in exactly the opposite direction to what we want.


We've also seen, regretfully, a sliding back on the life expectancy scale. We had an ambition of closing the gap on life expectancy by 2031, but we are clearly going in the wrong direction on that one. Indeed, Indigenous students are still 10 percentage points behind on school attendance rates in 2018, despite some inroads there. I think it is worth reflecting on what programs are in place around them now and why they are failing. 


I put it to this parliament that the fundamental reason for those failures is that they are not community owned programs. They are not done in genuine partnership with Indigenous communities. I don't know how many times it takes for us to understand. I heard the Prime Minister standing up in parliament the other day repeating on a number of occasions, 'It's not doing things to Aboriginal people, it's doing things with Aboriginal people.' The only way to make that something more than cheap political talk is to start walking the action now. You cannot keep repeating that phrase and think it's going to somehow come true when your actions actually defy what you are saying in parliament.


The only way that we can close the gap on all of these important targets is with a very deep and respectful commitment to do so, but in a genuine partnership with Aboriginal people. I'm sorry that this government's inability to work consistently in a genuine partnership with first-nation peoples is deeply problematic. It is deeply problematic. When you do not have that partnership basis, when these programs are not owned by the communities in which you seek to implement them and when they are not systematically targeted programs delivered in coordinated ways, there is a problem, because all of the evidence tells us that you need each of those ingredients to be in operation in order to have a successful program. We know, for example, health issues cannot be adequately tackled without also addressing a whole range of other very key social and cultural determiners.


So, when this government decides to backflip on a commitment around a national partnership on remote housing agreement, that has profound ramifications for all of the targets that we're trying to achieve here. How on earth do we provide safe housing for children in communities while they are growing up when there are an average of 17 to 23 people living in any given home in a community? How do we expect kids to be able to do their learning at school and come home and do homework? The concept that there would be some quiet space to retreat to at home in order to do some homework is just ludicrous. I think the government's inability to make those connections between the programs that must be community owned, clearly targeted and coordinated carefully, and the outcomes that they desire is very problematic.


The Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, made very clear in his comments around the Closing the gap report in parliament on Monday that, whilst we are very keen to work with the government to deliver better outcomes, this bipartisanship cannot be used as an alibi for inaction by this government. I join with the Leader of the Opposition to say that we wish to work with you to deliver better outcomes, but we are not going to sit by and wait for you guys to catch up. We don't have time for that. So I absolutely applaud Labor's initiatives in taking seriously the Uluru Statement from the Heart and those very real issues that were raised there before us. I am absolutely supportive of the idea of adding some additional targets around incarceration and out-of-home care to the list. I think the compensation packages in the Commonwealth jurisdiction for the stolen generations are critical, with money to the Healing Foundation. All of these are necessary— (Time expired)

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (11:15):  It is both a pleasure and a surprise to follow the member for Newcastle in this debate. It's a pleasure because she is an articulate and passionate advocate for better engagement with Aboriginal people and with Torres Strait Islander people and she is someone who constantly works to put her money where her mouth is, to go out to the community and listen to people. It's a surprise because I would have thought I'd follow a Liberal Party speaker in this debate, but seemingly the Turnbull government has run out of speakers in relation to the Prime Minister's Closing the Gap statement, even though they're in majority government. So I'm a bit surprised to be up next, after the member for Newcastle, but there you have it.


The Closing the Gap statement, of course, cannot be considered in isolation. It must be considered in the context in which it was originally created by then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. As you'll remember, as everyone of a certain age will remember, the entire nation had been moved by the Bringing them home report, brought down in 1997. I certainly remember where I was and how I felt at the time that report was brought down, and on hearing the stories—you almost can't call them stories; it's almost too kind a word for the harrowing accounts of what happened to children, what happened to parents, what happened to families. I was reminded of how that felt recently, on the weekend, when I attended an event organised with Link-Up and with the state of Queensland to acknowledge the 10th anniversary of Prime Minister Rudd's apology. That was an excellent event.


Link-Up is a sterling organisation. It is an organisation that reunifies members of the stolen generations with their families. Sometimes that's very joyous, sometimes they get time with parents they have had no time with before and sometimes it is very sad. Sometimes it's sorry business. Sometimes it's reunification, not with a living parent but with someone who's already passed away, at the graveside. So it's very important work and it's work that must be absolutely endorsed.


At the event held on the weekend with Link-Up and the state of Queensland, the former Prime Minister and member for Griffith, the Hon. Kevin Rudd, spoke in commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the giving of the apology. Many other people spoke at the event as well, but the people who were there I think would have found the most striking speech to have been the one given by an elder, Brian Gray, a member of the stolen generations, who told us what it was like for him as a three-year-old and a four-year-old. He told us of the treatment that he suffered and what that had meant for him as he grew older and grew into an adult. There wasn't a person there who wasn't crying. And there wasn't a person there who didn't want to reach back through time and stop it. But we can't, of course. We can't do that.


We can express the nation's feelings about what happened and we can commit to doing better—and that's what the apology was. The apology was an acknowledgement of pain. The apology was something that brought our nation together and forced us to confront the past. And it forced us to do it in a way that would inspire us to do better, not just in relation to the removal of children—and, of course, that remains a significant issue today—but in relation to all of the measures by which the quality of life of someone who was born Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander in this country can be assessed in a comparative way with everyone else. That's what closing the gap should be about. That's what the Closing the gap report was about, and I wanted to thank Prime Minister Kevin Rudd for what he did and for his leadership.


I made this point when I spoke at the event with Link-Up on the weekend. After the Bringing them home report, there wasn't consensus. The apology wasn't inevitable. It wasn't something that would definitely happen. It was really far from that. Calls for an apology were radical politics back then. We had to march; we had to fight—all of us, with Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islander people leading that, of course, and other members of the community, allies, standing beside them. It seemed impossible that anyone would apologise and that the then Prime Minister was staunchly opposed to a national apology being given. But with the change of government, with the new Prime Minister, what had previously been impossible was done.


Now, 10 years later, it seems as though it was inevitable. It seems as though it was something that was always going to happen, but, of course, it wasn't. It took that leadership from the then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd to bring us together, to unify us. He has many legacies, of course, but one of his greatest legacies, if not the greatest, is that his work, his leadership and the leadership of others with him in the cabinet at the time, have brought us together to commit at least to measuring and to actually asking, 'What's going on?'


There is a saying in business: you don't manage what you don't measure. It's the same for our nation. We have to measure, because it forces us to admit that we're not doing well enough, that we're not meeting the targets that we set, that we're falling short as a nation and that, in doing that, we're letting down our friends, our colleagues and complete strangers. We're letting them down. So it is with this year's Closing the Gap statement. Three measures out of seven are on track. That's better than last year. The reduction in child mortality is on track, the improvement of involvement in early education for Indigenous kids is on track and year 12 attainment is on track. But there are four other measures that aren't, and isn't it terrible that life expectancy is one of those that are not on track and that employment is not on track?


I think it's appropriate to note that the Prime Minister is seeking to review the targets. In doing so, I hope that he will not try to make them less ambitious. We need ambitious targets. As was the case with the apology, some things seem impossible until they're done; then you've done them and you move on. We owe it to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to be ambitious and to have ambitious targets. As the member for Newcastle said so eloquently, we need to think about why we're failing and think about the role of Aboriginal and Islander led organisations, or the lack of them, in our success or otherwise.


Being able to speak a few words in Ngunawal, as the Prime Minister can, is great. What's even better is listening to the words that are spoken to us by Aboriginal and Islander people. It's not enough, as the member for Newcastle said, to recite the proposition that we will do things with Aboriginal people, not to them. That's not enough. We have to walk that talk.


The Uluru Statement from the Heart was too readily dismissed by this Prime Minister and this government. If we're serious, and we should be, because we have to be, then respect should be paid to the Statement from the Heart. We should acknowledge the importance of truth telling. We should acknowledge that we need a voice to this parliament, a continuous voice to this parliament, so that it's not close the gap speeches once a year but a continuous engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples about what we're doing—about what the parliament is doing and what the executive government is doing. And ultimately we need to come to the view that treaty is something that we can do, that we can have a more mature relationship as a nation and that we can be reconciled in a much fuller sense of the word.


The apology was so crucial. It was such a watershed moment for our nation. It was absolutely fundamental and necessary for healing and for progress. But it's not enough of itself, because we need to continue to push. Let's never stop seeking to make progress, and let's place Aboriginal and Islander led organisations and voices at the centre of the progress that we seek to make.

"Husar, Emma, MP",ALP,2018-02-14,"



Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (11:25):  I acknowledge the traditional owners, the Ngunawal people, of the land on which this speech is given today, and I pay my respect to their elders past, present and emerging, two of whom I had the pleasure of sitting with at breakfast on Monday. In doing so, in acknowledging that this was, is and always will be Aboriginal land, I recommit myself to ending the scourge that is entrenched Aboriginal disadvantage. I commit myself to reducing the high rates of incarceration of young people, so that it is not the case that if you are young and Aboriginal you are more likely to be in jail than you are to graduate from university. I recommit myself to reducing the numbers of children in out-of-home care—away from their families, culture and community—which have doubled in the last 10 years since the apology to the stolen generation was given. I commit myself to reducing the alarmingly high rate of family violence in Aboriginal communities, which is 32 times higher for Aboriginal women. I commit myself to closing the gap. It is a reminder to all of us that each of us has a role to play in closing the gap, and I use my acknowledgment here today to remind and energise each of us to go back to our communities and do something about it. When you say sorry for something, you make a commitment to yourself and to that person or group of people that you will not repeat the mistakes of the past or your wrongdoing. I've raised my children and the children I used to teach in my classrooms like this.


This is how I open all of the addresses I am lucky and privileged to give as the member for Lindsay, as the representative of my community—every speech. In every meeting, in every room where there is a gathering I speak at, those are the words I speak. I feel it's imperative to provide that reminder that this country was well cared for, enriched by the culture and practices of Aboriginal people for some 60,000 years or more, long before colonisation, long before Captain Cook arrived and well before we here making rules about everyone's lives were even born.


I am disgusted, quite frankly, by those who see this as tokenism, by those like the Hills Shire Council in the electorate of the member for Mitchell, Alex Hawke, who have refused to include the acknowledgement at the start of council proceedings, which is at odds with the rest of the Western Sydney councils. It is out of time, out of touch and out of place. Western Sydney, where his electorate lies, also happens to have some of the highest numbers of Aboriginal people in an urban setting.


I am proud, though, of my local Penrith council for how they acknowledged and marked the 10th anniversary of the apology on Monday. Penrith's mayor, John Thain, acknowledged that Apology Day is a reminder to everyone to continue:


… to build on lessons from the past and work for better outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the future.


The mayor also acknowledged that the council's ceremony was:


… a powerful reminder that our community's future is shared between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and that our future—


is much brighter, not dampened—


because of it


My local council celebrated the importance of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture and their important contribution to the lands and waters of Penrith city.


This week, when we marked the 10th anniversary of the apology made to Aboriginal people, their families, their communities and their future generations, I was incredibly proud to be there. It was an apology and an acknowledgement of our past—our past mistakes and our past wrongdoings—and of how we as legislators are given the opportunity in here to promote equality for everybody.


Sadly, the Prime Minister was not in attendance. He attended the photo gathering at the front of the Marble Foyer but then he nicked away in a not-so-sneaky sneak off. Unfortunately, it didn't rate as a significant enough event for 'His Honour the Prince of Point Piper', also known as the Prime Minister, to attend. Sure, I get the workloads of this place are demanding. But what is more important than attending an anniversary of an apology that meant so much to so many? After he snuck off from the Closing the Gap event last week, one would have thought he might have taken the hint. It just shows that when you're born to rule learning from your errors is not essential, which is why the apology probably means very little. On further reflection, I am actually glad he didn't come, because the time for paternalism, tokenism and excuses is over. Frankly, that's all we would have heard. 


The leader of this country should have bothered to show up and be accountable on this day to Indigenous people and the rest of us non-Indigenous people who care enough to take up the fight on their behalf. That is our job in this place and that will always be our job in this place. The reality is when it comes to closing the gap, when it comes to actions for First Australians, this government is weak and out of touch. That weakness drips down into the conservative hearts of commentators who don't understand the inaction that not closing the gap is bringing. This inaction—far from dripping into the lives of our first nations people—causes deluges of inequality to rain down on them. The gaps are not closing. The list of targets that are not on track should fill us all with a sense of great shame and regret, because consistently falling short of the benchmarks we've set ourselves is not an outcome. We cannot amplify our limited successes in this place. We need action and we need acknowledgement. 


Would it be such a difficult thing to fly the Aboriginal flag on the top of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, for example? Absolutely not. But would it mean the world of difference to many people in our communities? Absolutely. Would it mean that we as Australians acknowledge that we are a country of not all white Australian settlers and that there were people here before us? Absolutely not. But it would mean a great deal to those people in those communities where that flag means the most. 


We are given two ears to listen and one mouth to speak. Therefore, we should always listen twice as much as we speak. I heard my good friend the member for Griffith in here remarking on the Prime Minister's grasp on the Ngunnawal language and his ability to give his acknowledgement in language from country. But, unfortunately, he doesn't use his two ears to listen as much as he's obviously taken the time to learn that. The Uluru Statement from the Heart would be a perfect instance where the Prime Minister could listen twice as much as he speaks. The response to that from those on the other side of the House—and the lack of listening to the voices of our first nations people—is not good enough. I acknowledge that there are not very many speakers on this report. If this issue is not a priority for the government, then I'm not quite sure what they're busying themselves with at the moment. 


I echo the comments from the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, in the response to the Uluru Statement from the Heart:


… who are we in this parliament to simply reject it out of hand?


As he said:


It's time we worked together to deliver—


We will work together, but we will not wait—


… a voice enshrined in the Constitution; a declaration to be passed by all parliaments—Commonwealth and state—acknowledging the unique place of the first nations in Australian history, their culture and connection; and a Makarrata commission to oversee a process of agreement making and truth telling.


We will deliver a compensation scheme for those people who were removed many, many years ago—not that for any second do any of us on this side believe that that would wipe out any hurt or damage that has been caused. 


These are small steps to addressing the inequality that exists and a small way of going forward to help close some of those gaps. Reconciliation is not just about confronting the past. It's about making sure mistakes are not repeated. As I said, when you say sorry, you mean it and you move forward so that you don't repeat or continue to repeat those mistakes. There is much, much more to be done to close the gap, and every small step to do so is greeted with warm welcomes, providing that those steps are the right ones. I believe that is absolutely on track when we say we should do things with Aboriginal people and not to them. I am not quite sure why the Prime Minister's action on the Uluru statement is at odds with the rhetoric that we keep hearing. 


I am proud to stand up for all people in this House, especially those who don't have the opportunity to do so for themselves. With the work that I have already done in my community around helping to end Aboriginal disadvantage, I will continue to do that, in spite of those who seek to railroad that and ensure that we don't actually address this.

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2018-02-14,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (11:35):  I'm pleased to make a contribution to take note of the Prime Minister's report on closing the gap. I do so recognising what a momentous week it is in this place as we all reflect on our responsibilities as lawmakers to do justice to first-nations people. 


Yesterday, in particular, was a day to think—I was thinking—about the power of politics, what happens in this place and its limitations. It's 10 years since former Prime Minister Rudd apologised. He said sorry. The commemoration of that was fittingly done in the Great Hall. The video that was shown was terribly moving and I, like the previous speaker, the member for Lindsay, have reflected also on this Prime Minister's constant evocation about doing things 'with' rather than 'to'. That video showed the experience of those men who were stolen and had their identities ripped away from them, where people sought to diminish their humanity by referring to them as numbers. They had things done to them by us. 


If we are to discharge our moral obligations to those men, to their descendants and to all first-nations people, we have to continue to acknowledge those injustices and our complicity in them. That's something that struck me in the power of the words spoken by Prime Minister Rudd—beautiful words—and the power of the statement that marked the opening of parliament 10 years ago. I acknowledge also the extraordinary work and commitment to this cause by my friend the member for Jagajaga. We also have to take stock of how far we have to go. Sadly, the Closing the gap report for this year shows how far we have to go. I will turn to that briefly. 


I also wanted to acknowledge some former colleagues of mine. I am very proud to have worked at the law firm Holding Redlich. In the 1990s they acted on behalf of two incredibly brave people, Lorna Cubillo and Peter Gunner, members of the stolen generation in the Northern Territory, in litigation that was unsuccessful, on behalf of all stolen generation members. I want to acknowledge the work of that team of solicitors and their counsel, which includes the now member for Isaacs. They are Michael Schaefer, Andrea Tsalamandris, Mark Champion and Luke Brown in particular. Andrea Tsalamandris—now Her Honour Judge Tsalamandris—told me yesterday that while the litigation was unsuccessful in the court she regarded the apology as completing that journey. That's something I wanted to share with the chamber today. 


I spoke about the power and limitations of actions in this place, of words spoken in this place, and I think that's something we should all reflect on. If we are to talk about doing things with rather than to people, we should accord people respect. Too little respect has been accorded to our first-nations people this week by our Prime Minister. On Monday, at the presentation of the report we are debating now, the Prime Minister left early. He did not attend the gathering in the Great Hall yesterday. He should have attended that gathering. So the Prime Minister can say 'with, not to', but these words are belied by his actions. In particular, they are belied by the government's approach to refresh, in its terms, the Close the Gap Statement of Intent. I think there is room to talk about how the Closing the Gap statement and its targets can be better considered, but we should think about how we do that. The member for Barton has made some very constructive suggestions in that regard.


When we talk about refreshing our approach to closing the gap let's think about what Aboriginal people have been saying about this. I just want to note the comments of Professor Megan Davis, someone who is always worth listening to on these matters, when she referred to the refreshing of the targets as reflecting the aspirations of the government and its policy priorities rather than those of Aboriginal people. I hope the Prime Minister and his minister will reflect on that criticism, and on the need to engage more broadly across the parliament around closing the gap.


On the Closing the Gap targets, I think all of us welcome the progress that we are seeing in three of the seven target areas but, in doing so, we also have to confront the fact that in four of the areas we are falling behind: in school attendance, in literacy and numeracy and in life expectancy, probably most problematically of all. As the member for Barton said, as well as looking to this mechanism to keep us on track—of course, one of the reasons we are not on track is that very significant cuts are inhibiting our progress at a federal level—let's also think about expanding our aspiration, because the Closing the Gap targets are a mechanism by which we can judge our progress towards equity and equality. They're not an end in themselves. It seems to me that to look only at the seven present targets is blinding us to some real imperatives.


I want to put on the record my strong support for two additional targets being looked at: incarceration—the Leader of the Opposition has looked at the injustices facing Aboriginal people, particularly young Aboriginal men, and that's a matter that requires much closer attention in this place—and also out-of-home care. If we are to reflect on the experience of the stolen generation, we cannot turn away from the moral stain that is the increasing number of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care today. I'd encourage all members to reflect on the contribution of the member for Barton in this debate in this regard.


I also want to touch very briefly on some issues that impact the communities that I'm so proud to represent in this place. Melbourne's northern suburbs are home to an increasing number of Aboriginal people and I want to acknowledge the leadership of the council in pushing for reconciliation and support for the Aboriginal communities that make up the City of Whittlesea in that part of my electorate. As I have in previous years, I also want to touch upon the extra ordinary work of Bubup Wilam early childhood centre. The leadership that's shown by Lisa Thorpe, the CEO, and her team is extraordinary. I am so proud of her fearsome advocacy, especially on behalf of young Aboriginal children in Melbourne's northern suburbs, and her determination to ensure that they can overcome intergenerational trauma. We're seeing extraordinary results, thanks to her work and the work of the community that is behind her. Of all the things I'm proud of in my electorate, Bubup Wilam is so dear to my heart.


I also want to acknowledge a conversation I had with another amazing Aboriginal constituent of mine, Marcus Stewart, who came to see me in parliament last week. I know Marcus will make a great impact right across public life. He drew to my attention the work that he is doing around language preservation, as well as work he is doing on behalf of traditional owners generally. In thinking about closing the gap in the wider sense, obviously, culture is so important and so is language. It does mean something that the Prime Minister acknowledges country in language—it matters—but it matters so much more profoundly that we don't allow language to die and with it so much of culture.


I am pleased to make a contribution to this debate. It is a really important debate. It forces all of us to look not only at what we say about our responsibilities towards Aboriginal people but how they can be realised. We have not done enough. We must all recommit ourselves to work hard; not just to use this as an exercise to mark off a date in the parliamentary calendar but as a reminder of the obligation that weighs so heavily on every non-Indigenous Australian to accept that we are responsible for dispossession and that we are responsible with Aboriginal people, with our first nation Australians, for ensuring the gap is closed.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",IND,2018-02-14,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (11:45):  Much has been said in this debate which I'm not going to repeat. My contribution today is to bring to the table some input from the people in Indi—the importance of giving voice, self-determination, supporting leadership and making sure that we actually have accurate data. 


As many colleagues in parliament know, many members of my community come to parliament as part of our Indi volunteer program. Today I'd like to acknowledge three of my volunteers, Catherine, Tracy and Hugh. I would particularly like to acknowledge Catherine, who has provided much of the background for this speech that I'm going to give. I asked Catherine for input and I'll be using her words as I move through. She talks about her leadership, particularly her work with the Wodonga Aboriginal Network. She talks about the need to support young people in leadership and she also talks about the need for accurate data.


So let's start with data. There's general agreement within the Aboriginal community that the population data issued by the ABS significantly underestimates the Aboriginal population living in Albury-Wodonga. The 2016 data reports a combined total of approximately 113,000 people, with the Aboriginal population making up 2.6 per cent, or around 3,000 people, whereas anecdotal evidence from the community suggests there are about 4,000 people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background living in Albury-Wodonga. The significance of this is that the allocation of funds is based on population data, and our numbers are way short of what the reality is. So we really need to look at that. 


I want to speak now in Catherine's words. I asked her to help me with my speech today. I asked her to introduce herself. As I move through I'll be using the personal pronoun 'I', as in Catherine's voice. 'So who am I? I am a proud Gunditjmara woman, a descendant of Susannah McDonald from the Lake Condah area of south-western Victoria. I've grown up and lived most of my life in the Wodonga Aboriginal community. I'd like to also acknowledge my father's English-Irish heritage and I believe having contributions from both worlds has provided me with the difficulties and challenges that living in both worlds can present. 


'I, along with my sisters, Jacqueline, Lucy and Mary, attended local primary schools and high schools before studying a Bachelor of Behavioural Science, Psychology, at La Trobe University in Wodonga. I continued my education by completing a postgraduate Diploma of Psychology with Central Queensland University via distance education. I was employed with the Department of Human Services for over 10 years, before becoming a senior planner with the National Disability Insurance Scheme in July 2017.' 


Catherine is still currently living in Wodonga with her husband, Ash, and her twin daughters, Charlotte and Maya. That is no small beginning in life. Catherine says she attributes her strong cultural connection to her mother, Aunty Judith Ahmat, a respected Aboriginal elder within the Wodonga community, and she's inspired by other local Aboriginal people, including Darren Moffitt, Aunty Liz Heta, Tammy Campbell and the local Koori young people she's connected with. She says, 'I have watched and listen to mum and influential aunties sitting around my kitchen table as we discuss local issues for as long as I can remember. I have a strong desire to fuel change, reduce racism, increase self-determination and close the gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people.' Catherine is currently on the board of Albury-Wodonga Aboriginal Health Services. She's a 2017 recipient of the Fellow of Indigenous Leadership, emerging leader, and she's current chairperson of the Wodonga Aboriginal Network.


I'd like briefly to talk of the Wodonga Aboriginal Network. It's one of 39 local Aboriginal networks operating in Victoria, made up of community volunteers. The network is a fantastic way to bring Aboriginal people together from many different nations within Australia. They are a strong and diverse community. The networks' participants support each other in a safe environment and they assist individuals and organisations to connect, share, learn and lead to improve outcomes for Aboriginal people. The network promotes self-determination and helps local people determine local priorities and develop local solutions. What a fantastic resource that is to a member of parliament.


The local network's current community plan has four main goals. These include reviving the Burraja Indigenous Cultural and Environmental Discovery Centre, supporting opportunities for young Aboriginal people, cross-border cooperation between Albury and Wodonga, and vice versa, and collaborating with other local Aboriginal networks to assist in progressing initiatives and programs at the regional level.


I'd like to speak briefly about some of these programs. The Burraja youth program is for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people between the ages of 10 and 15. It's designed to connect Koori young people to cultural local services and community, and to improve cultural identity. Over the last six months, the youth program has had 67 students enrolled over five programs, and has delivered 120 activities to participants. It's really working well and I'd like to acknowledge the committee: the co-chairpeople, Walter Melrose and Valda Murray; Liz Heta, who is the treasurer; Tammy Campbell, the secretary; and Mark Cottee as a mentor. I want to thank them for their work, and particularly Uncle Alan Murray and Brendan Kennedy for their work. The program is auspiced by Gateway Health Wodonga.


There are a number of other projects done by the Wodonga Aboriginal Network in partnership with the City of Wodonga and the Koori Youth Council. In 2016 they hosted the first Victorian BLACKOUT youth event. Yarning sessions were held to address three main topics: the need for stronger cultural connection, issues with drug and alcohol and the need for youth activities. As a direct result, the Wodonga Koori Youth Network was established. It works with young people living in Wodonga, supporting them to do the work that they need to do. Fantastic work!


Another work is the Mara Healing Possum Skin program. I think you'll love this one, Madam Deputy Speaker Wicks! The aim of the Mara Healing Possum Skin pilot program is for families who have a family member diagnosed with a terminal illness to work through the grief they're experiencing when they have that diagnosis. A pilot workshop was held in 2017, and 21 community members participated. A possum skin sash was made up to help the family during their sorry business and for future ceremonies. We're currently seeking funding to take this project much wider. It's so powerful, and the little pieces that were made are now being put into a quilt which is going to be held in the Aboriginal Health Service. It's great work.


I'm conscious that my time to speak is running out and I want to use some more of Catherine's words. I asked her what her future vision is for the Albury-Wodonga Aboriginal community. She said: 'I have strong responsibility and obligation to ensure our culture is honoured with authenticity, and the Aboriginal communities across Indi are sustained with strong, recognised leaders. The key to this is to strengthen our families to ensure healthy communities.' Catherine's vision for the future includes a rise in self-determination and a decrease in racism.


She said, 'Self-determination is the key for us to make our own decisions about our needs and taking ownership of our own culture and future.' She said that, historically, this right has been taken away and that, as a result, her people have suffered greatly. She said, 'In order for self-determination to be fully effective, further development of skills needs to be implemented to assist with strong governance and decision-making.' How right she is.


She said that the young Aboriginal people in her community have a significant role to play in leading self-determination into the future. And, therefore, it is important to provide the new generation of emerging leaders with the skills and knowledge required to ensure her people succeed in moving forward. Catherine commits to working towards this goal with the support of the Wodonga Aboriginal Network and community leaders.


So, colleagues, what a strong and powerful call! And how proud I am to say that I am a representative of my Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in north-east Victoria. I'd like to take the opportunity today to acknowledge, honour and thank them for all their work. I'd particularly like to acknowledge their patience and tolerance as they work with non-Indigenous people like me, who come with goodwill but who often need tutoring and care.


I finish my comments like many others today, by making a commitment to work with the leaders in the community, to do everything we can do within my community and within this nation to close the gap. I'd like to particularly acknowledge you and thank you, Catherine, and wish you well in your leadership journey.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2018-02-14,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (11:54):  It gives me great pride to be able to contribute to this discussion today. We saw earlier in the week the report to the parliament on the Closing the Gap targets and we heard eminent speeches from the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. We had a breakfast which, sadly, the Prime Minister failed to stay for and we had a wonderful opportunity just yesterday to see a great show of unity around the stolen generations—again, sadly, the Prime Minister wasn't present. I think that's indicative of some of the issues we're confronting here.


The Closing the Gap targets are to: close the gap in life expectancy by 2031, halve the gap in child mortality by 2018, have 95 per cent of all Indigenous four-year-olds enrolled in early childhood education by 2025, close the gap in school attendance by the end of 2018, halve the gap in reading and numeracy for Indigenous students by 2018, halve the gap in year 12 attainment by 2020 and halve the gap in employment by 2018. We know from the report that three of these targets are on track, which is a really good-news story. The target to halve child mortality is back on track. It had previously been on track and last year it fell off track, but, from 1998 to 2016, there's been a 32 per cent reduction in the gap in child mortality rates, and we are on track to halve those mortality rates by the end of this year. That's an important outcome. I want to pay tribute to all of those who are involved in that, particularly those involved in the primary healthcare networks across this country—most importantly, Aboriginal community controlled health organisations, who are a beacon as to what can be done when you work with local communities in addressing issues in those communities, including working on prevention.


The other targets, as we know, were commented on extensively by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. The opposition has been proposing for some time now that there be an initial target around the question of justice. Sadly, this is yet to be picked up, but we understand that, as a result of the refresh of the Closing the Gap targets which is currently under way, it is very likely—we hope—that this target will be picked up, potentially along with others, but we are, most importantly, concerned that we address this justice target. As the Leader of the Opposition said in his contribution to this debate:


I think most Australians would be surprised to learn that, in 1997, 20 per cent of the children in out-of-home care were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, but today it is 35 per cent and growing.


And he asked the question, 'How can this be?'—a relevant question to be asked. He went on to note the relationship between broken communities and the justice system, and he said:


It's why Labor has listened to First Australians and long called for justice targets to reduce incarceration rates and improve community safety.


I think that's a very important message to all of us.


A number of issues were raised this week in the debate around Closing the Gap, not all of which have addressed the Closing the Gap targets directly, but what I want to do is concentrate for a moment on some of the issues which are outside of the Closing the Gap targets but which are fundamental if we're ever to reach those targets. They are related to the social determinants of health in particular but also of other outcomes. How do we expect to have a healthy young child if we don't have adequate housing? I think it's a question which all health economists and those involved in prevention appreciate. Those addressing the highest rates of rheumatic heart disease in the world, which are in this country, understand that, if we don't address the housing problem, we're not going to address the health problems; and, if we don't address the health problems, we won't get the educational outcomes we're after. It is very simple, in my view.


Yet this week, we've had confirmed that this Prime Minister and his government have said that they will not renew the Commonwealth's commitment to the remote housing agreement. In the case of the Northern Territory, instead of matching the $1.1 billion stumped up by the Northern Territory government for the next 10 years, they are prepared to provide funding for two years only, transitioning out of supporting the Northern Territory community in the provision of remote area housing. In the case of Queensland and the other jurisdictions, they've said that the end of June this year will be the end of their relationship in terms of investment in those states for remote-area housing. That raises a very serious question about whether we will ever address all of those comprehensive Closing the Gap targets, because if we don't improve the housing outcomes for Aboriginal people in remote Australia we will not meet those targets. It's plain and simple. 


The government says, 'We're concerned this is a state problem.' It is not a state problem. It's a national problem, and we as a parliament and as a country are embarrassed by the fact that this government has chosen to withdraw its support from the most needy community in the world—almost—in the context of housing and the prevention of diseases like rheumatic fever. If we don't provide support, we're going to see a continuing escalation of rheumatic heart disease, a continuing escalation of diabetes and renal failure, and a continuing escalation in the other health issues that confront Aboriginal people who live in remote parts of this country on a daily basis. You don't have to be Einstein to work this out. Most informed people in the community would be able to tell you that this is the inevitable outcome of the failure of the government to agree to be involved in that discussion. 


Then we had what I think is probably one of the sorriest moments of this week: seeing the Prime Minister stand up in the parliament yesterday and reject, out of hand, the concept of a national voice emanating out of the Uluru statement. 



An honourable member:  His view.




Mr SNOWDON:
  As my colleague reminds me, that is his view. But it's not a view which can be readily accepted, because what he's tried to do is say that, somehow or other, Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islander Australians are saying to the rest of us that they want an extra chamber of the parliament solely for them. That's what he's implying, and that is just plain wrong. What they are saying is that they want an advisory body to the government. We had one of these in the past. It was called ATSIC. It was shot down in flames by the Howard government—one of the first acts of the Howard government was to get rid of ATSIC. There were issues around ATSIC, there is no question about that, but it didn't need to be abolished—reformed, yes; abolished, no. Instead of working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around the country, what the Howard government did is what this government is doing, which is to say, 'We're not prepared to listen.' What they should be doing is sitting down with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and listening to what they are actually saying, as opposed to what the Prime Minister thinks they're saying. 


It is not beyond the wit and wisdom of us in this parliament, as a national organisation responsible for the governance of this country, to work out with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, by sitting down and listening to them, what a voice to parliament—called something else, if you like—might look like. It could be built on the sort of thing that was proposed in the context of a reformed ATSIC, but it might be something entirely different. The Leader of the Opposition said in his statement to the parliament the other day:


It's time we took the Statement from the Heart into our hearts. It's time we worked together to deliver on its key recommendations: a voice enshrined in the Constitution; a declaration to be passed by all parliaments—Commonwealth and state—acknowledging the unique place of the first nations in Australian history, their culture and connection; and a Makarrata commission to oversee a process of agreement making and truth telling.


He went on to say:


The truth is that the Statement from the Heart calls for what both sides of the House say they are committed to: genuine partnership with, not to; real empowerment; and solutions constructed by first nations people. 


As someone who's been here all but three decades, I say to this government and I say to the Prime Minister: instead of listening to selected voices, it's time you actually sat down and talked to Aboriginal people in a fair dinkum way, listened to what they have to say, understood the messages they're giving and did not interpret them in a way that is politically convenient to you. It's time to act truly and to properly represent the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people across this nation.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2018-02-14,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (12:04):  On Monday morning, I was privileged to attend the Deadly Fun Run, organised by the Indigenous Marathon Foundation's Indigenous Marathon Project to acknowledge Closing the Gap Week. The fun run was organised by Nadine Hunt of Cairns, Elsie Seriat of Thursday Island and Adrian Dodson-Shaw of Broome. Plenty of Canberra and Queanbeyan Deadly Runners showed up, including Cara Smith from last year's Indigenous Marathon Project squad. Cara is now leading a beginning running group in Queanbeyan which has proved extremely popular with local women and children who are looking after their own health and supporting Cara in her attempt to run the Berlin marathon in September. We were joined by Minister Scullion and Senator Ketter, and it was a pleasure and a privilege to run a lap of the lake with the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten. Other Indigenous runners who attended were 62-year-old Rhonda Woodward, who began running last September and is now aiming to complete her first 10-kilometre in April; 32-year-old Emma Towney, who started running to help deal with mental health issues and hopes to complete her first marathon this year; and William Poi, who has lost over 15 kilograms after joining Canberra Deadly Runners.


I've been a strong supporter of the Indigenous Marathon Project for several years now, since running the New York marathon with the squad in November 2015. I've been proud to wear the Indigenous Marathon Project supporter singlet in the Tokyo, Berlin, London, New York, Sydney, Canberra and Gold Coast marathons, and always feel that donning the IMP supporter singlet makes me run a little faster. It puts a little more energy back in tired legs.


I acknowledge the squad from last year who ran the New York marathon. The 10 runners who completed the race on 5 November 2017 were Luke Reidy of Perth, Zane Sparke of Port Macquarie, TJ Cora of Cairns, Roy Tilmouth of Alice Springs, Scott Cox of Broome, Layne Brown of Warilla, Allirra Winmar of Perth, Natasha Shires of Karratha, Maletta Seriat of Thursday Island and Cara Smith of Queanbeyan. As head coach Adrian Dodson-Shaw said:


I selected these men and women for IMP because I saw in them the qualities of strength and resilience and the ability to lead by example.


I'm so excited for them. They've completed one of the hardest things you can put yourself through. It's very rewarding to see how proud and happy they are.


I recognise, too, the leadership of Rob de Castella, still the Australian marathon record holder with his extraordinary two hours and seven minutes; Lucy Campbell; Nadine Hunt; and Kellie O'Sullivan, who has recently finished up at the Indigenous Marathon Project. I thank them all for the important work that IMP does in order to work on closing the gap.


But, overall, the picture on closing the gap is not a pleasing one. Since the Closing the Gap targets were formed in 2008, there has never been moment in which a majority of those targets were on track. I seek leave to have incorporated into Hansard a table which shows from 2009 to 2018 whether particular targets have been on or off track.

Dr LEIGH:
  I thank the member for Fisher for providing leave on this occasion. This table shows that, for the period in which there were six targets up to 2014, we at best had three of the six targets on track. Since then, since the school attendance target was added in 2014, at best we've had three out of seven targets on track. Last year only one out of seven targets was on track, and that was the target to halve the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 or equivalent attainment rates by 2020. This year, we have three out of seven targets on track, but, as the House will note, the target to halve the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five by 2018 is only just on track, given that it was off track last year.


The target to ensure access to early childhood education for all Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities by 2013 is on track this year, but there was no data available last year. Throughout the period that it has been a target, the target to halve the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians by 2018 has not once been on track. The same is true of the target to close the life expectancy gap within a generation. Either it has not been on track or there was no available data.


So, as a nation, we have performed poorly in closing the gap, and it is only right for Indigenous Australians that we acknowledge this underperformance. The right response to that is not to lower the targets. As the Leader of the Opposition said in speaking to the Deadly fun-runners as we were about to set off on Monday morning, you don't deal with a tough race by moving the finish line a little closer. The marathon is an extraordinary effort, but no marathon runner worth their salt should be saying: 'Well, 42.195 kilometres is a bit tough. I'm feeling the pain in my legs. I think we'll just say 35 kilometres makes a marathon.'



An honourable member:  As much as they would like to.




Dr LEIGH:
  As much as they would like to, as the honourable member notes. As my friend Andrew Dodd likes to note, there's no such thing as a full marathon; there is simply a marathon. There is no such thing as lower Closing the Gap targets; there should only be the Closing the Gap targets.


The member for Lingiari, in addressing the issue of life expectancy in his speech, noted the most recent Indigenous life expectancy figures, published in late 2013, still show a gap of 10.6 years for men and 9.5 years for women. The reduction in the gap between the periods 2005-07 and 2010-12 was only small: 0.8 years for men and 0.1 years for women, suggesting that that gap still remains at about a decade, suggesting Indigenous men and women still die a decade before non-Indigenous men and women—that they enjoy 10 fewer Christmases, 10 fewer birthdays of their friends and family, 10 fewer years on this planet—and that's simply not good enough. Chronic disease remains the leading cause of mortality, with the second-highest leading cause being cancer, of which lung cancer is the leading cause of cancerous death. It is rising and the gap is widening.


The opposition announced that we will put in place a national healing fund, applying to ACT and the Jervis Bay territory. The announcement made by the Leader of the Opposition, along with the member for Barton, Linda Burney, Senator Pat Dodson, Senator Malarndirri McCarthy and the member for Lingiari, Warren Snowdon, was that a Labor government would provide stolen generations survivors in the Jervis Bay territory and the ACT with one-off ex gratia payments of $75,000, and $7,000 for funeral expenses. This is clearly an important announcement for my constituents, as I represent half the ACT and all of Jervis Bay. These are communities of great strength and resilience, with a legacy that is almost unimaginable to European settlers. We should honour and treasure that legacy, and these payments are an appropriate response to the trauma that was inflicted through the stolen generations.


A national healing fund will be set up to deal with intergenerational trauma caused by childhood dislocations, with a summit held on first nation children. As the Leader of the Opposition noted:


The traumatic effects of forced removal and separation from families, communities and culture have been severe and long-lasting for the Stolen Generations and their descendants.


The fund will be administered by the Healing Foundation—an Indigenous-run organisation that supports the ongoing needs of the Stolen Generations with services such as counselling, family reunion, return to country, and support for elderly survivors.


I have covered a range of topics in this speech, but closing the gap must remain a core focus for any Australian government. It is a vital performance metric, and the Closing the Gap targets must never be weakened.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2018-02-14,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Whitlam) (12:15):  Today we're taking note of the Prime Minister's annual report on the Closing the Gap targets. I'd like to open my contribution by joining with the member for Cunningham in paying tribute to the life of the late Aunty Agnes Donovan. Unfortunately, neither the member for Cunningham nor myself can attend her funeral in Wollongong today because of our parliamentary responsibilities. We send our sincerest condolences to the family and friends of Aunty Agnes. She was a much-loved elder within our community.


She was well respected as a member of the local community in the Shellharbour Aboriginal Community Youth Association, where she served as the chairperson of that organisation for many, many years. She always stood up for what she believed in and dedicated her life to closing the gap for Aboriginal people. In her role as the chair of SACYA, she implemented a range of programs helping disadvantaged Aboriginal families and young people, including the alternative learning centre for disengaged Aboriginal high school students. The aim of that program was to ensure that at-risk kids stayed engaged and stayed at school.


She has been a longstanding member of the Shellharbour Aboriginal Advisory Committee and worked on the council's Aboriginal employment strategy, which included the cultural heritage management assessment toolkit. She also worked with the Bass Point Interpretive Centre working group. She has made a tremendous contribution, not only to the Aboriginal community on the south coast and the Illawarra but to the broader community in our electorates. And we pass on our sincerest condolences to her daughter, Emma, her sons, Todd and PJ, and the many grandchildren that she loved and doted on. We thank you, the family, for sharing your mother, your grandmother, with us.


The Closing the Gap targets were established by the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in 2008. We are 10 years on. In 2018 the report has found that only three of the seven targets are on track to be met. These targets include halving the gap in child mortality rate by 2018, having 95 per cent of all Indigenous four-year-olds enrolled in early childhood education by 2025, and halving the gap in year 2 attainment by 2020. These three targets are on track. Nothing that I say hereafter should take away from the fact that these achievements should be celebrated. It is unequivocally a good thing.


However, if we look at the targets that have not yet been achieved, we still have a lot of work to do. Over the long term, between 1998 and 2016, the Indigenous child mortality rate has declined by 35 per cent. That is a great thing. We've also been narrowing the gap by 32 per cent. Improvements in the key drivers of child and maternal health over the past years suggest that there are significant gains that can be made. I'll have something to say in a moment about addressing the rates of smoking within Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and the benefits that can be gained if we are only able to bring those rates down to the background rates in the general community.


In the area of early childhood education, in 2016, 14,700 Indigenous children or 91 per cent were enrolled in early childhood programs. Again, that is a great thing. We should celebrate that. Nationally, the proportion of Indigenous 20- to-24-year olds who have achieved year 12 or equivalent increased from 47 per cent in 2006 to 65 per cent. The gap has narrowed some 12.6 per cent.


We can pause for a moment and say these are good things, but let's focus on the work that is yet to be done. The target to close the gap in school attendance is not on track. Overall, attendance in 2017 for Indigenous students was 83 per cent compared to 93 per cent for non-Indigenous students—a lot of rhetoric but not a lot of achievement on this important target. The target to halve the gap in reading and numeracy attainments by 2018 is also not on track. The target to halve the gap in employment by 2018 is not on track. Indigenous unemployment has fallen slightly over the decade, but far more needs to be done. In 2016, the Indigenous employment rate was 46 per cent compared to 71 per cent for non-Indigenous Australians. The target to close the gap in life expectancy by 2031 is not on track. Between the periods 2005-07 and 2010-12, there was only a small reduction of only 0.8 years for males and 0.1 years for females.


We don't have to look far to find some of the causes for this. Can I say, in a bipartisan manner, that nobody expected that we were going to make immediate gains in the first one or two or three years of establishing these targets. But that is, indeed, why you set yourself long-term targets and measure them on a year-by-year basis, to ensure that we are making progress. Last week the Closing the Gap campaign released its 10-year review of the Closing the Gap progress. It found that the aim of achieving health parity between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians by 2030 was effectively abandoned after five years—it was effectively abandoned after five years. The report highlighted that the government's $530 million cut to Indigenous affairs and programs in the 2014 budget had a material impact on this nation's ability to meet those objectives.


I said a moment ago that, if we could just focus on one area for a moment to achieve some of those gains, particularly in health outcomes, we could address the smoking rates in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and bring them down to the background rates in the general communities. We know that this is possible if we look at some of the areas where they have achieved this successfully. In the Darug community in Western Sydney, intensive programs invested in over a long term have seen a significant drop in the smoking rates, particularly the maternal smoking rates, in the Aboriginal community in Western Sydney. But, when the government seeks to congratulate itself, as it did this week, for reintroducing an anti-smoking program that it had cut in 2014—it axed an anti-smoking program in 2014 and it now seeks applause for reintroducing that program this year—we cannot do anything but criticise the government for what has been an appalling record in this area. If we want to do something about the life expectancy rates and we want to do something about the low birth-weight rate in infants, this is one program that, if invested in over a long period of time, can make a significant difference.


I want to say one final thing about the relationship between this government and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. I have no doubt that, in his heart, the Prime Minister wants to do the right thing, but, when you commission a process that resulted in the Uluru Statement from the Heart and had significant support right across the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community about a way forward on reconciliation between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and the rest of the country, and you reject that statement out of hand, by way of press release, and do not even have the courage to stand up and explain to the community why you did that, is it any wonder that the community is deeply sceptical of this government's commitment to the project ahead?

Mr GOSLING
 (Solomon) (12:25):  I want to also note the Prime Minister's Closing the Gap report and the Leader of the Opposition's excellent response, in particular the commitment, as we've heard here from other speakers, to have a system of reparations for those members of the Stolen Generation from both the Northern Territory and the ACT, who were the responsibility of the Commonwealth during that period, so that that part of our history is addressed. It is excellent that we've had some progress on some of the targets, as we have already heard. However, I must, by way of representing the Northern Territory, say that we are not on track to close the gap in early childhood education, school attendance, reading and numeracy, employment or life expectancy.


Indigenous children make up close to 80 per cent of the child mortalities in the Northern Territory, making it the worst rate in the country. That sets a bit of a benchmark for priorities in our society. If we have infants dying at such a high rate in those communities, it does speak to the widening gap. It is a real issue in the Northern Territory. In regard to Indigenous school attendance, the rate of Indigenous kids going to school in the Northern Territory fell. In 2014 it was 70 per cent of Indigenous kids going to school, and last year, in 2017, it was down to 66 per cent, so that's fewer Indigenous kids going to school.


Initially, it was encouraging that the Minister for Indigenous Affairs and senator for the NT, Nigel Scullion, said that he would match the NT government's record commitment to funding remote housing. However, after the Prime Minister's intervention, he's had to backflip on that. That is disappointing because housing is such an important enabler of healthy communities, families and lives. Education will improve if housing improves. So in terms of the Commonwealth's commitment, instead of backing away from the Northern Territory, we want to see the federal government step up and do more. Housing and land servicing is important, and I call on the Prime Minister to make a serious commitment in that area.


I also want to mention that the Turnbull government's response to the NT royal commission has, unfortunately, been totally inadequate. The protection and detention of Australia's young people is a national issue and a national responsibility. These are young kids we're talking about. They need and deserve better, especially from the federal government that called the royal commission in the first place.


I'll say this in a spirit of bipartisanship, but the Prime Minister must understand that national leadership includes looking beyond the harbour side view to the broad horizons of our country, and that includes, obviously, the Northern Territory—one-sixth of the Australian landmass. I encourage him to listen to the experts in the field and to show some real commitment so we can see some real progress on the ground in the Northern Territory in relation to these targets.


Debate adjourned.

Ms MADELEINE KING
 (Brand) (12:31):  I rise to speak on the Review of the four major banks (third report) conducted by the House Standing Committee on Economics. I was a member of this committee and participated in two of these reviews. I'd like to thank my colleagues the member for Kingsford Smith and the member for Burt and those members opposite who were part of the committee, and also the secretariat for all of their efforts in conducting not only this review but all the work that the House Standing Committee on Economics undertakes.


I also participated in briefings with the Reserve Bank Governor, Dr Philip Lowe, and in hearings with Dr Lowe and his very able team: Dr Guy Debelle, Deputy Governor; Dr Luci Ellis, Assistant Governor (Economics); and Ms Michelle Bullock, Assistant Governor (Financial System); among others. The Reserve Bank is a very important institution providing central bank services, and is a touchstone of the Australian economy. The RBA performs this work ably and professionally, and I thank the Reserve Bank and all of their staff for all of their efforts.


As a member of the economics committee, I also had the entirely unedifying experience of witnessing government members attack industry super funds in public hearings with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and ASIC. It was staggering to see the government attack those superannuation funds, which have been the best-performing super funds in the country over decades. Industry super funds are respected, trusted and embraced by their members because of their exceptional and consistent performance. They deliver lower administration fees and higher returns, as well as delivering the best value for money for Australian workers and their hard-earned money, which will support them in their retirement. This is what the government wants to attack. By virtue of my former employment for over a decade at a university, I'm a member of an industry super fund—UniSuper. Like most members of industry super funds, I'm very happy. Returns are good and management is excellent. This is what the government wants to attack.


With regards to the review of the four major banks, it was remarkable to witness this government dig their heels in, oppose the royal commission and get down to the business of protecting their powerful friends in the banks. This government, ridiculously, said that this review would sufficiently address any and all concerns held by victims of malpractice in the banking sector and lead to a more open and transparent culture in what has fast become one of the most scandal-ridden industries in Australia. As a member of the standing committee reviewing the four major banks, and after participating in the second and third hearings of these reviews, it was clear this was not happening, and it just highlighted the farcical nature of the whole process.


This is reflected in the dissenting report from Labor members of the committee—the member for Kingsford Smith, the member for Burt and me—that shows just how much we disagreed with the whole thing from the outset, and just how imbalanced the whole process was in the economics committee. It was dominated by government members who are utterly out of touch with the victims of bad behaviour by the banks—they are either out of touch or they are hamstrung by their party. Members had 10 to 20 minutes only to question the most powerful business executives in this country, to assess and to try and work through myriad of issues in what is a complex and highly secretive industry. It was clearly not enough, and this was evident throughout every hearing and every question that was asked.


Finally, Labor has dragged the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to a royal commission. We have consistently called for a royal commission, but it took a letter from the old mates at the banks to bring it on. But even now it seems it won't go far enough, and there are already glaring holes in the submissions process, not least of all the lack of information about how the commission will allow for public submissions, given that everyday Australians are the most affected by this. And I must congratulate the ACTU for setting up a website very quickly to collect individual stories of the victims. This Liberal royal commission already echoes all the fatal weaknesses of the review that has preceded it—padding up the banks and preparing them for a soft landing. Make no mistake: the big four knew that this was coming, and the last 12 months has been an exercise in preparation and anticipation of the day they knew would come. I even asked each executive during the hearing if, in fact, they knew a royal commission was inevitable. I was given a mix of responses, including one from Mr Ian Narev, formerly of CBA, who said:


If there were to be any other forums—in parliament, royal commissions or whatever they might be—we would be prepared to come and do what we do here, which is talk about what we're doing and talk about what we can do better.


There's a lot they can do better. I received a similar response from Ms Catherine Livingstone, the Chair of the CBA, when asking about preparations in the boardroom. She said:


I think the conversation around the board is on the extent of the regulatory environment and also the intersection with community expectations … 


Communication expectations? I bet the community didn't expect the CBA to facilitate money laundering by criminal gangs right around this country.


The letter produced to the Prime Minister only a few months later from the big four banks only confirmed my suspicions and, frankly, the very obvious fact that these banks have been preparing for a royal commission for some time. They had got their ducks in a row, preparing the terms of reference. All these circumstances serve to undermine a royal commission before it has even started.


These banks need a royal commission to re-establish accountability and public confidence. That much is true and that much they admit. The most profitable industry in Australia is also the most scandalous with the largest of these corporate scandals currently playing out in the Australian courtrooms with the CBA under money laundering allegations from AUSTRAC to the tune of some $600 million. Other allegations include: failure to report transactions of $10,000 or more on some 53,000 occasions in three years; failure to calculate interest on offset accounts for home loans; 8,600 customers receiving poor financial advice over nine years; allegations of unpaid super to part-time employees; inadequate systems and controls for inappropriate conduct as identified by ASIC; ongoing fees when not providing a service to customers; misappropriation of funds from clients; and exorbitant ATM fees. These are just some of the allegations engulfing the sector as set out in the Labor report. I could go on and on.


In the first two reports, Labor members made one recommendation only, that the government:


… take responsibility, stop defending the banks and establish the systematic, thorough and transparent investigation that only a Royal Commission can provide.


Unlike the recommendations made by the government members on the committee, which have largely been ignored, Labor's single recommendation, a royal commission, has been adopted by the government. This is clearly a vote of confidence in the Labor opposition, and I thank the government for its support. Sadly, yet surprisingly, it is a half-hearted, insipid and lacklustre attempt at holding this bank industry to account. As it stands, it is unlikely to restore public confidence in institutions which are at the centre of the Australian economy and which should have treated Australians with greater respect than they have.


In the third report on the banks review by Labor members, we've recommended to the government that, if this royal commission is to go ahead, it must appoint more commissioners to deal with the royal commission's workload and extend the terms of reference of the royal commission to include the matters that Labor has been calling for. These include: looking at the culture of the banks and executive remuneration; consultation with banking victims groups; protection for whistleblowers; regulation or oversight and the overall regulatory architecture of the banking system; and the conduct of liquidators where this relates to the financial services sector Finally, Labor recommends removing the term:


And, the Commission may choose not to inquire into certain matters otherwise within the scope of this Inquiry, but any such decision will be the Commission’s, alone.


That's the get-out-of-jail-free card for the banks. Then and only then is it possible that this royal commission can retain some semblance of propriety, due process and validity to combat the rising tide of malpractice and malfeasance of the four major banks in this country.


Once again, I'd like to thank the secretariat of the House Standing Committee on Economics for the extraordinary work they do and for the preparation they do to help all members of the committee in preparing for all the reviews that we do. And thank you very much for the support of members who were on the committee with me. I thank the House.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2018-02-14,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (12:40):  I'm pleased to rise and to have the opportunity to speak on our—the House Standing Committee on Economics—ongoing inquiry into the banks.


One thing I'd like to comment on about the royal commission that's been called is that I have some concern that many members of the Labor Party have given false hope to many people who will try to appear before the royal commission—that they think they can get some compensation. The entire problem, or the vast amount of problems that we've seen in the banking sector, is simply that our legal system does not give the victim of banking malpractice a fair crack. That is the fundamental problem. Someone who is in a business circumstance and who has a dispute with their bank simply does not have true access to justice because of the high legal costs.


That's why the most important thing that the coalition is doing is establishing a tribunal that will level the playing field somewhat. That will give an opportunity to someone who feels or believes that their bank has engaged in unconscionable, or misleading or deceptive conduct, or has broken some contractual term of their arrangement, to take their dispute to a tribunal and to have that dispute heard without undue cost to them. That is what will solve the problem. I'm sure that, when the royal commission finally hands down their report, that will be one of the strong recommendations they'll make.


But, just getting back to some of the last bank inquiry hearings, one of the things I have great concern about is that the banks have engaged in a form of political correctness to try to shadow away many of the things they've been doing. I will go to a couple of examples. Firstly, it's the National Australia Bank and the testimony of their CEO, Mr Thorburn. I asked him a question:


… you put out a press release in 2015 saying that you weren't going to loan any funds to the Carmichael coalmine. At that time, had you been approached for any loans for that project?



Mr Thorburn: I don't think so …


I continued:


… but you put out a press release saying that you wouldn't loan them the funds.


What we had there was the situation where one of the large banks put out a press release that they were not lending money to a certain project when they'd never even been approached. Now, that has to do commercial damage to that project. This is a foreign investor that comes into our country, that has already spent billions of dollars and that is already employing hundreds of Australians in real jobs, and we have one of the big banks issuing a press release saying they are not going to lend to them, which damages their commercial reputation, yet without that investor even approaching that bank. I don't think that conduct is good enough and I don't think it's responsible, given the significant reliance that our nation has on foreign investment. That was the National Australia Bank.


And they continued. Before Christmas, they put out what I can only describe as an 'ecopopulist voodoo statement', where they said they would no longer finance any new thermal coal mining projects. Surely, it's the banks' responsibility to weigh up the commercial viability of someone who approaches them for a loan and to make a decision on that basis? The banks should not be making a decision on what is politically correct at a certain period in time. The banks may well argue, 'There's no extra demand for thermal coal.' But, last year, we saw thermal coal prices up by over one-third. We saw our exports of thermal coal to Japan jump 50 per cent. We saw China's consumption of coal up 5.2 per cent. We've seen the International Energy Agency forecast that the demand for coal will increase between 2016 and 2022 by 300 million tonnes. We only export 200 million tonnes of thermal coal from Australia, and the International Energy Agency says that demand will increase by 300 million tonnes.


Industry experts are talking about the prospects for thermal coal. MineLife's Gavin Wendt said:


There is a very healthy price outlook for thermal coal.


The New Hope Group chief executive said:


We're seeing strong demand for higher quality Australian thermal coal in Asia, and that is what's driving the price.


It goes on and on. There is simply no reason, other than trying to appease a politically correct attitude in this nation, that the National Bank would put out such a statement. This shows, above all, why it is a very good thing to have a royal commission in this nation


And it didn't stop there. In the press release the National Bank put out they went on to say:



An orderly approach to the low carbon transition is critical to ensure Australians can continue to have access to secure, reliable and affordable energy and support our economy.



Hang on—'to continue to have access to affordable energy'? Do any of these bank executives actually open their electricity bills? Do any of these bank executives live in South Australia, where they have the highest electricity prices not only in the nation but in the entire world? They put out a press release saying, 'Continue to have access to affordable energy.' This shows that the executives of the National Bank are clearly out of touch with what is happening in the Australian economy. It shows that they are clearly out of touch with the economic needs of our nation going forward. To put out such a statement defies belief and shows why the decision for a royal commission should be supported.


But it didn't finish there. We also had the same thing from the other banks. We had the ANZ make the decision to put out a press release saying that they wouldn't finance a thermal coal station if it had an emissions intensity of over 800 grams per kilowatt hour. How can a bank make such a decision? Surely it has to weigh it up against the economics and the investment parameters rather than setting these artificial limits? It's the same thing with the Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth also put out a statement saying that they, 'wouldn't be loaning any funds and wouldn't consider a loan to the Carmichael coalmine in Queensland'. But, yet again, they had no responses asking them for a loan. How can we have our banks trying to mirror some of this anticoal rhetoric that we see in our community? They're just trying to cover up some of their misdeeds and to create a good feeling about some of their policies.


Our inquiries into the banking sector will continue with a House committee. There are still many issues we need to resolve, but, most importantly, we need to get the tribunal right. We need to ensure that if someone has a dispute with their bank they can take that dispute to a competent tribunal without the risk of being run over by legal costs and time, because that is the current system that we have. When a bank has had a dispute with someone and the person has said, 'I'll take you to the Supreme Court,' the bank would just laugh at them. It is that mismatch of power in our legal system that has caused the problems in our banking sector. I hope that with the policies of this government on our tribunal, and with the input of the royal commission, that this is something we can address so Australian entrepreneurs can go out there, risk their capital and try new business ideas, knowing that if something goes wrong with their bank they have the right to a fair hearing in a dispute.

Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (12:50):  I'd like to thank the member for coal—I mean, the member for Hughes—for being able to make nearly all of his speech about coal while discussing a report from the economics committee's inquiry into banking, and in particular for introducing us to the term 'eco-populist voodoo' economics. That's the quote of the day right there, member for Hughes.



Mr Craig Kelly interjecting—




Mr KEOGH:
  Coming back to the main point about the banking inquiry, which our committee has been dealing with, the genesis of this inquiry—and we have now handed down our third report—was the work of the banks in managing to increase interest rates on Australian consumers out of cycle with the rates being set by the Reserve Bank. One of the critical things that have come out through the work of the economics committee to date has been the high degree of profitability of our banking sector and how much money our banks are making out of the Australian consumer. While many of us are paying for this, critically it is not all of us. In fact, many parts of Australian society do not benefit in superannuation that may flow from those profits in our banks; some of us have but many people haven't. In the meantime, nearly all members of Australian society are paying for those profits through their use of banking. Of course, in the 21st century, it is almost impossible to maintain an existence in Australian society without paying banks interest rates or fees.


At the same time, the committee has had to grapple with a litany of historical and sometimes current scandals in the banking sector. We have the AUSTRAC scandal with the Commonwealth Bank. We've had the subsequent removal of ATM fees by major banks. It would appear they only did that once one moved. They were quite happy to continue to gouge Australian consumers for as long as possible. We've had the ongoing bank bill swap rate saga, where a number of banks have settled but there was litigation recently commenced by ASIC against the Commonwealth Bank. And of course we now have the government's announcement of the clayton's royal commission into banking.


The Commonwealth Bank, which seems to have been the focus of so much of this scandal, is not alone. Westpac have been accused of having the highest interest rates on their liar loans, which is not surprising after the ABC's Four Corners program found that lending staff were expected to complete between six and nine home loan requests per week. If targets were exceeded, staff could earn bonuses of $6,000 a quarter, but current and former bank staff said that if they didn't meet the lending targets, they were performance-managed out of the bank.


Last year ANZ paid over $43 million of an estimated total of over $52 million in compensation for failing to provide general or personal financial advice to customers whilst charging them ongoing advice fees regardless. ASIC has also banned a number of financial advisers, including from millennium3 Financial Services, after it was discovered it that it was ultimately owned by ANZ Bank. The NAB has also paid $25 million in compensation to victims of dodgy financial advice. A number of NAB advisers have also been banned by ASIC, including former financial planner Patrick Mitchell, who was later sentenced to eight years in jail.


The member for Hughes has referred to the government's proposal, now with legislation going through the parliament, for a financial complaints tribunal, trying to bring together some of the disparate tribunals in this sector. But it is not in any way a panacea to the issues we are seeing in the banking sector, nor is it able to help consumers. At the end of the day, 'tribunal' is a misnomer for this body. It is not in any way going to have independence from the sector. It's paid for by the sector, it's set up by the sector and it doesn't have force of law. It is effectively a contractual body, and that is a fundamental failing in the regulatory regime that we have in Australia.


As the Productivity Commission has very recently pointed out, there are also significant gaps in the regulation of the Australian financial services sector. You can't fix the banks, in particular the culture of the banking sector, without making sure our regulatory regime creates the proper environment. This is particularly important when we realise that the financial service regulator and the financial regulation environment in Australia have been expressly excluded from the terms of reference of the banking royal commission. In that regard, as in so many ways, the government's response to the issues we're finding in the banking sector through the inquiries being conducted by the economics committee and many other bodies is entirely inadequate.


The government has proceeded with the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, the BEAR, which I should point out was actually a Labor recommendation from this committee. However, what the government has put forward is much more teddy bear than grizzly bear, because, unlike the UK scheme which it is based on, the Australian regime only looks at the issue of prudential regulation, having vested administration of this regime with APRA. Of course, all of the scandals I mentioned before and many others have primarily been consumer facing. The consumer regulator, ASIC, is not going to be involved in the BEAR regime at all. If you think about it, the mantra 'profit at any cost' that we've seen from the banks is hardly going to cause a prudential problem, so one really wonders what it is that the government was thinking. Or is this again just a bit of paint over the top to make it look like the government is doing something?


In every report that this committee has handed down, the Labor members of the committee have said to the government: 'We must see the establishment of a banking royal commission.' This has been Labor's position for quite some time. The government has resisted this for years, but, finally, having been instructed by the banks that they would like a royal commission and being provided by the banks with terms of reference that they could live with, the government acceded to the calls that the Australian public have made for so long and announced that it will hold a royal commission. Of course, it has announced a royal commission that has a great deal of breadth in its terms of reference yet manages to exclude things like the regulatory environment, but it has also provided the royal commission with only 12 months in which to do its job of covering all of these matters that need to be investigated. We'll have an interim report handed down in September and a final report in December. The royal commission will cover matters which have seen over a dozen inquiries run in this parliament alone into different aspects of the banking sector over a large number of years and yet, remarkably, the government thinks it can wrap all of this up in a royal commission lasting 12 months. My hope is that as this economics committee continues its inquiry into the banking sector we can look at some of the areas that the royal commission is seemingly excluded from going into, areas such as the regulatory regime.


The other big failure of this royal commission so far, which I hope to see it rectify, is that whilst the banks have said that they will allow their employees to breach their contractual confidentiality requirements in providing evidence, which is only fair, given that the law requires that, there is at the moment no method for confidential submissions to be provided to the royal commission. Confidential submissions are quite different from anonymous submissions. Confidential submissions would allow the royal commission to know who has made the submission and to follow up on the information that has been provided to it. We have a large number of players in the banking sector that are not employees of the banks. In particular, there are a large number of consultants, whether they are the big four banking accounting firms or other specialist advisers to the banks. They have information and have positive ideas about how we can improve the banking sector in Australia, but because of the work that they do there is no way that they can put themselves on the record to the royal commission by name. There needs to be a way for them to be able to provide that inside knowledge, that expertise, to this royal commission so that it can look at how we can improve the banking sector here in Australia.


I suppose one thing at least has been achieved out of the inquiries that have been conducted by the economics committee to date. After I pointed out that the CommBank CEO was paid double that of Westpac's, the new CommBank CEO is starting on a much reduced remuneration package. Maybe that reflects that the banks are starting to listen to what the Australian public are telling them: 'You're doing a bad job; you can't keep ripping us off.'

 (Hughes) (12:40):  I'm pleased to rise and to have the opportunity to speak on our—the House Standing Committee on Economics—ongoing inquiry into the banks.


One thing I'd like to comment on about the royal commission that's been called is that I have some concern that many members of the Labor Party have given false hope to many people who will try to appear before the royal commission—that they think they can get some compensation. The entire problem, or the vast amount of problems that we've seen in the banking sector, is simply that our legal system does not give the victim of banking malpractice a fair crack. That is the fundamental problem. Someone who is in a business circumstance and who has a dispute with their bank simply does not have true access to justice because of the high legal costs.


That's why the most important thing that the coalition is doing is establishing a tribunal that will level the playing field somewhat. That will give an opportunity to someone who feels or believes that their bank has engaged in unconscionable, or misleading or deceptive conduct, or has broken some contractual term of their arrangement, to take their dispute to a tribunal and to have that dispute heard without undue cost to them. That is what will solve the problem. I'm sure that, when the royal commission finally hands down their report, that will be one of the strong recommendations they'll make.


But, just getting back to some of the last bank inquiry hearings, one of the things I have great concern about is that the banks have engaged in a form of political correctness to try to shadow away many of the things they've been doing. I will go to a couple of examples. Firstly, it's the National Australia Bank and the testimony of their CEO, Mr Thorburn. I asked him a question:


… you put out a press release in 2015 saying that you weren't going to loan any funds to the Carmichael coalmine. At that time, had you been approached for any loans for that project?



Mr Thorburn: I don't think so …


I continued:


… but you put out a press release saying that you wouldn't loan them the funds.


What we had there was the situation where one of the large banks put out a press release that they were not lending money to a certain project when they'd never even been approached. Now, that has to do commercial damage to that project. This is a foreign investor that comes into our country, that has already spent billions of dollars and that is already employing hundreds of Australians in real jobs, and we have one of the big banks issuing a press release saying they are not going to lend to them, which damages their commercial reputation, yet without that investor even approaching that bank. I don't think that conduct is good enough and I don't think it's responsible, given the significant reliance that our nation has on foreign investment. That was the National Australia Bank.


And they continued. Before Christmas, they put out what I can only describe as an 'ecopopulist voodoo statement', where they said they would no longer finance any new thermal coal mining projects. Surely, it's the banks' responsibility to weigh up the commercial viability of someone who approaches them for a loan and to make a decision on that basis? The banks should not be making a decision on what is politically correct at a certain period in time. The banks may well argue, 'There's no extra demand for thermal coal.' But, last year, we saw thermal coal prices up by over one-third. We saw our exports of thermal coal to Japan jump 50 per cent. We saw China's consumption of coal up 5.2 per cent. We've seen the International Energy Agency forecast that the demand for coal will increase between 2016 and 2022 by 300 million tonnes. We only export 200 million tonnes of thermal coal from Australia, and the International Energy Agency says that demand will increase by 300 million tonnes.


Industry experts are talking about the prospects for thermal coal. MineLife's Gavin Wendt said:


There is a very healthy price outlook for thermal coal.


The New Hope Group chief executive said:


We're seeing strong demand for higher quality Australian thermal coal in Asia, and that is what's driving the price.


It goes on and on. There is simply no reason, other than trying to appease a politically correct attitude in this nation, that the National Bank would put out such a statement. This shows, above all, why it is a very good thing to have a royal commission in this nation


And it didn't stop there. In the press release the National Bank put out they went on to say:



An orderly approach to the low carbon transition is critical to ensure Australians can continue to have access to secure, reliable and affordable energy and support our economy.



Hang on—'to continue to have access to affordable energy'? Do any of these bank executives actually open their electricity bills? Do any of these bank executives live in South Australia, where they have the highest electricity prices not only in the nation but in the entire world? They put out a press release saying, 'Continue to have access to affordable energy.' This shows that the executives of the National Bank are clearly out of touch with what is happening in the Australian economy. It shows that they are clearly out of touch with the economic needs of our nation going forward. To put out such a statement defies belief and shows why the decision for a royal commission should be supported.


But it didn't finish there. We also had the same thing from the other banks. We had the ANZ make the decision to put out a press release saying that they wouldn't finance a thermal coal station if it had an emissions intensity of over 800 grams per kilowatt hour. How can a bank make such a decision? Surely it has to weigh it up against the economics and the investment parameters rather than setting these artificial limits? It's the same thing with the Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth also put out a statement saying that they, 'wouldn't be loaning any funds and wouldn't consider a loan to the Carmichael coalmine in Queensland'. But, yet again, they had no responses asking them for a loan. How can we have our banks trying to mirror some of this anticoal rhetoric that we see in our community? They're just trying to cover up some of their misdeeds and to create a good feeling about some of their policies.


Our inquiries into the banking sector will continue with a House committee. There are still many issues we need to resolve, but, most importantly, we need to get the tribunal right. We need to ensure that if someone has a dispute with their bank they can take that dispute to a competent tribunal without the risk of being run over by legal costs and time, because that is the current system that we have. When a bank has had a dispute with someone and the person has said, 'I'll take you to the Supreme Court,' the bank would just laugh at them. It is that mismatch of power in our legal system that has caused the problems in our banking sector. I hope that with the policies of this government on our tribunal, and with the input of the royal commission, that this is something we can address so Australian entrepreneurs can go out there, risk their capital and try new business ideas, knowing that if something goes wrong with their bank they have the right to a fair hearing in a dispute.

Mr KEOGH
 (Burt) (12:50):  I'd like to thank the member for coal—I mean, the member for Hughes—for being able to make nearly all of his speech about coal while discussing a report from the economics committee's inquiry into banking, and in particular for introducing us to the term 'eco-populist voodoo' economics. That's the quote of the day right there, member for Hughes.



Mr Craig Kelly interjecting—




Mr KEOGH:
  Coming back to the main point about the banking inquiry, which our committee has been dealing with, the genesis of this inquiry—and we have now handed down our third report—was the work of the banks in managing to increase interest rates on Australian consumers out of cycle with the rates being set by the Reserve Bank. One of the critical things that have come out through the work of the economics committee to date has been the high degree of profitability of our banking sector and how much money our banks are making out of the Australian consumer. While many of us are paying for this, critically it is not all of us. In fact, many parts of Australian society do not benefit in superannuation that may flow from those profits in our banks; some of us have but many people haven't. In the meantime, nearly all members of Australian society are paying for those profits through their use of banking. Of course, in the 21st century, it is almost impossible to maintain an existence in Australian society without paying banks interest rates or fees.


At the same time, the committee has had to grapple with a litany of historical and sometimes current scandals in the banking sector. We have the AUSTRAC scandal with the Commonwealth Bank. We've had the subsequent removal of ATM fees by major banks. It would appear they only did that once one moved. They were quite happy to continue to gouge Australian consumers for as long as possible. We've had the ongoing bank bill swap rate saga, where a number of banks have settled but there was litigation recently commenced by ASIC against the Commonwealth Bank. And of course we now have the government's announcement of the clayton's royal commission into banking.


The Commonwealth Bank, which seems to have been the focus of so much of this scandal, is not alone. Westpac have been accused of having the highest interest rates on their liar loans, which is not surprising after the ABC's Four Corners program found that lending staff were expected to complete between six and nine home loan requests per week. If targets were exceeded, staff could earn bonuses of $6,000 a quarter, but current and former bank staff said that if they didn't meet the lending targets, they were performance-managed out of the bank.


Last year ANZ paid over $43 million of an estimated total of over $52 million in compensation for failing to provide general or personal financial advice to customers whilst charging them ongoing advice fees regardless. ASIC has also banned a number of financial advisers, including from millennium3 Financial Services, after it was discovered it that it was ultimately owned by ANZ Bank. The NAB has also paid $25 million in compensation to victims of dodgy financial advice. A number of NAB advisers have also been banned by ASIC, including former financial planner Patrick Mitchell, who was later sentenced to eight years in jail.


The member for Hughes has referred to the government's proposal, now with legislation going through the parliament, for a financial complaints tribunal, trying to bring together some of the disparate tribunals in this sector. But it is not in any way a panacea to the issues we are seeing in the banking sector, nor is it able to help consumers. At the end of the day, 'tribunal' is a misnomer for this body. It is not in any way going to have independence from the sector. It's paid for by the sector, it's set up by the sector and it doesn't have force of law. It is effectively a contractual body, and that is a fundamental failing in the regulatory regime that we have in Australia.


As the Productivity Commission has very recently pointed out, there are also significant gaps in the regulation of the Australian financial services sector. You can't fix the banks, in particular the culture of the banking sector, without making sure our regulatory regime creates the proper environment. This is particularly important when we realise that the financial service regulator and the financial regulation environment in Australia have been expressly excluded from the terms of reference of the banking royal commission. In that regard, as in so many ways, the government's response to the issues we're finding in the banking sector through the inquiries being conducted by the economics committee and many other bodies is entirely inadequate.


The government has proceeded with the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, the BEAR, which I should point out was actually a Labor recommendation from this committee. However, what the government has put forward is much more teddy bear than grizzly bear, because, unlike the UK scheme which it is based on, the Australian regime only looks at the issue of prudential regulation, having vested administration of this regime with APRA. Of course, all of the scandals I mentioned before and many others have primarily been consumer facing. The consumer regulator, ASIC, is not going to be involved in the BEAR regime at all. If you think about it, the mantra 'profit at any cost' that we've seen from the banks is hardly going to cause a prudential problem, so one really wonders what it is that the government was thinking. Or is this again just a bit of paint over the top to make it look like the government is doing something?


In every report that this committee has handed down, the Labor members of the committee have said to the government: 'We must see the establishment of a banking royal commission.' This has been Labor's position for quite some time. The government has resisted this for years, but, finally, having been instructed by the banks that they would like a royal commission and being provided by the banks with terms of reference that they could live with, the government acceded to the calls that the Australian public have made for so long and announced that it will hold a royal commission. Of course, it has announced a royal commission that has a great deal of breadth in its terms of reference yet manages to exclude things like the regulatory environment, but it has also provided the royal commission with only 12 months in which to do its job of covering all of these matters that need to be investigated. We'll have an interim report handed down in September and a final report in December. The royal commission will cover matters which have seen over a dozen inquiries run in this parliament alone into different aspects of the banking sector over a large number of years and yet, remarkably, the government thinks it can wrap all of this up in a royal commission lasting 12 months. My hope is that as this economics committee continues its inquiry into the banking sector we can look at some of the areas that the royal commission is seemingly excluded from going into, areas such as the regulatory regime.


The other big failure of this royal commission so far, which I hope to see it rectify, is that whilst the banks have said that they will allow their employees to breach their contractual confidentiality requirements in providing evidence, which is only fair, given that the law requires that, there is at the moment no method for confidential submissions to be provided to the royal commission. Confidential submissions are quite different from anonymous submissions. Confidential submissions would allow the royal commission to know who has made the submission and to follow up on the information that has been provided to it. We have a large number of players in the banking sector that are not employees of the banks. In particular, there are a large number of consultants, whether they are the big four banking accounting firms or other specialist advisers to the banks. They have information and have positive ideas about how we can improve the banking sector in Australia, but because of the work that they do there is no way that they can put themselves on the record to the royal commission by name. There needs to be a way for them to be able to provide that inside knowledge, that expertise, to this royal commission so that it can look at how we can improve the banking sector here in Australia.


I suppose one thing at least has been achieved out of the inquiries that have been conducted by the economics committee to date. After I pointed out that the CommBank CEO was paid double that of Westpac's, the new CommBank CEO is starting on a much reduced remuneration package. Maybe that reflects that the banks are starting to listen to what the Australian public are telling them: 'You're doing a bad job; you can't keep ripping us off.'

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2018-02-14,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Defence Industry) (16:02):  I would like to comment, albeit briefly, on Ron Walker's passing. Ronald Joseph Walker was a great doyen of the Melbourne establishment, a great Liberal, a businessman and a successful promoter of sport and culture in Melbourne. I first met Ron Walker in about 1989 or 1990 when I was on the federal executive of the Liberal Party as the federal vice-president of the Young Liberal Movement. Of course, the president was Marise Payne, who's now the Minister for Defence, and I'm now the Minister for Defence Industry—we have mirrored each other throughout our careers. Ron Walker was legendary in Melbourne and in Australia but also overseas, particularly in the UK. He was a great promoter. He was an activist, an advocate for his city and his state, a great successful businessman, a self-made man and a spruiker for his home town.


He did more than anyone between 1983 and 1996 to keep the Liberal Party alive as a political force. Over that time, in those 13 years, we had a number of changes of leaders and we lost several elections and we almost won a couple. One of the constant attributes of that period was that the organisation of the Liberal Party was very healthy and maintained its health with federal presidents and federal executives who ensured that we could run campaigns and hold the Hawke and then the Keating government to account. One of the main reasons that that happened was the finances that Ron Walker attracted to the Liberal Party of the time. As we all know, in opposition it's very hard to raise money; it's much easier in government. Without finances for campaigning, you can't really run the kinds of campaigns that the Australian public expect. Much has changed since 1996 in terms of fundraising and disclosure laws et cetera. They are good changes that should have happened. Ron Walker, as the treasurer of the Liberal Party throughout that period, did more than almost anyone else that I can think of to ensure that we had the finances that were necessary. He attracted the largest donation to a political party in the history of the Commonwealth up till that time, which was only surpassed by the donation to the Liberal Party by the current Prime Minister at the last federal election. The donation was from the United Kingdom. He worked very hard in the Thatcher government to convince businesses in Britain that had interests in Australia that having a strong opposition on the non-Labor side and a non-Labor government eventually—the Liberal Party and National Party government of John Howard—was important enough for them to take an interest in Australian politics. That was an achievement all its own. He supported and loved the Australian Liberal Party.


He was a great friend of many of my friends: Andrew Peacock, Michael Kroger, Peter Reith and, particularly, people like Jeff Kennett. These are the people in Victoria who have transformed Melbourne over the nineties, noughties and teens. They have completely transformed the economy of Victoria. They decided that after the Cain-Kirner period, when Victoria was in up pretty bleak place economically, they would change and modernise Melbourne. Melbourne is now the fastest growing of all the capital cities. In fact, on the current projections, it is expected that Melbourne will surpass Sydney and be our largest city in the decades in the future. Of course, in the early part of the 20th century it was the largest city in Australia and one of the largest cities in the British Empire. So Melbourne was transformed by these men, and women like them, who invested in sport, stadiums and competitions. Unfortunately, they stole the grand prix from Adelaide, where the grand prix had been lured, but that's competition and that's what happens. They have done a great job with the grand prix. Many of the great sporting events that we love in Australia, whether it's the AFL grand final or the Australian Open tennis, are placed in Melbourne. They had been of course for a long time, but these gentlemen—people like Ron Walker—made them into blockbuster events, like the Melbourne Cup, that put Australia on the map. They could see the transformative nature of sport, arts and culture. Melbourne therefore owes him a great deal, and Australian politics owes him a great deal. We are the people who get to be elected to parliament, which as we all know is a great privilege and a great honour, and we all work very hard in preselections and then in general elections to get here, but the people behind us are critically important to the health of the polity. Ron Walker was one of those people who contributed very much to the health of Australian politics, whether it's on the Labor Party side or the Liberal Party side.


On a personal level, he was an unfailingly courteous, polite and engaging personality. He was very tall, very imposing, with a tremendous mane of hair. For a young person he was somewhat intimidating, but he defused that because he was unfailingly courteous. He was very generous and very encouraging of young people. He was very encouraging of me. As a Victorian Liberal he would probably be closer to my position on the political spectrum than many others, although you certainly wouldn't have described him as a leftie under any circumstances. But he was very encouraging of young people in the Liberal Party. He saw us very much as the future and that they needed to be nurtured.


He would go to the trouble, which I know is quite old-fashioned these days, of writing handwritten notes to me to congratulate me on speeches or lectures, like the Menzies lecture I gave a few years ago, or even after a performance on Q&A or Insiders. Not necessarily sharing our political viewpoints, Q&A can be quite torrid for Liberal and National members of the government. He would write me short hand-written notes saying he'd watched me the other day and was very impressed. It was a very touching thing for someone to do. I do it myself when I can. It's old-fashioned and there is something very special about it. He did that even when he was very ill.


His last great campaign was against cancer. He was claimed by cancer, but for six years he fought it. I saw him many times during that period, but a couple of times I saw him when he looked very much close to death's door, and I thought, 'Ron's in bad shape.' But he would come back; he would fight back. After six years, sadly, he was finally claimed, and has gone to God.



I do wish his family every condolence. To Barbara, and Candice, Joanna and Campbell: you should be very proud of your husband and father. I, as a friend of Ron, was very proud to be able to call him a friend. He very much encapsulates the final lines of the poem by Tennyson called Ulysses, which is very well known, but I will read it into the Hansard:


Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'


We are not now that strength which in old days


Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;


One equal temper of heroic hearts,


Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will


To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield


I thank the House.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (16:11):  I rise to make a few short comments on this committee report. I might start by congratulating the chair and deputy chair of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs in particular and the remaining members of the committee on their work in reaching a consensus position in relation to their report on family violence in family law proceedings.


This is a deeply important issue, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Buchholz. The former Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia said that, in about 41 per cent of contested family law cases, family violence is a feature. That's 41 per cent of cases in which domestic and family violence is an issue in the proceedings. That means that we have to be very cognisant of the impact of family law proceedings on both the perpetrators and the victims and survivors of family violence. Of course, in the latter category I would include children and former spouses.


The report does a good job of going through a range of the issues that arise in respect of the way that family law proceedings are conducted in the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court of Australia—and the Family Court of Western Australia, for those people who are in the west. It does raise a number of concerns and issues in respect of the way that those proceedings can have an impact on, as I said, victims and survivors on the one hand and perpetrators on the other. But there are a few issues that I particularly want to mention.


Firstly, Labor took to the last election a commitment to introduce a policy, if we were elected, to prevent family violence perpetrators from directly and personally cross-examining their former spouses. Our policy was aimed at allowing judges, at the first mention, to determine whether or not existing options, such as video evidence, would be sufficient to protect victims and alleged victims, and, if not, to determine that family violence perpetrators would be prohibited from personally cross-examining. Our policy recognised that there was an interest in preventing perpetrators from personally cross-examining and, equally, there was an interest in ensuring natural justice by allowing the perpetrator to have, by other means, opportunities to cross-examine. Specifically, we included a policy provision allowing for the appointment of a lawyer for that person and, of course, the appointment of a lawyer for the other party in the proceedings.


This is important because a lawyer's first duty is to the court as an officer of the court. They have ethical responsibilities that they must discharge and they have professional responsibilities that they must discharge, and, in the event they fail to discharge those professional and ethical responsibilities, there are a range of sanctions that can be levied against them. In other words, a lawyer is not to act as a mere mouthpiece for their client; they must conduct themselves ethically and professionally, and, in the event they don't, there can be ramifications for them personally.


We thought this was an important policy and we therefore allocated more than $40 million in additional legal aid funding to allow both parties to be represented legally in that situation. Of course, you wouldn't want a situation where the alleged perpetrator was able to obtain legal assistance but the alleged victim was not; that would be a perverse consequence of this policy.


We took that to the election because the Productivity Commission had called for this back in 2014, because women's legal services had been calling for this measure and because Fair Agenda had been calling for this measure. We were very proud to take it to the election. We called and called and called on the government to introduce cross-examination reform. Unfortunately, the Turnbull government dragged its heels on this very important issue. Ultimately, though, I'm pleased to say that they did announce there would be cross-examination reform to prevent perpetrators from cross-examining victims, But, unfortunately, there was no money attached for additional legal aid, and the discussion paper that the Attorney-General distributed indicated that they weren't sure who would be doing the cross-examining on behalf of the alleged perpetrator. It could be a layperson, it could just be a friend of the perpetrator's asking the exact same questions the perpetrator would be asking and undertaking the same intimidation, revictimisation and retraumatisation that the perpetrator would be doing if they were asking the questions themselves.


We've been very critical of this policy. I'm very pleased that the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs has recognised the importance of ongoing reform of procedures in the Family Court system and the Federal Circuit Court system to seek to prevent the direct personal cross-examination of witnesses by alleged perpetrators of violence against them. I encourage the government, in considering this report, to consider the importance of meaningful protection for victims. That means additional funding for legal aid to make sure that victims and perpetrators can be represented so that everyone can get a fair go, so that no-one is denied natural justice and so that you have someone who is bound by their professional obligations asking the questions in a situation where domestic violence has been alleged.


There are many, many important issues in the report itself, and, as I said, I congratulate the chair and the deputy chair particularly for the bipartisan fashion in which they went about fashioning this report. But there are two other really important issues that I want to flag for the parliament. The first is the importance of reforming the family consultant system. In the family law courts—and I particularly refer here to the Federal Circuit Court of Australia—judges have very heavy workloads. Judges often come in, become a judge and are handed a docket with 300 cases on it. It's also a system where judges don't necessarily have family law experience when they're appointed, but the Federal Circuit Court does the lion's share of the family law litigation in this country. In those circumstances—the intense workload, the different experience of the courts and the fact that the lion's share of the work is done in this particular jurisdiction—it is important to recognise that judges are often under significant pressure. That means that when they have unrepresented litigants in front of them, when they've got a lot of cases on their docket, when they've got a massive directions hearing with people everywhere and when they're trying to get things done in a way that meets targets, they are going to be under a lot of pressure. So what do they tend to turn to? They tend to turn to and reply upon the reports provided by family consultants.


That's why it is absolutely imperative, as a matter of justice and fairness to the parties, that family consultant reports are able to be trusted. At the moment, there is no complaints mechanism if a family consultant conducts themselves in a way that the parties find unsatisfactory. There is a great deal of pressure on family consultants, because the fee schedule for family consultants has not been amended in a very long period of time. At the other end of the scale there are family consultants who charge very high fees privately, which of course gives rise to problems if you are in the position as the wealthier of the two parties in a family law proceeding and you're able to obtain a better quality, more detailed family consultant report.


There are several recommendations in the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee's report that go to professionalising the family consultant role, that go to accreditation and that go to ongoing learning and development in relation to understanding the dynamics of family violence specifically.


I want to very clearly welcome any moves that might be made to give effect to the recommendations that go to the issue of ensuring that everyone in our community, especially both parties and especially the court, can have confidence that the family consultant's report has been developed appropriately, that fair amounts of time have been spent with the parties and that the family consultants themselves understand the dynamics of family violence very well and are up to date with emerging understandings of evidence in respect of family violence and the research work that has been done in respect of the causes of family violence in its manifestations. So, as I say, I particularly welcome the provisions of this report that go to family consultants.


The last point I want to make is that this report does contain a recommendation which encourages the government to revisit the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility. What that presumption does, as was acknowledged in the Time for action report on family violence in 2009, is place the burden on the person least powerful and most vulnerable, the abused partner, to prove that the presumption should not apply, to prove that the abusive partner should not have equally shared parental responsibility.


This should just be a case-by-case assessment by the court. The court should look at each situation, particularly if there's family violence involved, and ask: what's in the best interests of the child? The best interests of the child must primarily be about safety for the child. We have all heard the stories. We had Our Watch in here talking about family violence yesterday. We all know how serious a problem family violence is in this country. This is an important recommendation. I congratulate the bravery of the committee, and particularly the chair and the deputy chair, for including it in the report.

Ms BANKS
 (Chisholm) (16:21):  I rise today to speak about this very important committee report, A better family law system to support and protect those affected by family violence: Recommendations for an accessible, equitable andresponsive family law system which better prioritises safety of those affected by family violence. The scourge of domestic and family violence has far-reaching effects on Australian families. I reflect today on the excellent work done in 2017 by the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, a bipartisan committee, under the leadership of the chair of the committee, the member for Corangamite.


May I take this opportunity to thank all those who made submissions to the inquiry. For victims of family violence, many of whom have had involvement in the family law system, sharing personal traumas and experiences to help others is indeed commendable, and their courage in wanting to contribute to systemic change so that others may be better helped and assisted has had an indelible impact on the inquiry and our subsequent report, so I thank them immensely.


I'm very proud that, in March 2017, the Attorney-General requested that this House of Representatives standing committee inquire into how Australia's family law system can better support and protect those affected by family violence. Many families across Australia access the family law system for assistance and support to resolve the legal issues which arise following a family breakdown, and many of these families have had experience with family violence. It is imperative that adequate support and management is provided to these families to ensure their ongoing safety and wellbeing.


In my early days as a lawyer, I practised family law and saw firsthand that divorces and breakups are inherently serious and complex in any event. But when the element of domestic violence becomes an integral element of that situation—that is, when domestic violence is implicated within the family law proceedings—it often has significant, enduring and devastating consequences for the victims of violence, particularly for young children. Domestic and family violence has a far-reaching effect for those who are experiencing it; it is devastating for the children who are often caught in the situation, as well as for the respective partners.


As the report advocates, it is essential that we have an accessible, equitable and responsive family law system which better prioritises the safety of families and that steps are taken to ameliorate instances where evidence suggests the family law system is not adequately supporting or protecting families which have experienced this violence. In particular, the report raises key concerns identified in evidence provided by the people regarding the current family law system's approach to family violence, including the difficulties posed by an adversarial family law system, the existence of inappropriate responses to reports of family violence, exorbitant legal fees, complex court procedures which reduce the accessibility of the family law system, and the complexity in navigating state, territory and federal jurisdictions. These myriad complexities burden families affected by family violence, and the current design of the system has at times failed to support and protect families affected by family violence. I'm proud that the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee has proposed the exploration of reform for the current system in this context. 


Our committee's report recommends a nationally developed risk assessment tool for use across the family law system and by all professions working within and adjacent to the family law system. We have also called for a stronger, more uniform approach to identifying and responding to family violence in family dispute resolution, using the new nationally consistent risk assessment tool. Another proposal to redress systemic shortcomings is the greater use of legally assisted family dispute resolution for families affected by family violence, thereby reducing the number of cases which proceed to court and have to wait for court dates, which frequently leads to lengthy delays in resolving disputes, with increasingly prohibitive costs. 


As a committee we've recommended significant reforms if and once a matter reaches court, including ensuring that the determination of family violence occurs early in the proceedings, which must be supported by a stronger initial assessment of risk so that the court can make informed decisions regarding parenting and property matters. The committee also makes recommendations for improved case management of family law matters involving family violence, including the adoption of a single point of entry to the federal Family Court so that cases may be appropriately triaged and actively case managed. The committee has also recommended that more uniform rules and procedures are implemented to reduce complexity, as well as stronger referral pathways and penalties for abuse of process—which we know happens far too frequently—perjury and noncompliance with court orders. 


Following the submissions, it is clear in the findings that obtaining an equitable property settlement after the breakdown of a relationship which has involved family violence can become very difficult. The initial divorce proceedings can be quite simple, but the property division can increase and extend the difficulties posed. The report presents evidence that property settlements can provide abusive partners with a new and fresh avenue for abuse and leave families impacted by family violence in significant financial hardship, which overlays the hardships they're already experiencing. In response, the report discusses options for safer, fairer and swifter property settlements, including simplifying the process for superannuation-splitting orders. 


Some families experiencing family violence, such as families from a number of different backgrounds, can face additional barriers when accessing the family law system. Having English as a second language can be prohibitive. Barriers can be faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families, culturally and linguistically diverse families and people with disability. As such, our report recommends that the previous recommendations of the Family Law Council be implemented. 


In addition, the report recommends improving the capacity of family law professionals to respond to family violence so that inconsistencies in capacity do not place families at risk of further harm. So, too, must resources to the family law system be increased to redress a backlog of cases in the federal Family Court system, which is yet another element which elongates the time for the hearing of cases. The committee believes that ongoing support services can provide families with security and safety after a family law matter has been resolved. We have expressed support for specialist domestic violence courts to employ wraparound models of court based support. The committee also recognised the importance of evidence based, evaluated and best-practice behaviour-change programs in the ongoing safety of families which have experienced family violence and has made recommendations for the incorporation and expansion of programs in existing services. 


In conclusion, I thank the former Attorney-General, Mr George Brandis, for requesting that the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee inquire into how Australia's family law system can better support and protect those affected by family violence. As the inquiry has determined, the family law system can be incredibly difficult and prohibitive for victims of family violence to navigate. I'm pleased that our report recommends tangible and, indeed, measurable improvements so that the scourge of family violence may be dealt with through the family law system in a person-focused, timely and efficient manner. I commend the committee's report.

"Husar, Emma, MP",ALP,2018-02-14,"



Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (16:30):  I wish I could be as convinced as the member for Chisholm was in her speech just now about the committee's work and the report. There is something that the government can do immediately about the inconsistencies and the incongruences occurring in the Family Court, which includes up to four years delay for somebody seeking justice through that system. They could appoint the judges that have left that system through retirement or assist those judges who have over 300 cases on their dockets.


The Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs throughout last year had the opportunity to inquire into a better family law system to support and protect those affected by family law. Unfortunately, this is a subject I have an expert lived experience in. Recommendations have been made for an accessible, equitable and responsive family law system which better prioritises the safety for those involved. Many families across Australia access the federal family law for assistance and support to resolve the legal issues which arise following family breakdown, including those impacted by family violence. Family break-up happens all the time. Not all of them land in Family Court. The ones who do are there because they cannot resolve it outside using the usual mechanisms. These are special families who are incredibly vulnerable and need this parliament's and the legislation's full support.


I am well aware and all too familiar with the shortcomings of the family law system. The shortcomings for families who are impacted by this system are far greater than for those who are not. I would go further and say they are not shortcomings; they are absolute, abject failures, and the people they are failing most, and the most grievously, are children. The struggles families face following breakdown are difficult, and the legal system is complex to navigate, but it is even harder when you are marginalised by having family violence as a feature of that breakdown.


The inquiry was about the specific way in which family violence and family law interact with each other. The 6,000 or so pieces of evidence we took throughout this inquiry told the story of how desperately inadequate the system is at serving families affected by family violence. When the chair of this committee, the member for Corangamite, denied the judges of the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court the opportunity to attend a hearing, I was most grievously offended. The people who have the oversight, whose life's work it is, and who spend every single day presiding over this, were not invited. They were invited; then they were uninvited. That is an insult. When family violence is a component of family break-up, separation and divorce, the complexities and difficulties are compounded exponentially. For the committee to be unable to hear from those judges and the two voices who were the most expert on this, you must ask yourself how serious this chair was about actually getting on with looking into the job we were tasked with on behalf of the Attorney-General.


Our current system absolutely needs to change, and addressing the shortcomings with real solutions instead of tinkering and teetering with the versions would be an absolutely great start. The addendum made in this report by Labor members provides a good insight into our feelings on those, and our reservations in supporting this without a caveat.


Families that experience family violence need adequate support and management to be provided to ensure their ongoing safety and their wellbeing is a priority. This doesn't end when they hit the family law courts. And it is not just that they deserve it; we absolutely owe it to them. In this place, we talk about and we say we are aware of the impacts of domestic and family violence, but are we really? At least one woman a week is killed by a current or former partner. It is week seven of 2018, and we've already had to count nine women. When a woman leaves an abusive relationship, the very, very least we can do is to provide a legal system through the family law courts that does not exacerbate the abuse. This is exactly what we are seeing now. The committee have made 33 recommendations; seven of them are needed absolutely right now.


Recommendation 12 focuses on the imbalance created when an unrepresented perpetrator of family violence is legally allowed to stand up in a courtroom and query their victim. I'm aware the government has made an announcement to support ceasing this. The member for Griffith talked ad nauseam about this and we have spoken at length about it on this side. But it's only an announcement and you cannot hang your hat on it or feel warm and fuzzy on the inside over an announcement. An announcement must be followed with action. Victims need help now and I call on this government to move past the announcing and get onto the delivery.


Recommendation 19 talks about the assumption of shared parental responsibility. This is a hangover from the reforms made by former Prime Minister Howard. It's not surprising he didn't seek a woman's opinion on this, because I'm sure, if he had and he'd done some investigation, he would have understood this is absolutely the wrong way of moving forward. These reforms were hastily delivered and create a situation where the perpetrator of domestic violence can use the courts to continue to perpetrate the violence, continue the imbalance of power and use the courts to try and obtain custody from the person they committed domestic violence against.


Who are these people? When you commit domestic violence against the other parent in your relationship, you do harm to the child. In New South Wales, our jurisdiction says that a secondary victim of domestic violence is the child that is in that household. So what right, I ask, does a perpetrator of domestic violence have to rock up to a court and use the legal processes to try and seek a shared equal parental responsibility? They have a right, absolutely, to a relationship with that child, but they also had a responsibility and a duty of care when they were living under that roof and were a perpetrator of domestic violence. We have a law that currently says, 'That's fine; you're entitled to ask for it and to go through that system'—a system which takes up to four years from beginning to end, at exorbitant cost of up to about $30,000 or, in some instances, even more than that.


We also heard about the extraordinary circumstance where, when the child ages another two years, the perpetrator can then ask for the file to be reopened and go back to court, dragging the victim and that child back through the process all over again. I cannot begin to imagine the impact on those children or that victim in being re-traumatised over and over again. So, when we call for shared care not to be presumptive, it needs to be understood what that actually means. It's not some law where we just want to marginalise all these poor perpetrators of domestic violence; it's actually taking into consideration the long-lasting impacts that trauma has on developing brains and young children.


The penalties need to be greater. If you were to commit DV, would you continue to do it if you knew when you were doing it that it actually meant access to your children would be dissolved as well? I don't see it as a penalty; I actually see it as a responsibility and something that we could do to help move to end the cycle of domestic violence. We know violence creates long-term harm and the consequences do not cease once people have exited the family law system or once that perpetrator is removed from the home.


Of the women who fall victim to violence, more than half have children in their care. I say 'women' because we do know that there are more women than men affected by this. It's imperative that these women who land in the family courts are supported. With this in mind, I note recommendation 31, which talks about the disgraceful delays in the Family Court system—delays that, out of all of this, notwithstanding our judicial officers working incredibly hard, are the most important thing to be addressed right now. It is something where, with a very easy pen stroke to put more judges into those positions, we could start addressing some of the backlogs. It is unacceptable that a woman and a four-year-old child could enter a family law system and not exit until that child is in middle primary school. When you are facing these things, you face the prospect of not being able to make decisions about where your child is going to attend school or about who's caring for them medically. That is four years out of a developing child's life. You learn everything that you're going to learn between the ages of nought and seven. If we are subjecting children to this life of instability because Family Court's going to drag on for four years, we are not doing our jobs as parliamentarians and legislators, or good jobs.


Recommendations 27 and 28 talk about better training for judicial officers. Recommendation 8 talks about the abuse of power, which I touched on briefly, and how perpetrators continue to use the system to gain access to their victims and continue the abuse long after the victim has left the family home.


We will await the commission's review and recommendations to allow any reform proposals to be thoroughly considered before they're implemented. I would caution against the use of parent management hearings. During our inquiry, we heard it was on, and then it was off—it was on and it was off. The people who are supposed to be charged with the responsibility of delivering these parent management hearings cannot be sure about who's going to be served by the parent management hearings or who will preside over those parent management hearings.


Before I finish, I'd like to acknowledge the tremendous effort of the committee secretariat, who did an extraordinary amount of work and took on incredibly heavy evidence on behalf of the committee.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2018-02-14,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (16:39):  It's a great privilege to speak on this report by the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs. It would be fair to say that the inquiry process, for many members, was a challenging one. For me as somebody who hasn't had direct experience of the subject matter of the inquiry—family violence and the family law system—parts of it were eye opening, and I think we need to acknowledge that. Some other members, including the previous speaker, the member for Lindsay, have perhaps had closer experience of the subject matter than I have. Nonetheless, it was a good opportunity to cover many of these issues as part of a package of issues that the government is dealing with in the space of family law.


I'd like to start by commending the chair for her leadership and all the other committee members for their participation in the inquiry, and I was privileged to be able to be part of this process of trying to bring the human stories and lived experience of many Australians in the family law system to the fore, to be codified for the record and to be part of a pathway of positive change to improve the system for Australians needing to deal with family law—for victims of domestic and family violence and, in particular, for children. The committee is trying to ensure their best interests are put at the heart of any system. That is the basis on which the report has been put forward. It is also the basis on which the report has been written and the recommendations have been designed. 


We also want to thank, very strongly, those who made submissions, both written and oral, throughout the inquiry. They have been critical in making sure that this report and the recommendations have integrity and making sure those voices are heard, because human stories sit at the heart of the problems that are faced by people in the Family Court. Human stories anchor this report as examples of the experiences we are seeking to address so we can improve the system for the better.


I don't want to labour in too much detail the different recommendations but simply acknowledge that there have been a number of key themes which have resonated with me throughout the inquiry. These include the section outlined in the committee's report that relates to parenting orders being heavily influenced by evidence provided in family reports and prepared by family consultants. It is extremely concerning, as the chair noted, that families are often paying thousands of dollars for these reports which may be written by practitioners who have no formal training in or understanding of family violence or its impact on children. It's critical that the quality and reliability of family reports improve. Something as simple as codification of people's stories to improve the system is clearly at the heart of fixing the system. It shows you how much opportunity there is, through simple procedural improvements, to dramatically improve the current situation faced by many people who experience the family law system.


Recommendation 5 follows on from that. It's about the need for the greater use of mediation or alternative dispute resolution by the Family Court during proceedings to encourage earlier resolution of matters. It came from concerns directly as a consequence of issues around family violence, to make sure that there are alternative avenues to deal with problems so that people do not get caught up in the legalese of the family law system. That means they can focus much more on human outcomes, particularly in removing environments which lead to conflict and focusing on how we can get to a point of resolution in the best interests of families and children. I'm particularly taken by recommendation 11, which says:


The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General works with state and territory counterparts through the Council of Australian Governments to establish a trial in one or more specialist state or territory family violence courts (including reaching agreement in relation to resources, education and court infrastructure) enabling family law issues in family violence cases to be determined by the one court, including expedited pathways for breach and enforcement proceedings. One of the trial courts should ideally be located in an area of high Indigenous population.


Central to a lot of the things we heard throughout this inquiry were the issues that people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds face. In fact, the system does not properly accommodate or recognise diversity and the lived experiences of many people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. That needs to be better recognised and accommodated within the court system if it's to achieve the best interests of the parties involved, and, again, particularly children. That is especially so in the case of the Indigenous population, who, we heard time and time again, have not been fully recognised in respect of how the family law system works. That is something we can do and that we can lead successfully to improve outcomes for every Australian.


Another recommendation that I thought was particularly prescient follow on directly from that, particularly recommendation 24, which also deals with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues. Looking at past reports, it said:


The Committee recommends that, as a matter of urgency, the Australian Government implements the Family Law Council recommendations from both the 2012 Improving the family law system for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients report, and the 2016 Families with complex needs and the intersection of the family law and child protection systems – Final Report, as they relate to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families, including those recommendations addressing—


exactly going to those issues—


community education;


cultural competency;


service collaboration;


culturally diverse workforce;


early assistance and outreach;


legal and non-legal services;


interpreters;


cultural reports;


family group conferences;


participation of elders or respected persons in court hearings; and


consulting with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representatives in the development of any reforms.


In the same context, many similar issues come as a direct consequence of CALD families and the situations that they face.


That particularly leads to a subject that perhaps wasn't given the full attention of this inquiry, not because it wasn't important but because it could have its own inquiry. I think it is very important to address and I would recommend that the committee considers for future discussion the issue of dowry demands. It was covered in section 7 of the report, dealing particularly with the issue of dowries and how they can be used as a form of bride pricing and how they are used as a form of psychological, financial and emotional violence which can undermine the independence of women. They are common in some subcultures of people, particularly from new migrant families. This subject was covered by the inquiry, but it probably justifies further extrapolation. I know there's some work being done by the Victorian government in this space. The use of bride prices or dowries as a way of controlling women is completely unacceptable in our country, and I'm sure you share that sentiment, Deputy Speaker Buchholz. Manjula O'Connor, a constituent of the great electorate of Goldstein, regularly raises with me some of the issues around dowry extortion in migrant communities. She is concerned particularly, that some new arrivals to this country haven't had the opportunity to understand, or haven't had the lived experience to understand, that this practice is not acceptable in our country. There needs to be further work done to make sure that women are not finding a situation where they experience this type of emotional violence and physical violence as a consequence of it but are able to live full and independent lives. Part of the family law system has to recognise where this may be a factor in relationship breakdowns, and that's part of making sure that people can live that full independence.


I recommend the report to the parliament. I congratulate the chair and everybody who participated in it, and I will take the opportunity to acknowledge and congratulate the new chair of the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee, Julia Banks, on her illustrious elevation after the departure of our previous chair, and wish the committee its best work and deliberations into the future.


Debate adjourned.

"Butler, Terri, MP",ALP,2018-02-14,"



Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (16:11):  I rise to make a few short comments on this committee report. I might start by congratulating the chair and deputy chair of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs in particular and the remaining members of the committee on their work in reaching a consensus position in relation to their report on family violence in family law proceedings.


This is a deeply important issue, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Buchholz. The former Chief Justice of the Family Court of Australia said that, in about 41 per cent of contested family law cases, family violence is a feature. That's 41 per cent of cases in which domestic and family violence is an issue in the proceedings. That means that we have to be very cognisant of the impact of family law proceedings on both the perpetrators and the victims and survivors of family violence. Of course, in the latter category I would include children and former spouses.


The report does a good job of going through a range of the issues that arise in respect of the way that family law proceedings are conducted in the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court of Australia—and the Family Court of Western Australia, for those people who are in the west. It does raise a number of concerns and issues in respect of the way that those proceedings can have an impact on, as I said, victims and survivors on the one hand and perpetrators on the other. But there are a few issues that I particularly want to mention.


Firstly, Labor took to the last election a commitment to introduce a policy, if we were elected, to prevent family violence perpetrators from directly and personally cross-examining their former spouses. Our policy was aimed at allowing judges, at the first mention, to determine whether or not existing options, such as video evidence, would be sufficient to protect victims and alleged victims, and, if not, to determine that family violence perpetrators would be prohibited from personally cross-examining. Our policy recognised that there was an interest in preventing perpetrators from personally cross-examining and, equally, there was an interest in ensuring natural justice by allowing the perpetrator to have, by other means, opportunities to cross-examine. Specifically, we included a policy provision allowing for the appointment of a lawyer for that person and, of course, the appointment of a lawyer for the other party in the proceedings.


This is important because a lawyer's first duty is to the court as an officer of the court. They have ethical responsibilities that they must discharge and they have professional responsibilities that they must discharge, and, in the event they fail to discharge those professional and ethical responsibilities, there are a range of sanctions that can be levied against them. In other words, a lawyer is not to act as a mere mouthpiece for their client; they must conduct themselves ethically and professionally, and, in the event they don't, there can be ramifications for them personally.


We thought this was an important policy and we therefore allocated more than $40 million in additional legal aid funding to allow both parties to be represented legally in that situation. Of course, you wouldn't want a situation where the alleged perpetrator was able to obtain legal assistance but the alleged victim was not; that would be a perverse consequence of this policy.


We took that to the election because the Productivity Commission had called for this back in 2014, because women's legal services had been calling for this measure and because Fair Agenda had been calling for this measure. We were very proud to take it to the election. We called and called and called on the government to introduce cross-examination reform. Unfortunately, the Turnbull government dragged its heels on this very important issue. Ultimately, though, I'm pleased to say that they did announce there would be cross-examination reform to prevent perpetrators from cross-examining victims, But, unfortunately, there was no money attached for additional legal aid, and the discussion paper that the Attorney-General distributed indicated that they weren't sure who would be doing the cross-examining on behalf of the alleged perpetrator. It could be a layperson, it could just be a friend of the perpetrator's asking the exact same questions the perpetrator would be asking and undertaking the same intimidation, revictimisation and retraumatisation that the perpetrator would be doing if they were asking the questions themselves.


We've been very critical of this policy. I'm very pleased that the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs has recognised the importance of ongoing reform of procedures in the Family Court system and the Federal Circuit Court system to seek to prevent the direct personal cross-examination of witnesses by alleged perpetrators of violence against them. I encourage the government, in considering this report, to consider the importance of meaningful protection for victims. That means additional funding for legal aid to make sure that victims and perpetrators can be represented so that everyone can get a fair go, so that no-one is denied natural justice and so that you have someone who is bound by their professional obligations asking the questions in a situation where domestic violence has been alleged.


There are many, many important issues in the report itself, and, as I said, I congratulate the chair and the deputy chair particularly for the bipartisan fashion in which they went about fashioning this report. But there are two other really important issues that I want to flag for the parliament. The first is the importance of reforming the family consultant system. In the family law courts—and I particularly refer here to the Federal Circuit Court of Australia—judges have very heavy workloads. Judges often come in, become a judge and are handed a docket with 300 cases on it. It's also a system where judges don't necessarily have family law experience when they're appointed, but the Federal Circuit Court does the lion's share of the family law litigation in this country. In those circumstances—the intense workload, the different experience of the courts and the fact that the lion's share of the work is done in this particular jurisdiction—it is important to recognise that judges are often under significant pressure. That means that when they have unrepresented litigants in front of them, when they've got a lot of cases on their docket, when they've got a massive directions hearing with people everywhere and when they're trying to get things done in a way that meets targets, they are going to be under a lot of pressure. So what do they tend to turn to? They tend to turn to and reply upon the reports provided by family consultants.


That's why it is absolutely imperative, as a matter of justice and fairness to the parties, that family consultant reports are able to be trusted. At the moment, there is no complaints mechanism if a family consultant conducts themselves in a way that the parties find unsatisfactory. There is a great deal of pressure on family consultants, because the fee schedule for family consultants has not been amended in a very long period of time. At the other end of the scale there are family consultants who charge very high fees privately, which of course gives rise to problems if you are in the position as the wealthier of the two parties in a family law proceeding and you're able to obtain a better quality, more detailed family consultant report.


There are several recommendations in the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee's report that go to professionalising the family consultant role, that go to accreditation and that go to ongoing learning and development in relation to understanding the dynamics of family violence specifically.


I want to very clearly welcome any moves that might be made to give effect to the recommendations that go to the issue of ensuring that everyone in our community, especially both parties and especially the court, can have confidence that the family consultant's report has been developed appropriately, that fair amounts of time have been spent with the parties and that the family consultants themselves understand the dynamics of family violence very well and are up to date with emerging understandings of evidence in respect of family violence and the research work that has been done in respect of the causes of family violence in its manifestations. So, as I say, I particularly welcome the provisions of this report that go to family consultants.


The last point I want to make is that this report does contain a recommendation which encourages the government to revisit the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility. What that presumption does, as was acknowledged in the Time for action report on family violence in 2009, is place the burden on the person least powerful and most vulnerable, the abused partner, to prove that the presumption should not apply, to prove that the abusive partner should not have equally shared parental responsibility.


This should just be a case-by-case assessment by the court. The court should look at each situation, particularly if there's family violence involved, and ask: what's in the best interests of the child? The best interests of the child must primarily be about safety for the child. We have all heard the stories. We had Our Watch in here talking about family violence yesterday. We all know how serious a problem family violence is in this country. This is an important recommendation. I congratulate the bravery of the committee, and particularly the chair and the deputy chair, for including it in the report.

"Banks, Julia, MP",LP,2018-02-14,"



Ms BANKS
 (Chisholm) (16:21):  I rise today to speak about this very important committee report, A better family law system to support and protect those affected by family violence: Recommendations for an accessible, equitable andresponsive family law system which better prioritises safety of those affected by family violence. The scourge of domestic and family violence has far-reaching effects on Australian families. I reflect today on the excellent work done in 2017 by the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, a bipartisan committee, under the leadership of the chair of the committee, the member for Corangamite.


May I take this opportunity to thank all those who made submissions to the inquiry. For victims of family violence, many of whom have had involvement in the family law system, sharing personal traumas and experiences to help others is indeed commendable, and their courage in wanting to contribute to systemic change so that others may be better helped and assisted has had an indelible impact on the inquiry and our subsequent report, so I thank them immensely.


I'm very proud that, in March 2017, the Attorney-General requested that this House of Representatives standing committee inquire into how Australia's family law system can better support and protect those affected by family violence. Many families across Australia access the family law system for assistance and support to resolve the legal issues which arise following a family breakdown, and many of these families have had experience with family violence. It is imperative that adequate support and management is provided to these families to ensure their ongoing safety and wellbeing.


In my early days as a lawyer, I practised family law and saw firsthand that divorces and breakups are inherently serious and complex in any event. But when the element of domestic violence becomes an integral element of that situation—that is, when domestic violence is implicated within the family law proceedings—it often has significant, enduring and devastating consequences for the victims of violence, particularly for young children. Domestic and family violence has a far-reaching effect for those who are experiencing it; it is devastating for the children who are often caught in the situation, as well as for the respective partners.


As the report advocates, it is essential that we have an accessible, equitable and responsive family law system which better prioritises the safety of families and that steps are taken to ameliorate instances where evidence suggests the family law system is not adequately supporting or protecting families which have experienced this violence. In particular, the report raises key concerns identified in evidence provided by the people regarding the current family law system's approach to family violence, including the difficulties posed by an adversarial family law system, the existence of inappropriate responses to reports of family violence, exorbitant legal fees, complex court procedures which reduce the accessibility of the family law system, and the complexity in navigating state, territory and federal jurisdictions. These myriad complexities burden families affected by family violence, and the current design of the system has at times failed to support and protect families affected by family violence. I'm proud that the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee has proposed the exploration of reform for the current system in this context. 


Our committee's report recommends a nationally developed risk assessment tool for use across the family law system and by all professions working within and adjacent to the family law system. We have also called for a stronger, more uniform approach to identifying and responding to family violence in family dispute resolution, using the new nationally consistent risk assessment tool. Another proposal to redress systemic shortcomings is the greater use of legally assisted family dispute resolution for families affected by family violence, thereby reducing the number of cases which proceed to court and have to wait for court dates, which frequently leads to lengthy delays in resolving disputes, with increasingly prohibitive costs. 


As a committee we've recommended significant reforms if and once a matter reaches court, including ensuring that the determination of family violence occurs early in the proceedings, which must be supported by a stronger initial assessment of risk so that the court can make informed decisions regarding parenting and property matters. The committee also makes recommendations for improved case management of family law matters involving family violence, including the adoption of a single point of entry to the federal Family Court so that cases may be appropriately triaged and actively case managed. The committee has also recommended that more uniform rules and procedures are implemented to reduce complexity, as well as stronger referral pathways and penalties for abuse of process—which we know happens far too frequently—perjury and noncompliance with court orders. 


Following the submissions, it is clear in the findings that obtaining an equitable property settlement after the breakdown of a relationship which has involved family violence can become very difficult. The initial divorce proceedings can be quite simple, but the property division can increase and extend the difficulties posed. The report presents evidence that property settlements can provide abusive partners with a new and fresh avenue for abuse and leave families impacted by family violence in significant financial hardship, which overlays the hardships they're already experiencing. In response, the report discusses options for safer, fairer and swifter property settlements, including simplifying the process for superannuation-splitting orders. 


Some families experiencing family violence, such as families from a number of different backgrounds, can face additional barriers when accessing the family law system. Having English as a second language can be prohibitive. Barriers can be faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families, culturally and linguistically diverse families and people with disability. As such, our report recommends that the previous recommendations of the Family Law Council be implemented. 


In addition, the report recommends improving the capacity of family law professionals to respond to family violence so that inconsistencies in capacity do not place families at risk of further harm. So, too, must resources to the family law system be increased to redress a backlog of cases in the federal Family Court system, which is yet another element which elongates the time for the hearing of cases. The committee believes that ongoing support services can provide families with security and safety after a family law matter has been resolved. We have expressed support for specialist domestic violence courts to employ wraparound models of court based support. The committee also recognised the importance of evidence based, evaluated and best-practice behaviour-change programs in the ongoing safety of families which have experienced family violence and has made recommendations for the incorporation and expansion of programs in existing services. 


In conclusion, I thank the former Attorney-General, Mr George Brandis, for requesting that the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee inquire into how Australia's family law system can better support and protect those affected by family violence. As the inquiry has determined, the family law system can be incredibly difficult and prohibitive for victims of family violence to navigate. I'm pleased that our report recommends tangible and, indeed, measurable improvements so that the scourge of family violence may be dealt with through the family law system in a person-focused, timely and efficient manner. I commend the committee's report.

Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (16:30):  I wish I could be as convinced as the member for Chisholm was in her speech just now about the committee's work and the report. There is something that the government can do immediately about the inconsistencies and the incongruences occurring in the Family Court, which includes up to four years delay for somebody seeking justice through that system. They could appoint the judges that have left that system through retirement or assist those judges who have over 300 cases on their dockets.


The Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs throughout last year had the opportunity to inquire into a better family law system to support and protect those affected by family law. Unfortunately, this is a subject I have an expert lived experience in. Recommendations have been made for an accessible, equitable and responsive family law system which better prioritises the safety for those involved. Many families across Australia access the federal family law for assistance and support to resolve the legal issues which arise following family breakdown, including those impacted by family violence. Family break-up happens all the time. Not all of them land in Family Court. The ones who do are there because they cannot resolve it outside using the usual mechanisms. These are special families who are incredibly vulnerable and need this parliament's and the legislation's full support.


I am well aware and all too familiar with the shortcomings of the family law system. The shortcomings for families who are impacted by this system are far greater than for those who are not. I would go further and say they are not shortcomings; they are absolute, abject failures, and the people they are failing most, and the most grievously, are children. The struggles families face following breakdown are difficult, and the legal system is complex to navigate, but it is even harder when you are marginalised by having family violence as a feature of that breakdown.


The inquiry was about the specific way in which family violence and family law interact with each other. The 6,000 or so pieces of evidence we took throughout this inquiry told the story of how desperately inadequate the system is at serving families affected by family violence. When the chair of this committee, the member for Corangamite, denied the judges of the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court the opportunity to attend a hearing, I was most grievously offended. The people who have the oversight, whose life's work it is, and who spend every single day presiding over this, were not invited. They were invited; then they were uninvited. That is an insult. When family violence is a component of family break-up, separation and divorce, the complexities and difficulties are compounded exponentially. For the committee to be unable to hear from those judges and the two voices who were the most expert on this, you must ask yourself how serious this chair was about actually getting on with looking into the job we were tasked with on behalf of the Attorney-General.


Our current system absolutely needs to change, and addressing the shortcomings with real solutions instead of tinkering and teetering with the versions would be an absolutely great start. The addendum made in this report by Labor members provides a good insight into our feelings on those, and our reservations in supporting this without a caveat.


Families that experience family violence need adequate support and management to be provided to ensure their ongoing safety and their wellbeing is a priority. This doesn't end when they hit the family law courts. And it is not just that they deserve it; we absolutely owe it to them. In this place, we talk about and we say we are aware of the impacts of domestic and family violence, but are we really? At least one woman a week is killed by a current or former partner. It is week seven of 2018, and we've already had to count nine women. When a woman leaves an abusive relationship, the very, very least we can do is to provide a legal system through the family law courts that does not exacerbate the abuse. This is exactly what we are seeing now. The committee have made 33 recommendations; seven of them are needed absolutely right now.


Recommendation 12 focuses on the imbalance created when an unrepresented perpetrator of family violence is legally allowed to stand up in a courtroom and query their victim. I'm aware the government has made an announcement to support ceasing this. The member for Griffith talked ad nauseam about this and we have spoken at length about it on this side. But it's only an announcement and you cannot hang your hat on it or feel warm and fuzzy on the inside over an announcement. An announcement must be followed with action. Victims need help now and I call on this government to move past the announcing and get onto the delivery.


Recommendation 19 talks about the assumption of shared parental responsibility. This is a hangover from the reforms made by former Prime Minister Howard. It's not surprising he didn't seek a woman's opinion on this, because I'm sure, if he had and he'd done some investigation, he would have understood this is absolutely the wrong way of moving forward. These reforms were hastily delivered and create a situation where the perpetrator of domestic violence can use the courts to continue to perpetrate the violence, continue the imbalance of power and use the courts to try and obtain custody from the person they committed domestic violence against.


Who are these people? When you commit domestic violence against the other parent in your relationship, you do harm to the child. In New South Wales, our jurisdiction says that a secondary victim of domestic violence is the child that is in that household. So what right, I ask, does a perpetrator of domestic violence have to rock up to a court and use the legal processes to try and seek a shared equal parental responsibility? They have a right, absolutely, to a relationship with that child, but they also had a responsibility and a duty of care when they were living under that roof and were a perpetrator of domestic violence. We have a law that currently says, 'That's fine; you're entitled to ask for it and to go through that system'—a system which takes up to four years from beginning to end, at exorbitant cost of up to about $30,000 or, in some instances, even more than that.


We also heard about the extraordinary circumstance where, when the child ages another two years, the perpetrator can then ask for the file to be reopened and go back to court, dragging the victim and that child back through the process all over again. I cannot begin to imagine the impact on those children or that victim in being re-traumatised over and over again. So, when we call for shared care not to be presumptive, it needs to be understood what that actually means. It's not some law where we just want to marginalise all these poor perpetrators of domestic violence; it's actually taking into consideration the long-lasting impacts that trauma has on developing brains and young children.


The penalties need to be greater. If you were to commit DV, would you continue to do it if you knew when you were doing it that it actually meant access to your children would be dissolved as well? I don't see it as a penalty; I actually see it as a responsibility and something that we could do to help move to end the cycle of domestic violence. We know violence creates long-term harm and the consequences do not cease once people have exited the family law system or once that perpetrator is removed from the home.


Of the women who fall victim to violence, more than half have children in their care. I say 'women' because we do know that there are more women than men affected by this. It's imperative that these women who land in the family courts are supported. With this in mind, I note recommendation 31, which talks about the disgraceful delays in the Family Court system—delays that, out of all of this, notwithstanding our judicial officers working incredibly hard, are the most important thing to be addressed right now. It is something where, with a very easy pen stroke to put more judges into those positions, we could start addressing some of the backlogs. It is unacceptable that a woman and a four-year-old child could enter a family law system and not exit until that child is in middle primary school. When you are facing these things, you face the prospect of not being able to make decisions about where your child is going to attend school or about who's caring for them medically. That is four years out of a developing child's life. You learn everything that you're going to learn between the ages of nought and seven. If we are subjecting children to this life of instability because Family Court's going to drag on for four years, we are not doing our jobs as parliamentarians and legislators, or good jobs.


Recommendations 27 and 28 talk about better training for judicial officers. Recommendation 8 talks about the abuse of power, which I touched on briefly, and how perpetrators continue to use the system to gain access to their victims and continue the abuse long after the victim has left the family home.


We will await the commission's review and recommendations to allow any reform proposals to be thoroughly considered before they're implemented. I would caution against the use of parent management hearings. During our inquiry, we heard it was on, and then it was off—it was on and it was off. The people who are supposed to be charged with the responsibility of delivering these parent management hearings cannot be sure about who's going to be served by the parent management hearings or who will preside over those parent management hearings.


Before I finish, I'd like to acknowledge the tremendous effort of the committee secretariat, who did an extraordinary amount of work and took on incredibly heavy evidence on behalf of the committee.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2018-02-14,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (16:39):  It's a great privilege to speak on this report by the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs. It would be fair to say that the inquiry process, for many members, was a challenging one. For me as somebody who hasn't had direct experience of the subject matter of the inquiry—family violence and the family law system—parts of it were eye opening, and I think we need to acknowledge that. Some other members, including the previous speaker, the member for Lindsay, have perhaps had closer experience of the subject matter than I have. Nonetheless, it was a good opportunity to cover many of these issues as part of a package of issues that the government is dealing with in the space of family law.


I'd like to start by commending the chair for her leadership and all the other committee members for their participation in the inquiry, and I was privileged to be able to be part of this process of trying to bring the human stories and lived experience of many Australians in the family law system to the fore, to be codified for the record and to be part of a pathway of positive change to improve the system for Australians needing to deal with family law—for victims of domestic and family violence and, in particular, for children. The committee is trying to ensure their best interests are put at the heart of any system. That is the basis on which the report has been put forward. It is also the basis on which the report has been written and the recommendations have been designed. 


We also want to thank, very strongly, those who made submissions, both written and oral, throughout the inquiry. They have been critical in making sure that this report and the recommendations have integrity and making sure those voices are heard, because human stories sit at the heart of the problems that are faced by people in the Family Court. Human stories anchor this report as examples of the experiences we are seeking to address so we can improve the system for the better.


I don't want to labour in too much detail the different recommendations but simply acknowledge that there have been a number of key themes which have resonated with me throughout the inquiry. These include the section outlined in the committee's report that relates to parenting orders being heavily influenced by evidence provided in family reports and prepared by family consultants. It is extremely concerning, as the chair noted, that families are often paying thousands of dollars for these reports which may be written by practitioners who have no formal training in or understanding of family violence or its impact on children. It's critical that the quality and reliability of family reports improve. Something as simple as codification of people's stories to improve the system is clearly at the heart of fixing the system. It shows you how much opportunity there is, through simple procedural improvements, to dramatically improve the current situation faced by many people who experience the family law system.


Recommendation 5 follows on from that. It's about the need for the greater use of mediation or alternative dispute resolution by the Family Court during proceedings to encourage earlier resolution of matters. It came from concerns directly as a consequence of issues around family violence, to make sure that there are alternative avenues to deal with problems so that people do not get caught up in the legalese of the family law system. That means they can focus much more on human outcomes, particularly in removing environments which lead to conflict and focusing on how we can get to a point of resolution in the best interests of families and children. I'm particularly taken by recommendation 11, which says:


The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General works with state and territory counterparts through the Council of Australian Governments to establish a trial in one or more specialist state or territory family violence courts (including reaching agreement in relation to resources, education and court infrastructure) enabling family law issues in family violence cases to be determined by the one court, including expedited pathways for breach and enforcement proceedings. One of the trial courts should ideally be located in an area of high Indigenous population.


Central to a lot of the things we heard throughout this inquiry were the issues that people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds face. In fact, the system does not properly accommodate or recognise diversity and the lived experiences of many people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. That needs to be better recognised and accommodated within the court system if it's to achieve the best interests of the parties involved, and, again, particularly children. That is especially so in the case of the Indigenous population, who, we heard time and time again, have not been fully recognised in respect of how the family law system works. That is something we can do and that we can lead successfully to improve outcomes for every Australian.


Another recommendation that I thought was particularly prescient follow on directly from that, particularly recommendation 24, which also deals with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues. Looking at past reports, it said:


The Committee recommends that, as a matter of urgency, the Australian Government implements the Family Law Council recommendations from both the 2012 Improving the family law system for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients report, and the 2016 Families with complex needs and the intersection of the family law and child protection systems – Final Report, as they relate to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families, including those recommendations addressing—


exactly going to those issues—


community education;


cultural competency;


service collaboration;


culturally diverse workforce;


early assistance and outreach;


legal and non-legal services;


interpreters;


cultural reports;


family group conferences;


participation of elders or respected persons in court hearings; and


consulting with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representatives in the development of any reforms.


In the same context, many similar issues come as a direct consequence of CALD families and the situations that they face.


That particularly leads to a subject that perhaps wasn't given the full attention of this inquiry, not because it wasn't important but because it could have its own inquiry. I think it is very important to address and I would recommend that the committee considers for future discussion the issue of dowry demands. It was covered in section 7 of the report, dealing particularly with the issue of dowries and how they can be used as a form of bride pricing and how they are used as a form of psychological, financial and emotional violence which can undermine the independence of women. They are common in some subcultures of people, particularly from new migrant families. This subject was covered by the inquiry, but it probably justifies further extrapolation. I know there's some work being done by the Victorian government in this space. The use of bride prices or dowries as a way of controlling women is completely unacceptable in our country, and I'm sure you share that sentiment, Deputy Speaker Buchholz. Manjula O'Connor, a constituent of the great electorate of Goldstein, regularly raises with me some of the issues around dowry extortion in migrant communities. She is concerned particularly, that some new arrivals to this country haven't had the opportunity to understand, or haven't had the lived experience to understand, that this practice is not acceptable in our country. There needs to be further work done to make sure that women are not finding a situation where they experience this type of emotional violence and physical violence as a consequence of it but are able to live full and independent lives. Part of the family law system has to recognise where this may be a factor in relationship breakdowns, and that's part of making sure that people can live that full independence.


I recommend the report to the parliament. I congratulate the chair and everybody who participated in it, and I will take the opportunity to acknowledge and congratulate the new chair of the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee, Julia Banks, on her illustrious elevation after the departure of our previous chair, and wish the committee its best work and deliberations into the future.


Debate adjourned.
