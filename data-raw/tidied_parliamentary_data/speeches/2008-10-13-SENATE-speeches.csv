"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-10-13,"—The Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 is a very important piece of legislation. The Greens believe that robust and effective occupational health and safety laws and practices are vital for the social and economic health of our workplaces and, more importantly, for Australians and their families.
The importance of occupational health and safety is obvious from looking at even just a few key statistics. In 2004 Access Economics estimated that there were 4,900 work related deaths each year in Australia. The ABS calculated that 690,000 employees suffered from a work related injury or illness in 2006. The Productivity Commission found that, in 2004, workplace deaths, injuries and illnesses cost the economy over $30 billion a year. These figures go to the economic and, importantly, the personal and social costs of workplace injuries and deaths. Behind each of those numbers is a person with a family, workmates, friends and a community.
The last time a bill to set up a national OH&S body was before this place, which was three years ago, I said:
… we have a grave responsibility to the Australian people to get this issue right … We do not want to be carrying out our policy experiments when the cost of our errors can be measured in human lives and injury.
The Greens believe that the previous government got it wrong in many ways. It abolished the tripartite and independent National Occupational Health and Safety Commission and replaced it with an executive body, the Australian Safety and Compensation Council—the ASCC. Under the previous government, we saw a systematic attack on the basic principles of occupational health and safety practice—genuine tripartism, independence and involvement of unions at the workplace level. We pointed this out very vigorously at the time, if people will recall. We believe that the current government has a responsibility to rectify the errors of the past and return to the national stage a robust and independent OH&S body. The Greens welcome the commitment of the government and the state ministers to developing a national, harmonised OH&S system.
The Greens have previously supported the development of national OH&S standards. We note the National Review into Model Occupational Health and Safety Laws currently being conducted by a three-person independent panel of experts. We look forward to the initial report of this review, which we understand is due at the end of October. We also acknowledge the intergovernmental agreement for regulatory and operational reform in occupational health and safety. We welcome the commitment of the government and the states to work towards a harmonised OH&S regulatory regime. We note that the provision of this bill in establishing Safe Work Australia is based on the IGA. But we also note that intergovernmental agreements do not take away the primacy of parliament in deciding the laws of the country. We want to work with the government to ensure that there is a replacement for ASCC and that it has as its key focus the development of model laws and regulations, along with other functions. But we also want to make sure that this body works effectively and in the best interests of the community in occupational safety and health matters.
We believe that building on best practice in OH&S in this country and around the world is to implement genuine tripartism and independence. On these criteria, this legislation is too skewed in favour of governments to the detriment of other key stakeholders in OH&S regulation—that is, employees and employers. Safe Work Australia comes as the latest in a line of national OH&S bodies. The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission was established in 1984 by the then Labor government. It explicitly adopted a tripartite and independent structure incorporating the findings of the Robens report. The Robens report fundamentally changed the approach to OH&S in Australia and around the world. In particular, the Robens report recommended an approach focused on general duties of care. The report stated that the problem of health and safety ‘could not be overcome so long as people were encouraged to think that safety and health at work could be ensured by an ever expanding body of legal regulations enforced by an ever increasing army of inspectors’. It went on to recommend that statutory recognition of joint consultative practices—including government, employees and employers—need to underpin the new approach.
If you agree with this approach—and all of Australia’s OH&S laws are based on this concept—then you also have to acknowledge the importance of genuine participation of employers and employees through a representative structure. The NOHS Commission did recognise this and was established as a statutory corporation with a membership structure incorporating employee and employer representatives. Its functions included formulating policies and strategies relating to OH&S matters, reviewing and making recommendations for the making of laws relating to OH&S matters, researching OH&S matters and conducting inquiries into OH&S matters.
In 2004, in its report into national workers compensation and occupational health and safety frameworks, the Productivity Commission made a number of recommendations relevant to the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, including a specific objective of achieving national uniform OH&S regulation and joint funding from the states. We note that this bill does implement these recommendations. The Howard government, however, instead of implementing those recommendations, once it got its chance by taking control of the Senate, abolished the commission. Prior to being able to abolish the commission, the previous government had already reduced its funding significantly. Between 1996 and 2005 the then government slashed the budget by over $4 million. We believe OH&S was never much of a priority for the Howard government.
The replacement body, the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, kept a similar membership structure, including the same number of employee and employer representatives as the previous commission, but it lacked genuine independence from government as it was merely an administrative rather than statutory body. It also took on responsibility for considering workers compensation matters with no consequent increase in funding. It is also worth noting that in 2004 Australia ratified the International Labor Organisation Convention No. 155: Occupational Safety and Health. This convention requires a national health and safety policy to be implemented in consultation with representatives of employers and workers. At the time, the ALP, the Greens and the Democrats opposed the replacement of the NOHSC with the ASCC. Safe Work Australia fits somewhere in the middle of the NOHSC and the ASCC. It continues the practice of being tripartite—although inexplicably downgrading the representation of employee and employer representatives—and, while more independent of government than the ASCC, is significantly less independent than the NOHSC.
The membership of Safe Work Australia and the independence of Safe Work Australia are areas where the Greens have concerns about this bill. We see no justification for downgrading the number of employee and employer representatives from three to two as this bill does. Both NOHSC and ASCC could manage three such representatives. We understand that a great deal of work is involved in adequately consulting employees and employers on the range of issues that come before such bodies. We do not want to see employee and employer representatives at a disadvantage in managing the task of representing their constituents’ interests on such an important body.
We are also concerned about the change in not naming the ACTU and the ACCI as the representative bodies—not necessarily because we have a particular view on these organisations but because the wording of the bill could mean that the union movement in fact has no representation on the SWA. This would be, in our minds, highly undesirable. We are open to further discussion on how the minister’s discretion in nominating an ‘authorising body’ could be tempered—for example, whether there is another formulation which would ensure that the most appropriate representative bodies are authorised. At this stage, we are certainly not convinced by the government’s current approach.
We also believe that there is an unnecessarily high level of ministerial control or direction over the membership of SWA. The minister has unnecessary discretion in the provisions, giving the minister the ability to essentially veto a member nominated by an employer and employee representative body. The minister has no such veto over representatives nominated by the states. This is not only interference in the independence of the body but also contrary to the principles of tripartism. We will be moving amendments to remove this power.
As well as downgrading the number and manner of appointment of employee and employer representatives, there are other provisions which seek to elevate the interests of the Commonwealth and state governments above those of employees and employers. In particular, the bill provides that, when voting on draft legislation, a decision is taken to have been made if there is agreement by two-thirds of the members but also a majority of the members who represent the Commonwealth, states and territories. These provisions also go against the principles of tripartism. The Commonwealth and state governments do not need additional voting rights in the context of Safe Work Australia—they already nominate representatives, and any draft legislation, regulations or codes of practice are required to go to the ministerial council for approval. Furthermore, any such legislation or regulations will need to be passed by the parliaments of the Commonwealth, states and territories. If they do not like something, there is sufficient protection for these governments in these processes, rather than undermining the concept of tripartism in the SWA. We will be moving amendments to restore the representative numbers and remove the additional voting rights of the Commonwealth, state and territory governments.
The other major interference with the independence of the body is the requirement that SWA’s draft strategic and operational powers be approved by the ministerial council and are subject to change on the direction of the ministerial council. Again, these provisions undermine both the tripartite nature and the independence of the SWA. These provisions represent an unnecessary intervention in the independence of the SWA.
I want to reiterate that, while we acknowledge that many of the provisions that the Greens take objection to come from the intergovernmental agreement, that does not put this piece of legislation beyond the normal and appropriate processes of this place. Intergovernmental agreements such as the one dealing with achieving a national harmonised OH&S regulatory system are important in our federation, but these agreements can never take away the role of parliament in making laws. When we believe laws can be improved, particularly when we believe the improvements will increase the probability of the desired outcome, we will argue for those improvements. In this case, we believe the desired outcome is not merely harmonised laws that state governments are happy with but harmonised laws that robustly protect the health and safety of workers. Further, we believe that such laws are best arrived at through a genuinely tripartite process.
The other area where, unfortunately, SWA is borrowing from the Howard government is in its funding. SWA’s initial funding will be $17 million a year. This is Howard-level funding for a body that also has workers compensation issues within its ambit. I note that when in opposition Minister Wong, in commenting on the Howard government’s abolition of NOHSC, said:
Labor believes that ongoing national research into occupational health and safety, something severely compromised by the ongoing funding reductions to the commission in recent years, plays an ongoing important role in the identification and prevention of workplace death and injury in Australia.
Safe Work Australia does have a function of conducting and publishing research, and we agree it is a vital role. We are just not sure how, with its proposed level of funding, Safe Work Australia could take on the essential task of drafting model laws, regulations and codes of practice and engage in the hugely important role of research.
As I mentioned earlier, in the last 10 years we have witnessed the Howard government making a sustained attack on OH&S structures, regulations and rights. The abolition of the NOHS Commission was only one of these. The former government also expanded the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth OH&S laws to non-government businesses.
The Commonwealth OH&S laws are generally seen as being weaker than OH&S regulation at a state level. This was of particular concern for workers in industries with high OH&S risks such as the building and construction and the transport industries. At the time these changes were being made it was noted that, while increasing the numbers of people covered by Commonwealth OH&S regulation, there was a significant lack of sufficient inspectors. There was also an attack on the rights of unions to have active engagement in OH&S matters in the workplace. By dramatically reducing the role of unions, the then government was acting contrary to the national and international evidence which demonstrates that there are much more effective OH&S practices when unions are involved.
The current government, while in opposition, forcefully opposed these measures, as did the Australian Greens. We welcome this government’s stated commitment to occupational health and safety outcomes and look forward to this ALP government introducing as soon as possible legislation to rectify the measures of the previous government, which lessened the rights of employees and the responsibilities of employers in occupational and health and safety matters.
Let us never forget that the paramount reason for occupational health and safety legislation is to protect the health and safety of persons undertaking work or affected by work. We have a duty in this place to get right the processes for developing that legislation and the regulatory framework. Therefore, we will be moving amendments to improve the representation of both employers and employees and to ensure the independence of this very important body. We do support the principle of the legislation but we think it needs improving and we will seek to make those improvements.",SENATE,<title>SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2008-10-13,"—On behalf of the coalition opposition I indicate that we support in general the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and the Safe Work Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2008; however, we do believe that the legislation has a number of flaws in it and we will be seeking to amend the legislation during the committee stages. Adding to the succession of Labor’s botched policies since it came to government, we are now forced to consider the establishment of Safe Work Australia, a body that will be dominated by state representatives making decisions about OH&S policy for employers and employees, who will have no real voice or influence in this process.
The need for this sort of legislation to harmonise occupational health and safety issues in the Australian context results from the failure of successive state governments to in fact get their acts together. So the need for us to have this harmonised approach results from the states not being able to do it by themselves. We as a coalition government sought to show leadership in this area, and I think we achieved a lot with the Australian Safety and Compensation Council. I will possibly say more on that later.
What federal Labor has now introduced is a body that will be dominated by the same state governments that have so abysmally failed their workers and employers in this particular area. The Labor states, after having failed so miserably, are now in effect being given a veto power, given the way that this body is to be structured. With great respect to the Prime Minister, this is not cooperative federalism. But it indicates yet again that this legislation has been introduced as a result of deals with Labor mates in the various state governments.
With this legislation, Labor is seeking to abolish the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, which was established by the coalition whilst in government to facilitate the tripartite coordination and harmonisation of workplace safety and workers compensation laws. Under the coalition, the ASCC was designed to facilitate a national approach to workplace safety and workers compensation utilising a tripartite consultative method to draw on and include employee and employer knowledge and experience in the move towards a national OH&S workers compensation system.
Whilst the coalition is broadly supportive of a harmonised national occupational health and safety system, it would be difficult to imagine a body better designed to fail in achieving this objective than the body proposed under the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 by the Rudd Labor government. Reading the bill, it is quite clear that it was designed by bureaucrats for a bureaucrat, but of course with the additional spin that the Rudd government has now become so famous—or should I say infamous—for putting out into the public arena. Not only does Labor’s bill fail to define the role of Safe Work Australia but someone, somehow, appears to have even forgotten to include the objects of Safe Work Australia and its role in bringing about improved safety outcomes for workplaces. We will be moving amendments in relation to that matter.
Unlike the ASCC, established under the coalition, Labor has purposely, at the behest of its state Labor governments, agreed to give excessive control of Safe Work Australia to the state ministers and reduce—and this is important—employer and union representation by 33 per cent; that is, from three to two for each category. Those that are impacted by occupational health and safety standards, those that pay for it and administer it on a workplace level, have been sidelined in favour of Labor state government bureaucrats. It seems as though the Prime Minister must have had his personal hand in this, because his great claim to fame was, of course, that he was coming to Canberra as the chief state bureaucrat from Queensland. Can I just say to the Prime Minister that the business of running Australia is a bit more than just trying to appease the odd state Labor bureaucrat. It is a lot more important to get this right.
The key partners in this should not be seen as the state Labor governments that have so abysmally failed over the years; the key partners are in fact those who have to deal with these laws, namely the workers themselves and the employers. By reducing the representation of the social partners and compromising their capacity to effectively represent the interests of both industry and employees, Labor is destroying the tripartite approach traditionally required for occupational health and safety regulation to effectively operate in workplaces. Labor’s proposed structure for Safe Work Australia will create an imbalance whereby workplaces directly impacted by the development and formulation of occupational health and safety will be denied the opportunity to genuinely participate in the forum where such regulation is developed.
The bill highlights the hypocrisy of Labor, who prior to the election spoke often of their commitment to occupational health and safety while regularly criticising the coalition—yet now, after the election, Labor have conveniently forgotten about workers and forgotten about industry and do not appear to understand that a process that does not seek to actively engage employers and workers in a meaningful way will not produce the improvements in workplace health and safety that are necessary for Australian workers. Even worse, we have a bill before us today that throws out previous reforms and an accepted understanding from both Labor and coalition governments that, when it comes to occupational health and safety, consultation is a proven mechanism for improving health and safety in workplaces.
When it comes to effective safety in the workplace, there can be no contest that improving and sustaining OH&S performance in the workplace from both an employer and an employee perspective is achieved by doing with the people and not by doing to the people involved. This is particularly the case where achieving outcomes involves significant changes. Some are costly changes or changes to culture in the workplace. Once again, Labor have failed Australian workers and workplaces in the proposed establishment of Safe Work Australia. The reason Labor have failed is quite frankly, I think, that they do not get it. Labor simply do not understand some of these issues because they do not have the real experience of either having been at the workplace themselves or having been an employer.
The current composition of Safe Work Australia fails to have proper regard for the views of industry and employees, which will undermine its credibility, and the outcomes it seeks to achieve, prior to the bill even being passed. We have a situation here now where there is rare unity between the ACTU and the ACCI. They are jointly complaining about some of these measures. We as a coalition agree with their concerns. When we have a situation where the coalition, the ACTU, ACCI and, I think—reading some of his suggestions—Senator Xenophon are all on a unity ticket in relation to some of these issues, you have to ask the question: why is it that Mr Rudd knows best? It is typical of this arrogant Labor government that it knows best and of course Mr Rudd, if he is in any doubt, will always give in to state Labor bureaucrats—and it is quite clear that Safe Work Australia has been largely designed by them. That is why we believe there are substantial flaws in this legislation.
We invite Mr Rudd to reconsider some of these issues and not be the arrogant ‘I know best’ Prime Minister that he has so quickly become. It seems that he can go overseas to tell the US congress how to vote and consider legislation, but he does not have the time to sit down with my good friend Senator Xenophon and others to encourage them to vote for certain pieces of legislation. It is just yet again indicative of the picture that Mr Rudd is painting of himself of an out-of-touch Prime Minister, arrogant enough to fly out of the country to tell the US congress how to vote but not interested in Australian senators and how they might exercise their vote—more interested in US senators than in Australian senators. It is that attitude that permeates this legislation in virtually every clause.
In the case of Safe Work Australia we are now witnessing a common Labor trait, where they cross their fingers behind their backs and tell Australian workers and business that they are doing one thing but instead make decisions and create ineffective regulations that create more problems than they solve. Labor’s limitation on the involvement of social partners—representatives of both employers and employees—will, without a doubt, lead to a situation where government representatives will be able to repeatedly override legitimate concerns raised by social partners during OH&S harmonisation discussions, including concerns relating to increased costs or impractical safety proposals for workplaces, or genuine proposals that may be lobbied against by a small sector in a few states. The proposed voting procedures under Labor’s bill are also unbalanced, giving state governments veto powers and simultaneously marginalising the role of what are called the social partners—I would say, the real players.
With limited capacity to oppose various proposals, there is no doubt that Safe Work Australia will be used by the government to develop other codes, policies and regulations, under the guise of safety, to achieve certain industrial outcomes on behalf of minority interests that would otherwise need to be discussed with stakeholders at a state level. Clearly the government has borrowed this approach from its Labor counterparts on a state level, where workplaces in many cases are already overwhelmed with impractical and unworkable occupational health and safety laws. Now Labor wants to introduce a body to achieve harmonisation which will be dominated by those same Labor governments and their advisers who have already failed to establish, in many cases, workplace occupational health and safety and workers compensation systems in their own states. Remarkably, Minister Gillard is determined not to listen to stakeholders and instead has chosen to reduce their representation and rely on state representatives who have already so abysmally failed in their own backyards.
The foundation upon which Safe Work Australia has been established is fundamentally flawed, with the direction and success of Safe Work Australia being contingent on the cooperation and participation of the ministerial council to which it is required to report. Members of the ministerial council have repeatedly failed to attend and/or cooperate with the Commonwealth in these meetings, which raises some legitimate concerns about just how effective Safe Work Australia will be in an environment where state Labor governments have been unwilling to cooperate and genuinely contribute to discussions about the harmonisation of occupational health and safety laws across Australia—particularly the New South Wales state government, which has been reported by some as having the very worst OH&S system in the country. Where the ministerial council fails to meet or refuses to cooperate and consider Safe Work Australia issues, then the work of Safe Work Australia comes to a halt—end of story. Just last year, we had the then New South Wales minister for industrial relations—I understand that was the minister of ‘Iguana’ fame—refusing to cooperate in a national discussion on occupational health and safety. If anything, Labor is now making it easier for uncooperative state governments to undermine the occupational health and safety harmonisation process for their own political gain.
Further, the proposed structure creates an unjustifiable imbalance. Improving occupational health and safety performance is critically dependent on a collaborative effort and the buy-in of all stakeholders. A process that does not seek to engage workers and employers in a meaningful way does not necessarily lead to improvements in workplace health and safety. In relation to these stakeholders, we will be moving amendments to ensure that the appropriate peak bodies are chosen to represent the stakeholders and that it is not, as is the case in the legislation at the moment, at the whim of the minister so that she can play favourites and approve those that she would like.
Labor’s duplicity is further highlighted by its unwillingness to review its processes and report back to parliament on the progress of Safe Work Australia. The bill currently proposes an inadequate process of reporting back to parliament every six years. It is incomprehensible that Labor wants to introduce a state-dominated, independent authority that has no requirement to report to parliament for six years in relation to its operations. Sure, under clause 70(2) there is the provision for an annual report, but there are only two sections dealing with what the annual report needs to cover. Can I respectfully suggest to the government that they should consider amending that further, to allow or to specifically state that they must also report on the operation of Safe Work Australia in relation to the legislation—what the faults are, what the benefits are—so that, if there are actual issues to be addressed, those issues can be addressed immediately. Occupational health and safety happens to be a very important issue—something that I would have thought everybody in this chamber would be absolutely agreed upon. Therefore, if an issue arises urgently then this body should be able to report to the parliament on those issues and have them dealt with, with amending legislation, as matter of extreme importance.
In brief, Safe Work Australia is, unfortunately, just another botched policy on top of the failed Fuelwatch, GroceryWatch, the proposed abolition of the ABCC and, in the last months, the failure of the award modernisation process, which industry says could potentially lead to significant job losses and inflationary outcomes. There is one common thread running through all of these botched Labor policies: the Labor government does not have a plan and is incapable of listening to Australians and delivering credible and acceptable policy solutions.
In brief, the opposition will support this legislation, but we will be pursuing a number of amendments during the committee stage to ensure that occupational health and safety in this country is properly addressed. If Labor want to now have a different body to that which the coalition had in the ASCC, so be it. They can make that their own and give it their own name—Safe Work Australia—but what it should have been is a genuine evolution of that which we had initiated. Unfortunately, a lot of the proposals are in fact regressive. Worst of all is the diminution of the union and employer roles in this vital area. I would have thought everybody would be agreed that, if anything, these social partners are a vital part of the cog and for Labor to overlook them is inexplicable. I look forward to the committee stage. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2008-10-13,"—I rise to support the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008. In doing so I commend the government, and particularly the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Julia Gillard, for the timely introduction of this bill, a bill that meets an important election commitment made by the Labor Party at the 2007 election.
This bill establishes a new independent Commonwealth statutory body, Safe Work Australia, to improve occupational health and safety and workers compensation outcomes for Australian workers. Labor’s platform for the 2007 election contained an important commitment:
Labor will work with the States and Territories to achieve a nationally consistent occupational health and safety framework which reflects best safety practice within Australia, and which is consistent with the best international standards. This framework should be clear and capable of enforcement at the workplace level.
This bill represents the government’s fulfilment of that very important commitment.
Safe Work Australia will be a cooperative body representing the Commonwealth, the states and territories, and employees and employers. It will be a reform-focused body with the power to make recommendations directly to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council, which includes the Commonwealth, state and territory workplace relations ministers. Safe Work Australia will have a number of important responsibilities. These responsibilities include developing national policy on occupational health and safety and workers compensation; preparing model occupational health and safety legislation and codes of practice for adoption by the Commonwealth, the states and territories; developing a compliance and enforcement policy to ensure that a nationally consistent approach is taken; developing proposals for the harmonisation of workers compensation arrangements across all jurisdictions; and reducing the complexity and costs for businesses. Safe Work Australia will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, an entity that was set up by the Howard government as a purely advisory body. In contrast to the ASCC, Safe Work Australia will play the central role in occupational health and safety and workers compensation reform.
Senator Abetz spoke moments ago about botched policy. Frankly, the other side is in a good position to recognise botched policy when it sees it—because, of course, it had custody of and inspiration for such policy over the past 11 years. Senator Abetz called for evolution, and evolution is what this bill represents as we go from the coalition stone age to a far more effective and just system under the Rudd Labor government. The Liberal and National parties had custody of our occupational health and safety law for 11 years. As a result, if I may quote the Deputy Prime Minister from her second reading speech in the other place:
Our health, safety and compensation systems are in a sorry state—unnecessarily complex and costly. Inconsistencies between jurisdictions mean that some workers are at risk of poorer safety standards than their counterparts in other states. At the same time, these inconsistencies increase the complexity, paperwork and costs for the 39,000 Australian businesses that operate across state boundaries.
Under the previous government, the Commonwealth’s own occupational health and safety body, Comcare, was developed into a backdoor way of allowing employers to escape the jurisdiction of the states and territories. Because the Commonwealth’s rules were less rigorous than those of the states and territories, employers tried to shift from state jurisdictions into the federal jurisdiction—that is, into Comcare—and the Howard government was happy to enable them to do so. In fact, this was a deliberate and calculated device to circumvent state laws. Senator Abetz has called upon this house to have regard for harmonisation, but of course it was nothing more than a rush to the bottom under the previous government. In the last days of the Howard government the then minister, Mr Hockey, granted an additional seven Australian companies eligibility to apply to move to Comcare. Given that this was a privilege initially granted to only 19 companies in the country, this represented a significant expansion. Senator Abetz has spoken mischievously about potential deals with Labor mates in state governments but, in consideration of Mr Hockey’s deeds in the dying days of the Howard government, one might just as easily speculate about deals between the Howard government and its mates in some of these major Australian businesses. This is why the current minister announced very shortly after she took office that she was imposing a moratorium on employees transferring into Comcare’s jurisdiction. She pointed out, very properly, that many questions had been asked about the protections available to workers in the Comcare scheme compared with those available under state and territory laws. There was deep concern about the capacity of Comcare to have the expertise and the resources to deal with many of these companies that have transferred into its jurisdiction.
The minister also pointed out that the Howard government failed to work cooperatively with the states and territories to achieve consistent workers compensation and occupational health and safety laws. The Howard government was not interested in consistency; it was simply interested in facilitating the movement of employers into an inferior scheme. In fact, I would go further—I would say it refused to consult with employers, employees or the state governments in seeking a genuine harmonisation. The Howard government was notorious for its refusal to work cooperatively with the states on issues like this. It always preferred to act in a unilateral and high-handed way, grabbing all the credit for itself and never missing an opportunity to miss an opportunity.
In January this year, the minister announced a review of the appropriateness of self-insurance under Comcare, with the aim of determining, among other things, whether Comcare provides appropriate occupational health and safety and workers compensation coverage, whether Comcare has the capacity to ensure that employers under its jurisdiction provide safe workplaces, and what arrangements are required to ensure that all workers working at workplaces under Comcare’s jurisdiction have their health and safety protected. This review is very welcome and I look forward to seeing its recommendations.
It is important to note that those opposite had their chance to get this issue right but, as was so often the case, they dropped the ball. In 2004, the Productivity Commission conducted an inquiry into workers compensation and occupational health and safety. The commission’s report recommended that all Australian jurisdictions adopt uniform occupational health and safety regulations, it recommended a national workers compensation scheme and it recommended nationally consistent standards for workers compensation. We might very well ask: what happened to those recommendations? The then Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Kevin Andrews, rejected them. He rejected recommendations from Australia’s principal advisory body on microeconomic policy and regulation, the Productivity Commission. Why did he do that? I can only surmise that it was due to deference by the minister and the then Prime Minister to what they saw as the interests of some employers—although I am sure the sensible majority of employers would have welcomed a uniform national occupational health and safety scheme. The then minister also rejected the Productivity Commission’s recommendation for an expert body to develop a national scheme. Instead we got a weak, toothless advisory body, the ASCC—which the other side are now trying to turn into a virtuous body.
In contrast to this sorry record of neglect, the Rudd government and the Deputy Prime Minister, whose commitment to the rights of Australian workers is well known, are determined to create a national occupational health and safety regime free from inconsistencies, unnecessary duplications and overlaps. This is an important national project and a good example of the Rudd government’s determination to make Australia’s federal system work better through cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states and territories.
It is true, of course, that there have been some differences of opinion among the states, and between the states and the Commonwealth, about the provisions of the legislation abolishing the ASCC and establishing Safe Work Australia. That is to be expected. The states naturally have their own points of view, and some states have expressed the desire to retain various aspects of their own state-specific occupational health and safety regimes rather than to immediately agree to a uniform national scheme. That is part and parcel of a project of this nature. Despite these differences, the Commonwealth and the states and territories have an important shared objective, and that is to create a system which will improve Australia’s occupational health and safety performance, leading to greater workplace safety for all Australian employees. This is not a government that is interested in facilitating a race to the bottom, to the lowest common denominator, as our predecessors were.
Why is this question of such great importance to Australian workers and to Australian employers? It is because each year, over the past 10 years, between 250 and 350 Australian workers have been killed in workplace accidents. In other words, between 1997 and 2005 nearly 2,400 workers were killed in such accidents. And, in each of the last 10 years, many thousands have been injured—some very seriously indeed. It is estimated that there is some $30 billion per annum in economic loss due to workplace accidents across the country. In each of the last 10 years, between 146,000 and 153,000 workers made serious compensation claims. In other words, each year between one and two per cent of all Australian workers receive a work related injury or suffer a work related illness serious enough to make a compensation claim. It is worth pointing out that these are minimum figures. They do not cover all workplace deaths and accidents. They do not include cases in which no-one made a claim for compensation; they do not include injuries resulting in absences from work of less than a week; they do not include many transport related injuries and deaths, since these are often not classified as workplace related; they do not include deaths and injuries among ADF personnel or members of police services; and they do not include asbestos related cases, which are compensated through other mechanisms.
I am pleased to note that the number of workplace fatalities and work related compensation claims has been slowly declining over the past 10 years. This is partly due to more effective workplace safety legislation in the states and territories, but it is also due to changes in the structure of the Australian workforce. The number of workers engaged in dangerous physical work in places such as mines and factories is declining. The number working in relatively safer white-collar jobs is increasing. The workforce is slowly ageing, and older workers are less likely than younger workers to be killed or injured at work. On the other hand, the number and incidence of workplace deaths and injuries among women are increasing as the gender balance in all areas of the workforce continues to shift towards women. The proportion of all serious claims where the employee was female increased from 28 per cent in 1997-98 to 33 per cent in 2004-05.
As we would expect, different industry sectors have very different incidences of workplace fatalities and injuries. The highest incidence of fatalities is in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sector, followed by the transport and storage sector. These two sectors each have an average annual fatality rate of more than 10 per 100,000 workers. Everyone would agree that that is unacceptable. The mining and construction sectors both have an average annual fatality rate of more than five per 100,000 workers. The agriculture, forestry and fisheries sector, the transport and storage sector, the mining sector and the construction sector also have the highest rates of compensation claims for work related injuries and illnesses. All four sectors have an average annual rate of more than 20 serious claims per 1,000 workers. In other words, each year more than two per cent of all workers in these sectors make a serious compensation claim. These figures show that there is an unacceptably high rate of fatality, injury and illness in these industry sectors in particular.
If we look at absolute numbers rather than incidence rates, the two sectors which produce the largest numbers of serious compensation claims are the manufacturing sector and the health and community services sector. Australian factories are safer places to work in than was once the case, but they are still far from being as safe as they should be and could be. It is apparent that our hospitals and health centres, a rapidly expanding sector of employment in this country, are also not as safe as they should be in terms of the health and safety of the people who work there.
I do not wish to suggest that all Australian employers act without regard to the health and safety of their employees. Of course that is not the case. I do not suggest that the majority of employers act in such a way. But it nonetheless remains a fact that there are some employers, unfortunately, who put the interests of their business ahead of the wellbeing of their employees in the scale of their priorities. This attitude leads to the health and safety of employees, and on some occasions the very lives of those employees, being put at risk. If that were not the case, we would not need an occupational health and safety regime at all.
As well as an effective, uniform, national occupational health and safety and workers compensation scheme, we need recognition of the vital role the trade unions play in the protection of the health and safety of Australian workers and in the maintenance of workplace standards. Government agencies, no matter how well intentioned or well funded, and no matter how extensive their powers, cannot be in every workplace every hour of the day, and nor is that desirable.
But when employees join trade unions, and when those unions have the legally protected right to check on the safety of their members and on whether the law is being observed at work, they do represent an extraordinary resource for government and regulators in this very important area. That is why this government works cooperatively with both business and unions to improve the safety of Australian workplaces, rather than treating the unions as enemies, as the previous coalition government did. We have just heard a speech from Senator Abetz in which he referred to the trade unions as ‘social partners’. This represents a magnificent elevation in their status from the 11 years of victimisation that they enjoyed under the previous government. But those weasel words do not change the fact that the trade union movement in particular has been shunned as a participant in this area for the past decade, and that is something that has now changed.
This is a very important piece of legislation. It will benefit both employers and employees. It will reduce the number of workplace fatalities and injuries and work related illnesses. In doing so, it will save lives. It is a very serious attempt to deal with a very serious issue and it is building on a very sorry legacy from the previous government. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2008-10-13,"—I would also like to speak on the government’s Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and related bill. This bill claims to establish Safe Work Australia as an independent Commonwealth statutory body with the aims of improving occupational health and safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements in Australia. As Senator Abetz outlined, the opposition supports this bill but has some very strong reservations about some aspects of it as it currently stands and will seek to amend those.
According to the explanatory memorandum that accompanies the Safe Work Australia Bill, the organisation will be:
… an inclusive, tripartite body representing the interests of the Commonwealth, the States and Territories as well as workers and employers in Australia. SWA will be a reform-focussed body with the power to make recommendations directly to the Workplace Relations Ministers’ Council (WRMC).
This new statutory body will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council which our government established, which was also designed as a tripartite organisation to coordinate and harmonise workplace safety and workers compensation laws across all Australian jurisdictions. Senator Feeney somewhat derisively referred to the Australian Safety and Compensation Council as an ‘advisory body’ and described it as ‘weak and toothless’. Could I please take you back to the great powerhouse of the proposed new body, Safe Work Australia. It will have the power to make recommendations. Wow! That is a really big change. My God! People will be quivering in their boots at the idea of a new body that can make recommendations to a ministerial council. What a novel change. The new government body is in effect simply a rebranding of the coalition’s Australian Safety and Compensation Council, albeit in a way that actually compromises the tripartite approach that our government took to workplace health and safety regulation to operate effectively in workplaces.
The coalition were and remain very aware of the need to have greater harmonisation in business regulation across Australia, and we are very supportive of any sensible approach to achieving better workplace safety arrangements across Australia. But we are also extremely concerned that the government’s proposed body will actually have less rather than more representation from the various stakeholders that were involved in the Australian Safety and Compensation Council. Safe Work Australia, in replacing the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, will actually reduce the number of representatives from industry and unions. They have been referred to both by Senator Abetz and by the shadow Treasurer, Ms Julie Bishop, as the social partners in the program to develop coherent workplace health and safety regulations across Australia. The industry and union representatives are each to be reduced from three to two. So in fact we will have four representatives from industry and from unions instead of the six that were on the Australian Safety and Compensation Council—a reduction of a third in the number of people who actually know what the jobs involve and who actually understand what happens in the workplace in something other than an abstract way.
This aspect of the reduction of representation for both unions and employers very much concerns the coalition. We need, in the area of workplace safety and health, to proceed with policy development in a calm, considered and experienced way that involves all the interested parties in developing viable solutions. What we do not need here is a board of directors, albeit with no power except to make recommendations, telling a ministerial council what the latest academic view or the latest bureaucratic view of workplace health and safety is. We need input from people who actually do the jobs and understand how the jobs can be done. The shadow Treasurer, Ms Julie Bishop, in the second reading debate on this bill in the other house said:
Labor talks—often—about its commitment to occupational health and safety, yet Labor does not appear to understand that a process that does not seek to actively engage employers and workers in a meaningful way will not produce the improvement in workplace health and safety that are necessary—
and meaningful, on the ground for employers and—
for Australian workers. When it comes to effective safety in the workplace there can be no contest that improving and sustaining OH&S performance in the workplace from both an employer and an employee perspective is achieved by doing things—
by developing policy, by talking through issues—
‘with’ people, not by doing ‘to’ people.
Our primary concerns hinge around the fact that the government’s new body limits the involvement of social partners in the development of new ideas and of sensible reforms. It must be asked, why would Labor want to do that, why would they want to limit the number of employer and employee representatives? We have already heard the concerns of Senator Siewert that this makes no provision for the peak bodies such as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the ACTU to be involved in the Safe Work Australia body.
As in many other areas, the proposed solution by the Rudd Labor government is simply a public servant style answer. Their proposal for a body with less representation of effective stakeholders will lead to a situation where the government representatives will be able to repeatedly override the legitimate concerns and issues raised by the employers and the union representatives during OH&S harmonisation discussions, including concerns relating to increased costs or, at the very worst, to impractical safety proposals in the workplace.
We all know what happens in practice when you have poor law or poor regulation: it is ignored by citizens. People recognise it for the foolishness that it is and proceed to develop their own ways around it. We will end up with more and more industrial police forcing people into ways of going about their jobs and achieving in their businesses that are not sustainable and have no respect within the community that they are best meant to serve if we do not involve closely the people whose jobs are, in the end, what we are talking about. How those jobs are done is best sorted by the people who actually do the jobs.
Under Labor’s proposed body, Safe Work Australia, we will have the bureaucrats outnumbering those who are actually working in the workplaces across Australia. There will be very limited capacity to oppose this apparently very powerful body—remember it can make recommendations. So, under the guise of safety, various proposals will come up to be further developed and there will be further changes made to codes, policies and regulations. But they will really be aimed at producing the sort of industrial outcomes that the Rudd Labor government wants to achieve on the behalf of minority interests that otherwise would not have gotten to the table with the current stakeholders at state level.
I heard Senator Feeney earlier express surprise that the Liberal government had a concern about unions and regarded them as a social partner in this. I find that ridiculously offensive but I must admit I did listen with some surprise to his new-found concern and respect for employers as a spokesperson for the Rudd Labor government. The only way that good, safe work practices happen is when employers and employees work together to achieve them. That is certainly something that the previous government set out to do despite the number of times that the state ministers refused to come to the table, refused to get involved.
The inconsistency we have spoken about within state regulations is costing business money. Yes, sure it does if you have to have a workplace health and safety officer who understands the intricacies often irrelevant to actual safety but just relevant to ticking the right boxes. If you need to have a workplace health and safety officer who can understand the rules of seven different jurisdictions, seven different sets of policies, seven different ways of applying them often—despite what the rules say—there is always room, as I think everyone here knows, for their interpretation. How they are applied by different workplace inspectors can vary radically from state to state. So, yes, there is a cost to business in doing that. But there is another cost to inconsistency in policy and that is the cost to employees who may injure themselves because they are working under one set of rules that are not appropriate to the area that they are working in because those rules have been made a long way away from the workplace and from where the job actually happens and it is not understood by those people.
I note that this bill says that Safe Work Australia will report to a ministerial council and again this is an area of concern given the previous performances of ministerial councils in the workplace relations area. Senator Abetz referred to people refusing even to attend ministerial council meetings. So, I have no high hopes that we will get any quick action out of this when we look at a body that is not dominated by people in the industry who have a vested interest in getting quick solutions to problems that may be seen or reforming policy when that is an issue but dominated by a public servant mentality that makes recommendations to a ministerial council. I do not think that anyone would suggest that a ministerial council is the way to get a quick decision. They are certainly powerful decisions when they are made, but they are not quick decisions. Again, we have some serious concerns here.
I would also like to follow up Senator Feeney’s comments regarding the previous government’s development of Comcare, which did allow some organisations to function under a coherent, unitary system of workplace health and workplace relations policies. As the shadow Treasurer has already commented, this saved millions and millions of dollars for some of those companies involved by not having to go through little extra hoops, by not having to have seven sets of instructions on how to do exactly the same job in exactly the same factory. I think that one of the things that we hope will come out of this harmonisation is a realisation that, in many cases now, we have national companies doing the same work in every state but doing the same work differently because there is no coherence to the state workplace health and relations policies or programs. So, yes, there is a saving there.
Senator Feeney appeared to imply that there was something rather sneaky and scary about the fact that there was a way that companies could save this money and get a uniform outcome. I notice that Senator Feeney was not able to give us any figures on workplace health and safety in those organisations. So I presume, on that basis, that they were positive and that, therefore, he did not want to tell anyone how they had actually succeeded in assisting companies not only to save money but also to improve their workplace health and safety record. Senator Feeney also noted that the workplace health and safety record of Australia has been slowly improving over the past 10 years. It could have improved a lot faster if the previous Howard-Costello government had had the cooperation of the states in bringing together issues such as the harmonisation of workplace health and safety regulations. Nevertheless, the intent of this legislation to produce harmonisation, to get cooperation, is supported by the opposition.
It is quite interesting that, in the current economic climate, when building in Australia has basically hit the wall, we have the other efforts of the Labor government to assist in the workplace. Their attempts to destroy the Australian Building and Construction Commission is just one example of this. It is worth noting that last year the construction industry in Australia contributed 6.7 per cent to Australia’s GDP and employed about 940,000 workers. That is nine per cent of the Australian work force.
Coalition government efforts in the past to reform the lawlessness and the corruption within the building and construction industry actually had a direct and positive effect in improving that industry and giving us the result that we got last year: a significant reduction in the number and cost of strikes and increased output and productivity. It is rather ominous to think about where the building industry might be now if it were not for the reforms that were forced through by the Howard-Costello government despite the outcries and lack of cooperation across the board that came from state Labor governments who were more intent on building up debt than they were in building their states or in building infrastructure in their states.
I also note with interest that next week—19 to 25 October—will be Safe Work Australia Week and there will be various celebrations going on around the country, as there rightly should be, to highlight and create awareness about what safe work involves and how everyone can contribute to improve the record that we have in occupational health and safety. I was somewhat bemused to note that in New South Wales—which of course probably has the record for being the most intransigent of the states and having the most confused of the regulatory bodies in this area—the Safe Work Australia Week will be launched at the Lismore City Hall, and they will have a big celebration. They will be celebrating not a reduction in workplace health and safety incidents and not a streamlining of regulation; they will be celebrating the 1000th workplace advisory visit. This is where someone turns up on your doorstep at your factory and attempts to tell you and your staff how to do your job better than you currently are. I think this is probably the sort of thing that we can look forward to a lot more under the proposed legislation. As I said, we will be seeking to amend certain aspects of it.",SENATE,<title>SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2008-10-13,"—I rise to speak in support of the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008. This bill is very near and dear to my heart, as I am not only a former union official but also a former union official who did copious amounts of training with regard to occupational health and safety in the workplace. The purpose of this bill is to establish Safe Work Australia, an independent Commonwealth statutory body to improve occupational health and safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements in Australia.
Safety in the workplace is of paramount importance. It is important to ensure the health, safety and welfare of workers while they are at their places of work. There are rights and responsibilities for both employees and employers in maintaining a safe workplace. In my previous role as a union official I saw the results of accidents and incidents and the on-costs that these events caused not only to the worker and their family but also to the employer and to the community. Safe Work Australia will be a reform focused body with the power to make recommendations directly to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. It will be empowered to develop national policy relating to occupational health and safety and workers compensation. It will be empowered to prepare, monitor and revise model occupational health and safety legislation and model codes of practice. It will be empowered to develop a compliance and enforcement policy to ensure nationally consistent regulatory approaches across all jurisdictions. It will be empowered to develop proposals relating to the harmonisation of workers compensation arrangements. It will be empowered to collect, analyse and publish occupational health and safety and workers compensation data and to undertake and publish research. It will also be empowered to drive national communication strategies to raise awareness of health and safety at work, further develop the National Occupational Health and Safety Strategy for 2002-2012 and advise the Workplace Relations Ministers Council on occupational health and safety and workers compensation matters.
Safe Work Australia will comprise 15 members, including an independent chair: nine members representing the Commonwealth and each state and territory, two members representing the interests of workers, two members representing the interests of employers and the chief executive officer. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations will make appointments to Safe Work Australia based on nominations from each body. The tripartite nature of Safe Work Australia’s membership ensures that this body will have input from major stakeholders in Australia’s occupational health and safety systems. It means that employers, employees and government can work together to pursue their common interest in improving occupational health and safety. But if we are serious about occupational health and safety, there is a real need for government to lead on this issue.
Safe Work Australia will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, commonly known as the ASCC, which was established by the Howard government to advise on the development of policies relating to occupational health and safety and workers compensation matters. The ASCC has been badly in need of reform for some time. As an advisory rather than a statutory body, it has no requirement to report publicly. In other words, it essentially has no teeth. The ASCC has effectively been contained to coordinating, monitoring and promoting national efforts in respect of occupational health and safety issues. Its advice could easily be ignored by the government of the day.
Unlike the previous government, the Rudd Labor government has taken a serious approach to improving Australia’s occupational health and safety arrangements. That is why we are undertaking a review of the Comcare scheme and setting up an independent panel of experts to conduct a national occupational health and safety review, as we have already heard from previous speakers. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Julia Gillard, announced the review on 4 April 2008 and tasked the expert panel with developing model occupational health and safety laws. That three-person panel will review occupational health and safety legislation in each state, territory and Commonwealth jurisdiction and make recommendations on the best structure and content for a model occupational health and safety act. The model act will be capable of being adopted in all jurisdictions. When the panel’s report is handed down, Safe Work Australia will be responsible for developing national policy relating to occupational health and safety and workers compensation. It will prepare model occupational health and safety legislation, model regulations and model codes of practice based on the findings and recommendations of the review report.
This is a first in Australia’s history. The Rudd government has taken the unprecedented step of entering into an intergovernmental agreement to harmonise occupational health and safety arrangements throughout the Commonwealth, states and territories. The intergovernmental agreement on harmonising occupational health and safety arrangements is a demonstration of the Rudd government’s commitment to cooperative federalism. It is also a great example of what the aspiration towards cooperative federalism can achieve. The Howard government, by contrast, never believed in cooperation with state and territory governments. Their approach to dealing with the states was about dictating policy to them and then threatening to deny funding if the states did not follow their way of doing things. Of course, the states and territories were never asked for their input on national measures, even though they were expected to provide matching funding. It was usually a case of: if we want your opinion we will give it to you.
It was convenient for the Howard government to take a big stick to the state and territory governments because they happened to be of a different political persuasion. They never saw it as being in their political interests to seek the adoption of consistent, nationwide regulations for occupational health and safety. For Labor, it is at the very core of our philosophy that the best outcomes can be achieved for Australia when Commonwealth, state and territory governments all work together in the common interests of the nation. That is why we have entered into an intergovernmental agreement, and with this legislation we are setting about implementing that agreement. The establishment of Safe Work Australia is a product of this agreement. The states and territories have agreed to provide 50 per cent of the funding, with the remaining 50 per cent to be provided by the Commonwealth. The total contribution from the parties will be $17 million in the first year, increasing each year by, at a minimum, the consumer price index. For the Commonwealth, that is $8.5 million in 2008-09.
The result of our approach to harmonising occupational health and safety arrangements will be to reduce regulation. This will free up businesses to focus on the important business of making real improvements to occupational health and safety. There is no more compelling reason to make sure we get our occupational health and safety systems right than the potential costs of getting it wrong. Workplace accidents and injuries result in phenomenal costs to businesses, workers and society. In the 2005-06 financial year there were 139,630 serious workers compensation claims. These claims involved either a death, a permanent incapacity or a temporary incapacity with an absence from work of one working week or more. Compensation claims do not account for the full extent of work related illnesses, since many work related diseases do not result in a claim.
A more recent report by the Productivity Commission estimated the number of serious injuries to be more than 140,000 per year. Tragically, more than 300 Australian workers are killed each year. According to an Access Economics report, 8,000 Australians die each year as a result of work related incidents or illnesses. These figures are staggering when we start to consider what these incidents and illnesses cost Australia. A 2004 report by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission identified the direct and indirect costs of work related illness and injury for employers, workers and the community. It found that the total costs of work related illness and injury were roughly four times the indirect costs. The costs of a work related injury or illness include such items as lost productivity; the cost of overtime and overemployment; employer excess payments; loss of current income; recruitment, training and staff turnover costs; loss of future earnings; medical and rehabilitation costs; investigation costs; legal fines and penalties; legal costs and overheads; travel expenses for attending courts or tribunals; social welfare payments; and loss of government tax revenue. The report estimated that the total cost of work related illness and injury was $20 billion in 1992-93, rising to $31 billion in 2000-01.
The Productivity Commission’s report now estimates the direct cost of supporting work related injuries and illnesses to be $34 billion a year. In addition to these financial costs there is the cost of the personal pain and distress caused to the injured worker as well as to their family and coworkers. In my home state of Tasmania, statistics from WorkCover Tasmania show that there were 9,873 reported workplace injuries in 2007, or 27 Tasmanians injured per day. The most common types of injuries in 2007 were soft-tissue disorders due to trauma, which accounted for 3,428 of the injuries reported, followed by wounds, lacerations, amputations and internal organ damage, which accounted for 2,355 injuries. The majority of these injuries were caused by body strains—3,336 injuries; falls, trips and slips—1,863 injuries; and being hit by moving objects—1,825 injuries. Just to give you some idea of the cost of these injuries, WorkCover reported that, in the 2006-07 financial year, $99.5 million was paid in compensable claims for workplace injuries. For the same period, four workplace fatalities were reported in Tasmania.
I want to give some sense of perspective on these figures, because we are talking about people’s lives and livelihoods. For example, the 300 or more work related deaths each year mean that, almost every day in Australia, someone heads off to work and does not return home. For each of these deaths there are many more injuries that affect workers for life. Imagine being in an accident at work that did not kill you but left you crippled for life. Imagine dealing with the daily trauma of the accident and the pain of its lasting effects. Imagine the mounting medical expenses and the legal struggle you would have to go through to obtain reasonable compensation. Imagine losing not only your job but also your future career as the accident causes you never to be able to work again. This is why it is vital to have a cooperative approach between the Commonwealth, states and territories on occupational health and safety arrangements.
This issue is too important to be treated as a political football. That is why I support this bill. Implementing these arrangements is about improving people’s lives. It is about making sure that the workplace hazards that threaten the quality of life and the livelihoods of ordinary Australian workers are minimised. It is about Commonwealth, state and territory governments working together and doing their utmost to make our workplaces injury and illness free. Every avoidable injury and every avoidable disease that occurs costs us. It costs us in lost productivity, in medical and legal expenses and in the pain and suffering caused to those affected. It costs our economy, it costs our society and it costs our families. However, this bill is not just about improving lives and it is not just about minimising the incidence of illness and injuries. The most important thing this bill is about is saving lives. I reiterate that this bill is about making sure that ordinary Australian workers are safe. This bill will save lives. I urge all senators to support this very important bill.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2008-10-13,"—My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. Will the government commit to immediately helping our pensioners and stimulating our economy by adopting the coalition’s plan to increase the pension by at least $30 a week?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Age Pension</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2008-10-13,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I take it that is a no to the $30 a week for pensioners. If the government will not do that, will it at least commit to an immediate one-off payment, similar to the one-off $500 payment for pensioners committed to by the Canberra Liberals if elected at this Saturday’s election, which will ease the burden on this section of the community.
Government senators interjecting—
—I am glad those opposite think it is so funny. They do not live on a pensioner’s pension. Will the minister commit to at least consider that payment to ease the burden on this section of the community and, at the same time, stimulate the economy?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Age Pension</title>,Questions Without Notice,2,1,question
"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2008-10-13,"—I thank the senator for the question. It is pretty similar to questions that I have been asked in previous weeks when, on behalf of the government, I made clear our position that we have committed to reform of the pension system and that we would do that with a report which will come down by February of next year and feed into the broader taxation reform inquiry. As the Senate would know, a bipartisan Senate inquiry report recommended the review of the pension system. We have acted on that with the Harmer review, and its report—the final report—will be with us by no later than February next year.
We do understand that pensioners have been doing it tough. We therefore, in our first budget in May, made a significant down payment on providing extra financial support for pensioners. That budget contained $7.5 billion in additional payments for seniors, carers and the disabled. So we have made a significant financial commitment—an injection of payments to seniors, carers and the disabled. It may well be that the opposition have now discovered the plight of pensioners and are saying that it is not enough, but the bottom line is that they had 11 years—they had 11 budgets—to do something about this, and they did not. For them, having gone into opposition, to suddenly be all care and no responsibility is, I think, fairly cynical. The opposition may now wander around Australia saying, ‘We ought to subsidise petrol; we ought to increase pensions; we ought not to worry about having a decent sized surplus,’ and lose any credibility they once had for economic management. But we know that we are in very difficult financial times. There is a great deal of uncertainty in the global economy. Pressure is being placed on the Australian economy like it is on all other economies. We are particularly well placed compared to many other economies, but we are under pressure. We do know that these events will impact upon us. That is why this government is providing strong leadership and prudent management to ensure the financial security of all Australians.
We made a range of announcements which seek to reassure Australians about the financial position of Australia. We argue that we are very well placed comparatively. We argue that our banks are strong. But we have also taken very large measures to try and provide confidence in the market and confidence in the Australian public with a guarantee on deposits, which is part of a range of measures we have taken. So we are taking what we regard as strong, prudent measures to protect all Australians, and that includes pensioners. Pensioners also benefit from having their savings protected under the measures we announced on the weekend.

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—Some pensioners do have savings, Senator Abetz, and they are concerned about them. What our measures do is seek to allay those concerns, to reinforce the government’s confidence in our banking system and in the financial settings in the Australian economy. We will do everything we can to protect all Australians from this current financial crisis, but there will be impacts on the Australian economy. We are open and honest about that, but we are providing the sort of leadership which we think is important in these times. Rather than wandering around trying to organise stunts, I would urge the opposition to join us in that responsible approach. (Time expired)

What we are is focused on the needs of pensioners and Australian families and on providing the sort of financial security they know that they need and the sort of leadership that is required in these difficult times. That is what we are focused on. As I said, we made a huge down payment in the last budget to try and improve the lot of pensioners, carers and the disabled.

"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2008-10-13,"—I thank Senator Adams for the question, which is an important question and I know of concern to pensioners. As the Senate and Senator Adams would understand, the application of deeming rates provides a fair way of calculating returns from financial assets for pensioners. Under the rules I think initiated by the former Howard government, financial investments are assumed to earn a certain amount of income regardless of the income they actually earn. Financial investments include bank, building society and credit union accounts; managed investments; shares and securities; loans; and other investments. Current deeming rates are four per cent for the first $41,000 of a single pensioner’s financial investment and the first $68,200 of a pensioner couple’s investment, and six per cent for financial investments above those amounts. They were increased in March from 3.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent to reflect increased returns available to investors in readily accessible investments such as bank accounts. The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and the Minister for Education and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Deputy Prime Minister, are responsible for setting the deeming rates. They are currently monitoring the current deeming rate in the light of the Reserve Bank decision and other recent financial activity.
The government’s immediate priority is to ensure that falls in financial asset values are reflected in the Centrelink system as quickly as possible. Today, Centrelink has been asked to undertake a system-wide update of customer records as soon as possible. This means that the new value of shares and other financial products will be automatically factored in to determine an individual’s pension rate. In the meantime, a pensioner can ask Centrelink to update their asset values at any time. I am sure that if there are further queries on this Senator Ludwig will be able to assist in terms of Centrelink’s activities. The system-wide update will occur as soon as possible. Centrelink will receive investment information that captures recent share market events in coming weeks. This update will help ensure that pension entitlements are calculated on the most up-to-date asset values available, meaning that pensioners whose asset values have dropped may receive more in their fortnightly pension payment.
We are committed to retaining deeming rules as a simple way of evaluating the financial income of pensioners. Although the share market is volatile, interest rate products are generally steady or increasing in value and pensioners are likely to continue to have access to a range of financial products that pay returns equal to or better than the deeming rates of four and six per cent for some time.
We are very much looking to be responsive to the situation. Centrelink is undertaking a system-wide update but any pensioner can ask Centrelink to update their asset values at any time. We think this should allow us to ensure that the deeming rates remain current and provide fairness to all pensioners.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Age Pension</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-10-13,"—Clearly, that is not a question one could answer with any certainty at this time. The impact of the financial crisis is not determined. We are in a very turbulent period. A projection one would have made two weeks ago would no longer be relevant. What is the case is that this government is absolutely focused on trying to provide the strongest possible protection we can to Australian pensioners and families from the global financial crisis. We have sought to reassure people that our economy is in good shape and that our institutions are in good shape. We have taken a range of measures—including the measure announced on the weekend to guarantee deposits—which seek to provide the sort of protection that all Australians will benefit from. We remain committed to those sorts of measures. (Time expired)

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2008-10-13,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Senator Evans) to questions without notice asked by Senators Humphries and Adams today, relating to pensions.
Referring to ‘answers’ might be an overly generous reference to what Senator Evans had to tell the Senate today about the government’s response to the plight of Australian pensioners. The minister declined to indicate whether the government would support the $30 a week increase which the opposition has placed very squarely on the agenda. He declined to indicate whether there would even be a response to the idea of a one-off payment to Australian pensioners who are facing immediate difficulties in light of a number of serious economic pressures. He was unable to enlighten the Senate in answer to the question from Senator Adams as to whether there was any information as to the number of Australian retired people who might be pushed towards collecting the pension or a part pension in light of deteriorating returns from share portfolios.
We have here a government which is somewhat ignorant about the extent of the plight facing Australian pensioners, has an attitude which is contumelious, even contemptuous, of Australian pensioners and the difficulties that they presently are facing. The government’s lack of interest, their lack of focus on making a difference to the financial position of these people is really very disturbing. In fact, Mr Deputy President, I think it behoves all of us in this place today to try and imagine what kind of pressures are being faced by these people and what uncertainty must confront them today as they look at what is unfolding about them. Consider their position over the last 12 months or so. They have seen real increases in the cost of the basics that they consume each day of the week. Grocery costs, the cost of rent or other financial costs associated with housing, and the costs of maintaining their houses have gone up, as has the cost of buying petrol to move about and to stay inside the community. All of those things have risen quite dramatically. We have seen of course other unfortunate economic messages being received by Australian pensioners, which must make them even more uncertain about where the future is heading.
Obviously in the past decisions were made, particularly by the former coalition government, to link Australian pensioner’s pensions with measures of indexation to provide them with some sort of security in these circumstances. The decision to link pensions to the expansion in the male total average weekly earnings was an important decision to provide some security for people who are living in retirement in this country. But those decisions do not, by themselves, provide enough of a barrier to these sorts of pressures to provide everybody with a sense of security. Everybody, of course, has a different financial position. That is why a $30 a week increase of the kind proposed by the coalition is an appropriate and fair response to the enormous pressures which Australians in retirement are facing today.
Of course we know that there are other kinds of pensioners, or kinds of retired Australians, who are under increasing and serious pressure. Those people who are living as self-funded retirees of course have had the sight in the last few weeks of their shareholdings, upon which many self-funded retirement packages are based, reduce in value. That is a matter of considerable concern. So it is with some relief that many people in this constituency, in the Australian Capital Territory, would have regarded the announcement yesterday by the Canberra Liberals that if elected at the election this coming Saturday they would be making a one-off payment of $500 to single age pensioners to relieve the position that they find themselves in. That would have been regarded as being very positive news by those people.
However, it needs to be asked why it has to be governments at the second tier of  Australian government who are stepping into the breach in these circumstances. It is of course primarily the Commonwealth government which should be providing for the income security of Australians in retirement, particularly those on pensions. It is a dismal condemnation of the performance—or lack of it—of the federal government at this time that state governments or state oppositions are now looking at providing additional support to those people who are on pensions to face the pressures and to deal with those issues in a proper and appropriate way. They at least understand that we owe something to these people and that these are Australians who are owed a great deal because of the wealth that they built for Australians of today. To not provide them with security in their retirement is a completely disgraceful sham.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Age Pension</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,5,1,speech
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2008-10-13,"—I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate today. Once again, it is an opportunity to highlight the sheer hypocrisy and duplicity of those on the other side of the chamber. For Senator Humphries to actually raise this issue in relation to the ACT election, to try and politicise an issue as important as this in the middle of an ACT election, just shows what a cruel stunt this is. By doing that, Senator Humphries actually demeans the push that he has tried to make today. This is also a stunt that has been put forward by the member for Wentworth and the Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull. He is following on from the Evel Knievel of Australian politics, Brendan Nelson—the man who came up with some of the greatest stunts we have seen in this parliament. We saw him in the truck driving around, we saw his fuel stunt and then he came up with his stunt on seniors. You may ask: how do we know that this is a stunt? Why is it a stunt? It is pretty clear: it is a stunt because in his policy he has left out two million pensioners. Two million pensioners have been left out of their plan. They talk about single pensioners. What about married pensioners? What about carers? What about pensioners with a disability? What about widows? There are two million people who miss out under the coalition’s plan for just a basic $30 increase, a figure that was not based on any science but simply plucked out of thin air. That is how we know that it is a stunt.
The government appreciates how important this issue is. We appreciate that seniors have made a contribution to this country. We appreciate that the population is ageing and that something needs to be done. That is why, in the 2008-09 budget, we did something. We took concrete action, and it amounts to an additional $5.2 billion over five years. This compares to $1.3 billion provided to seniors in the last Howard budget. The Rudd government has increased support for single age pensioners—on an individual basis—above and beyond their fortnightly payments by $900 this year. That is made up of a permanent increase in the utilities allowance from $107 per annum to $500 per annum and a $500 bonus, which amounts to a six per cent increase in single age pensioner income. On top of this we have also indexed it, with pensioners receiving a $9.10 per fortnight increase in March 2008 and a further increase of $15.30 in September 2008. That is concrete action from this side of the House and concrete action by the Rudd government.
Let us compare this to the coalition and to the Liberal Party. Senator Humphries has come in today and tried to use this issue, as I said, to score political points in the ACT election. What he forgets to say is that the Liberals and the Nationals were in government for 12 years. They had 12 years to do something about this issue. He forgets to talk about Mal Brough, who took to the cabinet a plan to increase the base rate of the pension by a similar amount. What happened? They knocked him over. Malcolm Turnbull was part of that. He sat at the cabinet table that opposed an increase for pensioners, opposed an increase to the base rate. He was there. How duplicitous of him now to come forward with it as his policy.
In fact, Malcolm Turnbull has form on this. Let us talk about his interview with Steve Price. We all remember what the shadow ageing minister, Margaret May, said to Steve Price on 16 May 2008. Price said:

Let me just be clear there, the opposition is now endorsing an increase in the base rate of the pension.

To which the shadow minister replied:

Yes. Absolutely.

That looks pretty clear cut to me. And what did Malcolm Turnbull say straight after?
We have not got a policy to raise the base rate of the pension.’
He said, ‘We have not got a policy.’ We all read in the Sunday Telegraph two weeks ago that Malcolm Turnbull said that he did not support Brendan Nelson’s plan. It is there. This is just sheer duplicity by the Liberal Party. They had 12 years to do something about this issue—12 years to help pensioners. There are two million pensioners who need that support now.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Age Pension</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,5,1,speech
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2008-10-13,"—It is extraordinary to listen to what Senator Arbib has to say. I preface my comments today by saying that this is a man who is touting himself as a future cabinet minister. I fear for the future of the Rudd government if this is the talent that is going to be in the cabinet. Senator Arbib has said today that, because the coalition bill only seeks to redress disadvantage for age pensioners and only seeks to redress disadvantage for veterans, that is not good enough and so nothing should be done. If you cannot have all of the cake, according to Senator Arbib, you should have none. That is simply arrant nonsense, and it is from a contemptuous government.
This is a government without a heart. It is a government that is hopelessly out of touch with the needs of the people of Australia. The government is prepared to ignore the plight of the Australian senior. It is prepared to ignore the plight of the veterans who are struggling to make ends meet. It is prepared to ignore the very real demands that they have to be able to heat their homes, to put food on the table, to access their local community clubs and to volunteer in the community. They need funds to do that. Some people are doing it really tough. This is a government that admits that people cannot afford to live on the age pension—no-one in the government has been prepared to admit that they can—but still the government does nothing.
Where are their priorities? That is the question, because whilst Australians are suffering and doing it very tough, Senator Arbib, your leadership is flying overseas trying to create moral crises and is seeking audiences with people about climate change in moves that are going to put up the price of electricity in this country by 40 per cent—and they are still out there doing that. One leader talks at press conferences about how he has dialled all the leaders of countries all over the world. None of them ring him because they know he is quite insignificant, but he rings them all trying to say, ‘Look, I’m star-struck’, like a schoolgirl at a Miley Cyrus concert. I would say to you, Senator Arbib, not to look at Miley Cyrus but to look at Billy Ray Cyrus and the words that he penned—‘don’t break my heart, my achey-breakey heart’—because I tell you now that Australian pensioners’ hearts are broken. They have been broken by this government because you have promised so much and delivered so little. This is where the coalition has to pick up the mantle. We have drafted a bill which we have brought into this place, and it has got through here because people have supported it. The only people who do not support it and the only people who do not want to see some changes for pensioners leading to benefits are on the other side of the chamber, members of the Labor Party.
Senator Arbib comes in here with his canned notes—and he has been sent in here because he wants to be a cabinet minister—and he says, ‘Oh, look, we can’t do anything. We’ve only got a surplus of $23 billion and we’re not going to do anything until we get the reports.’ Let me tell you this, Mr Deputy President: if you give pensioners a $30 a week pension rise, that will help them to buy more. That will help to stimulate the Australian economy and that will help to grow our economy in a very difficult financial time. But what does the government do?

Senator Arbib interjecting—

—It is still in denial about it all. It is a tragedy, one that is happening in our own backyard. It is a tragedy that this government is more focused on things such as spin, is more focused on its own media profile and is more focused on its members climbing the greasy pole to get into cabinet rather than helping pensioners through a crisis. Senator Arbib was just talking about a crisis; I heard him interject to that effect. There is a crisis at home. Yes, there is an economic crisis—we know that—but there is also a human crisis that is taking place under the noses of this very government, and there are none so blind as those who do not want to see.
Those opposite do not want to see. They admit it and then they wash their hands of it; they do the Pontius Pilate—‘No, it’s not our fault. We’re not going to have anything to do with it. It’s due to 12 years of inaction.’ That is arrant nonsense too, because for 12 years our coalition government did everything we possibly could and so pensions are markedly higher. We took a policy to the last election for pensions to better reflect the cost of living but unfortunately we were not able to enact that. But this government is full of inaction. It has not even got a policy to lighten the load of pensioners so as to see them do better. That is the tragedy of it. We have had enough talk, spin, symposiums, orchestrated media releases and things. We actually want to see some action for those in society that are really doing it tough. So it is very hard for me to sit here and listen to what the people on the other side have to say when they say, ‘Oh, we’re not going to do anything till next year.’ Next year will be too late. Pensioners need some help now. The government should get on with the job.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Age Pension</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,5,1,speech
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2008-10-13,"—The government is happy to get on with the job. We have heard the word ‘pensions’ so many times in the last few months. Why are the senators opposite only prepared to talk about pensions now that they are in opposition? People on this side of the chamber were happy to talk about pensions while in opposition and are happy to talk about them while in government. We have got nothing to be defensive about. But those opposite, after 11 long years, do—and now you are trying to make up for lost time when you have got no power to do anything about it. Those on this side take responsibility. We understand the pressure that pensioners, especially age pensioners, are under, because a basic standard of living for those not able to support themselves is a key principle of the income support system. Every citizen should be able to meet their basic needs and to participate in Australian society.
This government is intent on properly addressing 11 years of coalition neglect. Pensioners deserve dignity in their everyday life. The unsustainable position that pensioners are in has been exacerbated by those opposite because they did not do anything in 11 long years of government. In contrast, Labor recognised the needs of pensioners in our very first budget when we substantially increased the utilities payment.
As the cost of living rises, people are finding it harder and harder to make ends meet. Today, in the current financial climate, we see that more than ever. This government takes the plight of pensioners very seriously. That is demonstrated by the quick action that the government has taken. You would have noted that in question time today it was said, as we are currently discussing, that it does take some time for financial markets to settle down in these current times of crisis. Notwithstanding that, there are people who have lost substantial amounts of income very quickly. My superannuation account has dropped by some $20,000 in the last year, with a proportion of that dropping rapidly in the last few weeks, so I know that those who are retired, are close to retiring or are at pension age will have lost vast sums of money on which they are currently dependent for deriving an income. So I think it is of vital significance to this debate that the government has already requested a system-wide update of customer records. This means that the new value of shares and other financial products is going to be automatically factored into determining an individual’s pension rate. In the meantime, pensioners really need to be encouraged to ask Centrelink to update their asset values at any time. I think this one act highlights very clearly the importance that the government places on managing our pensions system well.
These are complex issues. I do not think those opposite understand that. We can see from the financial crisis the number of different issues that can impact on the rate of pension that someone receives. There is a range of issues that the government is going to need to address. These include things like how pensions are taxed, the high effective marginal tax rates for pensioners when they undertake extra work, how people who want to do some work feel discouraged from doing so, the fact that the grants and rebates for disability pensioners do not cover the kinds of equipment that they need and the fact that the current system does not cater for the extra costs, once you turn 65, associated with having a disability, because you are automatically transferred from the disability pension to a seniors pension. There is also the fact that people currently have a choice about whether they want a carers payment or an aged-care pension. This causes a lot of confusion. This point was well addressed by Senator Arbib when he highlighted the way in which senators opposite want to give a pension increase to one cohort of people but not others, so if you are a single age pensioner you can have an increase but if you are a carer you cannot. In many cases these are the same people, so they have had to make a judgement call about whether they want to apply for a seniors pension or a carers pension. (Time expired)

"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2008-10-13,"—I also rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Evans this afternoon. Without doubt, pensioners in this country are finding it hard to make ends meet. They need more financial assistance to offer them some relief from rising petrol prices, rising rents, rising costs of pharmaceuticals and rising costs of tea and coffee. Yet Labor prefers to continue delaying the decision to provide our seniors with more financial assistance, despite the fact that both Mr Rudd and Mr Swan admitted that they could not survive on the single age pension.
The annoying part is that we have to wait until February when the Harmer report is to be handed down, and then maybe in the budget in May our pensioners will get some relief. Labor is denying pensioners urgent relief. Both Mr Rudd and Mr Swan have been all over the place on the pensions issue, giving promises one day only to take them back the day after. Australian pensioners now have no idea whether the government will support them in the future. Only last week, Mr Rudd hosed down expectations that older Australians could get an increase in their pensions in next year’s budget. Mr Rudd said that the federal government may not be able to afford extra payments now due to the effects of the global credit crisis.
I note in the West Australian today that the number of elderly people now going to the food bank and the soup kitchen has grown dramatically, and the number of young people who are unable to get accommodation has also increased over the last month. These issues, with the global credit crisis, are certainly starting to play havoc for those people who are really and truly battling insofar as their pensions are concerned. If the government is not going to do anything until next May, I just wonder how these people are going to exist and what can be done. This is why the opposition is doing its best to raise the issue with the government time and time again, so that they will finally, hopefully, take action.
The Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Mr Lindsay Tanner, backed Mr Rudd’s threat by saying to journalists last Thursday that ‘pension reform was just one of the issues on the table for the budget’ and that ‘the priority was steering the wider economy through the financial crisis’. Naturally, senior lobby groups were not happy with this announcement. Mr Tanner’s comments showed a great lack of understanding of how the economy works. He acknowledged this himself only today by stating that the government was actively considering spending part of the $26.6 billion budget surplus to stimulate the economy. Mr Tanner said that raising pensions would be one option. However he would not give details of exactly what is under consideration or when it would be put into action.
Mr Tanner was forced to make this announcement today after the Australia Institute published a discussion paper yesterday which stated that an immediate increase in the pension would be the right measure to deal with the global credit crisis. The Australia Institute said that pensions should be increased to boost the national economy giving it an immediate injection of cash. The Australia Institute also said:
Pensioners spend less money on imported cars and overseas holidays than higher income earners, which means that the money has a greater affect on the Australian economy.
It is interesting, is it not, that Mr Rudd and Mr Tanner said last week that they would probably not be able to find any money for pensioners in next year’s budget due to the global credit crunch; yet, on the other hand, experts and think tanks say that the best way to deal with the credit crisis is to increase the pensions. I urge the government to give pensioners more money before Christmas. The best way to do this is to pass the Urgent Relief for Single Age Pensioners Bill 2008 in the House of Representatives, granting an increase in the single age, single service age and the widow B pension of $30 a week. Pensioners need this money now, not next year, and so does the Australian economy.

"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2008-10-13,"—It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death on 29 September, 2008 of Dr Glenister Fermoy Sheil, a senator for the state of Queensland from 1974 to 1981 and from 1984 to 1990.

"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2008-10-13,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate records its deep regret at the death on 29 September 2008 of Dr Glenister (Glen) Fermoy Sheil, former Senator for Queensland and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his wife in her bereavement.
Dr Sheil was born in Sydney in 1929 but spent his childhood moving around Australia, attending schools in Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania, before studying medicine at the University of Queensland. In 1955 he married another medical student, Dr Marjorie Sheil. The couple spent the early 1960s living in London, where they both completed postgraduate medical studies. Dr Sheil went on to qualify as a specialist physician, concentrating on cardiology and geriatrics. After returning to Australia, he opened his own private hospital in Brisbane.
In his maiden speech in 1974, Dr Sheil recalled that the catalyst for his participation in politics was his passion for health policy. It seems that he had a strong passion to oppose Labor health policy, but he obviously did it with a great deal of personal commitment and with a strong background in the area.
When he ran for the Senate in 1974 and was placed at the bottom of the Queensland Country Party ticket, he campaigned around Queensland on the issue of Medibank and managed a surprise victory for the 10th Queensland Senate seat. Dr Sheil resigned from the Senate in 1981 to go into project management. But he was drawn back into politics by his strident opposition to the Hawke government’s Medicare scheme and was elected to the Senate again in 1984. Very few of us would contemplate making the same mistake twice, Mr President, but Dr Sheil did. On 20 December 1977, he was sworn in to the Executive Council, having been nominated by Prime Minister Fraser to be the Minister for Veteran’s Affairs—but he did not get there. The Prime Minister subsequently withdrew the nomination, following publicity given to the senator’s views on apartheid, which ran counter to the then government’s policy. His swearing-in as a minister did not take place, and Dr Sheil’s appointment to the Executive Council was subsequently terminated on 22 December. I think he will always have a place in the history of ministerial appointments in this country.
He is remembered for making a very significant contribution to Australian public life as a National Party senator for Queensland. He served on a number of committees, including as the Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce from 1976 to 1981 and as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare and the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs as well as the Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance. Dr Sheil participated in parliamentary delegations to China, the UK and Ireland and attended the 1978 CPA conference in Jamaica. The senator served three times as the Country National Party whip in the Senate between 1981 and 1990.
In addition to being a vocal proponent of private health care and a critic of the Whitlam and Hawke governments’ health policies, Dr Sheil was outspoken on a wide range of other issues, including education, wheat deregulation, tax policy and immigration. While serving as a senator, Dr Sheil started up the interhouse tennis competition, I am reliably informed. He was obviously a very talented sportsman, having received the Royal Agricultural Society’s sportsman of the year award in 1956. He represented Queensland in tennis, rugby and squash—quite an achievement. He was a foundation member of the Queensland Rugby Union Club, the Brisbane Tennis Association and the Queensland Cricketers Club, as well as a life member of the Queensland Lawn Tennis Association. He was a very active man in all facets of his life and very committed to public affairs.
Sadly, Dr Marjorie Sheil passed away in 1989, and, in 1990, Dr Sheil retired from the Senate. He continued his work as a medical specialist and proprietor of the Fermoy Private Hospital in Brisbane. He was a life member of the Australian Medical Association—Australia’s strongest trade union—and a chairman of the Australian Leukaemia Fund, raising $1.5 million for a new bone marrow transplant unit. He was also an ardent monarchist and was elected as a Queensland delegate to the 1998 Constitutional Convention, where he led the Queenslanders for a Constitutional Monarchy group. I wonder what he would make of Malcolm Turnbull being the Leader of the Opposition now! He clearly maintained an ongoing strong interest in public affairs. In 2002 he published a book, A companion to the Australian Constitution on understanding the Constitution. Dr Sheil is survived by his second wife, Elizabeth. On behalf of the government, I offer her our condolences on her loss. Dr Sheil was obviously a very significant senator. He made a large contribution both here and in public life more generally. I am sure the Senate will endorse the regret that I have expressed on behalf of the government at his passing.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Dr Glenister Fermoy Sheil</title>,Condolences,6,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2008-10-13,"—I rise to support the motion moved by Senator Evans in relation to a senator I had the pleasure of knowing. As Senator Evans has described, Dr Sheil could rightly be described as having had a colourful career in the Australian Senate as a representative of, first, the Country Party and then the National Party for his adopted state of Queensland. He had a background as both a rabbit farmer and a medical practitioner before entering the Senate. As you can see from the body of evidence, he was often in the headlines during his two terms in this place. As Senator Evans has outlined, he had a very keen interest in sport. He represented his own state in several sports, which is a remarkable feat.
As Senator Evans also said, it was Senator Sheil’s professional career in health which brought him to put his hand up for federal parliament. As Senator Sheil described it, ‘the fiery fingers of the federal government coming between him and his patients’ was enough to motivate him to seek federal office. He first came into this place in 1974 and then again in 1975. Indeed, his original election in 1974 was remarkable given that he was No. 6 on the joint Liberal Party-Country Party ticket for that double dissolution election. At that time, there were only 10 senators per state. It was a remarkable result for the Liberal and Country parties and led to Glen Sheil winning a seat in this chamber. He actually tendered his resignation in 1981, as I understand it, to contest the Gold Coast seat of McPherson for his party. Fortunately, from the point of view of my party, he was unsuccessful, because that seat was held by the Liberal Party. That brought none other than Lady Flo Bjelke-Petersen into this place when she filled his casual vacancy.
Senator Sheil came back into this place in 1984. I imagine there are very few senators who have resigned from the Senate and then been successfully re-elected. That must put him in the history books. That means that, at least, Ron Boswell and Julian McGauran, on our side of this chamber, would have had the pleasure of serving with Glen. He was an active committee participant in his time in the Senate in a range of portfolios. He was also party whip for the Country and National parties in the Senate on three occasions during his two stints in the Senate.
As has been mentioned, Senator Sheil was most famous for his brief appointment to the Executive Council in 1977. As a then very junior research officer at the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party, I well remember the ecstasy of winning in 1977 followed by the drama of losing a minister before he had even been sworn in. Indeed, today in the media section of the Australian, which is now compulsory reading for me in my new role, my good friend Nikki Savva has reminded us all that it was she who, in trying to dig up a story on the new ministry, rang Glen Sheil and asked him, with great friendliness and joy, about his views on some controversial issues. As Nikki has said today, his career ended after three short sentences. As Nikki would put it—and she is of Greek origin—the moral of the story is: beware of friendly journalists bearing gifts! One must be extremely careful of being sucked in by overly friendly journalists—and Nikki was very good at it. Glen, to his credit, said exactly what he thought on the issue of apartheid but, having been published and given great prominence by Nikki’s then newspaper, that meant Malcolm Fraser was in a position where he could not proceed to appoint Glen to the ministry. I guess that compares to the recent case of a New South Wales Labor minister who, I think, lasted some three or four hours in his role.
Two years after nearly being sworn in as Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Glen Sheil said that he would very much have liked to have been Minister for Veterans’ Affairs but that he suffered ‘death by the media’ and his comments on apartheid were misrepresented. I am not sure that he was misrepresented. I think he stated exactly what he felt. It is to his credit that he was very upfront in what he felt and in what he believed. He never did shy away from very strongly held views. He was very active in this parliament in trying to give force to his views and to alter policy to reflect his view of the world.
It is very unusual in the National and Country parties, but in 1989 he did cross the floor to vote against the Hawke and Keating government’s deregulation of the domestic wheat industry—although that was supported by the then opposition. As Senator Evans noted, Glen’s first wife, Marjorie, died from breast cancer in 1989 at the relatively tender age of 58. They had been married for many, many years. He was very active in his life after politics, going back to his first love of medicine. Then, in 1998—again as Senator Evans mentioned—Senator Sheil was a Queensland delegate to the Howard government’s Constitutional Convention, representing the Constitutional Monarchists group in Queensland. I was the minister responsible for organising that convention, and I am a Constitutional Monarchist myself, so I well remember Glen’s presence and his great contribution to the success of the convention.
On behalf of the coalition I place on record our great appreciation of Glen’s public service and of our acknowledgement of the great honesty and energy that he brought to his role. We tender our profound sympathy to his wife, Elizabeth, in her bereavement.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Dr Glenister Fermoy Sheil</title>,Condolences,6,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-10-13,"—I want to add to the remarks of both the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate in regard to Dr Glen Fermoy Sheil. My correspondence with Dr Sheil was mainly by phone, generally around preselection time. Being an honorary life member of the National Party, he assured me that I had his vote; I suppose because I am here I must have had it.
Glen was born in Sydney on 21 October 1929, the son of William and Agnes May Sheil. His father was CEO of Mount Morgan Mines and he attended a range of schools including Benalla High, Hutchins School in Tasmania and the Southport School in Queensland. Later he attended the University of Queensland, where he attained a degree in medicine. He was also a very prominent rugby player—in fact, he played rugby for Queensland. Apart from practising as a doctor he was also the owner of the private hospital at Auchenflower and a company director.
Dr Sheil was good friends with—and had as a patient—Sir Robert Sparkes, a long-term president of the National Party, and this assisted in his attaining preselection for the Senate. Dr Sheil was elected to the Senate in 1974. As Senator Minchin pointed out, he won the final 10th position in a battle with Mal Colston and a gentleman from the DLP—Condon Byrne, I think it was. He lived in interesting times. He resigned in 1981 to run for the seat of McPherson on the Gold Coast. There were discussions at the time about a certain preselection and preferences deal, but Dr Sheil and the Nationals stuck to their guns rather than do the deal. As a result they lost the seat. This goes to show, I hope, the consistency in beliefs of who you deal with and who you do not. As part of his campaign for McPherson he was known for walking the whole length of the Gold Coast. After his failure in McPherson he did, however, manage to make it back to the Senate in 1984, as No. 4 on the National Party Senate ticket. He was part of the pinnacle of the National Party’s representation in the Senate, when the Nats sent four senators, just from Queensland, down here: Lady Flo Bjelke-Petersen, Dr John Stone, Senator Ron Boswell—who is still with us now—and Dr Glen Sheil.
Dr Sheil was a fanatical sportsman. He loved rugby, squash and tennis, and he was—as has been pointed out—the Royal Agricultural Show National Fitness Sportsman of the Year in 1956. He was a foundation member of the Queensland Rugby Union. It would be wrong not to mention some of the colour that made up Dr Glen Sheil. He was known for having strong views and for not being at all afraid to express them—sometimes repeatedly. This is a time that may have passed from us in politics, which is a shame. One such view was his belief that the starvation of the Bantu people in Africa could be averted by a diet of rabbits, something which he knew a lot about, owning, as he did, a rabbit farm called Thumper Industries. Glen was the shortest-serving minister in the history of the parliament, after endorsing apartheid and suggesting its merits for Australia. In fact, Glen never actually got sworn in after his appointment. He was—as was pointed out—part of the executive council, but he was never actually sworn in as a minister. This is part of the colourful tapestry of politics. We are here in varying philosophical shapes and sizes. Though we may not agree with the views of others we know our nation is truly free when such views are extolled and the only cost is to ministerial prospects.
Glen was known by his colleagues as being a good doctor. He never had children but was married twice. His first wife, also a doctor, Marjorie, passed away in 1989 after suffering breast cancer. Glen then married a second time, to Elizabeth, the daughter of the VC winner Lieutenant Colonel Charles Anderson. Dr Sheil believed in the right of gun ownership—that it was vital for the freedom of Australia. In early political speeches he managed to do other extraordinary things, such as read the Lord’s Prayer in nine different South African languages. Dr Sheil voted with the Democrats against the deregulation of the domestic wheat industry, but he was also National Party Whip from 1980 to 1981, 1985 to 1987 and for a short period in 1990. Dr Sheil was the first chairman of the Southport School Foundation—it is one of the oldest private schools in Queensland, and possibly in Australia. Dr Sheil was highly energetic, and a capable and colourful character who will long be remembered. In true National Party form he was contentious, articulate and not scared of being forthright in his views, or of accepting the costs that his convictions and views brought.
In a day when preselections are scripted, views are sanitised and we are delivering pallid, boring exposes so as not to cause any waves, Dr Glen Sheil could not have survived. But in an environment where Australia had broader political shoulders and people had more fortitude to truly present their views as they held them, regardless of the consequences, Dr Sheil flourished. Such was the colour of this person. Dr Sheil’s passing gives further passage of Australian politics into the sanitised, boring, pallid porridge of predictable views and predictable lines out of predictable people from a central office run by pimply little boys who have never had a job away from politics.
I did not share all of Dr Sheil’s views. Dr Sheil was a pro-choicer; I am a pro-lifer. Obviously on that one we had vastly different views. Dr Sheil was a monarchist, gun lobbyist, pro-choice advocate, doctor, senator, husband and rabbit farmer. I do not agree with all that Dr Sheil was but I hope that the better aspects of his character have found favour with God.

"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2008-10-13,"—I rise to speak in respect of the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and the Safe Work Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2008. The coalition support, essentially, the spirit of these bills but we question whether the bills as currently drafted are able to deliver on that spirit. The spirit of the two bills is apparently to harmonise occupational health and safety and workers compensation laws across states and territories and nationally, with a view to achieving what we all want, which is safer and more productive workplaces. However, the coalition has grave concerns about whether the bills as currently drafted will in fact deliver harmonisation in terms of occupational health and safety and workers compensation laws and will in fact deliver safer and more productive workplaces.
In the provisions reflected in these bills the coalition sees yet again a failure of the Rudd government to deliver on its promise of the formulation of evidence based policy to the benefit of all Australians. How so with these bills? Business has long supported consistent national outcomes and regulation in respect of occupational health and safety and workers compensation. These bills beg, however, the questions as to the government’s true purpose in drafting the bills as it has and, secondly, as to how it proposes to deliver harmonised outcomes and safer and more productive workplaces.
Businesses largely support consistent and harmonised outcomes, particularly those businesses that operate across interstate borders. They will have concerns about how this unrolls in practical terms. They will have concerns, for example, about the potential substance of the regulation if, for example, the substance of the regulation results in the higher and highest of all standards across the states and nationally without there being evidence based assessment of why that should be so. Business will have concerns if the aim for nationally consistent and harmonised outcomes results in an equal or increased amount of red tape to what exists today.
So what is the government doing in terms of this legislation—the ‘how’? In terms of the how, they are proposing legislation that will give states the veto—the say-so—and make this new body subject to the whim of the ministerial advisory council. The government is setting up a new body that is designed to fail. The states thus far have not been able to come up with a harmonised occupational health and safety and workers compensation system yet the government is now supposedly designing a new system aimed at achieving that which still gives the states the power. And it gives the states the power in a number of ways, including a diminution in the current number of people able to represent not only the business sector but also the union sector on this new body. It essentially gives the balance of power to the states, added to which is the influence and overriding influence of the ministerial advisory council.
In so doing, the government stands to ignore the input of the very partners that the government needs to bring about safer and more productive workplaces—that is, the trade union movement and their members and employer organisations and their members. The government has not explained why it sees fit to diminish the number of representatives of each of those partners in the workplace. Nor has the government seen fit to explain the ‘why’, to justify the basis upon which it proposes to no longer nominate, for example, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry as the peak body of employers and the Australian Council of Trade Unions as the peak body of employees.
It should be incumbent on those two organisations to demonstrate why they should be the peak bodies in respect of their membership, but it raises an interesting question as to why a government does not contemplate having peak bodies to represent both of those sectors. I would put it to you that part of the thinking is to find an array of opinion so that the government can support a particular state by finding some stakeholder who comes up with the outcome that the government wants on any particular issue at any particular time. The legislation needs clearly nominated peak organisations for employers and employees for the workplace partnerships.
The government needs to explain why the states will be given veto powers, why the Workplace Relations Ministers Council needs to retain such influence, why an ACCI and an ACTU would no longer be nominated as peak bodies representative of their sectors, and why the numbers of employee representatives and the numbers of employer representatives should be reduced from what they are now. The government needs to show us that they are not intent on, instead, providing themselves with a payback mechanism for their state mates, as has been enjoyed, for example, in the COAG context in respect of water—and I need not name the states which have enjoyed unfair treatment in that forum. We look forward to the committee stage of the legislation and to the government demonstrating its evidence based policy approach to achieving safer and productive workplaces across Australia.",SENATE,<title>SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2008-10-13,"—I rise to speak in support of the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and related bill. The purpose of the legislation is to establish Safe Work Australia as an independent Commonwealth statutory body to improve both occupational health and safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements in Australia. The legislation establishes the operational arrangements to support Safe Work Australia, including those relating to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. Safe Work Australia will be a reform focused body with the power to make recommendations directly to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council and will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, which was established by the former Howard government as an advisory council, whose functions were limited and were confined to coordinating, monitoring and promoting national efforts on health and safety and on workers compensation.
A further difference from the former Howard government’s attempts towards safer workplaces is that the budget for Safe Work Australia will be funded 50 per cent from the Commonwealth and 50 per cent from the states and territories. Safe Work Australia will be an inclusive tripartite body of 15 members. The membership will comprise an independent chair, nine members representing the Commonwealth and each state and territory, two members representing the interests of workers, two members representing the interests of employers and a CEO. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations will make all appointments to Safe Work Australia based on nominations from each body.
As a former long-distance line-haul truckie, I know nothing more important than the value of getting home safely at the end of a hard day’s yakka—and every worker should expect to have that right. Every Australian worker has a fundamental right not only to get home safely but to expect and receive the highest level of occupational health and safety standards not only from their employers but also from their fellow employees.
It is important for us to acknowledge that, whilst occupational health and safety is an important issue to us all, we in Australia still do not have a single system of reviewing and improving occupational health and safety standards. This legislation will address this. In Australia right now we have nine systems of assessing and monitoring occupational health and safety—one for each of the six states and two territories and one for the Commonwealth. Each of these systems performs an important role and protects workers’ interests. However the duplication of systems often becomes confusing and does not allow the system to fully address all occupational health and safety issues.
The Rudd Labor government’s Safe Work Australia will improve occupational health and safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements in Australia by streamlining all systems and creating a greater, safer outcome for Australian workers and for all Australian workplaces. The former Howard government did little to address occupational health and safety. The Howard era did very little more than make occupational health and safety more complex and created a complicated framework of funding and responsibilities. There were differences in jurisdictions, and different employers, under differing state and Commonwealth rules, were subject to varying standards. By attempting to attract national employers to be part of the then Commonwealth system, the Howard government attempted to usurp the state and territory governments and consolidate power. The approach of the Rudd Labor government could not be more different.
Through cooperative federalism, the Commonwealth government has sat down with the states and territories and worked out a solution which is in everyone’s interest, not in just the political interest of one conservative government. Cooperative federalism may be one of this government’s greatest achievements. Rather than blaming and bickering between governments, the Rudd Labor government has been able to bring together states and territories to make real progress towards reductions in duplication, as well as improving consistency. A more efficient Australia will be able to better perform and increase productivity.
I draw senators’ attention to the funding approach of this legislation, which is further evidence of the cooperation between state and territory governments in Australia. Safe Work Australia will, unlike its predecessors, be a body which is jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the states so that the states have a real sense of ownership in what Safe Work Australia ultimately does and in what occupational health and safety objectives they can achieve. Safe Work Australia’s goal is to develop national policy around occupational health and safety and workers compensation and, importantly, to guide us down the path of harmonising our nation’s differing occupational health and safety laws. Safe Work Australia will provide new benchmarks. It will be another example of why Labor is the party of reform. This is a very significant step towards ensuring higher standards of occupational health and safety in this country.
This bill will be good for business, good for government and good for workers. These reforms are part of the Rudd Labor government’s goal of creating a seamless national economy that is not being dragged down by duplications and border disputes between states and territories.
The average figures for workplace injuries in my home state of WA are terrible figures. Fifty-one Western Australians—I say again: 51 West Aussies—are injured at work every day. In an effort to reduce this number and improve education about occupational health and safety, the former WA Labor state government ran the ‘Come home safe’ campaign. This was a state-wide television and radio advertising and information program that supported the state government’s priority of safer communities and safer workplaces. It aimed to make workplaces safer by achieving a positive change in workplace safety culture and practices. The campaign focused on the importance of arriving home safely from work and featured children and family members waiting for their loved ones. This campaign was broadcast and communicated across WA, and from most accounts it was very effective in raising awareness of workplace safety—but it was unfortunately limited to WA.
Each of the separate state and territory occupational health and safety organisations attempts to communicate the message of workplace safety, but not all are able to do so effectively or have the resources to do so. Figures from the Western Australian Department of Consumer and Employment Protection estimate that on average a WA worker is killed every 19 days, while a worker is seriously injured every 30 minutes. If Safe Work Australia can reduce the chances of only one family losing a loved one through an accident at work then it will have been a success and a sound use of resources. More than 300 Australians, sadly, are killed each year at their workplace and many more die as a result of work related diseases that could have been avoided.
Each year over 140,000 Australians are seriously injured at work. The cost to our economy has been estimated at $34 billion per year. The cost to those injured and to their families, workmates and friends cannot be measured. Between 1997 and 2006 around 147,800 compensation claims were accepted. Across Australia during the same period, sadly, approximately 300 deaths occurred each year. That means that 2,700 people died from a workplace related accident. According to the peak workers body in my state of Western Australia, UnionsWA, 460 people died in the workplace between 1988 and 2008. That is just in Western Australia alone. UnionsWA’s figures also tell us that there has been a gradual decrease in fatalities, from a high point of 36 in 1988 to a low point of 12 in 2006. Unfortunately, that figure increased to 25 in 2006-07 and 27 in 2007-08. But 460 workplace fatalities in Western Australia over this period is clearly unacceptable. The fatalities were from across industries: 136 fatalities in the mining industry; 104 in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries industry; 70 in the construction industry; and 31 in the manufacturing industry.
A figure that I wish to go to now is that relating to deaths involving heavy vehicles, truckies and other users of the road networks, because these figures would not be captured in workplace fatality numbers; they would be recorded as road or traffic deaths. Once again I will refer to my time on the road. This really is dear to my heart. I can probably also speak for Senator Williams on the other side, another good-blooded ex-truckie in this chamber. I know that he would hold work safety close to his heart, especially for those men and women out there on the roads hauling all our produce and materials through the dark hours of the night—those unseen champions of industry who go about their job every day and every night without so much as a whimper. In 2007 there were over 200 road deaths in Australia involving heavy vehicles. One in five road deaths involve heavy vehicles. In other words, the heavy vehicle transport sector is a significant contributor to Australia’s road toll. In 2007 road fatalities involving an articulated truck increased by 5.4 per cent. Trucks as a whole account for approximately six per cent of total vehicle kilometres travelled but are involved in approximately 15 per cent of all road fatalities. Over the past five years over 1,000 Australians have died as a result of a road accident involving a heavy truck. Those are sobering figures. Three-quarters of these fatal accidents involved an articulated truck. These statistics place transport workers at high risk of death or serious injury in their workplace, an unacceptable situation. I cannot stress this enough. When we talk about road fatalities and truckies: their workplace is the cabin of that truck; their workplace is that bitumen road underneath them. That is why it is so frightening to hear these statistics. They would not be picked up in any workplace fatality statistics that we collect, but they are workers who are killed while doing their job.
A national body of coordination will improve occupational health and safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements in Australia. Through Safe Work Australia we will have one body that is tasked to address the national problem of occupational health and safety standards in Australia. This new body is being tasked with some important jobs. Safe Work Australia will develop a national policy relating to occupational health and safety and workers compensation; develop, prepare, monitor and revise model occupational health and safety standards and model codes of practice; develop a compliance and enforcement policy to ensure nationally consistent regulatory approaches across all jurisdictions; develop proposals relating to the harmonisation of workers compensation arrangements; collect, analyse and publish occupational health and safety and workers compensation data and undertake and publish research; drive national communication strategies to raise awareness of health and safety in the workplace; further develop the National Occupational Health and Safety Strategy; and advise the Workplace Relations Ministers Council on occupational health and safety and workers compensation matters.
This bill will raise the bar on workplace safety rules and ensure consistency in workplace standards and in the education of those standards by employers and employees to ensure that workers can work in a safe environment knowing that, if an accident were to occur, their income and family would be protected while they recovered.
Workers compensation issues and standards of occupational health and safety have been the subject of fierce debate between governments, employers and unions for many years. Jurisdictions and schemes are complicated and often inconsistent. This bill will present a way forward. This is the path towards attaining a goal of national consistency and understanding and awareness of occupational health and safety issues.
This bill continues the already significant work of the Rudd Labor government in improving cooperation between the state and federal governments, and the establishment of Safe Work Australia is an essential part of the government’s strategy to facilitate improvements to safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements across Australia. Since coming to office less than 12 months ago—I know it seems a lot longer, Madam Acting Deputy President, but it was less than 12 months ago—the Rudd government has undertaken a review of the Comcare system, set up an independent panel of experts to conduct a national occupational health and safety review and developed a landmark intergovernmental agreement with its state and territory counterparts to harmonise occupational health and safety legislation nationally.
This bill, along with the intergovernmental agreement, brings a new era of cooperation between the state, territory and federal governments on this matter. It addresses another key area of cooperative federalism that will save lives, simplify rules and reduce the cost of doing business. This will be one of the great reforms within Australian workplaces and Australian industry. As I have indicated, Safe Work Australia will be a great step forward for workers and employers and for occupational health and safety in this country. It will be the body which will take Australian workplace safety laws to the next level to simplify safety laws and make them more effective and efficient. The government has set itself the task of creating a seamless national economy unhampered by unnecessary state duplications, overlaps and differences. We do this because we care about building a better Australia now and into the future.
Occupational health and safety affects everybody. Every year, hundreds of thousands of Australians have their lives changed because of an injury at the workplace. This means that every year Australia’s poor occupational health and safety record has horrible consequences for Australian workers and Australian families. We can do something about this and we can improve Australia’s occupational health and safety standards. That is what Safe Work Australia will achieve. It is time to start the process of changing Australia’s occupational health and safety performance. That start begins with this bill, and I urge all senators to support it. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2008-10-13,"—The introduction of the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 is timely and appropriate. I am particularly proud to be a member of a government that is meticulously focused on delivering its electoral promises, for which it received a mandate at last year’s federal elections. A constructive and workable federalism requires a national and cohesive approach in legislation and in practice with regard to key issues of our time. The myriad state based occupational health and safety schemes, plus the existence of differing state based and national workers compensation schemes, do not augur well for achieving economies of scale. The introduction of the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008, of which I am a proud supporter, is part of a comprehensive policy strategy to cement productivity gains and efficiencies through national standards that will take effect throughout Australia.
As is often noted by members and senators, 140,000 Australians are injured at work every year, at a cost to the nation of approximately $34 billion. The current approach to occupational health and safety and workers compensation needs to be improved. The standards of workplace safety and the level of compensation benefits should not be contingent upon where one resides in Australia. Geographical and state based anomalies are no longer acceptable in the 21st century in modern society. Australian employers do not require the regulatory duplication, the burden and the red tape of operating in at least half-a-dozen forms of state occupational health and safety and workers compensation jurisdictions. These include the national Comcare system, a scheme originally designed to administer workers compensation entitlements to federal public servants but which has now morphed into a de facto national scheme by stealth through the inclusion in Comcare of private enterprises that operate Australia wide.
Incremental anomalies and untenable outcomes will continue to prevail and grow if this Safe Work Australia Bill is not allowed to pass through the Senate. Long-term decisions need to be made within a national framework that allows clarity and certainty for employer decision making. A miner at Mt Isa should expect the same occupational health and safety and workers compensation entitlements as a miner working in the Pilbara region. Safe Work Australia, as the Deputy Prime Minister has pointed out, will not be a toothless, Howard-era advisory council but rather will be, as the minister describes it, ‘an independent, reform focused body, with the power to make recommendations directly to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council’.
For 24 years, Australian governments of all persuasions—and, by extension, Australian citizens—have satisfied themselves with the iniquities and inequities of varying occupational health and safety and workers compensation laws. We do not expect the Medicare system, for example, to provide different financial outcomes for our citizens depending on which part of Australia they reside in. Accordingly, we should expect no less from our occupational health and safety and workers compensation laws. This bill must be supported in the Senate so that the urgent and overlooked imperative to harmonise these laws is not delayed for a moment longer than it should be.
As the Prime Minister has noted on many occasions, this government is here to serve all Australians, not just sectional interests. It is for this reason that Safe Work Australia will be a tripartite body encompassing broad representation and allowing for the expression of the voices of employers, workers, state governments and territory governments.
Safe Work Australia will be enacted into law as a prescribed agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act, while from an administrative perspective the 15 members who will comprise the tripartite body will ensure that its task is not hamstrung by the creation of a bloated bureaucracy—as witnessed in the failed Howard government’s entanglement of employers in Work Choices, endless red tape and bureaucratic overlap. Work Choices was, of course, a disaster—not just for workers’ rights and conditions but also for its undermining of occupational health and safety at the workplace through its unfair dismissal provisions. Under Work Choices, if a worker complained about an occupational health and safety issue they ran the risk of being sacked if the boss did not approve of what they had to say, so we should acknowledge the important occupational health and safety benefits that come from ripping up the Work Choices legislation and replacing it with fair and balanced industrial laws.
The Liberal Party have been keen to criticise the composition of the Safe Work Australia board of directors. After consultation with the workplace relations ministerial council, the minister must select an independent chair to preside over the meetings. The minister must select a representative of the Commonwealth government, one representative nominated by each state or territory and two representatives nominated by both worker and employment groups authorised by the minister. It is at the discretion of the minister to identify which bodies represent workers and employers and to seek nominations from them. In total, there will be nine board directors representing each of the state and territory governments and the Commonwealth, two board directors representing the interests of employers, two board directors representing the interests of workers, and one independent chair.
We have heard time and time again from those opposite about the supposed injustices in the composition of the board. Their argument is that the majority of directors should be representatives from employer groups and unions and that the Australian government has got the balance wrong. I fail to see how you can have a national organisation that aims to standardise occupational health and safety policy across federal, state and territory jurisdictions without a representative of each of those governments. I challenge the Liberal Party to identify which states or territories they feel should not be represented on the Safe Work Australia board. If they feel that they should all be represented, then presumably they reckon that the Australian government should increase the number of union and employer representatives on the board until they reach parity with the government representatives. However, to do that you would need to install an additional five directors onto the board on top of the four already there, to even things out with the government representatives. But then, of course, you could not just have five extra board directors from employer and union groups because that would mean that one grouping would get one more vote than the other. To achieve what the Liberal Party is calling for you would actually need six new board directors, bringing the total board to a gigantic and unworkable 21 directors. As the saying goes, too many cooks spoil the broth.
Unless the Liberal Party are calling for some states and territories to have no representation on the Safe Work Australia board, then they can only be hoping for a massive and unworkable increase in the size of the board itself. The reality is that all major stakeholders are represented on the board of directors and they will have a say in the formation of the new occupational health and safety policy. None of these stakeholders could be removed from the board without Safe Work Australia losing its ability to effectively coordinate occupational health and safety policy across all jurisdictions. The Australian government has got the balance right between all stakeholders, and I am confident that Safe Work Australia will improve the efficiency and safety of workers.
In my former role as secretary of the South Australian branch of the SDA, it was my job to help ensure that retail workers could perform their duties safely in the workplace. While the SDA has been successful in fighting for safer workplaces in the retail industry, it is an unfortunate fact that avoidable workplace injuries still occur in the retail industry across Australia. The phasing out of plastic bags at retail outlets has the potential to exacerbate that problem. While I applaud any moves to protect the environment, it should be noted that in our switching to reusable mesh or calico shopping bags it is retail workers who are likely to pay the price. These reusable shopping bags can hold more items than ordinary plastic shopping bags and can therefore become substantially heavier. Considering how often the checkout operator must lift shopping bags every day for extended periods of time, it becomes obvious that workplace injuries are far more likely to occur with reusable bags. Back, neck and arm strains will be more common amongst checkout operators, and there needs to be serious consideration given to limiting the amount of heavy lifting these workers should be expected to perform. Unfortunately many of these reusable bags are in an unsanitary condition when they are presented at the checkout. I have heard of retail workers having to handle dirty and smelly bags, some stained with old meat products that have not been cleaned out properly—or worse. Retail workers should be able to expect to work in sanitary conditions. I am worried that many young retail workers will not have the courage to refuse to load an unsanitary bag when a customer presents one at the checkout.
The ALP government of Gough Whitlam, way back in 1974, attempted to harmonise workers’ compensation laws. The Whitlam government bill failed at the altar of sectional interests. Let us hope that we do not repeat the same mistake here. As the Deputy Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, has pointed out, this bill reaches out to those who are inclined to engage in a new spirit of cooperation symbolic of new federalism, one that avoids name calling and state blaming. This is because Safe Work Australia will be jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the states and territories, working cooperatively to solve problems with occupational health and safety laws in Australia. While it may not be an original thought, Mr John Merritt, a director of WorkSafe Victoria, once said: ‘A civilised society is best judged by how it treats its most vulnerable citizens.’ Our most vulnerable citizens surely include those who have been maimed and injured in the workplace, along with the children and spouses dependent upon the 300 workers who are killed in the workplace throughout Australia each year. The passage of the Safe Work Australia Bill will take us into the 21st century. I commend support of the bill.",SENATE,<title>SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2008-10-13,"—I rise in support of the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and the Safe Work Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2008. These bills seek to establish Safe Work Australia as a Commonwealth statutory body. It will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, which was set up by the previous government. As we all know, that council had limited functions, in that it coordinated, monitored and promoted national efforts on health and safety and workers compensation. Under the new government, Safe Work Australia will have a much more comprehensive role. It will develop, monitor and enforce national standards in health and safety. Its role will also include the harmonisation of workers compensation requirements and, as has been stated by previous speakers, it will be jointly funded by Commonwealth, state and territory governments. It needs to be said at the outset that this bill is a significant step towards uniform health and safety laws in this country.
Every year, more than 300 Australian workers are killed doing their jobs, while a further 140,000 are seriously injured. Many more die as a result of work related disease. It is estimated that the cost to our economy is something in the order of $34 billion per annum. To partners, children, friends, family and fellow workers the cost is immeasurable. This Labor government is committed to improving workplace safety and its foundation, the workers compensation system. Since coming to office, the new government has undertaken a review of Comcare, reached agreement with our state colleagues to harmonise occupational health and safety legislation and set up an independent panel to conduct a review of national occupational health and safety. Safe Work Australia will play a central role in OH&S and workers compensation reform as it will be the vehicle that will give effect to the recommendations of the review panel. More particularly, and equally importantly, it will develop a national policy for OH&S and workers compensation; prepare, monitor and revise OH&S legislation; develop a compliance and enforcement policy to ensure national consistency; develop proposals relating to the harmonisation of workers compensation arrangements; and drive national communications strategies to raise awareness of health and safety in the workplace.
The importance of best practice in occupational health and safety standards cannot be overstated. It is the right of every worker to return home at the end of the day as safe and injury free as they were when they embarked upon their journey to work. It is the responsibility and moral obligation of every employer to ensure that they provide a safe working environment, and it is the responsibility of government to develop, review and enforce health and safety standards. As we all know, accidents do happen, and when they do there should be adequate and accessible compensation that provides for the cost of rehabilitation or security for those who are left behind. It should not matter if you are injured in the far north of Western Australia or down in southern Tasmania.
These bills are part of the government’s commitment to create a seamless national economy by reducing duplications, overlaps and, where possible and feasible, inconsistencies and differences between the states. Currently in Australia there are no less than nine different laws governing occupational health and safety. Harmonisation of this plethora of laws will be welcomed by workers, unions and employers alike. But, more importantly, reform of occupational health and safety and workers compensation systems will not only increase profitability and productivity; it will also better protect the lives and health of Australian workers.
I now want to turn to some aspects of the government’s plans for the new body. I must say at the outset that we are entering new terrain which is potentially fraught with conflict. There is potential for conflict because the government seeks to create national standards across a national economy but we remain saddled with a Constitution moulded in the late 19th century. Australia in those days was of course a set of minimally connected states, a minimally aware bunch of coastal cities trying to shift from a city-state mentality to that of a sovereign nation. In that context, the Australian Constitution reflects the dominant paradigm of the time—that is, the emerging Commonwealth was granted limited, restricted and defined powers that were truly national in outlook. For example, defence, customs and post and telegraph were expressions of power. But, apart from the express powers enumerated in section 51(xxxv) of the Constitution, all other powers were left by express reservation to the states. In essence, there was a weak centre and a set of powerful flanks. Now of course we have, we are told, a virtually seamless national economy—indeed, the events of recent weeks in financial markets suggest a seamless international or totally globalised economy, particularly in the major advanced nations—and on that foundation the government seeks to establish Safe Work Australia. By definition, such a body, despite the latterly better intentions of the High Court, can only have the power that is expressly granted under the Constitution.
The second major concern is that, in terms of national policies, national legislation and national implementation and communication strategies, Safe Work Australia will need to overcome the rock of statehood—state government departments, state agencies and generally state interests. Indeed, I know from experience that the power of vested interest groups in this area is a sight to wonder at. Indeed, in the context of a range of industries that are increasingly indigenous to particular states, I see huge misunderstandings that will require careful consideration by the powers that be in Safe Work Australia. By that, I mean manufacturing interests in New South Wales and Victoria; mining interests in Queensland, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and, increasingly, in South Australia; grain-growing interests, which are fundamentally different on the west coast from those on the east coast; and a whole range of biotechnology and value-added service industries which develop and have developed in clusters in particular geographic locations. In each of these instances unsuitable policies, heavy-handed regulation, mindless copying from one industry to another and the desire to delegate responsibility up and away from a lower level in the name of harmony all suggest that caution needs to be the rule of thumb.
The next concern I have is about national coordination, or cross-state harmonisation, and relates to my experience in this field in a former life, between 1986 and 1996. Despite what some people say, they were not halcyon days for national coordination, national harmonisation or national responsibility. My vivid memory of those days, in this area of work, was one of endless meetings, seemingly without purpose, driven by state departments of labour, in coordination with national departments, which simply resulted in layer upon layer of bureaucracy that would have made the presidium of the former USSR react either in embarrassment or in awe—I do not know which.
I particularly remember one committee, charged with the design of chairs for checkout operators in supermarkets, having no less than seven appeal committees attached to the working party and nine—get that!—review committees, charged with doing the same job. The bottom line was and is that the majority of checkout operators prefer to stand, not to sit. The real occupational health and safety issue was the height of the workstation and the ability to manoeuvre hips as an aid to shifting parcels of goods. Nevertheless, we had dozens of committees which examined this issue for years on end and which eventually were unable to find a workable or a sensible solution.
Similarly, the design of a workstation for the loading of grocery items onto shelves above shoulder level was eventually the subject of similar committee investigation and review—alas, with an identical outcome. Eventually, my union simply retained an industrial health firm to interview a number of shelf stackers to find out the nature of their problem relating to lifting above their shoulders. A mechanical tool was designed to assist in loading shelves above chest level. The union sold the concept to national retailers and they purchased hundreds of the units and placed them in supermarkets around Australia. Independent retailers soon followed suit and, hey, injuries caused to shelf stackers from reaching above their shoulders to load high shelves were virtually eliminated.
I recite those two tales simply to highlight that sometimes nationally charged agencies can develop a life and a set of concerns remote from that which is needed at the shop floor level. None of this of course ever occurs deliberately or with mala fides; it simply occurs, a bit like the tides. Lessons of the 1980s and 1990s need to be learnt and not mindlessly replicated or repeated.
Similarly, in the field of workers compensation and the desire for uniform protection, the real issues that need to be addressed are, in no particular order: the relationship between workers compensation and common law; the cost to employers; the benefits to affected or harmed workers; incentive, as it relates to workplace health and safety reform; and the costs, as population bases become larger as national companies shift from localised state schemes to national schemes. Each of those matters goes to the grant of power reserved to the states and the legislative schemes and restrictions they have enacted and re-enacted over a period of 100 years.
In turn, as sure as workers compensation provides a real benefit to injured or hurt workers, its cost premium can be prohibitive. The proof of this lies in the huge liabilities carried by various state instrumentalities and the premiums charged by insurance companies in this field.
All of the matters that I have identified are merely problematic. They are issues that require hard thinking and serious policy responses. If this is not done, the net result will simply be the transfer of a bankrupt or near bankrupt state agency to a national body. This is a real danger, because one of the prime objectives of Safe Work Australia is ‘developing a national policy for occupational health and safety, and workers compensation’. I do not say it should not be done; I simply say there are consequences to decisions, as there always are. And some of those consequences fall under the category of ‘known knowns’, to paraphrase former United States Defense Secretary Rumsfeld.
A lot of work is being done to centralise and coordinate through the COAG process. A lot of the proposed legislation, regulations and bodies that are being created in a host of areas are beneficial in intent. That cannot be denied. No sensible person could quarrel with breaking up dysfunctional bureaucracies, getting rid of defunct state agencies or voiding past legislation when its use-by date is up. The only caveat I offer is to learn from some of the errors and some of the mistakes from previous attempts in this area of reform. In that way we will truly attain a Safe Work Australia that looks forward and assists those who will be most in need. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2008-10-13,"—I indicate that I will support the second reading of this bill. The Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 establishes Safe Work Australia as an independent statutory body to replace the previous Australian Safety and Compensation Council, which was an advisory body to the minister. I endorse the remarks of other senators, Senator Bishop included, about the importance of having an effective occupational health and safety body in this country. I should also indicate that in my time as a member of the South Australian parliament I was a member of the Parliamentary Committee on Occupational Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation and moved for an inquiry into workplace injuries and deaths in South Australia. The report of that inquiry was delivered on 12 October last year. The committee heard extensive evidence about the very human impact when a person is seriously injured or killed in the workplace. That is why it is important that we get it right. It is important that we have a comprehensive framework in place that actually makes a difference in reducing the unacceptably high level of death and injury in the workplace.
In relation to that I want to acknowledge and pay tribute to the work of Andrea Madeley, whose 18-year-old son Danny died several years ago in a horrific industrial accident. She has been a champion for those who have experienced the loss of a loved one as a result of death in the workplace. Andrea established VOID, Voice of Industrial Death. She has been a very strong campaigner, as has her group. She has provided support for families who have lost a loved one and for community groups who want to agitate for reform in relation to occupational health and safety. It is important that we understand that that is what we are here for—to ensure that this legislation maximises the benefit of reducing the impact of the unacceptably high levels of death and injury in the workplace.
It is because of my experiences as a state member of parliament that I welcome this move to, in the government’s words, ‘harmonise’ occupational health and safety practices across states, which will no doubt be welcomed by businesses that operate nationwide. I accept the argument made to my office during a ministerial briefing that, because national standards have been advisory and each state has had its own legislation, consistent and effective outcomes have been hard to achieve. However, I do wish to focus some attention on another of the government’s claims, which is that this new body will be truly independent, and I note the comments made by Senator Siewert in her contribution on this bill. As an Independent senator in this place, I do not take descriptions of independence lightly. As I look at this new body, Safe Work Australia, I raise a number of concerns in relation to its independent representation of the broad range of interests associated with occupational health and safety. I accept the argument that, because the states make the occupational health and safety laws, it is vital that any national body is founded through their cooperation and support. However, it is important that any independent national statutory advisory body is truly representative of all key bodies and is not top-heavy with departmental heads, members hand-picked by ministers or business representatives from the big end of town.
This balance is all the more significant when one recognises that many of the past problems with OH&S legislation have been in red tape, compliance costs and complexity, which have rendered it unworkable in the small-business context. In my own state of South Australia, the peak employer body is Business SA, but it would be fair to say its membership does not represent the diverse views of all businesses. Indeed, its role in the recent workers compensation changes in South Australia, which were pushed through by a Labor government, indicates that its views are by no means universally endorsed.
I note the concerns of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the ACTU in relation to the reduced numbers of non-government representatives and I indicate that I will be moving amendments to deal with what I consider to be an anomaly. I note the comments of Senator Abetz in relation to this and also those of Senator Siewert. I also note the comments of bodies such as the Law Council of Australia, who point to the lack of representation from legal and insurance bodies on a body that is about occupational health and safety outcomes. These are matters that are of significant concern to me and significant in the ultimate outcome of ensuring that we have an effective occupational health and safety framework in this country.
I would like to refer to some work that is about to be published in the Journal of Occupational Health and Safety—Australia and New Zealand. It will be published in volume 24, No. 5 at the end of this month. It is by Dr Kevin Purse of the Hawke Research Institute at the University of South Australia. Dr Purse is someone whom I have known for a number of years through his work in occupational health and safety. He is a person for whom I have high regard. I have high regard for his ability to look at the big picture and to analyse the defects in occupational health and safety structures in Australia and the states.
In the article headed ‘Safe Work Australia: a new one-stop regulatory shop?’ there are a number of important points that have been made by Dr Purse in relation to this legislation. I propose to address some of the issues raised by Dr Purse and to refer to the matters that he has raised in his article that is soon to be published. I would recommend that article to all honourable senators, if they have an interest in this particular field. Dr Purse’s analysis is, I believe, robust, fair and very comprehensive.
Dr Purse makes the point in terms of the history of this that the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission was established in 1985 by the Hawke government as part of the Hawke government’s implementation of the prices and incomes accord. He states:
The National Commission played an important role in providing, for the first time, a forum that enabled the federal, state and territory governments, in conjunction with the trade union movement and employer interests, to address OHS issues on a national basis.
Dr Purse goes on to say:
Arguably, its major achievement was the development of national standards in seven key hazard areas: manual handling, hazardous substances, noise, plant, major hazardous facilities, dangerous goods, and the certification requirements for industrial equipment operators.
That in itself was a significant achievement. He goes on to say:
In practice, however, the goal of national uniformity was never achieved because the National Commission’s model national standards were frequently adopted by the various jurisdictions on a modified basis only or, on more than one occasion, not at all. This in turn contributed to growing criticism of its performance, which subsequently found more general expression in a 1995 Industry Commission report.
…            …            …
The National Commission’s standing declined further following the election of the Howard Government in 1996. Funding cuts and a substantially reduced role … were the most obvious hallmarks of this decline. 
Dr Purse goes on to say:
One other particularly important contribution during the Howard years was the 10-year national OHS strategy announced in 2002, which called for reductions of at least 20% in work-related fatalities and 40% in work-related injuries by 2012.
I note the comment of senators such as Senator Feeney about the enormous cost—the many thousands of Australians who are injured each year in workplace accidents and the many who are killed in the workplace. Those figures do not include those who have died from asbestos related diseases. I disclose that I am a patron of the Asbestos Victims Association of South Australia and am very proud of my involvement with that organisation.
The history of this particular legislation is that the Deputy Prime Minister in the lead-up to the 2007 election announced that there would be an intention to abolish the council—a ‘toothless tiger’ I think the Deputy Prime Minister, then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, called it—if it won office. I understand the policy intent. There was good reason to abolish what was in place, but I have real concerns about the governance arrangements. The points made by Dr Purse are ones that I endorse. He states in his soon-to-be published article:
There are at least three obvious points that can be raised concerning these governance arrangements. The first is that representation would be highly skewed towards government nominees. The second concerns the cumbersome decision-making criteria. While this is no doubt intended to secure decisions which have a high degree of consensus and therefore a greater level of commitment from state and territory governments, the downside risk is that this could result in lowest common denominator outcomes. The third point, which follows on from the other two, is that the parties most directly concerned—employers and unions—would have a lesser role than the jurisdictional members, both in terms of representation and voting strength.
Those final matters are some of the matters that I believe would be dealt with by the amendments that I propose to move.
This legislation, as Senator Siewert has pointed out, is defective on the issue of the independence of this body and the way it interacts with the ministerial council. I look forward to the amendments that will be moved by Senator Siewert—and by Senator Abetz, for that matter—in relation to the issue of the governance structures. As Dr Purse states:
From the government’s perspective, the most pressing issue will undoubtedly be the development of model national OHS legislation to be adopted by the states and territories.
That is clearly the case. Dr Purse makes the following point:
With a national workforce of only 10.7 million workers, it is increasingly difficult to justify the continuing plethora of state and territory laws on OHS in Australia. Perhaps even more importantly, if followed through, the July 2008 commitment by COAG to the principle that a national approach must not compromise or reduce OHS standards provides a firm basis for reform.
That to me is another key criterion: let us not have a race to the bottom here when it comes to OH&S legislation. It is also important that there be an effective national compliance and enforcement policy. I see this legislation is providing a framework and a foundation for that. These are matters that must be dealt with.
In relation to the challenges ahead, I note that Dr Purse makes the point that the final shape of the government’s Safe Work Australia legislation will be determined in this place, subject to the concurrence by the House of Representatives. He says:
… it is clear that the government has laid out an ambitious plan for a nationwide restructuring of OHS regulation and, to a lesser extent, workers compensation arrangements.
Dr Purse is optimistic. He believes that, even though we no longer have wall-to-wall state Labor governments:
… the prospects for a national model OH&S legislation have never been better.
That is something that clearly I believe is encouraging, because we need to act on the unacceptably high level of people who are injured and killed in the workplace in this country.
I note that there is a role, as Senator Bishop alluded to, for looking at workers compensation issues. I am very concerned at what the South Australian Labor government has done in workers compensation. I believe that Safe Work Australia will play an important governance and structural role with respect to workers compensation in the various states and that it can only be beneficial in being able to make recommendations that cut red tape and go to the core of workers compensation matters that need to be dealt with—after all, if we can effectively tackle issues of occupational health and safety, that will inevitably lead to a reduction in deaths and injuries in the workplace and will of course mean that workers compensation schemes will not have the same cost pressures on them. A concomitant effect will be maintaining and, particularly in South Australia’s case, increasing the levels of benefits to injured workers, given the draconian changes that were introduced only recently by the South Australian government.
With those remarks, I look forward to the committee stage. This is an important piece of legislation. I think it is important that we get it right and I look forward to the amendments that will be moved by my colleagues Senators Siewert and Abetz so that we can ensure that this is truly an effective and independent body that will make a very real difference in occupational health and safety in this country and, by extension, reduce the level of death and injury in the workplaces of Australia.",SENATE,<title>SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2008-10-13,"—Madam Acting Deputy President Hurley, I congratulate you on your appointment to the big chair—another member of the class of 2004 has made it there. I am very pleased to be able to speak this evening on these two bills before the Senate. The Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and the Safe Work Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2008 establish a new Commonwealth statutory authority that is another practical example of the government’s determination to undo the wrongs of the past and to establish a modern, national and balanced approach to workplace issues that will stand the nation in good stead for the future.
As is well known, the Australian Labor Party was established by working people and their unions as a party for the workers. We take the protection of workers and their rights very seriously and we have done so throughout the long history of our party. It was the Labor Party, for example, that initiated the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission that was established in 1985 as part of the Hawke Labor government’s 1983 prices and income accord with Australia’s trade unions. The commission was very important in establishing for the first time a national focus on occupational health and safety. In particular, it developed national standards in addressing hazardous areas for workers such as manual handling, noise, plant, hazardous substances and dangerous goods. The work that the commission did has certainly provided the foundation for ongoing work in that area at both the state and federal level.
During the period of the Howard government, the commission unfortunately suffered funding cuts and a reduced role. It was eventually replaced by the Australian Safety and Compensation Council. That was a council and not an independent statutory authority and, unfortunately, in its guise as a council, the organisation did not have the clout that it had previously had. So, in the 2007 election campaign, Labor, true to its long history of supporting workers and ensuring the best possible outcomes in the area of workers’ safety, promised to replace the council with an organisation with more teeth. That is what we are doing here with these bills tonight, and it is a great thing to see Labor’s workplace relations legislation gradually implemented in the chamber.
That attitude from the Labor government is in stark contrast to the approach of the opposition. When most recently in government, the coalition was determined to make the lives of workers as difficult as possible through draconian industrial relations laws, and, unfortunately, the former government paid scant attention to health and safety at work. In contrast, as I said, protection of workers’ rights was at the forefront of Labor’s election campaign last year. We vowed to roll back Work Choices, which stripped many workers’ rights. That is a process we began earlier in the year, and we look forward to seeing more legislation along those lines as the year progresses.
Labor has always recognised that workplace safety is an incredibly important issue for workers and their families and of course for the economy. There is not much point arguing at the workplace for better wages, flexible hours, longer leave or better working conditions if you are in a workplace where you could get severely injured, contract some workplace related disease or even be killed. We know that more than 300 Australians are killed at work each year and many more die as a result of work related disease. Each year over 140,000 Australians are seriously injured at work, and that means that 17 in every 1,000 employees will be off work for at least a week due to work related injury and disease. Two of those 17 workers will need at least six months off work to recover from the injury or illness they sustained during their working life. It is estimated that there are some 689,000 work related injuries in Australia each year. The struggle that can follow a serious injury has far-reaching effects on both the injured worker and their family, on their relationships, on their job prospects and on their future income. Many of us on this side of the chamber have previously worked in trade unions or related areas and have worked closely with people who have suffered work related injuries and seen the long-term detrimental effect that can have on them and their future prospects.
What makes it all much worse is that so many of those workplace injuries and deaths can be prevented through safer practices in workplaces. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to focus on workplace safety issues. There seems to be an assumption in Australia that workplace safety is not a problem because we are a developed nation and we have reasonably good laws comparable to some other nations. There is also unfortunately often the attitude of little sympathy for injured workers and ignorance about what is at stake. In this legislation we are attempting to put workplace safety at the forefront of people’s minds. If people need to be focused on that, perhaps one of the things they could pay more attention to is the impact of workplace injuries on the economy, which has been estimated in Australia to be a cost of some $34 billion a year. In these current economic times we well know that that vast sum of money could be better spent than on supporting workers who unfortunately have been injured when they need not have been injured.
In addition to establishing Safe Work Australia, the Rudd Labor government has already started work to make Australian workplaces safer and healthier. For example, we have undertaken a review of the Comcare scheme, a scheme which the former government neglected for a decade. Under the previous government, Comcare was underresourced and unable to cope with the investigations workload that it had. Our review will outline ways in which to fix the problems in that system that is so important to us.
The government has also set up an independent panel of experts to conduct a national occupational health and safety review and has also developed an agreement with state and territory governments for nationally consistent occupational health and safety legislation. We want that review to recommend the optimal structure and content of a model occupational health and safety act that is capable of being adopted in all states and territories and federally.
The debate about these bills before us today could not be more timely as next week is Safe Work Australia Week. That is a week that brings the nation’s focus to workplace safety issues and encourages people to really prioritise safety in their workplaces. I would like to congratulate everyone getting involved in Safe Work Australia Week activities which are being held across the nation. In my home state of South Australia, our four major occupational health and safety stakeholders—SafeWork SA, WorkCover SA, Business SA and SA Unions—have truly outdone themselves this year, extending Safe Work Australia Week into a whole month.
Starting today and running until 7 November these organisations are ensuring that everyone across the state, from Port Lincoln to Roxby Downs to Mount Gambier, has the opportunity to participate in an event related to workplace safety. Those events include community breakfasts, a celebrity doctor with simple tips on how to put life back into your business and working life, and an executive management forum facilitated by Mr Tom Phillips, the former CEO of Mitsubishi Motors Australia. There is also a special South Australian health expo showcasing excellence and innovation in injury prevention.
Safe Work Australia Week is coordinated by the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, the ASCC, and is a good example of what can be done with national input and support. But the government wants to do more. The Safe Work Australia Bill and its transitional bill will establish Safe Work Australia, a replacement for the ASCC. Unfortunately, because of funding and because its powers were limited to coordinating, monitoring and promoting, the ASCC was unable to have a substantive role in promoting and ensuring occupational health and safety across the workforce. Safe Work Australia will be an independent Commonwealth statutory authority designed to improve OH&S outcomes and workers compensation arrangements in Australia.
We know that OH&S systems are aimed at preventing workplace accidents, while the workers compensation systems are designed to deliver support needed to workers and their families when such accidents occur. Historically, both occupational health and safety and workers compensation arrangements have been fragmented across the Commonwealth and states and territories. As we know, each state and territory has its own health and safety laws. While there is some consistency across those laws, there are still, unsurprisingly, some fundamental differences between them. That inconsistency between the jurisdictions can create a lot of confusion and makes it very difficult for workers who may move from one state and territory to another, as we know increasingly workers in Australia do, and also difficult for employers who operate across more than one jurisdiction. I understand there are some 36,000 employers in Australia who operate in more than one jurisdiction. As workers move into a new jurisdiction they want to know what their rights and entitlements are, particularly in relation to compensation, because it may be different from what they had before. If a worker has an ongoing workers compensation claim, then it needs to be made easier for both the employer and the worker to ensure that that claim can be dealt with consistently.
The legislation before us today seeks to set in place the structure to facilitate more consistency across the nation, putting in place a set of high-standard occupational health and safety rules across all jurisdictions. Safe Work Australia will take forward the initiatives of the Commonwealth and the states and territories to streamline and harmonise workers compensation arrangements. For the first time in the history of our Federation, governments from each state and territory and the Commonwealth have formally committed to the harmonisation of occupational health and safety legislation through an intergovernmental agreement.
When Safe Work Australia comes into being, it must take into account the interests of the Commonwealth and the states and territories as well as workers and employers. It will be a reform focused body with the power to make recommendations directly to the Workplace Relations Ministers Council. The states and territories have agreed to an arrangement whereby the Commonwealth will fund 50 per cent of the budget for Safe Work Australia, while the states and territories together will fund the remaining 50 per cent. Details of those funding arrangements are set out in the Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Occupational Health and Safety made between the Commonwealth and the states and territories on 3 July 2008.
Safe Work Australia will be a positive move financially for the government. The Commonwealth will be required to pay an initial minimum amount of $8.5 million which would be subject to indexation by the CPI as a minimum in the following years. This amount is less than the amount outlaid for the running of the Australian Safety and Compensation Council. It is an example of how a wise investment can deliver excellent benefits for Australian workers and employers.
The Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 will assist the nation in improving occupational health and safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements in Australia because it will empower Safe Work Australia to do a number of things. It will develop a national policy in respect of occupational health and safety and workers compensation; prepare model occupational health and safety legislation and codes of practice for approval by the ministerial council and for adoption by the Commonwealth, states and territories; and develop compliance and enforcement policy to ensure that a nationally consistent approach is taken to compliance and enforcement. This is very valuable for employers who work across a number of jurisdictions; they will know the rules wherever they are operating. Safe Work Australia will also develop proposals relating to the harmonisation of workers compensation arrangements across all jurisdictions. It will develop proposals for national workers compensation arrangements for employers with workers in more than one jurisdiction. Importantly, it will build expertise across occupational health and safety laws and workers compensation schemes that will be readily accessible across jurisdictions and industries, which will reduce the complexity and costs for businesses.
Another feature of Safe Work Australia will be its ability to undertake data collection and research and to publish its findings. This will ensure that all jurisdictions and industries have access to up-to-date, industry-specific information. Employers and workers will be able to adopt practices that will reduce instances of risk and injury in workplaces across Australia. While facilitating data collection might seem a minor part of the bills before the chamber, it is in fact very important. We should never forget how important good data was in assisting and sustaining the victims of asbestos related diseases during their long fight in the pursuit of compensation. So I am very pleased to see that data collection is specifically mentioned in the bills as an important focus of Safe Work Australia.
The Safe Work Australia legislation will also create and maintain mechanisms for review and revision of the effectiveness of Safe Work Australia in performing its functions. This will ensure that the organisation is active in operating efficiently and is responsive in meeting its strategic and operational goals.
The bill also deals with the membership of Safe Work Australia. This will consist of representatives from Commonwealth, state and territory governments, as well as people representing the interests of workers and employers in Australia. This will make Safe Work Australia a truly representative body rather than just an expert body. It is an innovative structure. I am very pleased to support such a structure, particularly when it includes at a national level not only government representatives but also worker and employer representatives. The importance of having a representative body is also reflected in the bill by the stipulation that SWA needs to have at least two-thirds of its voting membership in place in order to perform its functions. I think that stipulation highlights the importance of the body and the need to ensure that all interests in the very vexing and sometimes difficult area of workplace safety are taken into consideration.
In closing, while commending the bills to the chamber, I would like to acknowledge the many workplace occupational health and safety delegates in Australia who volunteer to undertake the role of monitoring what happens in their workplaces, of advising their workmates on how to keep themselves safe and of reporting and improving on health and safety in their workplaces. They are the front-line warriors who ensure that workplaces in Australia are safe. No matter what legislation we pass in this place, it would be pretty irrelevant if we did not have these delegates on the ground doing what they do very well. I would also like to acknowledge the work in South Australia of the Asbestos Victims Association. It was at the forefront of ensuring that South Australians who were afflicted by the terrible diseases from asbestos had an opportunity to fight their case for compensation. Like Senator Xenophon, I would also like to acknowledge the work of Dr Kevin Purse, who is a fearless campaigner and sometimes a fearless critic of federal and state governments in the area of workers compensation. I thank him for his work.",SENATE,<title>SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2008-10-13,"—Madam Acting Deputy President Hurley, I too place on record my congratulations on your elevation to such esteemed high office in this place.
I rise to speak on the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and the Safe Work Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2008. I say from the outset that perhaps there is a case for those on the other side of this chamber to seek some assistance because I think too many of them actually suffer from short-term memory loss in relation to their attacks on Australian workers over their almost 12 long years in government. To have people like Senator Boyce come into the chamber and make the assertions she did during her speech is a real case of short-term memory loss—or maybe it is just selective memory.
As promised prior to the last election, the Rudd government is delivering a new independent national body to lead and improve occupational health and safety and workers compensation arrangements in Australia. As most of us in this place would be aware, there have been too many changes at the state level over the last decade or so. I know that all workers in Australia are very much looking forward to these changes and this new legislation.
The purpose of this legislation is to establish Safe Work Australia as an independent Commonwealth statutory body to improve occupational health and safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements in Australia. The legislation establishes the operational arrangements to support Safe Work Australia, including provisions relating to the nomination of, the appointment of and the terms and conditions of members, conflict-of-interest issues, procedures relating to the conduct of meetings, and decision-making processes. The legislation also enables the chair to constitute committees to draw upon a wide range of expertise for the performance of its functions.
Safe Work Australia will be funded by both the Commonwealth and the states, with each side contributing 50 per cent of the cost. Safe Work Australia will comprise 15 members, including an independent chair, nine members representing the Commonwealth and each state and territory, two members representing the interests of workers, two members representing the interests of employers, and the CEO. Safe Work Australia will develop national policy relating to occupational health and safety and workers compensation; prepare, monitor and revise model OH&S legislation; develop a compliance and enforcement policy to ensure nationally consistent regulatory approaches across all jurisdictions; develop proposals relating to the harmonisation of workers compensation arrangements—and I do not think we can emphasise too much the importance of that; collect, analyse and publish OH&S and workers compensation data and undertake and publish research; drive national communications strategies to raise awareness of health and safety at work; further develop the National OHS Strategy 2002-2012; and advise the Workplace Relations Ministers Council on OH&S and workers compensation matters. So there is definitely a very important responsibility attached to that board. The legislation will also create and maintain mechanisms for review and revision of the effectiveness of Safe Work Australia in performing its functions. This will ensure that the body is active and operating efficiently in meeting its strategic and operational goals.
Safe Work Australia will replace the Australian Safety and Compensation Council, which was set up administratively by the previous government as an advisory council. In contrast to the ASCC, Safe Work Australia will be funded by both the Commonwealth and the states and territories and will provide a central role in occupational health and safety and workers compensation reform. The government has set itself the task of creating a seamless national economy unhampered by unnecessary state duplications, overlaps and differences. Occupational health and safety is a prime example for this sort of reform.
More than 300 Australians are killed each year at work and many more die as a result of work related disease. Each year over 140,000 Australians are seriously injured at work. There were 139,630 serious workers compensation claims in 2005-06. A large majority of these claims—around 70 per cent—involved injury or poisoning, totalling 98,360 claims. The most common industries where workers are injured at work are transport, construction and manufacturing. According to the ACTU, every week nine Australian workers die under traumatic circumstances. I do not think that we can overestimate the impact that illness, serious injury and death causes to individuals, families and workplaces—and let us not forget the effect on the economy. But we cannot overlook the human cost—the impact on people’s future earnings, their capacity to support their families and the mental health issues that arise from these injuries. Too often workers have to regain their confidence and self-esteem. All these things have an impact on their families and the community as a whole.
Researchers estimate that at least 2,500 workers a year die as a result of illness or injuries, and about 170,000 people suffer a work related injury or illness. The figures are actually higher than this because these are only the deaths and injuries recorded by the workers compensation authorities. Many more Australian workers suffer injuries or illnesses that go unrecorded. Factor in to all of this the work related diseases such as cancer, asbestosis and occupational asthma and the total number of work related fatalities rises to around 2,900 a year. In Tasmania in 2007, nine workers lost their lives in traumatic workplace incidents. I believe this is unacceptable, and the Rudd Labor government believes this is unacceptable. The cost to our economy of these injuries has been estimated at $34 billion per year. However, you cannot put a cost on those injured and the effects on their families and friends and the wider community.
The establishment of Safe Work Australia is an essential part of the government’s strategy to improve safety outcomes and workers compensation arrangements across Australia. Since coming to office we have undertaken a review of the Comcare scheme, set up an independent panel of experts to conduct a national OH&S review and developed a landmark intergovernmental agreement with our state and territory counterparts to harmonise occupational health and safety legislation nationally. The legislation, together with the intergovernmental agreement, ushers in a new era of cooperation and collaboration between the Commonwealth, states and territories in this important area. It is a collaboration that will improve the health and safety of workers across Australia and reduce the complexity of regulation for businesses.
Occupational health and safety and workers compensation are issues too important to be neglected any longer. We do not have to search too far back in our memories to recall the sorts of attacks that the previous Liberal coalition government made on Australian workers. In fact, I think there had not been such an attack since 1929, and we saw the effects of that with the former Prime Minister in fact losing his seat and repeating history.
Workers’ lives and health are also at stake, and so too is the efficiency and impact on the running of our country’s economy. Occupational health and safety and workers compensation reform will increase profitability and productivity and better protect the lives and health of all Australian workers. Safe Work Australia will play a pivotal role in this reform. Every worker has a right to a safe workplace and to a work environment that enables them to live a socially and economically productive life.
I would like to join with my colleague the former speaker in putting on record my thanks to those people who take up the position of occupational health and safety officers in workplaces around the country. In fact, I know firsthand from the experience of my husband, who held that position in local government for a number of years, that it can be very challenging. It is not always easy when you have to take on the bosses—in his case, local government—and companies to ensure that workplaces are safe. After all, everyone is entitled to a safe work environment. This bill reaffirms the Rudd government’s commitment to safer workplaces.
I join with my colleagues in commending this bill to the Senate and I hope those on the opposite side of the chamber will show some sense and will support this in the interest of all Australian workers and their families.",SENATE,<title>SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2008-10-13,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—
I rise tonight to give support to the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and Safe Work Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2008. Let me elaborate on the current occupational health and safety system in place in Australia in the present time.
Currently, every state and territory has a different Occupational Health and Safety Act. There are even two Commonwealth OH&S Acts. More than that, there are also several state-based industry-specific OH&S laws like those that cover coal mining in Queensland. These Acts all have a large degree of overlap but their rules and regulatory provisions are different.
For any employer operating across two or more states, this means coming to grips with and implementing not one, but several OH&S regimes into their work environments.
Four years ago the Productivity Commissions raised this problem and identified the need to harmonise our multiple OH&S schemes into a set of national standards. Importantly, the Productivity Commission recognised that any harmonisation of OH&S laws should not come at the expense of workplace safety standards in any one state.
In response to this the Howard Government created the Australian Safety and Compensation Council—a toothless bureaucratic tiger whose role was reined in to “coordinating” and “monitoring”, “promoting” and “recommending”. Four years later, we’re still no closer to minimising the red tape faced by business and we still have eight distinct OH&S regimes.
Inconsistencies between jurisdictions mean that some workers are at risk of poorer safety standards than those in other states. At the same time, these inconsistencies increase the complexity, paperwork and costs for more than 39,000 Australian businesses that operate across state boundaries.
In response to this challenge, the Howard Government choked.
The ASCC was nothing but a smokescreen to cover up the inaction of the Howard Government on occupational health and safety.
It was a toothless tiger with the power to advise and not much else.
During the Federal Election, the now Labor Government made a commitment to overhaul the Australian Safety and Compensation Council and replaced it with a body that could deliver results.
This new body was to be independent and non adversarial; feature inclusive representation from all Federal and State and Territory Governments, as well as employer and employee groups; allow inclusive input to policy development and research into issues; develop expertise across OHS laws and workers compensation schemes; be responsible for data collection mechanisms through which risk, injury and cost profiles can be readily accessed across jurisdictions and industries; drive policy development which will deliver consistency across OHS legislation and across workers compensation schemes; and have powers through its ability to refer matters to the Workplace Relations Ministerial Council and enforcement of common implementation dates for reforms. Safe Work Australia will be that body.
This bill is just another example of Labor meeting its election commitments. It’s another example of Labor’s cooperative federalism—working cooperatively with the States rather than playing politics on the critical issues that matter to working families. It’s another example of Labor getting the job done.
We’ve heard a number of complaints in this place during the course of this debate about the membership of this committee. Senator Abetz had the nerve to claim that this bill is the result of deals between “Labor mates” in State Governments. There have been some concerns that employer and employee representation on this body has been reduced and government representation has been increased.
I think this is indicative of one of the many reasons that the Coalition failed time and time again to achieve any meaningful federal reform in 11 and a half years in Government.
If you want to end the blame game with the States, you’ve got to start by talking and consulting. You can’t just throw a model bill at them and tell them to pass it.
I’m not surprised at Senator Abetz’s allegations one bit—the closest the Howard Government came to cooperative federalism was threatening to pull funding whenever a State wouldn’t do what it was told. Senator Abetz and the Coalition were the bullies in the political playground—stealing the lunch money of the states that wouldn’t play by their rules.
The Rudd Labor Government is trying something that the Howard Government never even tried—we want to use the carrot, not the stick.
11½ years of the Commonwealth Government telling the States to “do what I say or else” has demonstrated that the stick doesn’t work.
By bringing the States to the table and giving them a voice in the formulation of a model Occupational Health and Safety Bill, we’re giving them a stake in the legislation that we’ll be asking them to pass—the carrot they’ve all been waiting for.
Senator Abetz and the Coalition need to get it into their heads that a bit of cooperation never hurt anybody.
The passage and enactment of this legislation will put into motion the Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Occupational Health and Safety agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments in July—a truly momentous landmark in the development of Commonwealth-State relations. Something never seen in the 11 and a half years of the Howard Government.
I want talk a little bit about the primary function that Safe Work Australia will adopt under this bill—developing model Occupational Health and Safety legislation for adoption by the States and Territories.
This is a fundamental policy role that Safe Work Australia’s predecessor —the Australian Safety and Compensation Council—was denied.
The Productivity Commission noted in its review in 2004 that any harmonisation of OH&S laws should not be a case of harmonising down to the lowest common denominator, but rather harmonising up to the best practice OH&S standards of the day.
Assuming the bill passes through this place, there needs to be an acknowledgement by the new members of Safe Work Australia that industry-specific issues need to be confronted and accommodated by any model legislation developed.
I draw the Senate’s attention to one particular industry-specific problem—the pressure placed on truck drivers to meet deadlines and the occupational health and safety hazards this poses.
The trucking industry is facing a safety crisis. 275 people died in heavy vehicle accidents in the twelve months between March 2007 and March 2008—an increase of 19.7 per cent on the previous year.
It’s time that the trucking industry had some recognition in OH&S Laws for the unique risks that truck drivers are faced with every day.
I’ve heard many of the horror stories from drivers about the demands placed on them—forcing them to speed, or ignore breaks and sleep time, and even in some cases use illicit drugs to push through and meet an unrealistic deadline.
These stories take up pages and pages of the Transport Workers Union submission to the National Transport Commission investigation into driver remuneration and payment methods in the Australian Trucking Industry.
I’ll give you a couple of examples: Greg from Port Melbourne says:
“I am paid by the hour, but know that there is no way you can survive on 7.6 hours pay a day so you work as much overtime as you can to survive. As a result I have driven whilst I’ve felt fatigued in order to finish the job and earn more money. I have experienced being pressured to accept lower rates in order to keep work and was been told indirectly that I must do the job or face consequences such as termination.”
Keith, an owner driver from Hemmant in Queensland sums it up:
“Blokes are dying because they can’t get enough money no matter how hard they push themselves.”
The role of Safe Work Australia is not simply to harmonise our OH&S laws across States and Territories. The role of Safe Work Australia is to take a leading role in the development of Occupational Health and Safety policy—to be the open forum for debate between governments, employers and employees on occupational health and safety standards.
This is a unique opportunity to build on our existing OH&S standards and ensure that we are enforcing best practice measures in every jurisdiction in Australia, across every industry. This means delving into the industries facing unique challenges and doing something about it.
In the case of the trucking industry, the TWU argues that the rates of pay and conditions in the transport industry force drivers to succumb to the pressure to work excessive hours, exceed legal speed limits, drive through break and sleep times, and in some cases use illegal stimulants to keep them going.
All of these pose not only a risk to the employee or self-employed driver, but they are a threat to the very safety of any motorist. These pressures arise from unsafe payment practices.
The existence of the link between remuneration and safety standards was made very clear in the NSW Industrial Relations Commission Mutual Responsibility for Road Safety case. The Full Bench of the NSW IRC found that:
“… every 10 per cent more that drivers earn in pay rate is associated with an 18.7 per cent lower probability of crash, and for ever 10 per cent more paid days off the probability of driver crashes declines 6.3 per cent”.
In response, the Transport Workers Union has proposed a safe rates system to the National Transport Commission. This would include enforceable rates of pay and conditions for employees and owner-drivers which do not encourage or require the drivers to engage in unsafe driving practices, and enforceable requirements on planning for safe and legal performance of road transport journeys. The safety of truck drivers and other road users should dictate journey planning, not the requirements of clients; establishing a chain of responsibility in which all contracting participants from the driver through to the ultimate client are held accountable for the safe and legal performance of road transport work; and an appropriate and adequate enforcement regime—providing sufficient resourcing to regulators and industry and employee groups.
This is the subject of a review by the National Transport Commission at the moment but these are the sorts of industry-specific issues that Safe Work Australia—should this bill pass through this place—needs to consider in formulating national occupational health and safety policy.
Again, this bill is the height of cooperative federalism and is a big step in the right direction for worker’s occupational health and safety rights. It replaces the toothless Australian Safety and Compensation Council and provides a unique opportunity to build strong, national standards for workplace safety.
Colleagues, it is with great pleasure that I commend this bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SAFE WORK AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-10-13,"—If there are no further speakers in respect of the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 and related bill I will seek to close the debate. I thank senators for their contributions to the debate on these bills. This legislation will give effect to the intergovernmental agreement for regulatory and operational reform in occupational health and safety agreed by COAG on 3 July 2008. This is an historic agreement and a watershed in Commonwealth-state relations. For the first time governments from each state and territory and the Commonwealth have formally committed to the harmonisation of OH&S laws and the implementation of uniform OH&S legislation complemented by consistent approaches to compliance and enforcement.
The Australian government recognises that occupational health and safety is primarily a state and territory government responsibility and that true reform in this area can only be achieved with the Commonwealth, state and territory governments working cooperatively as partners rather than as adversaries. The intergovernmental agreement ushers in a new era of cooperation and collaboration between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. It is a collaboration which will improve the health and safety of workers across Australia and reduce the complexity of regulation for business. The establishment of Safe Work Australia is an essential first step in this process. Safe Work Australia will play a pivotal role in realising the shared commitment of the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments to work together to achieve harmonisation of OH&S laws. It will have the important task of developing a model OH&S act, model regulations and model codes of practice with approval by workplace relations ministers.
However, during the course of this debate, various senators have expressed concern about aspects of Safe Work Australia’s governance and have indicated that they intend to move amendments to the bill. During my summary I will turn to the various issues that have been raised and, of course, they will be dealt with as well in the committee stage, I would expect. Various senators have questioned the composition of Safe Work Australia and the voting rules relating to the model OH&S legislation. Opposition senators have sought to deflect attention from their own appalling record in the area of occupational health and safety by claiming that this legislation is fundamentally flawed because it creates an imbalance between the representatives of the state and territory governments on the one hand and the representatives of employers and employees on the other. They have also claimed that these rules reduce the role and effectiveness of the workers’ and employers’ representatives.
The membership of Safe Work Australia was agreed in the intergovernmental agreement. It seeks to balance the interests of the jurisdictions, who will be required to enact the model OH&S legislation as agreed by the ministerial council and by the employers and workers who will be affected by the model legislation when it is enacted. I acknowledge that the membership levels agreed in the intergovernmental agreement involve a reduction of employer and worker bodies when compared with the various bodies that preceded the one proposed by this legislation. Both the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission and the Australian Safety and Compensation Council had three representatives from employers and workers. Having said that, however, it is difficult to see what benefits will accrue from increasing the worker and employer membership on Safe Work Australia. Workers and employer representatives together comprise one-third of the membership of Safe Work Australia.
The Commonwealth, state and territory governments, who will jointly fund the operation of Safe Work Australia, are represented by only one member each. Indeed, the Commonwealth’s representation on Safe Work Australia has also been reduced when compared with its membership on the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission and the Australian Safety and Compensation Council. In each case the Commonwealth had two members. With two members each, the social partners will continue to play a significant role in the decision making and effectiveness of Safe Work Australia. Quite frankly, any suggestion that increasing worker and employer representation will increase the expertise available to Safe Work Australia or improve the quality of decision making in Safe Work Australia simply does not stack up. Not only will worker and employer representatives be involved in Safe Work Australia’s operations, they can also engage with the harmonisation process through participation in advisory committees and through any consultation process undertaken by Safe Work Australia.
The opposition would have us believe that state government bureaucrats will be able to repeatedly override legitimate concerns raised by the social partners during OH&S harmonisation discussions. Quite frankly, this is not the case. All questions will be decided by a two-thirds majority vote of members present and voting at a meeting. In the highly unlikely event that there is a split between the states and territories on the one hand and the employer and employee representatives on the other, the independent chair will have the deciding vote.
During the debate today, senators have also taken exception to the fact that the bill does not specifically name the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry as bodies who can nominate representatives for appointment to Safe Work Australia.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 pm to 7.30 pm
—Prior to the suspension of the sitting I was providing a summary of the debate on the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008. In concluding those remarks I was going on to say that, by not naming the representative bodies in the legislation, the minister is able to seek nominations from the most representative organisation of employers and workers at the time nominations are sought. In this way the minister is able to ensure that a balance of worker and employer interests are represented on Safe Work Australia.
Turning to the issue of voting rules, Senator Siewert has expressed concern about the voting rules and in particular the provisions requiring an absolute majority of the states and territories for any decision about the model OH&S legislation. The voting rules were also agreed in the intergovernmental agreement. Questions relating to the model OH&S legislation will require an absolute majority of all the voting members who represent the Commonwealth, states and territories. This is as it should be, because it is the Commonwealth, states and territories that will be required to enact the model OH&S laws.
Turning to the role of the ministerial council which was also mentioned by a number of senators contributing to the debate, senators criticised the fact that Safe Work Australia is reliant on the cooperation and participation of the ministerial council to which it is required to report directly. The government makes no apology for this. If Australia is to have a harmonised set of OH&S laws then it will only do so with the agreement of the states and territories. The ministerial council will have the responsibility to agree by consensus to the model OH&S legislation proposed by Safe Work Australia, unless at least a majority of jurisdictional representatives on Safe Work Australia support the proposed model OH&S legislation. It is unlikely the ministerial council would reach agreement by consensus.
What the criticisms of the bill fail to acknowledge is that the composition and governance arrangements of Safe Work Australia were agreed by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments as part of the negotiations on the Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Occupational Health and Safety. They overlook the commitment demonstrated by the states and territories in negotiating the intergovernmental agreement and contributing 50 per cent of the funding for Safe Work Australia. The intergovernmental agreement obliges the states and territories to take all necessary steps to enact the model OH&S act.
Occupational health and safety and workers compensation are, quite frankly, too important to be neglected any longer. Workers’ lives and health are at stake, and so too is the efficiency of our economy. Occupational health and safety and workers compensation reform will increase profitability and productivity and better protect the lives and health of Australians. Safe Work Australia will play a pivotal role in these reforms. With those words, I commend the bills to the Senate.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2008-10-13,"—We are always hearing or reading about the housing affordability crisis as it affects the big capital cities of Australia. Regrettably, what often gets overlooked is how the issue affects working families in the smaller regional towns, especially those in South Australia. In my home state, we have seen the benefits of the mining and exploration boom and the way it has created jobs, particularly for young people. Many mines are opening or expanding in South Australia, including Roxby Downs, Prominent Hill and many smaller mines, as demand for our minerals grows. In fact, the mining boom has been so successful in my state that an international mining survey ranked South Australia fourth best in the world for mining prospects over the last 12 months.
One of the side-effects of this boom is the impact on land and house prices in rural towns. To give just one example, the city of Port Augusta in the Upper Spencer Gulf was reported to have had a 34 per cent increase in housing costs over the last 12 months. But recently I saw firsthand how some regional towns are imaginatively trying to address the issue. Two weeks ago I was asked to open a new housing estate in Ceduna in the far west of South Australia. Ceduna is a particularly pretty seaside town at the end of the Nullarbor desert. The surrounding coastal strips are some of the most ruggedly beautiful regions of Australia, and not too far from Venus Bay, where I once saw the sun come up in 1972. It is also not far from Fowlers Bay, where Matt Flinders, when circumnavigating Australia, took shelter from a storm.
Ceduna has a population of approximately 3,500 people and has many of the problems that affect other regional towns across Australia. Its principal industries are fishing, tourism and cereal farming, although poor rains will, sadly, wipe out many of the crops this year. Like much of the west coast, where my mother’s family came from, it of course produces export quality oysters—in Murat Bay, Denial Bay and nearby Smokey Bay. While walking along the picturesque norfolk-island-pine-lined foreshore during the world-famous Oysterfest, I was struck by the great sense of excitement, almost a buzz, in the town with the prospect of being the hub for new mines like the mineral sands development of Iluka mines, less than 200 kilometres inland. The mine will mainly produce zircon, which is used in, amongst other things, radiometric dating. The $420 million new mine will bring roughly 200 new young families to the town—hence the urgent need for affordable housing.
The housing estate that I was privileged to open was called Talbot Grove. It was a response to the need in Ceduna to provide cheap and affordable, yet quality, housing. The Ceduna council has had a dream of providing cheap, affordable housing in Ceduna for the last 10 years. With the support and encouragement of the Ceduna council and the state government, Scott Rowlands and his company were able to bring this project to fruition. Builders from Phoenix Relocatables built transportable homes in Adelaide that were then brought to Ceduna and put in place on 19 blocks of land that the council provided. These top-quality finished house and land packages were sold for prices ranging from $150,000 to $170,000. The amazing feature of the new housing estate is that it averaged four houses put in place every five weeks. The newest part of Ceduna is now almost completely populated. When I opened Talbot Grove on Saturday, 4 October, 18 of the 19 houses had been purchased and a contract was near on the 19th.
Talbot Grove is an ideal example of what can happen when stakeholders work together on the important question of affordable housing. The 19 families in Ceduna that have taken advantage of this will have housing that is modern, affordable and adequate for their families’ needs. In fact, I think that this project could become a national benchmark for providing affordable housing across regional areas.
I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Rowlands on providing housing to families in Ceduna that is much sought after. I also want to congratulate the CEO, the mayor and the council of Ceduna for having the foresight to support this project. Mayor Allan Suter, Chief Executive Officer Tony Irvine and other members of council attended the opening ceremony. The opening was well attended and many of the new residents came along to show how proud they were of their new homes. Other distinguished guests and some of the tradesmen who had helped put the houses together were also in attendance. In summary, Talbot Grove in Ceduna shows what can be done to provide affordable but quality housing in the regions.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Housing Affordability</title>,Adjournment,21,1,speech
