Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein—Minister for Trade and Investment) (12:03):  by leave—It is with great pleasure that I table the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement (KAFTA) and accompanying national interest analysis for parliament's consideration. I signed the agreement with my Korean counterpart in Seoul on 8 April, during the Prime Minister's historic and very successful visit to North Asia.


As with all proposed treaties, the parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Treaties will now review KAFTA and, in due course, provide its report. A parallel inquiry is being conducted by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. Importantly, the tabling today of KAFTA will also give the public the opportunity to scrutinise in detail the provisions of the treaty.


On a day when we will turn our attention to addressing the nation's budget, it is timely to point out some of the most important features of KAFTA and the contribution it will make to Australia's economic future. The signing of KAFTA is a significant milestone for the government's economic diplomacy agenda. KAFTA is a world-class, comprehensive agreement that substantially liberalises our existing and growing trade with Korea: our third largest export market, our fourth largest trading partner, and an economy with an above average growth outlook. It is a liberalising agreement with one of Australia's most important trading partners. Over an implementation period of 15 years, from 2015 to 2030, KAFTA is expected to create 15,000 jobs and add $5 billion to our economy.


KAFTA is the first of a series of bilateral trade agreements we are committed to concluding with major trading partners. These agreements, when they enter into force, will translate to more jobs and higher economic growth for Australia, and demonstrate definitively that Australia is open for business. To this end we concluded negotiations with Japan during the Prime Minister's visit to Japan on 7 April and have re-energised our negotiations with China. These agreements will add a new dimension to our bilateral relationship with each country, part of a deepening engagement with our North Asian partners.


KAFTA gives Australian exporters significantly improved market access in goods and services. It eliminates very high tariffs on a wide range of Australian goods exports, including beef, wheat, sugar, dairy, wine, horticulture and seafood, and it creates new market openings for services. KAFTA will substantially improve investment protections and further integrate Korea with Australia's open and stable economy.


Importantly, KAFTA also protects our competitive position in the Korean market. Today, Korea is giving preferential access to our major competitors, including the United States, European Union, Chile and ASEAN countries. But immediately on KAFTA's entry into force, Korea's tariffs will drop to zero for 84 per cent of its imports (by value) from Australia, and most other tariffs will be phased out quickly. Ninety nine point eight per cent of Australian goods exports will enter Korea duty free on full implementation of the agreement.


For agriculture, Korea will eliminate tariffs immediately on entry into force for raw sugar, wheat, wine and some horticulture. Tariffs on most other agricultural products will be eliminated within short time frames thereafter. Importantly, Korea will eliminate its 40 per cent tariff on beef products progressively over 15 years, and will help to level the playing field for Australian beef exporters, particularly relative to the United States. Korea will also eliminate all tariffs on manufacturing, energy and resources within 10 years. This will particularly benefit our resources, pharmaceutical, energy and automotive parts exporters.


As part of our own commitments, Australia will remove its remaining tariffs on Korean goods on entry into force or over several years. Removing our remaining tariffs on Korean goods will benefit Australian consumers and industries which rely on imported Korean products. Tariffs relevant to local sectors which compete against Korean products, including some vehicles, automotive parts, steel and textiles, footwear and clothing, will be phased out in staging periods to allow industry to adjust.


KAFTA will provide Australian services exporters with outcomes equivalent to the best treatment Korea has agreed with any trading partner, on par with its agreements with the United States and Europe. This includes new market access for suppliers of legal, accounting and telecommunications services, and guaranteed open access across a broad range of other services, including financial and education services.


KAFTA improves opportunities and protections for Australian investors and investments in Korea. It will also attract more direct investment from Korea into Australia and promote investor confidence and certainty in both countries.


KAFTA includes an investor-state dispute settlement, or ISDS, mechanism, consistent with the government's policy of considering ISDS on a case-by-case basis. The government has ensured inclusion of appropriate carve-outs and safeguards in important areas such as public health and environmental measures.


KAFTA creates opportunities for closer collaboration between Australian and Korean businesses, including in professional services and agricultural and resources research and training. An audiovisual co-production agreement will deliver new commercial opportunities for the Australian film and television industry.


With one in five Australian jobs linked to trade, this agreement will provide an important boost to Australia's economy. Economic modelling estimates goods liberalisation alone to be worth nearly $5 billion in additional GDP to Australia between 2015 and 2030, resulting in an annual boost to the economy of around $650 million after 15 years of operation. Our agriculture exports are modelled to increase by 73 per cent and manufacturing exports by 53 per cent by 2030 as a result of this free trade agreement.


Ultimately, Australia's objective in pursuing free trade agreements is to increase the prosperity of Australians. We achieve this by negotiating liberalising agreements that eliminate or substantially reduce barriers to trade and help to minimise red tape, to the benefit of both parties. KAFTA meets this objective.


The economic benefits of this free trade agreement to our businesses and consumers—and to the Australian economy more broadly—will start to flow once KAFTA enters into force. We aim to ensure this important agreement can enter into force by the end of 2014 to allow Australians to reap the benefits from this agreement as early as possible.


Implementation of KAFTA will require a number of legislative amendments and I urge members and senators to give favourable consideration to these amendments when they are introduced. This is an agreement that took a long time to negotiate, and I commend the achievement of officials from various agencies led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I also acknowledge the contribution of colleagues opposite and the former trade minister, Craig Emerson.


I commend this agreement to parliament, and hereby table the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement with its national interest analysis.


I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Sydney to speak for 8½ minutes.


Leave granted.




Mr ROBB:
  I move:

Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (12:12):  I thank the minister. On behalf of the opposition, I welcome the tabling of the signed Korean-Australian Free Trade Agreement and the related national interest analysis. The former Labor government commenced negotiations on a bilateral trade agreement with the Republic of Korea in 2009 and substantially progressed the negotiations during our term. Those negotiations were part of Labor's embrace of our region. In our Australia in the Asian century white paper we mapped out significant opportunities—and some challenges—for Australia in our region. Increased trade in goods and services is one of those key opportunities.




The Republic of Korea and Australia have a good, strong and stable relationship. Post defence assistance in the Korean War in the 1950s and the establishment of formal diplomatic relations in 1963, the trade relationship between our two countries has developed rapidly. Korea is now our fourth largest trading partner in terms of two-way trade, accounting for over $30 billion per annum of trade between our countries. There is much more capacity to deepen our trading relationship with Korea. A key test of the agreement signed by the government is how much of that capacity will be realised.



















2








As noted by the minister, the tabling of the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement and accompanying national interest analysis today will provide the parliament and the Australian people with the opportunity to scrutinise the provisions of the treaty in detail.

The Prime Minister announced that negotiations on this agreement were concluded in December last year. The text was not made public until 17 February 2014. In tabling the signed agreement and national interest analysis today, 13 May 2014, the minister has finally given the parliament the opportunity to properly scrutinise the details of this agreement. Labor will of course embrace that opportunity both through the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and the Senate's Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry processes. 


Labor has a strong and well-founded concern about the inclusion of an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism in this treaty. The minister has provided the House with some assurances today about the operation of so-called carve-outs of that that investor-state dispute settlement mechanism. I assure him and the Australian people that we will test those assurances. We will also examine the decision to include certain safeguards in the agreement in favour of Korean industry and the decision to exclude some agricultural industries from the terms of the agreement. All Australians have a stake in our trading relationship with the world. The Senate committee has already called for public submissions and I would encourage industry stakeholders and citizens to inform the parliament's consideration by sharing their views.


On behalf of the shadow minister for trade, Senator Wong, and the opposition, I acknowledge the work of the minister and I congratulate him and his officials in reaching agreement on the terms of the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement. I also welcome the minister's generous acknowledgement of the contribution of the former trade minister, Dr Emerson. 


Parliamentary consideration of proposed treaties is a fundamental element of our democratic processes. While we are about to embark on our parliamentary consideration of this treaty proposal I note that equivalent domestic processes are underway in Korea. Labor is committed to working with the government constructively but not uncritically in ensuring the proposed treaty before the House is in our national interest.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2014-05-13,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (12:17):  It is well known that an important event is due to take place in November in Brisbane and that is the G20 forum. A two-day leaders summit will see Australia's presidency on display. It will provide us with the opportunity to help craft a better future for not just the peoples of G20 countries but everyone in the world. This is the chance to address economic issues and advance the opportunities for everyone.


To ensure that the Commonwealth and Queensland governments can keep this forum safe and effective, this legislation, the G20 (Safety and Security) Complementary Bill 2014, is required and I therefore endorse the bill. The key themes for the gathering will be stronger economic growth and therefore more jobs. More jobs mean better standards of living. The other theme is to put in place measures that will make the global economy more resilient to enable more nations to be able to cope with the challenges of the future. Stronger economies give nations the ability to fulfil their primary responsibility of helping the people in their countries to live a better life. Strong economies in G20 countries encourage greater trade and will help to lift other nations as well. Stronger economies also enable better development assistance to non-G20 nations and help to build better capacities around the world. The G20 is therefore a positive organisation with a positive agenda.


In spite of the value it adds for billions of people, there is no doubt that the G20 is a target for extremist groups and extreme left-wing groups both locally and internationally. I was thinking about naming some of these groups that have already apparently committed to protesting as it is easy to look them up on the internet. I was thinking about it but decided that, just like graffiti tags, they add no value to the world and the aftermath of their effect is a cost to the taxpayers. They therefore do not need to be given any credibility by being named here.


The history of the G20 and other forums, including those in Toronto in 2010, London in 2009 and Melbourne in 2006, shows that there is a very small but violent and destructive element that wants to destroy property and recklessly endanger lives. Ultimately the cost is borne by taxpayers or insurance companies and, no doubt, the livelihood of many of those responsible is even provided for by taxpayers. There is therefore a need for laws such as these to counter dangerous and violent extremists who emerge at these events. There is also an opportunity for the Department of Immigration to watch out for those international troublemakers who will seek visas to come to Brisbane. Basically this bill is about ensuring that the security arrangements that apply to the security area in Brisbane will also have application at Brisbane Airport and on Commonwealth land.


As I said before, there is a history of protests and an unfortunate willingness to make those protests destructive and even violent. We must therefore have security arrangements in place to counter, or at least handle, the threats expected. From my research there is a theme for those readying themselves to protest. It would be fair to say that those against the G20 are those who proclaim themselves socialists or even communists. They are those who have not yet realised that collectivism has always failed. It has failed because the rhetoric of class struggle has not been realised by a new ruling class replacing the last one or it has failed because its systems strangle innovation and entrepreneurial spirit due to there being no incentive for hard work or for coming up with new ideas. It is a system of inertia where the only progress made is towards ever-increasing poverty. The reality is elevation of the population of developing countries is achieved through trade and economic development, not through endless aid. Although I am no fan of one-party states, China, a G20 country, is an example of a country that is elevating itself through increasing levels of economic development. More and more private enterprise and a willingness to demonstrate capitalistic tendencies, even within government enterprises, is helping to lift the population. It was not through foreign aid or collectivism that things changed, but through increasing amounts of business freedom. Of course, a full multiparty democracy would lift the remaining shackles.


The G20 represents about 85 per cent of global GDP and 75 per cent of global trade. This is seen by the lunatic Left as some sort of attack on the majority of the world's population, suggesting that this has come at the direct cost to the poor in the developing world. This is obviously not true, because the G20 represents two-thirds of the world's population. So many of these socialists and communists criticise the G20 by talking about the usual scapegoats such as the USA and the United Kingdom, and maybe throw in France, Germany and Australia to make their case for the evils of capitalism. But the G20 is not an English-speaking forum or even a Western Hemisphere club. Yes, it is the USA, the UK, Canada and Australia. Western European members are France, Germany, Italy and the EU itself. But members are also Argentina, Brazil and Mexico—populous countries keen to make decisions to lift their populations to better standards of living, and yet still attacked by those small and terrible left-wing groups.


Yes, there are other countries with big economies whose membership is probably not surprising, like Saudi Arabia, Russia, South Korea, Japan and China. I do not think that the destructive and often violent protesters should protest when the G20 also includes India, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey. This general protest, seen by the Left as being almost fashionable in a grotesque way, is an attack on the poor of those countries as well.


Listen to those that protest against the G20 and you would think it is a protest against the USA and the West, but such protests are against most of the world. The question then becomes: why do these protesters hate the poor people of Soweto in South Africa so much? Why do they hate the poor people on the streets of Mumbai or those in Sao Paolo? It is a sad state of affairs when these protesters are doing their best to hold back the development of so many poor people in the world. But there is an answer to that question, and that answer is that, unlike the vast majority of the people in the world, these small numbers of protesters have not realised that history has moved on. The revelation yet to strike them is that communism and socialism has failed everywhere. There is no example of a success story. Even the one-party states proclaiming themselves the Communist Party have moved away from collectivism and controlled economies because they failed.


I know that talking about socialism may be useful for pre-selection in some parties, even here in the House, but the reality is that there are very few that hold onto the communist ideals. Some may say that talk of communism here in Australia is some sort of 1950s scare campaign, but despite there being hardly any Communist Party members left in Australian society there are some. Ballajura resident Richard, within Cowan, often makes the point to me that he is both a member of the Communist Party and the Greens. The first time I met him at the Marangaroo Primary School polling booth in 2004 he wore a CPA hat and a Greens shirt. I see that he also writes for The Guardian newspaper regularly—by that I mean the Left-leaning one. To clarify: I mean The Guardian is also the Communist Party newspaper.


It is also a point worth making that on the Communist Party website the only link to a political party that I can recognise is actually to the Greens. For this country, they are fellow travellers—no doubt marching in five columns. I have also noted that the Communist Party has website links to the CFMEU, ACTU, UnionsWA, Greenpeace and the Australian Conservation Foundation.


So I say again that there is a very small group of people that will protest at the G20 in Brisbane. They are people that mainly have allegiance to the failed political systems of socialism and communism. Ironically, while they have the right and the opportunity to peacefully protest because of the democracy they wish to end, if they lived in a socialist or communist nation, such as those of the past, such a protest would have been brutally dealt with.


I also reiterate that the world has moved on and those that protest are stuck in the past. They are stuck with a belief in the good of a system that failed all but the ruling elites. They are also stuck with the reality that even the massive population countries such as China, India, South Africa and Brazil are all in support of the G20 and the results that the G20 pursues. It is little wonder that Richard of Ballajura is the only person in my electorate that is a self-proclaimed communist; that is probably because he is the only one of 100,000 voters. 


The Communist Party, no doubt, will be joined by their fellow travellers in protesting at the G20. The numbers will be small, but the trouble they cause will be dealt with properly under the existing and/or short-term measures provided for in this bill and the Queensland G20 (Safety and Security) Act. I hope that there will be no problems, that no-one will be hurt and there will be no property damage, but the question still remains: why do these anti-G20 groups want to stop developing nations such as Indonesia, India, South Africa and others from lifting their populations to a better future? Why do they want to hold back the residents of Soweto, Sulawesi, Sao Paolo and Mumbai?


The G20 countries know that it is through economic activity that people are lifted up. It is through excellent opportunities, such as the G20 Forum in November in Brisbane, that a better future is planned for and implemented. I endorse this bill and the benefits for the people of the world that will come from the G20 deliberations.

"Feeney, David, MP",ALP,2014-05-13,"



Mr FEENEY
 (Batman) (12:27):  The opposition supports the G20 (Safety and Security) Complementary Bill 2014. It is a bill which will create a new standalone Commonwealth act clarifying the interaction between provisions in the G20 (Safety and Security) Act 2013—that being a piece of Queensland legislation—and existing Commonwealth legislation at the Brisbane Airport during the G20 Summit in 2014 in Queensland. 


As this place well understands, it was former Prime Minister Julia Gillard that secured for Australia the host nation status for the 2014 G20 Leaders Summit. That, of course, was secured by her at the 2011 G20 Leaders Summit held in Cannes. 


The 2014 G20 Leaders Summit will be the most important event in the G20 year and will be held on 15 and 16 November in Brisbane. This will be the most significant meeting of world leaders that Australia has ever hosted, with as many as 4,000 delegates and 3,000 media representatives expected to attend.


The G20 is, without doubt, the premier forum for international cooperation on the most important of issues of the global economic and financial agenda. As set out on the G20 website, the objects of the G20 are threefold: firstly, policy coordination between its members in order to achieve global economic stability and sustainable growth; secondly, promoting financial regulations that reduce risks and prevent future financial crises; and thirdly, the modernising international financial architecture.


G20 members account for 85 per cent of the world economy, some 80 per cent of global trade and two-thirds of the world's population. The G20 represents all geographic regions of the world. Hosting a meeting of the significance of the G20 gives Australia a valuable opportunity to influence the economic policies of the major economies of the globe and contribute to a healthy, growing and resilient global economy. Achieving such outcomes will also boost Australian jobs, living standards and long-term prosperity. The G20 summit, of course, is an opportunity to showcase the very best of Australia.


Inevitably, this event will involve a complex security operation—perhaps not the Warsaw Pact versus NATO conflict that the previous speaker seemed to summon into being. Nonetheless, event organisers will need to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect visitors, while minimising disruptions to inner city residents and businesses. As a consequence of Queensland hosting the G20 summit in 2014, the Queensland Police Service will take on the primary responsibility for providing security to G20 delegates and their official parties, security for meeting and accommodation venues, including motorcade routes, and security for other official events associated with the G20 meeting in Queensland. The G20 delegates will include internationally protected persons who require the very highest standards of personal security. In addition to the protection of delegates in G20 events, the Queensland Police Service is also responsible for protecting members of the public, as one would well imagine, together with businesses and property—those things being unrelated to the G20 summit—from any illegal activities that may be planned by persons opposed to the G20 meetings.


With these additional responsibilities falling on the Queensland Police Service for the safe conduct of the G20 meetings, the Queensland Newman LNP government determined it would be appropriate for an additional stand-alone act to be passed by the Queensland parliament granting specific powers to the Queensland Police Service for the G20 event. The powers are broadly similar to those provided for under the New South Wales APEC Meeting (Police Powers) Act 2007 and the Western Australian Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Special Powers) Act 2011. I think it is worthy for this House to note that that legislation passed the Queensland parliament with the support of both the government and the opposition.


This bill we are considering will create a new stand-alone Commonwealth act clarifying the interaction between provisions found in the Queensland G20 (Safety and Security) Act 2013 and existing Commonwealth legislation at Brisbane Airport during the G20 summit in 2014 in Queensland. The Queensland act provides police officers and appointed persons with special powers for the purposes of the summit. Those powers supplement the powers available under the Queensland Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 and are designed to ensure the security and safety of the G20 summit, events, delegates, members of the public, and public and private property. The powers are exercisable for a limited period and apply only with respect to certain specified locations, including Brisbane Airport, which is the important part for our purposes, because that is a Commonwealth place.


The G20 (Safety and Security) Complementary Bill 2014 provides mechanisms for dealing with any overlap between the provisions and the G20 (Safety and Security) Act 2013 and existing Commonwealth legislation in their application to the relevant parts, or part, of Brisbane Airport. This will ensure police officers and other authorised persons have a very clear understanding of the powers available to them at Brisbane Airport during the summit. The powers will be exercisable for a limited period and apply only with respect to those limited locations.


The bill would not directly provide for any additional powers; however, to avoid any inconsistency between Commonwealth aviation legislation and the Queensland legislation, the proposed section 8 provides certain provisions which ensure that those functions are able to be exercised with absolute clarity by the responsible authorities. This will prevent there being any concerns about powers being available under the Queensland act not being able to be exercised in Commonwealth places. One can readily appreciate what a nonsense it would be if a regime applying more generally in Brisbane was not able to be exercised in certain particular Commonwealth places.


Members of the AFP will have access to powers found in the Queensland legislation, as that act confers powers on 'non-State police officers', which includes members of the AFP and the police force of another state or New Zealand. This is legislation which is utterly practicable and which ensures that the Commonwealth and the powers and authorities of the Commonwealth are able to work effectively and with jurisdictional clarity with Queensland and the Queensland Police Service.


This is a piece of housekeeping legislation, but, again, let me make very plain the fact that this G20 event is something of enormous significance for this country. It is an opportunity, again, to congratulate former Prime Minister Julia Gillard for securing Australia as the host nation for this very significant event. This is an event that both government and opposition support and demonstrate great support and pride in Australia's hosting. On those bases, I commend the bill to the House.

It is a sad state of affairs when these protesters are doing their best to hold back the development of so many poor people in the world. But there is an answer to that question, and that answer is that, unlike the vast majority of the people in the world, these small numbers of protesters have not realised that history has moved on. The revelation yet to strike them is that communism and socialism has failed everywhere. There is no example of a success story. Even the one-party states proclaiming themselves the Communist Party have moved away from collectivism and controlled economies because they failed.


I know that talking about socialism may be useful for pre-selection in some parties, even here in the House, but the reality is that there are very few that hold onto the communist ideals. Some may say that talk of communism here in Australia is some sort of 1950s scare campaign, but despite there being hardly any Communist Party members left in Australian society there are some. Ballajura resident Richard, within Cowan, often makes the point to me that he is both a member of the Communist Party and the Greens. The first time I met him at the Marangaroo Primary School polling booth in 2004 he wore a CPA hat and a Greens shirt. I see that he also writes for The Guardian newspaper regularly—by that I mean the Left-leaning one. To clarify: I mean The Guardian is also the Communist Party newspaper.


It is also a point worth making that on the Communist Party website the only link to a political party that I can recognise is actually to the Greens. For this country, they are fellow travellers—no doubt marching in five columns. I have also noted that the Communist Party has website links to the CFMEU, ACTU, UnionsWA, Greenpeace and the Australian Conservation Foundation.


So I say again that there is a very small group of people that will protest at the G20 in Brisbane. They are people that mainly have allegiance to the failed political systems of socialism and communism. Ironically, while they have the right and the opportunity to peacefully protest because of the democracy they wish to end, if they lived in a socialist or communist nation, such as those of the past, such a protest would have been brutally dealt with.


I also reiterate that the world has moved on and those that protest are stuck in the past. They are stuck with a belief in the good of a system that failed all but the ruling elites. They are also stuck with the reality that even the massive population countries such as China, India, South Africa and Brazil are all in support of the G20 and the results that the G20 pursues. It is little wonder that Richard of Ballajura is the only person in my electorate that is a self-proclaimed communist; that is probably because he is the only one of 100,000 voters. 


The Communist Party, no doubt, will be joined by their fellow travellers in protesting at the G20. The numbers will be small, but the trouble they cause will be dealt with properly under the existing and/or short-term measures provided for in this bill and the Queensland G20 (Safety and Security) Act. I hope that there will be no problems, that no-one will be hurt and there will be no property damage, but the question still remains: why do these anti-G20 groups want to stop developing nations such as Indonesia, India, South Africa and others from lifting their populations to a better future? Why do they want to hold back the residents of Soweto, Sulawesi, Sao Paolo and Mumbai?


The G20 countries know that it is through economic activity that people are lifted up. It is through excellent opportunities, such as the G20 Forum in November in Brisbane, that a better future is planned for and implemented. I endorse this bill and the benefits for the people of the world that will come from the G20 deliberations.

"Feeney, David, MP",ALP,2014-05-13,"



Mr FEENEY
 (Batman) (12:27):  The opposition supports the G20 (Safety and Security) Complementary Bill 2014. It is a bill which will create a new standalone Commonwealth act clarifying the interaction between provisions in the G20 (Safety and Security) Act 2013—that being a piece of Queensland legislation—and existing Commonwealth legislation at the Brisbane Airport during the G20 Summit in 2014 in Queensland. 


As this place well understands, it was former Prime Minister Julia Gillard that secured for Australia the host nation status for the 2014 G20 Leaders Summit. That, of course, was secured by her at the 2011 G20 Leaders Summit held in Cannes. 


The 2014 G20 Leaders Summit will be the most important event in the G20 year and will be held on 15 and 16 November in Brisbane. This will be the most significant meeting of world leaders that Australia has ever hosted, with as many as 4,000 delegates and 3,000 media representatives expected to attend.


The G20 is, without doubt, the premier forum for international cooperation on the most important of issues of the global economic and financial agenda. As set out on the G20 website, the objects of the G20 are threefold: firstly, policy coordination between its members in order to achieve global economic stability and sustainable growth; secondly, promoting financial regulations that reduce risks and prevent future financial crises; and thirdly, the modernising international financial architecture.


G20 members account for 85 per cent of the world economy, some 80 per cent of global trade and two-thirds of the world's population. The G20 represents all geographic regions of the world. Hosting a meeting of the significance of the G20 gives Australia a valuable opportunity to influence the economic policies of the major economies of the globe and contribute to a healthy, growing and resilient global economy. Achieving such outcomes will also boost Australian jobs, living standards and long-term prosperity. The G20 summit, of course, is an opportunity to showcase the very best of Australia.


Inevitably, this event will involve a complex security operation—perhaps not the Warsaw Pact versus NATO conflict that the previous speaker seemed to summon into being. Nonetheless, event organisers will need to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect visitors, while minimising disruptions to inner city residents and businesses. As a consequence of Queensland hosting the G20 summit in 2014, the Queensland Police Service will take on the primary responsibility for providing security to G20 delegates and their official parties, security for meeting and accommodation venues, including motorcade routes, and security for other official events associated with the G20 meeting in Queensland. The G20 delegates will include internationally protected persons who require the very highest standards of personal security. In addition to the protection of delegates in G20 events, the Queensland Police Service is also responsible for protecting members of the public, as one would well imagine, together with businesses and property—those things being unrelated to the G20 summit—from any illegal activities that may be planned by persons opposed to the G20 meetings.


With these additional responsibilities falling on the Queensland Police Service for the safe conduct of the G20 meetings, the Queensland Newman LNP government determined it would be appropriate for an additional stand-alone act to be passed by the Queensland parliament granting specific powers to the Queensland Police Service for the G20 event. The powers are broadly similar to those provided for under the New South Wales APEC Meeting (Police Powers) Act 2007 and the Western Australian Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Special Powers) Act 2011. I think it is worthy for this House to note that that legislation passed the Queensland parliament with the support of both the government and the opposition.


This bill we are considering will create a new stand-alone Commonwealth act clarifying the interaction between provisions found in the Queensland G20 (Safety and Security) Act 2013 and existing Commonwealth legislation at Brisbane Airport during the G20 summit in 2014 in Queensland. The Queensland act provides police officers and appointed persons with special powers for the purposes of the summit. Those powers supplement the powers available under the Queensland Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 and are designed to ensure the security and safety of the G20 summit, events, delegates, members of the public, and public and private property. The powers are exercisable for a limited period and apply only with respect to certain specified locations, including Brisbane Airport, which is the important part for our purposes, because that is a Commonwealth place.


The G20 (Safety and Security) Complementary Bill 2014 provides mechanisms for dealing with any overlap between the provisions and the G20 (Safety and Security) Act 2013 and existing Commonwealth legislation in their application to the relevant parts, or part, of Brisbane Airport. This will ensure police officers and other authorised persons have a very clear understanding of the powers available to them at Brisbane Airport during the summit. The powers will be exercisable for a limited period and apply only with respect to those limited locations.


The bill would not directly provide for any additional powers; however, to avoid any inconsistency between Commonwealth aviation legislation and the Queensland legislation, the proposed section 8 provides certain provisions which ensure that those functions are able to be exercised with absolute clarity by the responsible authorities. This will prevent there being any concerns about powers being available under the Queensland act not being able to be exercised in Commonwealth places. One can readily appreciate what a nonsense it would be if a regime applying more generally in Brisbane was not able to be exercised in certain particular Commonwealth places.


Members of the AFP will have access to powers found in the Queensland legislation, as that act confers powers on 'non-State police officers', which includes members of the AFP and the police force of another state or New Zealand. This is legislation which is utterly practicable and which ensures that the Commonwealth and the powers and authorities of the Commonwealth are able to work effectively and with jurisdictional clarity with Queensland and the Queensland Police Service.


This is a piece of housekeeping legislation, but, again, let me make very plain the fact that this G20 event is something of enormous significance for this country. It is an opportunity, again, to congratulate former Prime Minister Julia Gillard for securing Australia as the host nation for this very significant event. This is an event that both government and opposition support and demonstrate great support and pride in Australia's hosting. On those bases, I commend the bill to the House.

Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (13:30):  Australians have been horrified at the kidnapping of more than 250 schoolgirls in Nigeria. I know every member in this place wishes to see them returned safely to their families as soon as possible. The essence of this crime is the calculated denial of education to girls and women. It is a form of oppression that consigns women to lives of unrealised potential, to mistreatment and to powerlessness. It is a form of discrimination and tyranny that consigns whole nations to poverty and suffering. It comes from the same instinct that motivated the Taliban attack on 14-year-old Malala Yousafzai, who had the courage to openly advocate for the education of girls in Pakistan. 


I draw members' attention to the piece by Ian Wishart, the CEO of Plan International, in TheAustralian today on the transformative impact of education for girls. He notes: 


Each extra year of secondary school increases a girl’s potential income by up to 25 per cent while cutting infant mortality as much as 10 per cent.


Unfortunately, as Mr Wishart says, it takes the abduction of hundreds of terrified young girls to remind us that the right to education is a daily battle for millions of girls.


Australia makes a critical contribution to supporting the education of girls in developing countries. In the context of the Nigerian kidnapping, we should recognise that practical and effective foreign aid prevents terrorism, creates opportunities and builds resilience in developing countries. Foreign aid has never been more important and it must be shielded from further cuts in the budget.

 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (14:00):  I rise on indulgence to acknowledge the passing of former Senator Brian Harradine. He was a Tasmanian senator for almost three decades. He was a staunch unionist, a committed Catholic and, at the time he retired, the Father of the Senate.


At the time of his retirement, the Hobart Mercury said about Brian Harradine:


His values were firm, his organisation superb and his negotiating style maddening.


I discovered this myself when I came to negotiate with Brian Harradine over the extended Medicare safety net back in 2004. Brian never did deals and he never did horse-trading. But if there was something in it for Tasmania it was amazing how the merits of the issue always improved.


In a long and distinguished career, Brian Harradine was deeply respected for his values and for his principles. He was deeply respected as a man of honour and integrity. He engaged in many fights, but it was never about him; it was always about the cause.


For Brian Harradine, faith and family were everything. So I say to Brian's family, on behalf of the government, to his wife, Marian, to their 13 children, to their 38 grandchildren and to their family and friends: he was a good man. He made a contribution to this country and will be missed.

Mr Harradine was born in South Australia, but it was in Tasmania that he really made his mark. He worked in Tasmania as a trade union official. He led the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council and was elected into the Australian Senate in 1975 as an Independent.


Brian Harradine is the longest serving Independent senator in our history. He was both a fiercely proud Independent and a principled senator but, perhaps more so, a fiercely proud Tasmanian. He represented the island state with strength and conviction for three decades, before retiring in 2005. I wish to pass the opposition's condolences onto his wife and his large extended family. May he rest in peace.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-05-13,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (15:13):  This morning I received an email from one of my constituents which read in part: 'I am 48 years old and unemployed. The fact that I have not been able to find another job makes life difficult but just manageable because my husband works. He is 52 years old and works for the federal government. He is very good at what he does but unfortunately the program he works with has been cut and he finds out today if his job has been cut.'


My constituent goes on to say that she has two teenage daughters in Catholic schools and has a mortgage on a small, three-bedroom house north of Canberra that has been refinanced a couple of times in the last few years and some credit card debt. All of this is manageable, my constituent writes, if her husband keeps his job. But then she says, 'If he loses his job, we have no option but to sell the house and count on the kindness of relatives and friends, or to live on the streets'. My constituent concludes, 'Cutting 16,000 Public Service jobs will destroy the economy in Canberra and destroy thousands of lives, including those of my family'.


My constituent is a battler, one of millions of battlers across Australia. But recent decades have been a time in which billionaires have made out far better than battlers. Earnings have grown three times as fast for those in the top 10 per cent as for those in the bottom 10 per cent. The income share of the top one per cent of Australians has doubled over the past generation. The income share of the top 0.1 per cent has tripled. It has been a generation that has been good to the cigar-chomping plutocrats and not so good, unfortunately, for low- and middle-income Australians.


And yet what have we seen since this government has come into office? We have seen a government that has ripped away supports for low- and middle-income families: targeted supports such as the schoolkids bonus, the income support bonus, the low incomes superannuation contribution—all taken away by this government. Equity funding from schools ripped away; trades training centres, which aim at keeping low-income students at school, taken away; and the very cleaners who clean the Prime Minister's office are going to likely see a pay cut as a result of decisions made by this government.


In an era in which the earnings of financial dealers and anaesthetists have risen so much more rapidly than the earnings of cleaners and checkout workers, we have a government whose No. 1 business adviser thinks that we have a wages problem—not the wages problem that CEO earnings have risen twice as fast as average earnings while the minimum wage has risen slower, but a wages problem that the minimum wage is too high. And we have a government that is going soft on the top end of town: saying no to modest measures to crack down on profit shifting by multinationals, giving back $700 million of revenue that now has to come out of the pockets of low- and middle-income Australians, giving a mining tax cut that will cost—well, do not take my word on this; let us go to the Treasurer's own budget papers—$1.8 billion in 2016-17. The result of that mining tax cut will see the benefits go to some of the richest people on the planet.



A government member interjecting—




Dr LEIGH:
  I have just told you, anonymous interjector, of the Treasurer's estimate. If you have a different idea on that, you should take it up with the Treasurer.


We have a government that wants to put in place a parental leave scheme that gives maybe $75,000, maybe $50,000 if they are going to strike a deal with the Greens, to the most affluent families when they have a child. It is a scheme that is at odds with the means-tested system of social supports that has been fundamental to Australia's social state.




Mr Hutchinson:
  It's not a welfare policy!




Dr LEIGH:
  I hear an interjector over there: 'It's not a welfare policy'. And that would sit with the government's policy document, which reads as follows:


… paid parental leave is an economic driver and should be a workforce entitlement …


In other words: for the most affluent Australian families it is, 'Welcome to the new age of entitlements.' So much for the government's rhetoric.


We will hear suggestions tonight that the Treasurer has suddenly become Robin Hood. Let us face it: even the Sheriff of Nottingham occasionally got the odd knight or dame offside, but this is not going to be a Robin Hood budget. This will be a budget that will slug the battlers and will help the billionaires. This is a government that wants to strip away financial protections from vulnerable Australians, which will have the effect of boosting earnings in the financial sector, I am sure, but if the government puts FOFA back on the agenda, it is going to hurt low-income Australians. It is going to hurt pensioners, the very victims of the Storm Financial collapse five years ago.


This hit on low- and middle-income Australia is going to reverberate in so many other areas too. The government claims to be committed to closing the gaps. You cannot close the Indigenous-non-Indigenous gap if your policy is to widen the economic gap in Australia. This government says that it is committed to closing the pay gap between men and women, but you cannot close the pay gap between men and women if your industrial policy is to attack unions and to make it impossible for unions to bargain to assist gender equity across the community.


I say to the Prime Minister: enough of the tribalism, enough with the class warfare; it is time to govern in the interests of all Australians. We have heard talk lately that the government wants to engage in means-testing. That would be news to those of us on this side of the House, who sat through six years in which the coalition in opposition opposed means-testing at every turn. We tried to put in modest changes to the baby bonus, and the Treasurer compared it to China's one-child policy. When we put in place modest means-testing to the private health insurance rebate, the now Minister for Health said that it 'represents a betrayal of the 12 million Australians who contribute to their own health care', and many coalition speakers decried means-testing the private health insurance rebate as class warfare. And on page 93 of Battlelines, the Prime Minister has criticised means testing itself.


This is a Prime Minister who has no deep philosophical commitment to means-testing. Let us be honest: he has very little intellectual commitment to anything. This is a Prime Minister who, after all, when talking about carbon pricing some years ago said, 'If you want to put a price on carbon, why not do it with a simple tax?' And yet, in order to win the Liberal Party leadership, he was willing to backflip on that. This is a Prime Minister who promised Peter Reith that he would support him for the Liberal Party leadership and then backflipped and supported Alan Stockdale, with poor Mr Reith afterwards saying:


I honestly do not know, I really don't. But he certainly did ask me, and he did not just ask me, he asked people around him to join my campaign, as it were … I am a bit disappointed.' 


Australians will be pretty disappointed by a Prime Minister who has said literally dozens of times, for example, 'What you will get under us are tax cuts without new taxes.' He said that there would be 'no new tax collection without an election'. He said, 'No country has ever taxed its way to prosperity,' and he said, 'Personal income tax will be lower under a coalition government in its first term than it is now.'


This is a Prime Minister who said in his budget reply just last year—the now Prime Minister was standing at this very dispatch box here—'No-one's personal tax will go up.' Let's see whether that holds up tonight. This is a Prime Minister who was pretty willing to have a go at our side of politics any time he thought that there had not been promises kept. In fact the Prime Minister in criticising former Prime Minister said:


I am not a doctor but I think that we are in the presence of a condition, a chronic condition, TDD, truth deficit disorder.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2014-05-13,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (15:23):  I have got to say that, after listening to that 10 minutes, there is a little part of me that actually does want the member for Fraser to stay in the chamber. The thought that the member for Fraser might be shaping the minds of young Australians at some tertiary campus somewhere is so horrific that there is a soft spot that would like him to stay in the chamber. No-one takes him seriously, and that is just that side. We are even more dismissive than that side when it comes to the member for Fraser. I have got to say that would have to be one of the most pedestrian examples of an MPI that I have heard, and to think that this was the crescendo for the shadow Assistant Treasurer. Here we are on budget day, a chance to shine, and we had at best what would be considered an understudy's performance when it comes to actually making a contribution to economic debate.


The MPI before the House today was an attempt by the Labor Party to sledge whether or not Australia faces a budget emergency. I thought that there might be some argument from the Labor Party. They usually lead out in this debate talking about how the world's greatest Treasurer—as they like to refer to the member for Lilley—had obtained a AAA credit rating. I thought that might be one of the arguments that Labor would lead with, but they did not even mention it. What I find strange is the argument that Labor put forward, the one example they use to try to claim that Australia was in tiptop, perfect economic shape, which always neglects the starting point when Labor was elected. On any measure, if you look at what it was that the Labor Party inherited a little over six years ago, you will see Australia's financial position was that we had no net debt and that the Labor Party inherited a budget surplus of some $20 billion. In six short years the Australian Labor Party presided over budget deficits to the tune of $190 billion. They left us with a cumulative budget deficit forecast to be some $123 billion and on a pathway to projected debt of $667 billion.


Labor says there is nothing to worry about; there is no concern here; do not worry; things were never better. Unfortunately, that is not the view of anybody who is right in the brain, frankly. It is also not the view of the IMF. The IMF published an interesting publication about a month or so ago and in that publication they revealed that under the Australian Labor Party Australia had the fastest increase in expenditure of any government in the developed world. That was the finding of the IMF. It is entirely consistent with what we have been saying on this side of the chamber and when we were on that side of the chamber in opposition about Labor's performance.


The Labor Party like to say, 'Hang on, we were going to make sure that expenditure only grew at two per cent a year.' Great in theory, but unfortunately not the practice of the Australian Labor Party as they spent money hand over fist. Frankly, the only thing that exceeded Labor's ability to spend money was Labor's ability to borrow money. Today we are left with Labor's legacy—$123 billion of cumulative budget deficits, $667 billion of forecast Labor debt and a financial situation that, if left unchanged, would see the Australian people have deficit after deficit after deficit for 16 years. 


So I say to the Australian Labor Party: don't sit there and pat yourselves on the back and claim that you did an outstanding job. You did nothing of the sort. The Australian Labor Party were beneficiaries of an economy that was handed over to them in tiptop shape. What they left were the smouldering ruins, figuratively, in terms of the kinds of decisions that they took in government which saw us have the biggest increase in expenditure by governments in the developed world. So the Australian Labor Party certainly cannot crow about their economic stewardship.


Unfortunately as well, when it comes to Labor's performance they have been left wanting in a number of different areas. It is not only in relation to debt and deficit; it is also in relation to their management when it came to the expenditure. We saw what they did on one occasion—on the back of an envelope, I think it was, in one of the VIP aircraft. The former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and the former communications minister, Senator Conroy, were sitting back and on the back of a coaster—as I believe the accounts recall—they came up with a you-beaut idea to develop the NBN. We remember the NBN because originally it was going to be about an $8 billion exercise to provide high-speed broadband. Then that was scaled up to being about $14 billion or $15 billion and then we saw projections of $29 billion. We understand, when you look at the costs of Labor's rollout—how slow it was, how many targets were missed, how many inefficiencies were built into the system, how many disputes there were with contractors—that we saw the actual cost of Labor's NBN rollout forecast to reach over $90 billion. I see in recent media reports that Telstra on their 4G wireless communications network are providing speeds of—you guessed it—100 gigabytes.




Mr Watts:
  You're rewriting the laws of physics!



A government member:  A hundred megabytes.




Mr CIOBO:
  Up to 100 megabytes, I am corrected.



A government member:  Megabits.




Mr CIOBO:
  Megabits. I have not rewritten the laws of physics at all, actually. The reality is that, when it comes to commercially viable opportunities, there are download speeds the private sector provides on wireless communications today that are comparable with what Labor wanted to do with over $90 billion of taxpayers' funds. So we see forecasts as well that predict under 4G and possibly the 5G network that is currently in the R&D stage download speeds of up to one gigabyte and not at a cost of some $90 billion of taxpayers' funds. This is just another example of the way in which Labor was recklessly spending people's money.


But, of course, in the current climate let's not lose sight of an inquiry that is currently taking place into the pink batts fiasco. If there is one example, one crowning glory of Labor incompetence—and there is a lot to choose from—it is the pink batts scheme. It was Labor's design again, Labor's rollout. In every respect Labor's DNA and fingerprints were all over the pink batts scheme, where we saw billions of dollars wasted to roll them out and then billions of dollars wasted to get them back out of ceilings. Meanwhile, lives were lost, the industry was destroyed and Labor walked away as if nothing ever happened. In that respect, the Australian Labor Party will stand condemned for many years.


It was not just about the fact that they took a strong economy and in many respects left it bruised, bashed and dented. It is not about the fact that Labor inherited $20 billion surpluses and left the Australian people with $50 billion deficits. It is not about the fact in isolation that Labor took a situation where we had no net debt and put us on a pathway to $667 billion worth of debt. It is also not exclusively about the fact that Labor put us on a pathway for 16 years of budget deficits. It is also that Labor, in spending the money, chose to spend it so poorly—so much so that we have today an inquiry taking place as to why, unfortunately, Australians lost their lives under their stewardship and why billions of dollars were wasted.


But the other key example—the other crowning glory of Labor's incompetence—would have to be their approach to Australia's border protection. There is very little that can be said in any way, shape or form that would characterise Labor's decisions around border protection as being positive. Under Labor we saw a situation where over 50,000 people came to Australia on over 700 boats. Over 1,000 lives were lost at sea, and Labor said they were brilliant when it came to economic stewardship and management of policy.


That is just the latest example where in a relatively short eight months the minister responsible, the member for Cook, has done an outstanding job stopping the boats, delivering on our promise and, when it comes to economics, saving Australian taxpayers billions of dollars as a consequence of our ability to have a backbone and make the tough decisions. Tonight will be further evidence that we are a mature, adult government with a methodical approach and that will make the hard decisions.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (15:34):  I actually rise to speak on the MPI, which was about a budget emergency. I got waylaid and got to hear the member for Moncrieff for 10 minutes talk about the usual three speeches he makes; however, it was a bit unfortunate, because obviously there is going to be a ministerial vacancy coming up, and I always go for the Queenslander when it comes to any vacancies! With respect to the member for Kooyong, I always want to plump for the Queenslander, but after that speech getting on his CV I just cannot believe the member for Moncrieff let me down like that. But, nevertheless, best of luck: if that is the start of your job application, you've got a lot of work to do. Opportunity rich, I think we say, Steven!




Mr Ciobo:
  Look where you're sitting!




Mr PERRETT:
  Good point! But nevertheless, let's go back to the budget emergency. We heard that speech. This is the no-surprises government, remember? The member for Moncrieff is a member of the no-surprises government and the no-new-taxes government. This MPI is important because obviously we need to see it through that prism. There is no budget emergency. There are impediments coming in the future with an ageing Australian community, but that does not mean an emergency. The fact that I will be looking for a retirement home in 20 or 30 years does not mean that I call the ambulance today. There will be issues in the future. There are obviously some challenges, but a prudent, adult government would recognise that rather than confecting this thing called a 'budget emergency'.


I still see that footage—and I have seen it a lot the past couple of days—of the Prime Minister saying they will be the government of no surprises. It is funny, but every time I see him say that I hear the theme music from Jaws because that is what Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister, the member for Warringah reminds me of—no surprises like the movie Jaws. That shark is coming, we know; it is coming along tonight. The member for Warringah is really the poor man's political Steven Spielberg with basically the same storyline, and tonight he has created—or tried to create—this budget emergency as if to cloak what they are doing. The member for Moncrieff mentioned things being in a party's DNA in his speech, and we have seen it in the LNP. I have no problem with the member for Moncrieff. He knows sharks very well; he has sharks in his electorate on both sides of the beach. However, sharks do what they do, what they are programmed to do and what is in their DNA, and that is what the LNP are programmed to do as well. They cut health services, they neglect education and they attack pensioners and even people with disabilities. It is sad to say.


I mention this because the member for Moncrieff did mention an IMF report, but he mentioned the most recent one, not the one before that talked about the Howard government, which was basically the front bench opposite repeated. The Howard government was the most profligate government in the history of Australia.



Government members interjecting—




Mr PERRETT:
  I know you are laughing at the Howard government history, but that is the reality. If we wanted to sell every asset, obviously, we would have been in a much strong position.



Government members interjecting—




Mr PERRETT:
  You laugh, but look at what actually happened. Let us look at those realities. Under the Rudd-Gillard government we were a lower-taxing government. As a member of the Left, I am a little bit confronted by that, because I think good, responsible governments should be able to tax to provide responsible services. Under the ALP, we taxed at 22.5 per cent, whereas the Howard government taxed across its history at 25 per cent. Many of those opposite on the front bench were part of that drunken sailor collective that did so much damage to Australia.



Admittedly, in hindsight we embraced a lot of tax cuts in 2007 that perhaps we should not have. As a candidate at the time, I thought it was good policy—in hindsight, not so much. The reality is that we have a budget that is manageable and in a good, strong position. (Time expired)

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (15:39):  A book entitled Disconnected has been described as:


A forensic examination of Australian life, this insightful book suggests that contemporary society has lost touch with its communities and its people.


It was written in 2010 by the author of this matter of public importance, none other than the member for Fraser, Dr Andrew Leigh.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  I hope you didn't pay for the book!




Mr McCORMACK:
  I did not pay for the book; I googled it, Member for Cowper, and found it on Google. The subject of that book and the title of that book, Disconnected, is exactly what I am afraid the member for Fraser is with this MPI, which is about:


The Government's attempt to confect a Budget emergency to justify the harsh measures in the Commission of Audit report.


He knows that the Commission of Audit is a report for government, not a report by government. And he knows, being an economist and having spent the last three years in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government, the absolute fiscal emergency that we have been placed in by that government, of which he was a member.


When they came back to office in 2007, Labor inherited a surplus of $20 billion with no net debt and $45 billion in the bank. It was a good position, but between 2008-09 and 2012-13 Labor delivered deficits totalling $191 billion. Despite all this, not that long ago I heard the member for Fraser say that had things been left to go unchecked by our side—by our government—we would be back in surplus by the year 2016-17. He made that point. How disconnected is the member for Fraser? How disconnected is he from the state of the economy? He knows that Labor left additional projected deficits of $123 billion over the next four years—2013-14 to 2016-17—when he claimed that we would be getting back into surplus. Over six budgets, Labor increased spending by more than 50 per cent—$137,000 million. The International Monetary Fund, as the member for Moncrieff quite correctly pointed out, recently found that Australia's spending is projected to grow faster than any of the 17 advanced economies it profiled.


Labor's waste and mismanagement knew no bounds—a cost blow-out of at least $29 billion with the National Broadband Network. How much would it have cost? Seventy-four billion dollars? Who would know? There was a blow-out of more than $11 billion in border protection costs. When Labor inherited office under Mr Rudd, there were just four adult males in detention centres in Australia. When we regained control of government, 55,000 men, women and children had unfortunately come to these shores in 800 boats, costing more than $11½ billion. That is straight off the bottom line of this country.


There was a $6 billion to $8 billion blow-out in the cost of overpriced school halls. Admittedly, there were some school hall projects in my electorate which have proven to be very good, but they were managed by the independent schools. The ones for the public schools were absolutely ripped off, and public school teachers tell me this. Every time I visit a public school, they point to how they were not allowed to manage their own project and what they could have possibly done with the money had they been able to do so. Stimulus cheques of $900 were sent to around 27,000 Australians living overseas and 21,000 people who had died.


Treasury projects that without policy change the budget would have been in deficit for the next decade. This would mean 16 unbroken years of deficits unless brought under control by the Liberal-National coalition, which is what we are doing, and it starts tonight. The adults are back in charge. As Tony Abbott, the now Prime Minister, promised prior to the election, we would get the economy back on track and the absolute confidence of the people to do that. People have been ringing and telling us, 'Don't squib it.' They want us to get in and make the hard decisions on behalf of the people and on behalf of the taxpayers of this nation, who deserve better. They deserved better over the last six years; they did not get it, but they will certainly get it under the Abbott-Truss Liberal-National government.

Ms BUTLER
 (Griffith) (15:44):  It is of course a pleasure to stand here before the parliament to help to debunk the myth that there is a budget emergency. There is no budget emergency despite what those opposite have tried to convince the Australian public to justify their ideological attacks on public services in this country. Despite the rhetoric from the Liberals and Nationals, Australia's economy is the envy of the world. We have a record of continuous economic growth over the last 22 years that is to be acknowledged and celebrated.


During Labor's period of office we moved from being the 15th biggest economy in the world to being the 12th. Our GDP per capita ranking moved from being the 17th best in the world to the eighth best. We have a AAA credit rating from the three main ratings agencies, and we maintained it through the global financial crisis. By the time we left office we were one of only eight countries in the world that had these three AAA credit ratings with a stable outlook. According to Credit Suisse's Global Wealth Report, in 2013 Australia was number one in the world for median adult wealth. Our net debt is just 11 per cent of GDP. It is the third lowest net debt in the OECD, and yet the Liberal-National Party carry on as if there is a budget emergency.


Let us talk about the figures in MYEFO—$68 billion added by the Treasurer since the pre-election fiscal outlook. What did the Treasurer do? He looked at the way unemployment was being calculated and forecasted and he changed the way unemployment was being forecasted, even though they were the same forecasting arrangements that had been in place under the Howard government. What did changing the forecasts for unemployment do? It hit revenue and, of course, it hit spending.


What else have we seen from this Treasurer? Removing the two per cent spending cap. After the global financial crisis Labor maintained its spending cap. We kept spending growth to below two per cent after the global financial crisis. As the shadow Treasurer has said, it is a two-card trick—you take away the two per cent spending cap in MYEFO and you put it back on in the budget and claim to have improved the deficit position. People are not going to fall for that.


What else have we seen from this government? The trick they are trying to play on the Australian people in the way that foreign aid was calculated and projected to grow under MYEFO. They have admitted in question time, in this place, that they had no intention of spending that money on foreign aid. Of course people are right to be dubious about MYEFO; people are right to be dubious about the $68 billion that the Treasurer has added to the deficit over the forward estimates. Why should people be sceptical? Because we are being softened up for cuts to services that are ideological.


This mob opposite us have wanted to get rid of Medicare since before its inception. We celebrated 30 years of Medicare this year. If it was not for the Liberals and the Nationals it would have been 40 years of Medicare. They have always hated universal health care. They have always hated spending Australians' money on making sure there is universal access to health care. That is why tonight we will see the shameful end of universal health care in this country with the introduction of a GP tax. When I was running in the Griffith by-election only a matter of months ago I was accused by people opposite of running a scare campaign about the GP tax. We had everybody from the foreign minister to the Prime Minister swanning in to Griffith to say, 'We've got no plans for a GP tax.' Yet here we are, a few short months later, and what are we expecting tonight? What do you think it is? Is it a GP tax? It is a GP tax. It is the end of universal health care in this country. 


The people opposite, the Liberals and Nationals, have always hated Medicare and universal health care. People in the electorate of Griffith who I represent and people across Australia love universal health care; they love Medicare because it is one of the defining achievements of our social democracy in Australia. If, as predicted, a GP tax is included in tonight's budget then the Liberals and the Nationals will understand very quickly how people feel about that change to Medicare. They will understand very quickly the backlash to the GP tax, not to mention the petrol tax, the personal tax increase, the failure to fund education as they had promised—the broken promises from a Prime Minister who claimed he would have no excuses.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (15:49):  Here we are again on budget day witnessing more Labor denial. We are all forgiven on this side for thinking we have just heard three speeches much the same. When you analyse them, the member for Fraser was a bit different from the member for Moreton. I think the member for Fraser knows that Labor has a big apology to make to the Australian people and he is not quite comfortable with that fact. He very carefully managed to not mention any of the things he has advocated in a previous life that might reform some of the structure of the budget. With the member for Moreton, on the other hand, I think the Labor brainwashing machine has done a pretty complete job. I think he actually believes everything he said. He said he was confounded by a few things. We would say he is confounded by most things. That is what we say; that is our experience. It falls to the coalition government—here we are again—on the first budget of a coalition government to clean up Labor's mess. Peter Costello stood here in 1996 and began the clean-up: $96 billion of debt, a $10 billion budget black hole—



An opposition member interjecting—  




Mr TONY SMITH:
  You might learn something if you listen. You did not learn much with Conroy. You are new, you have got a chance. 


There was $96 billion and a $10 billion budget deficit that had been promised as a surplus right through the campaign, and what did we get from Labor? No apologies, no concession and they fought every step of the way to fix the mess they had created. They created the chaos and then they complained about the clean-up. What happened when they won in 2007? No net debt, a $20 billion budget surplus and Wayne Swan came in on budget night six years ago and said the surplus was not big enough. The skyscraper should have had another floor on it. In his budget speech six years ago he said: 'We've honoured our commitment to deliver a budget surplus of at least 1.5 per cent of GDP and gone further to a budget surplus of 1.8 per cent. The previous government forecast a surplus of only 1.2 per cent for 2008 and 2009.' As all of those opposite know, and most of them were complicit in it, they wrecked the budget. I will tell you what the member for Fraser did not mention while speaking for 10 minutes on an MPI—and this is a first for any shadow economic minister on budget day: he failed to mention debt or deficit once, not once. You sat there through that government, complicit in the fiscal mess that was created.


The member for Moreton we give a leave pass to. We accept that he did not know what he was doing. We absolutely accept that. But you knew what you were doing, Member for Fraser—$123 billion of deficit into the future and $667 billion of debt. And what does Labor say today? The member for Moreton says nothing ever happened and the member for Fraser does not mention it. Just keep on keeping on—that is the Labor way. Stay on the debt train. And then you have the member for Griffith, who, unfortunately, has been given some talking points about OECD figures, as if we would aspire to OECD debt figures. How ridiculous! As if we would aspire to OECD debt figures. In other words, you see OECD debt figures as a target. This is an incredible proposition we face on budget day.


What is clear for the people of Australia is that Labor will not apologise and Labor will not do anything to clean up the mess that they have created. It falls to a coalition government; it is our historic duty to clean up Labor's mess. We are going to have to do it again, and we are doing it again so that we can have a stronger economy and a better future for all of our constituents.


For those opposite on budget day, here they are—no mention of debt or deficit. Now the member for Fraser is typing an op-ed on inequality or something.




Dr Leigh:

Mr TONY SMITH:
  You just got bored, did you? I tell you what, I will finish on this note: maybe it was the shadow Treasurer's idea to keep you out of the lockup as long as he could.

"Watts, Tim, MP",ALP,2014-05-13,"



Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (15:54):  I am very pleased to speak on this matter of public importance raised by the member for Fraser. What we have seen since the last federal election is one of the great con jobs in Australian political history. The coalition's so-called budget emergency is a smoke-and-mirror show to provide political cover for an extreme, ideologically driven attack on the Australian way of life. The 'budget emergency' is the big lie that underpins the coalition's economic strategy. It is the big distortion, the big confection, the big fib, the big falsehood and the big untruth at the core of the coalition's extreme and out-of-touch agenda for Australia.


By any objective measure, the previous Labor government left Australia with a strong and stable fiscal outlook. Our budget position is the envy of the advanced world. Labor left Australia with a triple-A credit rating and a stable outlook from all three ratings agencies. Australia is one of only 10 economies in the world with three triple-A ratings, putting Australia's credit rating in the company of nations like Germany, Canada, Sweden, Singapore and Switzerland. In 2013-14, Australia's net government debt is just $191.5 billion, or just 12.1 per cent of Australian GDP—a level of net debt that is not even one-sixth of the advanced economy average of 74.7 per cent of GDP recorded by the International Monetary Fund. The data just does not support the drama from those on the other side of the House.


What is the real root of the fiscal hysteria that we see from those opposite? It is nothing more than base political opportunism. During the global financial crisis, when millions of jobs were being lost in economies around the world, the coalition put their extreme ideology ahead of the jobs of hundreds of thousands of Australians. They opposed the job-saving fiscal stimulus introduced by the Labor government in 2008-09—an economic policy described by Nobel prize laureate Joseph Stiglitz as one of the 'best designed' stimulus packages of any advanced economy.


But how does one justify this extreme ideological position to the Australian public? Parroting the words of their conservative allies in the United States and the United Kingdom, the coalition imported a political attack from countries with vastly different fiscal situations than our own. Unfortunately, the facts in Australia never match their imported political rhetoric. While the deficit in Australia grew to $54.5 billion, or 4.2 per cent of GDP, in 2009-10 in the wake of Labor's job-saving fiscal stimulus, it never even reached half the average deficit of advanced economies during this time. Similarly, as the global financial crisis passed, Labor dramatically reined in the deficit, reducing it to just $18.8 billion in our last full year in office, or just 1.2 per cent of GDP—less than one-fourth of the international advanced economy average of 4.9 per cent. Labor continued this budget discipline by deciding on over $180 billion in responsible savings to fund investments in hospitals, schools and the NDIS, which, at the time, those opposite claimed to support. This was fiscal discipline, I might add, that was consistently opposed by the Leader of the Opposition, and it also included means testing the private health insurance rebate—a saving that is still not supported by those opposite. A set of long-term structural savings was delivered by Labor that left the budget cumulatively better off by over $300 billion by 2020-21.


Of course, none of these facts suited the coalition's narrative, so after those opposite entered government they needed to start changing the fiscal facts to meet their budget confections. The Treasurer set to work moving the goalposts. In the six months after the federal election, the Treasurer made a series of decisions designed to double the budget deficit. A combination of their own spending decisions and changed economic assumptions, or what a layman might call 'cooking the books', added $68 billion to the budget deficit in this period of time. And now they are trying to frame up the Australian Labor Party as being responsible. If this were just a matter of political game playing, it would be one thing, but the real reason for this fiscal hysteria—



Government members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! Those on my right!




Mr WATTS:
  The real reason for what has happened is that the Prime Minister is trying fit up the Australian people for a hairshirt. Despite promising no cuts to health, no cuts to education and no changes to the pension before the election, we finally saw Tony Abbott's true agenda when his Commission of Audit report was released. It is no surprise that he held back the release of this report until after the WA Senate election. It is no surprise that he did not tell voters about his extreme ideological agenda before the last federal election.




Mr Whiteley:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would like him to provide evidence that he is being framed.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No, that is not a point of order and it is verging on being disorderly.




Mr WATTS:
  I can understand the sensitivity from those opposite. It is no surprise that they did not tell voters about their real plans for Australia. They knew that the Australian public would not have a bar of it if they knew about it. The Australian people did not vote for this and they do not want it, and at the next election we are going to hold the government to account.

Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (15:59):  The approaching budget has flushed out a whole new breed of politicians and commentators—the debt and deficit deniers. Unflustered by the facts, impervious to any crisis and unwilling to listen to their opponents, their ranks are bolstered by disaffected types who simply want the government to keep spending on their latest cause. In these circles it is completely unfashionable to recognise the need to stop spending. Labor already suffers from this disease and I fear that the crossbenchers in this House and in the other place will soon catch it. Almost two weeks ago I took part in a regular panel on ABC radio with the member for Fraser, the shadow assistant treasurer. I was stunned to hear him argue that we are in fine shape. On ABC's Lateline on the very same day he went on to say that, when you look around the world, Australia's public finances are in extraordinarily good shape. The member for Fraser knows better. As a newly-minted politician I understand the opportunism of his position. When I survey my constituents, which I do constantly, I find that cost of living, health and immigration often trump debt. If I were just looking for votes I would look to the extraordinary precedent set by European politicians‑just keep spending until you are bankrupt.


A day is a long time in politics so why worry about a deep impending crisis which can be hidden from mainstream voters by opportunistic spin merchants? The debt deniers' approach has evolved over time. When in government Wayne Swan gave lip service to fixing the problem. With a hopelessly flawed mining tax as his main weapon he was never going to deliver. Due to the relative freedom of opposition, lip service has now given way to full-blown denial aided and abetted by partisan loyalists in the economics profession. It is always easy to present a couple of facts to whisk the problem away. In the great tradition of our national broadcaster it is time for a more comprehensive fact check. It may be true that we are currently in a better position than many other countries in terms of the ratio of public debt to GDP but we should take no comfort in comparisons with Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain and other economic basket cases. With mining investment growing from next to nothing only years earlier to now be topping more than $100 billion, close to 10 per cent of GDP, and the strongest terms of trade for 150 years we should have a strong starting position, but we do not. 


The Commission of Audit has made the gravity of the situation clear. Our biggest spending programs, roughly half the budget, are set to grow much faster than GDP for decades to come and Labor has made no attempt to curb the trajectory. Their promises on aged care, education, disability and pensions, particularly those promises made beyond scrutiny of the forward estimates, entrench totally unsustainable spending growth. These expenditures are driven by demographics—and demographics is, of course, destiny. All of this adds up to the fastest rate of growth of expenditure amongst all developed countries recently surveyed by the IMF. Meanwhile, Australians have amongst the highest level of household debt in the developed world, at over $1.5 trillion. Since the early 1990s, our mortgages and credit card debt have grown much faster than the overall economy. This creates a level of vulnerability to rising government debt for Australian families, businesses and workers through upward pressure on interest rates, crowding out of private sector jobs and a reduction in the government's ammunition to deal with a global downturn. 


It was irresponsible to run large budget deficits during a mining boom with skyrocketing household debt. However, leaving the problem for another day would be a huge threat to the prosperity of those households with high debt burdens, many of whom are in my electorate, and to the prosperity of all those businesses which rely on those households for their prosperity. We are falling off a fiscal cliff and we still have a long way to fall. The debt and deficit deniers are screaming that it is all okay because we have not yet hit the bottom. I suggest that they look down to see the bodies sprawled below, mostly European. (Time expired)

"O'Neil, Clare, MP",ALP,2014-05-13,"



Ms O'NEIL
 (Hotham) (16:04):  This important discussion goes right to the heart of the falsehood that is being peddled by those on the other side of the House. It sits at the heart of the debate about the budget. Over the past weeks we have heard some ridiculous claims made by those on the other side of the House as they go around Australia. You get the feeling that the Treasurer believes if he repeats that we have a budget emergency frequently enough and loudly enough then it will start to come true. There is a problem, though. The facts do not support the statement. Let us turn to some of these facts. 


As previous speakers have mentioned, we have a public debt to GDP ratio in Australia of somewhere around 20 per cent, about a fifth of GDP. The member for Casey asked who do we want to compare ourselves to. Is the OECD the right spot to put the bar? Let us take a look at those who have AAA credit ratings. Australia is one of 13 countries around the world which has a AAA credit rating. By my list Australia has the lowest debt to GDP ratio of all countries with a AAA credit rating. I have not worked out the average myself, but by eyeballing this list I would say the average debt to GDP ratio is about 55 per cent, so we are sitting at just under a half of the debt to GDP ratio for all those countries with a AAA credit rating. You do not have to take my word for it because, as is becoming quite apparent, we are struggling to find a serious economist in Australia who will stand behind some of the fatuous claims made by the government. Even Tony Shepherd, who produced the infamous Commission of Audit report, would not state that Australia is in a budget emergency. The only people who are making this claim are those who are sitting on the other side of the House. 


Given all this evidence, why do we see all the rhetoric? We have heard some very interesting views from this side of the House speculating on what they are trying to do. I have been thinking about this for a few weeks and I have my own theory. I think what we are seeing on the other side of the House is what economist Paul Krugman has called a very serious person syndrome. This syndrome occurs when right-wing politicians want to get up and create some sort of crisis. They get really serious and really tough on the topic to show off a professional veneer. The problem is, as we have just talked about, the facts just do not support it. I do not like the politics but I think you have to admire the moxie, given how far away from the facts they are. 


There is another problem with the rhetoric that is being spun on the other side of the House—that is, the government decisions that are being made simply do not line up with this idea that we are heading into a huge fiscal crisis. What we have seen in the announcements that the Treasurer has made so far are some massive new areas of spending going to some of the wealthiest people in our community. One of the examples that I know we will hear more about is the paid parental leave scheme, which will give somewhere between $50,000 and $75,000 to some of the richest women in the whole of Australia. This scheme is going to cost $5.5 billion a year. That is about as much as the whole amount of federal spending on child care. If you go out and talk to the mothers of Australia about what they would prefer investment in, I think we all know what the answer will be.


Something else I want to talk about is the government's attempt to abolish carbon pricing and in its place create this taxpayer-funded slush fund that will pay the companies which are the biggest polluters in Australia to try to cut down carbon emissions—a scheme which we know is not even going to help Australia meet its carbon goals. 


What we see along with these massive areas of spending are some significant areas of cuts. The cuts, as we have come to expect from those on the other side of the House, are affecting the Australians that can least afford to pay. I am talking about a tax on people who are sick. I have been doing mobile offices during the sitting break, and I am sure that you guys have had this experience: constituents have been coming up to me and they have been so afraid; these are people who have illnesses and just cannot afford to pay $6 every time they go to the doctor. I know that those on the other side of the House tend to represent electorates where there may be fewer people in this situation, but I can tell you that the constituents of Hotham are incredibly concerned about things that will tax people who might be sick.


All the while, we have these very serious people on the other side of the House paying $140,000 for a private jet to bring them to Canberra and having a lovely time sitting in the parliamentary courtyard puffing on Cubans. I would just say to those on the other side of the House that it might be time to stop trying to pretend you are so serious and tough, get real with the facts and start listening to those on the other side of the House who actually have some experience and understanding of economics.

 (Bennelong) (16:09):  The members opposite have accused this government of overdramatising our nation's situation. These allegations seem a little rich coming from the party so famous for drama. Labor's long-running soap opera confused and captivated voters over six long seasons, starring Kevin and Julia, then Julia and Kevin, and finally, back by popular demand, a solo act by Kevin. 


For Labor to suggest that a deficit nearing $667 billion is overdramatised shows that clearly they have moved from drama to comedy, but this is no laughing matter. So let us cut the drama. Let us set aside the opposition's rhetoric for a moment and address the facts. Let us revisit Labor's legacy, to examine where we are today. Unfortunately for Labor, the facts are pretty damning. In their first year in government, Labor delivered a budget deficit of $27 billion. In the very next year, the deficit had blown out to $54.5 billion. In five budgets between 2008 and 2013, Labor delivered $191 billion of budget deficits and $123 billion of accumulated deficits over the forward estimates.


The facts are clear: when they came into office, Labor inherited a surplus of $20 billion, with no net debt and $45 billion in the bank. By the end of their six-year spiral of spending, they left Australians with a dizzying legacy of projected debt, the product of structural spending measures which promised to take us on a road into the red to $667 billion by 2023.


So, before the opposition accuse us of overdramatising the very real deficit they have left behind, I would ask them to check the facts. If they really see the numbers as not a big problem, they deserve to stay in opposition for a very long time, because it is going to take a very long time to fix their mess. When they were in office, Labor's best financial minds behaved like rich kids playing with daddy's credit card. They threw money at pink batts and school halls and committed to an NBN spend that, ironically, has blown out into the clouds. Their total disregard for fiscal responsibility has led us to where we are today. 


Today's deficit is not of our doing, but it will be our undoing if we fail to respond to it. That is why tonight this government will deliver a budget to put our nation back on track and pay down the debt. This budget represents the first steps towards delivering our promise to the Australian people. Labor may accuse us of confecting a budget emergency but, while they streak through the halls of parliament offering a lot of rhetoric but no plans to address the debt, we on this side of the House have started the difficult task of making the hard decisions they did not have the fortitude to make. We have looked closely at the facts, rolled up our sleeves and come up with a plan to restore the budget to surplus.


Labor have levelled another attack against this government in the lead-up to tonight's budget. They say we have somehow broken our election promise to be a government of lower taxes by promising a levy on high-income earners. So, again, I propose that we take a look at the facts. Tony Abbott has been faithful to his low-tax mandate. Tonight's budget will outline our plans to relieve taxpayers of billions of dollars in tax burden by reducing taxes in many areas across the budget. This government is asking everybody to do their share of the lifting to fix Labor's mess. The levy is an appeal to those who are fortunate enough to earn a high income to get Australia back on track. This levy is about making sure responsibility for the heavy lifting is shared fairly, and it is time that those opposite stopped making mischief on this proposed policy to pay back the debt. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The discussion is now concluded.

Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (16:14):  I ask leave of the House to make a statement on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit concerning the draft budget estimates for the Australian National Audit Office and the Parliamentary Budget Office for 2014-15, and also for leave to present a copy of my statement.


Leave granted.




Dr SOUTHCOTT:
  As the committee responsible for parliamentary oversight of the Parliamentary Budget Office and the Australian National Audit Office, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is required by legislation to consider the draft budget estimates for each office, with the chair making recommendations to both houses of parliament. Therefore, on budget day each year, the committee makes a statement on whether, in its opinion, these offices have been given sufficient funding to carry out their respective mandates. In support of this process, both the PBO and the ANAO are empowered through their respective legislation to disclose their draft budget estimates to the committee, which the committee then considers in making any representations to government and the two houses.


In accordance with the Parliamentary Service Act 1999, the committee received a copy of the PBO's draft budget estimates in February 2014 and subsequently received an update from the Parliamentary Budget Officer identifying revisions to his estimates. The PBO has had a small level of additional savings allocated to it, due to an increase in the annual efficiency dividend, reducing its appropriation over the budget and forward estimates by $162,000. The PBO's total revenue from government will be $7.263 million in 2014-15.


As a small agency, the PBO has developed an efficient operating model through necessity. The committee will be interested in the outcome of the ANAO review into the operations of the PBO, due to be released in June. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has advised the committee that the cumulative impact of the base-level efficiency dividend will present management challenges to the PBO in the future. Notwithstanding this, the committee endorses the proposed budget for the Parliamentary Budget Office in 2014-15.


Moving to the ANAO, in accordance with the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951 and the Auditor-General Act 1997, the committee received a copy of the Australian National Audit Office draft budget estimates in January 2014 and has subsequently received updates from the Auditor-General identifying revisions to his estimates. The committee has been advised that in today's budget an increase in the efficiency dividend from 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent will be applied over the next three financial years. This will result in a further $1.67 million reduction to the ANAO's annual appropriation over the budget and forward estimates. The Audit Office's total revenue from government is $73.412 million in 2014-15. The Auditor-General has advised that the outlook over the forward estimates highlights a range of pressures, as he seeks to maintain appropriately resourced financial statement and performance audit programs. The increase in the efficiency dividend and other pressures noted in the ANAO's budget submission are expected to lead to a reduction in the ANAO's performance audit program in the forward years. It is expected that the number of performance audits conducted will be reduced from 49 to 48 in 2015-16 and then down to 47 in 2016-17 and subsequent years.


The committee remains strongly concerned about the level of funding uncertainty for the forward years. Last year, the Auditor-General foreshadowed the need to reduce his work program in the forward years if new funding was not provided in this year's budget. This situation has, unfortunately, come to pass. Nevertheless, noting the continuing tight fiscal environment, the committee endorses the proposed budget for the Audit Office in 2014-15 and recommends its passage. The Auditor-General and his office should be commended for managing to maintain their performance audit program over the last few years, despite budget reductions. The ANAO is unable to reduce its financial statement audit work, because of its mandatory nature and the need to adhere to professional standards.


Further proportional funding increases are also required as new entities are created. The committee notes that the government's commission of audit has identified the ANAO's work in auditing agency key performance indicators as playing an important role in focusing agencies' attention on measuring and improving the effectiveness of programs. The funding of this area remains an area of concern for the committee. The ANAO has moved past the point of doing more with less to actively reducing the amount of scrutiny it provides to parliament and the Australian people. Any further increase in or expansion of duties should be adequately funded by the government. The committee recommends that steps be taken in next year's budget to place the Audit Office on a more financially sustainable footing to ensure that its essential work in scrutinising government processes and expenditure is properly resourced and that funding be provided to ensure that there is no further reduction in the number of performance audits conducted.


In conclusion, the committee remains concerned about the increase in pressures being placed on the PBO and the ANAO. Additional savings measures have been applied that further reduce the available funding and are now at the point where they are having an effect on the scope of the ANAO's work program. As independent authorities, the PBO and the ANAO need to be sufficiently funded to fulfil their legislative requirements and adequately support the parliament. The committee appreciates the efforts of both the Parliamentary Budget Officer and the Auditor-General in maintaining strong working relationships across the parliament and particularly with this committee. They have made themselves available for regular briefings and have been responsive to requests for information on a variety of topics. The committee looks forward to continuing these productive relationships. I present a copy of my statement.

Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (16:21):  On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the committee's report No. 441, entitled Inquiry into Public Governance Performance and Accountability Act 2013 rules development.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Dr SOUTHCOTT:
  by leave—I present the report from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit entitled Inquiry into the Public Governance Performance and Accountability Act 2013 rules development. The PGPA act and its accompanying rules will establish a new resource management framework for all Commonwealth bodies, replacing the Financial Management And Accountability Act 1997, otherwise known as the FMA Act and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, otherwise known as the CAC Act. The PGPA rules as disallowable instruments need to be developed and tabled in parliament before the substantive provisions of the PGPA act come into effect on 1 July 2014.


The terms of reference for the committee's inquiry were to consider the process for the development of the rules, and the impact and purpose of the rules, in the context of the broader Public Management Reform Agenda. As set out in the report, the committee believes that stage 1 of the reform agenda, comprising the PGPA Act and the implementation of the first set of PGPA rules, establishes a solid foundation for efficiencies and the framework for cultural change in Commonwealth resource management in future years.


The committee has made several recommendations in its report, to assist implementation of the rules and further progress the Public Management Reform Agenda. Chapter 1 of the committee's report provides an overview of the significance of the PGPA Act and associated rules in the context of the reform agenda. Chapter 2 of the report examines the consultation process for the rules development and the guidance and training being set in place to prepare agencies for the transition on 1 July 2014.


The committee commends the initial consultation process undertaken by Finance for the development of the first set of PGPA rules, and Finance's commitment to continue this process for the rules to be implemented post 1 July. However, the committee has recommended that Finance review the guidance material for the rules, to improve consistency.


In chapter 3 of the report, the committee noted general support from inquiry participants for the majority of draft rules required for 1 July 2014 commencement of the PGPA Act. Some 19 rules were considered by the committee as part of the inquiry.


The committee has made a number of recommendations in response to some specific issues raised by stakeholders. Noting the concerns raised by the Auditor-General regarding the PGPA rule on 'approving commitments of relevant money', the committee has recommended this rule be amended to explicitly place an obligation on all individual officials to consider 'proper use' of public resources before approving commitments of relevant money, with this issue to also be included in the first independent review of the PGPA Act in three years time. The committee further recommended that the draft guidance material supporting this rule be amended to include discussion of the risks involved in officials approving aggregate expenditure proposals.


The committee also noted concerns raised by a number of stakeholders about the draft rule on audit committees—in particular, regarding the exclusion of an organisation's chair from being a member of its audit committee. On balance, the committee did not recommend any change to this rule but rather that Finance amend the draft guidance supporting the rule to emphasise that the chair of a Commonwealth body can attend audit committee meetings as an observer.


In terms of more general issues concerning the PGPA rules development, the committee noted the concerns raised by the Australian Public Service Commission about dual coverage of the PGPA Act and the Public Service Act 1999. In response, the committee has recommended that Finance and the Public Service Commission work together to draft the necessary amendments to the PGPA Act and/or Public Service Act to reduce potential confusion from this dual coverage, with amendment proposals to be put to the parliament as soon as practicable.


In support of a proposal made by the Australian National Audit Office, the committee has also recommended that an additional guiding principle emphasising the parliament's role be applied in developing the remaining elements of the Public Management Reform Agenda. The committee further recommended that Finance work to ensure that any necessary amendments are made to the Auditor-General's Act 1997 to ensure the ANAO retains the audit powers under the new arrangements that the parliament would expect, including the power to audit the full planning, performance and accountability framework under the PGPA Act.


Chapter 4 of the report focuses on post-1 July 2014 issues concerning the rules development for the PGPA Act. The committee has recommended that Finance continue its consultation with stakeholders on the rules required for post-July. It has also recommended that Finance prepare a plan clearly outlining the anticipated dates for development of all future rules, to ensure there is sufficient time for public consultation and a committee inquiry before tabling in parliament and implementation.


In terms of the development of future rules under the PGPA Act and other elements of the reform agenda, the committee has noted in the report that it intends to conduct inquiries into both stages 2 and 3 of these proposed reforms. Key priority areas for stages 2 and 3 include a new risk framework, better facilitation of 'joined-up' government and partnership arrangements, and an improved performance framework, with new PGPA rules for corporate plans, annual performance statements and annual reporting requirements. The rules relating to the performance framework are of particular interest, given the many recommendations of past ANAO audits and committee inquiries concerning performance reporting by Commonwealth agencies.


In conclusion, if the benefits of this new framework are fully captured this will modernise public sector financial management, making Australia once again world leading in this area and positioning us well for the decades ahead. I commend Finance for its leadership in driving this significant reform process. I commend the report to the House.

Mr CONROY
 (Charlton) (16:27):  by leave—As Deputy Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Accounts and Audit, I am pleased to join with my colleague the member for Boothby in commending the report into Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 rules development to the House. The report recognises that there has been significant consultation with relevant stakeholders regarding the development of the rules, and this is welcomed by the committee.


I will not go into too much detail on the report as the chair has ably covered this off. However, I do want to cover two recommendations, the first around approving commitments of 'relevant money'. The report analysed the draft rule in relation to approving commitments of relevant money. The Australian National Audit Office noted that the draft rule was a substantive departure from existing obligations that explicitly require an approver to be satisfied, after making reasonable inquiries, that giving effect to the spending proposal would be a proper use of Commonwealth resources. The ANAO concluded that it did not consider the proposed rule would provide the government and the parliament with sufficient confidence that officials, in approving the commitment of relevant money, will be required in all cases to form a judgement that it represents the proper use of such money. Consequently, the committee was of the view that the draft rule should be amended to explicitly place an obligation on all individual officials to consider proper use before approving a commitment of relevant money, and recommendation 5 in chapter 3 addresses this.


The second issue I would like to cover is the dual coverage of PGPA Act and Public Service Act. This was highlighted by several submissions, most notably the Public Service Commission, which stated that the dual coverage of the two acts, with each of them setting out alternative statements seeking to regulate the behaviour and professional standards of public servants in the APS, adds complexity and the potential for confusion for APS employees. To address this potential confusion the committee proposed that the PGPA Act be amended to specify that the provisions of the act relating to the general duties of officials do not apply to those employed under the Public Service Act. In response to these concerns, the Department of Finance has indicated that they will continue to work with the Public Service Commission to ensure clarity around the way in which the two acts interact, and the committee recommended that they come back to parliament with a solution as soon as possible. I will finish by thanking the committee secretariat for their work in preparing the report, and I commend it to the House.

Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (16:36):  Before question time, I was extolling the virtues of the Green Army program and speaking about what I believe are the benefits for people in my electorate. The target participants are younger people who are predominantly unemployed. I am already working on projects in my electorate. Participants in the Boggabilla-Toomelah project, in conjunction with the Moree Plains Shire Council, will undertake training as well as mentoring in the work situation. I have also spoken to some employers in that area so that, at the end of the Green Army project, we may be able to offer some part-time employment in the last couple of weeks and convert this into longer-term employment.


There are jobs in my part of the world. At the moment, many of them are being undertaken by short-term backpacker visitors. Much of this work could be undertaken by local people, but we have to break their cycle of poverty and disconnection. I believe the Green Army program is a way of doing that. There are possibilities in other parts of my electorate. I have heard some of the comments from members of the opposition about environmental programs and the like. The environment is not just iconic sites. It is not just the Snowy Mountains, the Great Barrier Reef or the forests of Tasmania. The natural environment is in need of some attention. 


There has been some talk that the Green Army program may not have environmental outcomes. I have been in discussions with local land services and councils about the eradication of noxious weeds. One which is certainly in need of drastic attention is Hudson pear. For those of you who do not know about it, Hudson pear is a very nasty little cactus bush. The spikes are so sharp that, when it goes through the lips of animals or onto their legs as they walk through it, more often than not animals end up with an infection which is very detrimental to their wellbeing. Indeed, Hudson pear can lead to the death of kangaroos and domestic livestock like sheep and cattle because of the cruel way in which it attaches itself to them. Not only would a Green Army project give practical environmental outcomes but also it would provide opportunities for many people who now are disconnected from the workforce. 


The idea that people can just step up into a job when they come from a household where people do not have a job is incorrect. The Green Army projects in my electorate will come with suitable training and mentoring to help young people come to terms with the concept of turning up to a job every day and the commitment that entails, and also the rewards which genuine, worthwhile work can give to people. Hopefully it will lead to permanent employment.


Another project I have been working on in conjunction with RiverSmart Australia is remedial work in the public areas of the Macquarie Valley. There is an area of about 150 kilometres along the Macquarie River from Wellington down through to Warren and the Macquarie Marshes where a Green Army team could do worthwhile weed control, riverbank stabilisation and build boardwalks to make public areas along the iconic Macquarie River more accessible to the public so that more people can appreciate the beauty of this river. I have been in discussions with Dr Bill Phillips from RiverSmart, who has submitted a very worthwhile proposal for an employment program along the river. That would also include some really worthwhile remedial work in the Tiger Bay Wetlands on the outskirts of Warren along the Macquarie and in the river itself.


I have been a little disappointed by some of the contributions from members of the opposition who see this as some sort of assault on trade unions or some form of cheap, serf labour for young disadvantaged people. The greatest thing we can do to put stability into these young people's lives is give them the opportunity to undertake some form of employment which will be a pathway for them into a future involving work, not disconnectedness, impoverishment and isolation from the mainstream community. Indeed, this program will lead to better outcomes in employment. Also, it will lead to practical environmental outcomes which will benefit the environment, not highfaluting global targets which we may or may not reach but projects that will have a positive effect on the environment in which we live and which sustains us. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014 has my full support.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2014-05-13,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (16:43):  I note the contribution from the member for Parkes on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. I share some of his optimism about this program but would like to detail some concerns. I was in the Parkes electorate over Easter, on the Macintyre west of Yetman—a beautiful part of the world. I had a lovely time there. I have a soft spot for the Macintyre, which I assume is the northern border of his part of New South Wales. My mum was a Goondiwindi girl. We scattered my mum's ashes on the Macintyre three years ago. It is three years ago tomorrow, in fact, that she passed away. So I have always had a soft spot for that part of the world. It is beautiful.


Obviously, when young people go to particularly remote parts anywhere—even if they are from Toomelah, Parkes or any other part of his electorate—I have concerns about who these young people will be supervised by because of the cultures that can sometimes develop in work camps, in any work camp. My grandfather came from Goondiwindi and he told me many stories about how tough some of the work camps can be in really remote areas. I will go to some of these concerns in my speech.


This legislation is of particular concern because three Green Army projects were promised in the electorate of Moreton prior to the 2013 federal election. I am assuming—rather naively on budget day, I guess—that the Prime Minister will carry out the promise made by the LNP candidate for Moreton to roll out these three Green Army projects. Interestingly, the LNP candidate promised that there would be a jobs symposium within 100 days of the election. I have written to Minister Abetz and Minister Pyne, and still that jobs forum has not taken place.


But I still live in hope that the three Green Army projects that were promised for the Oxley Creek Common, the Archerfield Wetlands and the Granard Wetlands will take place. They are all in the middle of my electorate. Even though mine is an inner-city electorate, these areas—basically, around what I call the Oxley Creek Common area—are a twitcher's paradise. If you go there at any time, you will find a lot of birdwatchers. You can easily see about 70 different species in one hour, even though my electorate is only 10 or 15 minutes from the middle of Brisbane. If you go along there, you can even see jabirus. I have not seen them there, but you can see a jabiru—almost in the middle of Brisbane. Striped honeyeaters, spotted harriers, juvenile little bronze cuckoos and fairy wrens are just some examples. There have been up to 195 bird species seen in this Oxley Creek Common area.


The Green Army seeks to reinstate the failed Green Corps program that was started by the Howard government. The LNP government claims that Green Corps was undermined by the former Rudd-Gillard government; however, it was a Labor government that first introduced the Landcare and Environment Action Program, which aimed to provide work with opportunities for young people while achieving positive environmental outcomes. This grassroots environmental action is extremely important to any community, whether it be the remote communities mentioned by the member for Parkes or inner-city suburbs that have challenges, like those in the electorate of Moreton.


I support action to address these local issues. However, I am concerned that, with only a few months until the program is due to start, no-one is quite clear about the specific details as to how the Green Army will work. I had a look at the application from and there is still a lot of uncertainty about how it will run. I am particularly concerned about its exemptions from workplace health and safety laws, compensation laws, industrial relations laws and even bullying and harassment laws, because those who will be involved are young and because, generally—as you would find if you have had any dealings with such people in your electorate—many have not been academic successes or have had challenges at home and challenges in their family life, so they are often our most vulnerable. Taking away those protections, particularly health and safety laws and those preventing bullying, will make it a particular challenge.


I believe, and Labor believe, that we need to do everything we can to get people into work. We are the Labor Party. It is in our title; it is in our DNA. Every individual who can work should be given the chance to work, but we know that that can only happen if there is appropriate support and protection. We do not want work at any cost. That is the strategy of the economic 'let 'er rip' society. That is not what Australia is about, not since the Harvester Judgement and even before that, you could argue.


Environmental work and training programs are an effective way—I agree with the member for Parkes—of getting people employment, as well as providing environmental benefits that help the nation. Workplace training programs have the potential, if they are well designed and well implemented, to achieve these twin goals. But there still outstanding questions. 


Firstly, I am concerned about wages. We acknowledge that Green Army participants will be paid the equivalent of a training wage, which, while not overly generous, will be more than the income support payments many of them would likely be on. These payments will also be similar to the training wages received by thousands of other young Australians who are in vocational training or education. Certainly, that is the case now—before 7.30 tonight. But, unlike trainees or apprentices, participants in the Green Army are under the supervision of the Commonwealth. Denying them the status of Commonwealth employees leaves them in a no-man's-land in terms of the employer-employee relationship, which affords a range of workplace rights—an area of law I am quite familiar with. They are not considered workers and therefore they would not have the same workplace rights. The ACTU president, Ged Kearney, said:


This is about taking away well-paid, well-protected jobs from people and replacing them with low-paid, unsafe jobs.


Yet, every second day, we have someone from the government talking about the rollout of the insulation program and the concerns that came with that.


Youth unemployment is a significant issue within my electorate, and I do not want the coalition government to think that, if they see unemployment rates for youth improving, it is as a result of these projects, because the Green Army program's wages are not sufficient for our youth to survive on. Our youth need real jobs with real wages, real workplace safety measures in place and a career path.


Those recruited will do manual labour, including clearing local creeks and waterways, fencing and tree planting. I have seen similar programs in my electorate already. Yet this government has ensured that Green Army members will be exempt from Commonwealth workplace laws, including the Work Health and Safety Act, the Fair Work Act and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. One thing that concerns me about the amendments to this bill is that they mean it does not provide adequate protections—namely, in the areas of occupational health and safety, workers compensation and rehabilitation. Every Australian has the right to work in a safe and comfortable environment without concerns about their physical safety or the threat of emotional abuse. This government has a duty of care to these proposed workers and, if they are not protected under the Fair Work Act, this government needs to expose its plans in more detail so I can explain to my constituents what the protections will be.


On top of this, the 15,000 young people who are intended to be employed under the coalition's Green Army have no guarantee of protection against racial, religious, sex or other forms of discrimination while working in the program, and will not be protected by workplace bullying prevention laws. As I said, people in my inner-city electorate can go home at night, but if they are working out in Woop Woop or beyond the Black Stump—particularly young and vulnerable people—they might be exposed to abuse, I would suggest. The Human Rights Commission's website states under the responsibilities of employers:


Your employer has a legal responsibility under Occupational Health and Safety and anti-discrimination law to provide a safe workplace. Employers have a duty of care for your health and wellbeing whilst at work. An employer that allows bullying to occur in the workplace is not meeting this responsibility.


In this case, they will be employed by private service providers, and therefore they will fall under state and territory workplace health and safety regulations—regulations that are under threat in Queensland at the moment. I do not know the situation in other jurisdictions. 


We now know that participants will receive, at a minimum, some training in first aid and work safety. Where appropriate, cultural awareness training will also be provided. Beyond this, there is no explicit obligation on service providers to provide further training, although we understand the assessment process will ensure that additional training will be rated more highly. We also know that some participants may require work-readiness training, including literacy and numeracy. Young people in my electorate need a guarantee that they will be protected against forms of discrimination while working in the program.


This amendment to the Social Security Act, as proposed by the government, neglects to expose details related to workers' rights, benefits and protections, and it cannot be supported blindly. The associated statement of requirements is equally limited on detail. Since this bill was first introduced, further information has been released on how the Green Army will operate, but only piece by piece. At best, it is piecemeal. Access to formally recognised training delivered by a registered training organisation under the Australian Qualifications Framework is noted in the statement of requirements as an optional component of the program, to be negotiated with each participant. This gives me no confidence that participants will actually gain access to useful training.


The federal Liberal-National government boasts about improving waterways and environmental hubs, including the three promised projects within my electorate that I mentioned earlier. However, the LNP government in Queensland is selling off community garden spaces that this bill is trying to promote. Nyanda State High School in my electorate was closed down at the end of 2013. Running through the grounds of the Nyanda State High School is the Nyanda community garden, where the community has been working to rehabilitate the Rocky Waterholes Creek. This is a very important site for the local community and for training. Not far from the site, I am reliably informed, a platypus has been seen. The local community requested that any proposed development of the school site carve out the area where the garden was. I wrote to the Queensland education minister, John-Paul Langbroek, but unfortunately he refused to shave off this bit of land—even though the LNP government owed this community big time because when they were last in government they closed down the Acacia Ridge High School, moved the students to the old Salisbury State High School and turned it into a new school, Nyanda State High School. Now that they are back in government, they have closed down this high school, at a time when we should be investing in education and when the suburb's numbers are growing. There is a boom in the number of young people coming through local state schools, yet they closed down that high school. 


So, on the one hand, the Abbott government claims to be addressing the issue of youth unemployment through the Green Army Program; on the other hand, it is removing funding for the Youth Connections program, designed to stop young people who have not completed year 12 from falling between the cracks by working with them and their challenges to help them onto the path to work or education. Last year almost 75,000 young people were given the help they needed through Youth Connections, and by the end of this year it is expected to reach 100,000.


There is overwhelming evidence to show how critical the transition from school into work or study is to reducing the lifetime risk of unemployment and boosting lifetime earnings. We know how important it is to be learning or earning. BoysTown and the Smith Family, which have serviced youth in my electorate, will lose their funding under the LNP government, and so these vital services that look after the youth of Moreton will be lost.


Labor seeks a guarantee from the government that all participants in this Green Army Program who are on income support payments will be better off, regardless of their life situation. We need to ensure that participants are not worse off through any changes in income tax, childcare payments or the potential loss of low-income healthcare cards or associated concessions. I also have serious reservations about preserving existing jobs in areas that overlap with activities to be undertaken by the Green Army. The Green Army simply cannot be an excuse for putting Australians out of work in favour of using low-paid participants. The government needs to stop deceiving the Australian public that this is an environmental program. The coalition's track record on environmental policy, as seen in their disastrous Direct Action policy—a policy which they are embarrassed by and about which no environmentalist or economist can find anything good to say—is shameful, and I urge this government to stop ignoring the signs and start looking at effective climate policy and improved environmental preservation.

 (Paterson—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry) (16:58):  I rise today to pledge my support for the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. The reason for this is very simple: it was a proven winner on a number of fronts when it was introduced as the Howard government's successful Green Corps program. The coalition government is delivering a key election commitment to establish the Green Army, starting from July this year. The Green Army will build on the former Green Corps program that was established in 1996 to employ young people on environmental projects to preserve and restore our natural and cultural environment.


The Green Army will offer young Australians aged from 17 to 24 the opportunity to support local environment and heritage conservation projects while gaining hands-on practical skills and work experience in conservation management. The experience and training received will count towards a qualification in land management, park management, landscaping or horticulture. The Green Army will make a real difference to the environment and to local communities through projects such as restoring and protecting habitat, weeding, planting, cleaning up creeks and rivers, and restoring cultural heritage places. 


This voluntary initiative is both an environmental and a training program. It will help young people increase their skills base, gain practical experience and enhance their job readiness. It also complements the government's Direct Action Plan on climate change. The Direct Action Plan gives the community the ability to address our environmental challenges and to reduce our emissions at the lowest possible cost. 


I support this bill because it provides a common-sense pathway of exposure to those still to decide whether they want to pursue further education in environmental disciplines. I am especially looking forward to rolling out this initiative in my electorate, as the community there has a high unemployment rate, particularly amongst our youth. I support this bill because it seeks to help the long-term unemployed to find and keep a job. In my electorate, we have an issue with youth unemployment and this bill focuses on that as an area of concern. 


At the start of this year, the Newcastle Herald published a study by the Centre of Full Employment and Equity, a think tank backed by the University of Newcastle. It named 14 Hunter suburbs as 'red alert'—high-risk localities for predicted unemployment rise. One of the report's co-authors, Professor Scott Baum from Griffith University, said parts of the Hunter—including Raymond Terrace, which is in my electorate—had been identified because of a low proportion of skilled workers, high rates of casual labour, low education levels among residents and a high concentration of workers in declining industries. He also said that it would hit particularly hard in areas where there is already high unemployment and a high concentration of employment in industries like mining, retail and manufacturing—the types of jobs they predicted to be more at risk or in decline. 


It is true that currently my electorate is experiencing a high rate of youth unemployment. While estimates of the exact figure for youth unemployment in my electorate vary widely, the Brotherhood of St Laurence recently launched a campaign to bring attention to the crisis of youth unemployment in Australia. According to their 'My chance, our future' youth employment campaign, the figure has risen across the country and sits at around 12.2 per cent nationally. That is up from 8.8 per cent in 2008. They include my electorate in the Hunter statistics. They estimate that the unemployment rate among 15- to 24-year-olds sits at around 9.5 per cent. The ABS statistics claim that it sits at 7.1 per cent. Any way you look at it, it is not a figure to be celebrated. 


We need to get these young people out of a life of welfare dependency and into the workforce. As I told the Newcastle Herald recently, there is no silver bullet to fix soaring teen unemployment rates in the Hunter. Over the past two to three years, there has been a general downturn in business confidence and people have not yet seen the light at the end of the tunnel. After six years of bad management and spiralling debts, the government have a massive workload ahead of us. We have to get the economy back on track and get people into jobs and out of unemployment queues. 


The Hunter is like most regional areas. When business is doing it tough, jobs become scarcer and apprenticeships dry up—and are treated as alternative cheap labour, which in turn affects our national skill base. That is why we are working hard to deliver new policies that encourage job growth and private investment. One of those policies of course is to kill off the carbon tax. Let us be frank about it: the carbon tax killed jobs, not just in my electorate but right across Australia. Businesses in the Hunter have told me that the carbon tax was an added pressure to their operations they could ill afford. It resulted in job losses. 


This year, we have seen many industrial companies in my electorate reconfigure their employment structures. In the past fortnight we have seen OneSteel announce plans to shed 100 jobs, Downer EDI announce plans to cut 200 jobs and Chain Valley Colliery confirm plans to cut 73 jobs. Falling commodity prices, lower business confidence and job cuts in mining and car manufacturing have a flow-on effect on youths searching for apprenticeships or indeed full-time jobs. The coalition have introduced legislation to repeal the costly carbon tax and the monstrous mining tax. We know from speaking to our constituents that this will boost business confidence. We will keep working towards cutting red tape for small business to assist the economy to grow. 


The Newcastle Herald also reported on a future constituent of mine—when I say 'future constituent', I mean that she has not yet reached voting age—Tabatha Tyne. The 17-year-old Ms Tyne has spent a lot of the last four months on the hunt for a part-time job. A former vice-captain of Raymond Terrace High School, she graduated last year and is a member of the volunteer youth reference group that provides early intervention mental health services to people aged 12 to 25. During her final years at school, Ms Tyne completed a TAFE course in community services and is now studying full-time for a certificate IV in youth work at TAFE. She plans to undertake a further diploma so she can be a youth worker. Ms Tyne travels from her Raymond Terrace home into Newcastle two days a week for her studies. She has been looking for a job in retail since finishing school. She is clearly a determined young woman, a hard worker, motivated and goal driven. However, she also falls into the youth unemployment category. For now she relies on a fortnightly youth allowance payment. She believes this is due to a lack of job experience. 


Job experience is what the Green Army Program will offer the young and unemployed. I believe we can, through programs like this, arm young Australians with the skills to get and keep jobs. It will not only actively improve hundreds of sites across the country but allow local young people to get training and learn to work as part of a team. I am hoping that joining the Green Army will become a rite of passage for hundreds of young people in the years ahead. Joining the Green Army will teach many young people about teamwork and local ownership—and about the value of belonging to something greater than themselves. 


In the lead-up to the election last year, we had already earmarked a project in the Paterson electorate at Lemon Tree Passage. Nine young people will receive training in environmental rehabilitation at the Tilligerry Peninsula as part of the 170,000 Green Army project. This project consists of the rehabilitation of up to five kilometres of foreshore pathways, boardwalks and walking paths. The work will consist of pathway upgrades, bush regeneration works and the renewal of the seven walking bridges in the area. The benefits of the scheme extend to the community. The existing pathways are extremely popular but are degrading to a point where they are no longer meeting safety requirements. Now the residents will be able to enjoy walking the area as a leisurely Sunday stroll rather than as an intense work-out. This project will also help reduce the burden on the Port Stephens council in fixing and upgrading council infrastructure. 


Tilligerry Peninsula has a large population of an endangered species: it is recognised as valuable koala habitat. The bush regeneration will assist in providing safer areas for the koalas to live in and allow better access for visitors to view the koalas. The workers on this project will receive training and experience in pathway construction, carpentry, landscaping and bush regeneration as well as occupational health and safety and first aid training. The participants will also receive a $400-a-week training wage and a TAFE accredited training wage upon completion of the program. 


I want to see this program grow and thrive like its previous version, the Green Corps program. Over the life of the Howard government's Green Corps program, its participants produced incredible results and the benefits are still evident today. The participants planted more than 14 million trees, erected more than 8,000 kilometres of fencing, cleared more than 50,000 hectares of weeds and constructed more than 5,000 kilometres of walking track or boardwalks. In my electorate, a Green Corps team removed over a tonne of rubbish from an almost two-kilometre long walkway at the Grahamstown canal. They also reduced the amount of lantana beside the walkway and planted thousands of trees and native grasses. 


There are four other sites in my electorate which received Green Corps grants under the Howard government. An example from the second round of the grant scheme was the Hunter Regional Organisation of Councils. This Green Corps project focused on revegetating the roadside corridors adjacent to the New England Highway in towns like Branxton, Lochinvar, Greta and Rutherford. The main focus of the project was to create corridors of green along major road reserves, restoration of native vegetation and habitats and the reversal of land degradation. The third round included a project for the historic Tocal Homestead on the CB Alexander Agricultural College at Paterson. This project involved the regeneration of riverine rainforest and wetlands, construction of post and rail fences and building conservation. In round 6, this college received another project grant when the Green Corps were called in to regenerate more of the riverine rainforest and wetland ecosystems at Tocal in the lower Paterson Valley. Tocal holds a large land mass and its campus spans broadacre land. 


Finally, in round 9, the Green Corps were called by the Tilligerry Habitat Association to the restio wetland area. This project was designed to prepare wetlands for public visitation. As such, this job required boardwalk and path construction, mulching, pruning, planting and water management. These projects all led to the participants gaining skills that they would not have attained had they just been claiming the dole. 


These projects also led to one of my constituents winning Paterson Corporate Citizen of the Year in 2006. Shane Bailey was a team leader in Green Corps projects. He won the award on the basis of his work mentoring young people. Mr Bailey worked with the Green Corps teams who were undertaking six-month projects in the Port Stephens area. He was an inspiration to these young people by providing career advice and also by acting as a referee for the youths when they had gained the experience and skills and were applying for jobs. To him it was more than a job; it was about the people. So I awarded him the honour due to his enthusiasm for training others in the environmental industry and for his ability to relate to his team members. He is a shining example of what can be achieved through the Green Corps program and, in turn, the revamped Green Army. 


When the former, Labor government took office, this important initiative was torn apart and then it was terminated in 2012. Young people no longer had the opportunity to gain practical skills and improve their local environment. The government is strongly committed to kick-starting the economy and offering the community the ability to address our environmental challenges and to reduce our emissions. I call on the Labor Party and all members of the parliament to support the Social Security Legislation (Green Army Programme) Amendment Bill 2014 for the benefit that it will provide to our environment, for the benefit it will provide to our young people and for the positive effect it will have on our community as a whole. I commend this bill to the House without any reservation.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (17:12):  The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014 is a poor excuse for an environment policy. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Social Security Act and the Social Security (Administration) Act to clarify social security arrangements for participants receiving the Green Army allowance paid under the Green Army Program. 



It is my understanding that the coalition's Green Army Program aims to recruit young people to perform environmental tasks across the country and to pay them a training wage to perform environmental tasks that are currently being performed by other employees and businesses throughout the country. There are two arms to the coalition's environment policy, Direct Action. The focus of Direct Action is to pay big-polluting companies a government subsidy in the hope and wish that they shall reduce their carbon emissions over time. It is a complete reversal, the complete antithesis, of the Liberal and conservative philosophy of government subsidies to business to pay big polluters in the hope that they will reduce their emissions over time. 


The program that we currently have in place, the carbon price, is one whereby the big polluters pay for the right to pollute in our economy. The money and revenue that is generated from those big polluters paying for the right to pump carbon into our environment is used to commercialise renewable energy. Half of the revenue that is raised from the carbon price is used to promote renewable energy in Australia and throughout our economy. The other half is provided to people on low incomes and pensioners to ensure that they can meet cost-of-living increases as a result of electricity price increases. That is the system we have at the moment. The polluter pays system is going to be replaced by a system where the government pays the polluter, and the coalition calls that progress! That is the first arm of this government's environmental policy, and what a backward step that is.


The second arm of their environmental policy is the one that we are debating here in the chamber tonight, the Green Army Program. This is a program that will see Australians being paid a training wage to perform environmental tasks throughout the country, replacing those who are already performing those tasks—the bush regeneration companies, the landscapers and the local government authorities—who are being paid a normal wage and are getting the protection of occupational health and safety and workers' compensation provisions throughout the country. They are getting paid an award wage for the work they perform. But the government are going to replace those employees and those businesses that are doing that work at the moment with a group of Australians on a training wage. The government are seeking to deceive the Australian public into believing that this is an environmental program. The reason for that is simple—they do not have a coherent environmental policy. In fact, many on that side do not believe earnestly in climate change and our nation taking action on this important issue.


The program we are debating here today is an employment program and as such the participants should be treated as employees. Labor believes that environment based work and training programs can be an effective pathway to work for many job seekers as well as providing environmental benefits. Workplace training programs have potential, if well designed and implemented, to achieve these twin goals; however, there are a number of questions that remain unanswered with respect to the Green Army Program. The bill does not, as is expected by the people whom I represent in Kingsford Smith, lay out the detail required for analysis or discussion. It is also clear that it is a pseudoenvironment policy from a government that could not care less about serious policies to tackle climate change.


In contrast, when Labor were in government we developed policies aimed at conserving Australia's pristine environment. One policy was Caring for our Country. Caring for our Country aimed to achieve an environment that was healthier, better protected, well managed and resilient and that provided essential ecosystem services in a changing climate. Under the first phase of Caring for our Country, from 2008 to 2013, the Labor government invested more than $2 billion to protect and rebuild the resilience of our environment. The second phase of the program was designed to support land managers; community groups, including Indigenous groups; industry; and local environment groups. Caring for our Country target area grants provided funding of between $50,000 and $2 million for projects to maintain ecosystem services, protect our conservation estate and enhance the capacity of Indigenous communities to conserve and protect natural resources across six target areas. The target area grants focused investment in critical areas of our environment, which were selected in recognition of their high levels of vulnerability and importance. Through the target area grants and the second round of the Biodiversity Fund Labor invested in landscape scale restoration of our environment, including some of our most valuable ecosystems.


In addition to Caring for our Country, Labor became the first government to seriously deal with the central challenge of restoring the Murray-Darling Basin to health after chronic neglect by the coalition. After decades of overallocation and disagreement on how to manage the river, Labor began to restore the balance in the system and bring the river back to health. Under the plan 2,750 gigalitres of surface water will be recovered for the environment and used to benefit wetlands, forests and river flows, including the Ramsar listed wetlands in South Australia. Importantly, the plan was designed to achieve the government's target of having the Murray-Darling river mouth open nine years out of 10.


Labor agrees that we need to do everything we can to get people into work. Labor in government had a record of creating jobs in our economy. Close to one million jobs were created over the six years of the last Labor government. We believe that every individual who can work should be given that chance. We know this can only happen with appropriate support. Labor put in place a number of important employment programs—such as Youth Connections, which I understand is facing the axe in tonight's budget—for people in our community living with disabilities, the young, elderly job seekers and the long-term unemployed to ensure that they have the necessary support to get back into the labour movement. Labor believes in helping people to get a job through the right training, work experience and incentives and, most importantly, with the appropriate level of support.


This bill as proposed by the government omits much of the detail related to workers' rights, benefits and protections. The statement of requirements is equally scant on some of the detail. The question that I pose on behalf of many businesses in Kingsford Smith is: what happens to those small businesses that currently work in this space—the bush regeneration businesses and local landscaping businesses that do local government work—businesses that are currently training staff, paying award wages, providing occupational health and safety and workers compensation support? They are providing training and apprenticeships for people to undertake and gain training in landscaping and environmental conservation. They will be forced out by a cheaper government scheme. Access to formally recognised training delivered by a registered training organisation under the Australian Qualifications Framework is noted in the SOR as an optional component of the program to be negotiated with each individual participant. This gives no confidence that participants will actually gain access to training.


Labor is concerned that the bill does not provide adequate protections for participants in the scheme, namely in the areas of OH&S, workers compensation and rehabilitation. We have been told that participants will be covered by relevant state legislation and insurance, while work safety will be audited by the department. Although this provides some protection, the price of safety will be constant vigilance.


Australians are right to be suspicious of the motives of this government when it comes to environmental and employment programs. The government has made it clear that protection of the environment is not one of its priorities through its Direct Action program. A further concern of Labor is the crowding-out aspect of this bill. The government must assure those hardworking Australians in local government and other authorities and those small businesses that work in this space that they will not be displaced and that their businesses will not be affected by the Green Army participants coming in and doing their work.


To conclude, I believe that the government needs to answer a number of questions before this bill is given passage through the House and the Senate. Those questions are as follows. Firstly, why are participants not considered workers or employees under the Work Health and Safety Act, the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Fair Work Act? Secondly, exactly what are the implications for participants not being considered workers or employees under these acts? Thirdly, how will the program support people into mainstream employment? That must be the focus of employment and training programs. It is not a quick-fix, quasi-environmental program. It is an employment program. How will people get into long-term employment through these pathways? That question has not been answered by the government in proposing this bill. Will there be minimum training outcomes? If so, what are they? And will there be minimum training hours required for those participating in the program? What protections will there be to ensure that no businesses currently providing and working in this space will lose business or that, indeed, no employees will lose their jobs as a result of the passage of this bill? They are the questions that constituents in Kingsford Smith, in our community, wish the government to answer before this bill is passed.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (17:25):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme Bill) 2014. I do so to support this bill wholeheartedly. Firstly, the practical measures of this bill amend the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999. They clarify the social security arrangements for participants that will be receiving the Green Army allowance. The Green Army is set to become Australia's largest ever environmental workforce. It will deliver work and jobs for 15,000 people, making it the largest standing environmental workforce in our history. It is a program that will provide real and practical solutions for clearing up our riverbeds and creeks, revegetating sand dunes and revegetating mangrove habitats, amongst the many other environmental remediation initiatives.


There are two bonuses for the community in this. Firstly, there are the environmental benefits that we will receive throughout Australia. Secondly, there are the training benefits for 15,000 young Australians who will receive the opportunity to have up to 20 weeks training in an environmental program. So, it is good news on both fronts.


I am very proud of the projects that have already been announced in my electorate, which are all based around the Georges River. The Georges River has a long history with Australia's settlement. It was first explored by Bass and Flinders back in 1795, when they took that famous little boat of theirs, the Tom Thumb, and sailed it all the way around from Port Phillip, around into Botany Bay and up the Georges River. They mapped the area all the way up to Georges Fair. That expedition opened up a lot of the land and farmland around Bankstown.


Another part of the Georges River that is very historically important is the weir at Liverpool. That was constructed in 1836. That was the dividing mark on the river, where on one side was the brackish saltwater and on the other was the freshwater. Everything upstream from the weir was all freshwater, which became the drinking supply for the township of Liverpool. Today, over one million people live in the catchment area of the Georges River. It is one of the most highly urbanised catchment areas in Australia. It has over 200 years of history behind it. It is an area that needs significant environmental remediation in many areas.


I am proud to say that we already have announced for my electorate six separate Green Army programs—one in Kelso Creek, one in Clinches Pond at Moorebank, one at Wattle Grove Lake, one at Yeramba Lagoon, another at Harris Creek in Holsworthy and one on the border of my electorate, under the Liverpool Bridge, at the famous Lighthorse Park. These programs will make a serious and significant improvement to the environment along the Georges River, for the thousands and thousands of people that use the river for recreation. In fact, I was down there late last week and a little fishing boat had pulled up. The guy who was fishing there had caught about a dozen blackfish. So the river is actually not in bad nick now, but a lot more could be done to improve the quality of the river and to bring it closer to what it was when Bass and Flinders first sailed down there in 1795.


While I am talking about the Georges River and the things on our environmental program, I would like to give my congratulations to the Chauvel Park Environmental Group. This is a group of citizens in the local community who are doing work similar to what the Green Army would do but on a volunteer basis. I have been down there and seen them working away on the weekend. They showed me the river banks, and there is that much work and clearing of vegetation to do that it is almost beyond explanation. When the member for Kingsford-Smith talks about how these programs will somehow crowd out what some other community members are doing, it is just absolute and complete nonsense. I would like to congratulate Robert Storey and Ian Bailey and all the other workers in that Chauvel Park Environmental Group for the great work that they do, and I am sure that that can be complementary to all the other things the green army project will be doing.


I have heard during this debate many members from the opposition making sad, sniping remarks complaining about this program and saying how truly wonderful their carbon tax program has been in taking action on climate change. This program provides a true example of the difference between the coalition and the opposition. What we are proposing here provides practical steps to improve the environmental areas of our country. In comparison, things like the carbon tax are purely symbolic and have absolutely no beneficial effect on the environment. This is the difference. The carbon tax actually does do a few things for the environment and that is exactly what I would like to get onto. What we see with Labor's carbon tax is a classic example of the law of leftist unintended consequences. That law simply states, for every leftist government law, hurriedly passed in response to a current or recent crisis, to give greater power to government or to provide for more centralised control over the economy, there will be two or more unintended consequences that will have greater negative effects than the problem it was designed to fix, often harming the very people the legislation is intended to assist. I would like to give an example of how the carbon tax does that and contrast that to the green army program. 


One thing the carbon tax does is push up the price of electricity. What is the average person's response to an increase in a price in one particular good or one particular way of producing things? They look for substitutes and alternatives. That is exactly what is happening in Sydney as we speak, today. People are finding that they cannot afford to turn on the heater to warm their house during winter. So what are people doing? They are going out to the bush or to their backyard, cutting down a tree and burning the wood. They are using wood fires as a substitute because of the high electricity prices. They are burning wood to keep themselves warm. What effect does that have? We know that when you burn wood you release into the atmosphere not only carbon dioxide but also particulate matter. In Sydney in winter, between 50 and 60 per cent of the particulate matter in the atmosphere comes about through people using wood fires in their homes to keep themselves warm. This action releases particulate matter, commonly known as PM10 or PM2.5. 


Why is there a concern about this particulate matter? I refer to a few recent reports. Firstly, the report of the World Health Organisation states: 


PM affects more people than any other pollutant. The major components of PM are sulfate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust and water. It consists of a complex mixture of solid and liquid particles in organic and inorganic substances suspended in the air. The most health-damaging particles are those with a diameter of 10 microns or less, which can penetrate and lodge deep inside the lungs. Chronic exposure to particles contributes to the risk of developing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as lung cancer.


A recent article written by Professor Bin Jalaludin notes:


… the world's leading experts on cancer, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified outdoor air pollution as a carcinogenic to humans. The agency's report, Air Pollution and Cancer, said there's now sufficient evidence that components of outdoor air pollution can cause cancer.


He notes that air pollution is:


… one environmental hazard that everyone is exposed to; we all have to breath the air around us.


Even unborn children are exposed to the potential harm of air pollution, a complex mixture of particles that can be solids or aerosols, and gases.


It was only a few years ago that the New South Wales Chief Health Officer, Denise Robinson, told a public inquiry at New South Wales Parliament House that the deaths of between 600 and 1,400 Sydneysiders every year could be attributed at least partly to air pollution. I will repeat that: between 600 and 1,400 deaths are attributed to air pollution in Western Sydney. The World Health Organisation rightly sets maximum recommend pollution levels. Although they say that there is no safe level, there is no threshold that they have identified at which no damage to health is possible, they do note that guidelines for the particulate matter PM10 is 20 microns per cubic metre as an annual mean. What has happened in Western Sydney since the carbon tax has been introduced? It has turned more people over to burning wood, releasing more particulate matter. We have the measurements of the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage from their monitoring station in Liverpool. Since the carbon tax was introduced in 2010, every single year the particulate pollution in Western Sydney has increased. Last year the particulate pollution in Western Sydney was above World Health Organisation standards for PM10.


For PM10, pollution has increased 25 per cent since the carbon tax was introduced. These levels of air pollution are caused by wood heating, which people converted to to try to keep their home warm in the winter, because of the imposition of the carbon tax. In Western Sydney we now have pollution levels above those the World Health Organisation recommends. The situation is just as bad for the more dangerous particulate, PM2.5. Since the carbon tax has been introduced, it has pushed up the prices of electricity and people have converted to heating their homes with wood. PM2.5 pollution, the most deadly of all the particulate pollutions, has actually increased by 50 per cent since 2010. 


These are the unintended consequences of bad policy and symbolic policy which is actually harming the environment and harming the air quality of people in Western Sydney today. That is what we are dealing with here in this parliament. It is not only a matter of the cost burden on the community. Policies like the carbon tax are actually harming the environment and they are harming the health of millions of citizens that live in Western Sydney today. This is what we get from the opposition.


We need to think through the unintended consequences of this bad policy. That is why I am so glad that we on this side of the House are taking practical steps to improve the environment in Western Sydney. We are taking practical steps with our Green Army Program to improve the quality and the health of the Georges River for the benefit of all Sydneysiders. That is what a good government does: take practical steps rather than simply symbolic steps that have these unintended consequences which today are harming the health of residents of Western Sydney, not only in my electorate but throughout the entire Western and South-West Sydney basin.


So I commend this bill to the House. Again, it shows the difference between the coalition and the opposition. We are here taking practical, real steps that will improve the environment in Western Sydney, while the opposition are intent on implementing these symbolic measures that not only have no effect but do the opposite—cause harm to people's health.

"Conroy, Pat, MP",ALP,2014-05-13,"



Mr CONROY
 (Charlton) (17:40):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. Labor supports training that helps people gain work experience and increase their opportunities to get a job. We agree that there is value in engaging unemployed people and empowering them with skills that they need to get a foot in the door with an employer. We also see merit in targeting environmental, conservation and heritage projects to deliver these practical work experience programs and teach people new skills. That is why Labor has a record of support for programs that share the core aims of the Green Army Program. Indeed, it was the Keating government that established the Landcare and Environment Action Program in 1992, which saw young people between the ages of 15 and 20 years broaden their practical know-how and which equipped them with new skills through various landcare activities.


However, this current incarnation, the Green Army program, contains a number of concerning aspects which deserve proper scrutiny. While this bill goes only to the social security elements of the Green Army, there are much broader issues to be debated, some of which have been the subject of an inquiry in the other place. More predictably, this bill serves to continue the tradition of this Liberal government of engaging in acts of empty symbolism. The government say they want to build a green workforce, but participants are not guaranteed they will be better off than if they were receiving income support payments. They say that this program is about skills and training, but, beyond basic workplace induction, there is no guarantee of further qualifications. They say they want to tackle climate change, but they have shown they are determined to take this country backward in its approach to protecting the environment and reducing dangerous carbon emissions.


In the electorate I represent, there are around 4,000 people receiving income support payments to look for work. In the Hunter region more broadly there are over 25,000 people receiving these payments. Of these, it is young people between the ages of 17 and 24 who will potentially be affected by this legislation. Some of these people may have only just left school, and almost certainly there will be a significant number who have little or no experience in a formal workplace. It is imperative, therefore, that the safety of these young people is guaranteed. Indeed, given that the program will engage volunteers in physical, outdoor tasks—such as landscaping, construction of boardwalks and walking tracks, and the cleaning of waterways and creek banks—ensuring the safety of participants is arguably the most important part of this policy.


The government has said that participants will be covered by relevant state legislation and insurance held by service providers and the Commonwealth. Work safety will also be subject to auditing by the department. Despite this, Labor remains concerned that this bill does not provide adequate protections for participants in the scheme. This is especially concerning for people in New South Wales, where the workers compensation and rehabilitation system has been severely eroded under the state coalition government.


The government predicts that the program will expand rapidly, up from 250 projects and 2,500 participants in the first year to 1,500 projects and 15,000 participants by 2018-19. This paints a scenario where a large number of people are moved out of the social security sector and into the skills and training sector. The change, as reflected in this bill, sees a participant shift from income support payments to a training allowance and provides an exemption from job search requirements throughout the course of the program.


We know that participants will receive first aid and work safety training. Where appropriate, cultural awareness training will also be provided. Beyond this, however, there is no explicit obligation on service providers to provide training. This represents a significant flaw in the program. For starters, we know that some participants may require work-readiness training, including literacy and numeracy if appropriate. Will they receive this training? Furthermore, it is important that young people in the Green Army are rewarded for their time and effort. The program must provide those who go through its ranks with relevant training that is formally recognised, and participants should rightly expect to come out of the program with marketable skills that are in demand by employers.


The equivalent program in the last Labor government, the National Green Jobs Corps, required organisations to provide participants with at least 130 hours of accredited training. That is around five hours per week of accredited training for participants over the six months. We strongly believe that accredited training should be a core element of this program—and it must be accredited training, not some sort of voluntary sham.


While they are a part of the Green Army, participants receive more pay than they would receive on the ordinary income support payment, albeit less than the minimum wage. Nonetheless, the government must guarantee that all participants on income support payments will be better off, regardless of their life situation. Income tax increases, reduction in childcare payments and the potential loss of low-income healthcare cards are important for families trying to make ends meet. We must ensure that this program does not have a negative impact on these concessions and that it will not mean these participants are worse off.


In predicting such a high participation rate, the government must also ensure that the Green Army does not come at the expense of other workers—for example, those in the local government sector. This program is supposed to be about empowering job seekers. It is not, should not and cannot be a vehicle to replace jobs that are already being done for a decent wage and with reasonable conditions, and substitute them with a literal army of low-paid workers. Given the agenda of this government, we are right to be sceptical of its motives. This is a government that does nothing when it comes to people losing their jobs or having their pay cut. Let us not forget that under this government more than 60,000 Australians have lost their job. Under this government the foundations have been laid for a full-blown attack on the penalty rates of the hundreds of thousands of casual, part-time shift workers. This is not a government that cares about jobs or about workers.


In contrast, the Labor Party will always be the party that fights for the rights and conditions of workers. The Labor movement has always fought for decent workplace standards, and safety at work is a fundamental part of this. We on this side ask Mr Abbott: how will you guarantee the safety of young people working for the Green Army? So far, the answer is that it is not their problem; it is not their concern. These young people must look to the state and territory governments for reassurance that they will be taken care of if they are injured at work. In my electorate this will sound a dark and ominous warning, because the workers of New South Wales, particularly those in my electorate, are currently suffering under a state coalition government that has completely dismantled the workers compensation system. Thanks to the New South Wales Liberals, a worker who is injured on the way to work now has no claim to compensation. Injured workers who already receive payments have had their access to the scheme drastically reduced, even if their injury is for life. We have even had suggestions that if you lose a limb—if you have an amputation as a result of a workplace injury—it is not an injury serious enough to demand compensation. All of this has been done with the support of the Prime Minister and the coalition here in Canberra, who at the same time have launched their own brutal attack on the livelihoods of working people.


Close to my home in Newcastle, the Liberals have abandoned funding for the community based Hunterlink Recovery Services, a venture that sees unions and employers working together to support young men and women in the Newcastle and Lake Macquarie areas who are experiencing addiction and mental health issues. As we know, these issues often manifest themselves as problems at work. Labor supported this program; the coalition does not. This is just one example of the coalition's approach to workers' health and safety.


We are also right to expose the empty environmental symbolism contained in this program. Those opposite say that this is all about improving the environment, but this government has no credibility when it comes to supporting Australia's environment. This government's failure on the environment has already attracted international notoriety for some of the most draconian attacks we have seen. Some of these attacks include undoing the management plans for the world's largest marine reserve system; turning back decades of bipartisan support for the Commonwealth's role in protecting matters of national environmental significance; and attempting to delist world heritage areas, making us one of only three nations attempting to delist a World Heritage area, in which we share the esteemed company of Oman and Tanzania. They have also destroyed the Tasmanian forestry agreement which has been worked on for so long by environmental groups, the forestry industry and workers.


However, the two most glaring attacks on the environment, committed by this government, have been its constant undermining of the renewable energy target and their attempts to stop Australia combating climate change. On the RET, they have commissioned a review conducted by climate change sceptics, particularly Dick Warburton. We have seen incredibly stupid remarks by the Treasurer about how he finds offensive the wind turbines he sees when he drives down to Canberra. We have seen them talk about undermining the RET, reducing it and possibly even abolishing it. Certainly, we have seen some very worrying remarks. If they do this we will see $18 billion of current investment in the renewable energy sector stranded. We will also see the jeopardising of another $18 billion in clean energy investment if the MRET policy is lost. This would directly affect the employment of 24,000 people who are employed in the renewable energy industry and would represent a breach by those opposite of a pre-election promise to maintain the renewable energy target. We saw very strong direct commitments by the Minister for the Environment when he was the opposition spokesperson. Any attempt to water down the renewable energy target would be another broken promise by a government that is specialising in broken promises.


On climate change, those on the opposite side are a fraud. They are made up of two different groups: a group that does not accept climate change and a group that, for pure political pragmatism, refuses to take action. We even heard the previous speaker suggest that taking action to combat climate change causes cancer. These people will grasp at any straw to oppose action on climate change. This is despite the fact that the science is well and truly in. Over 97 per cent of published scientific reports by climate change experts conclude that climate change is happening and manmade climate action is the direct driver. Scientists now say that climate change is occurring with a certainty of 95 per cent. To put that in context, that is the same certainty with which they say tobacco causes cancer. Those on the other side reject it, and when they pay lip service to combatting climate change, they have their ridiculous joke of a policy, Direct Action. It is a policy of centralised government control, a policy so woefully inefficient that the Grattan Institute has concluded it will cost over $100 billion to get to the Commonwealth's minimum target of a five per cent reduction in greenhouse emissions, even though a larger target is quite possible. So we see them paying lip service with a program that will cost over $100 billion and that will cost Australian households $1,300 per year. At the same time we see attempts to scrap the rational, efficient way of combating climate change, which the last government put in place: the 20 per cent renewable energy target, which I have already spoken about; the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which is filling a vital gap in the finance of new large power stations; and, if the reports are to be believed, the abolition of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, a vital agency supporting R&D innovation in renewable energy—another broken promise and another breach of their trust with the electorate. Ultimately, there is the abolition of the fixed price emissions trading scheme that we have now, the carbon price, and the refusal to engage in shifting it to flexible price emissions trading scheme.


We heard the last speaker say that the carbon price is not working. The facts are in; it is working. Since the carbon price began we have seen a 7.6 per cent fall in emissions from the electricity sector alone. That represents a 15-million-tonne reduction in carbon pollution emissions. That is equivalent to taking almost four million cars off the road. Emissions are relatively flat for the broader economy, but the growth in emissions has been in sectors not covered by the carbon price. The carbon price is working. It will be more efficient and effective when we shift to a flexible price emissions trading scheme linked to the rest of the world. But anyone who says it is not working and not reducing emissions is either trying to fool people or lying.


We have to combat climate change. We have to take care of our environment. We heard a lot today in question time about intergenerational equity. One of the most important obligations of this generation of the decision makers in this House is to leave the environment, the planet and Australia in a better position for our children and our grandchildren. I have an 11-month-old daughter and I want her coming of age in an environment that is better than now, where I can look her in the eye and say, 'This parliament, this government, this country took action on climate change as part of an international effort to reduce dangerous carbon emissions.'


To get back to this legislation, the Green Army Program is something the opposition will not oppose. We have serious questions marks about its implementation. I know our spokesperson is in meetings with the minister about it, and hopefully we can resolve the issues. Supporting on-the-ground conservation is important, but it cannot be done by sacrificing the safety of the workers involved, by putting out of work people who are already undertaking this work, or by paying them less than income support payments. We support this program, with appropriate safeguards. It builds on long-term programs run by the Keating, Howard, Rudd and Gillard governments. I think we just need to improve the implementation of it and we need to look at moving environmental action beyond empty symbolism to combatting climate change to ensure that our environment is in good hands.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2014-05-13,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (17:55):  I rise to support the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. The bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to clarify participation arrangements for the participants receiving the Green Army allowance paid under the Green Army Program. This is an exciting piece of legislation for the people in my electorate of Swan. It marks the start of a delivery of real environmental action on the ground in my electorate after six years of no action under the Rudd-Gillard Labor experiment.


This legislation, as much as any other, encapsulates the difference between the coalition and the Labor Party in general. Pretty much the Labor Party's only approach to the environment over the last few years has been a tax, the carbon tax—a plan that involves redistributing money, buying permits offshore and the expenditure of taxpayers money on a massive bureaucratic system of paper shuffling and redistributed money-go-rounds, all to produce no result. Despite the $7.6 billion tax, emissions for the first 12 months barely changed—it was by 0.01 per cent. It is a grand internationally focused macro scheme that does not recognise local environmental issues on the ground or trust that local people have the knowledge to improve our environment. Consequently the environment in my electorate of Swan received zero benefit from the previous government's policies. In fact, the Perth NRM received a funding cut of nearly half its budget under the Howard government. That funding cut was $2 million. This was cut from the Perth NRM funding under the previous Labor government.


The coalition's approach is different and it has always been different. It is an approach for real action on the ground to tackle environmental issues and improve our environment through practical measures. Take for example the Howard government's Green Corps program, which achieved results on the ground. The program propagated and planted more than 14 million trees; erected more than 8,000 kilometres of fencing; and constructed or maintained more than 5,000 kilometres of walking tracks and boardwalks. Under Labor's watch this important initiative was torn apart, rebadged and failed to improve the environment.


The previous speaker, the member for Charlton, spoke about ensuring the safety of the participants in the scheme. I know the member for Charlton was not here at the time under the Rudd-Gillard Labor government, but I see him stand there and talk about ensuring the safety of the participants in this scheme, yet we now have a royal commission looking into the pink batts scheme, where four people died and over 200 houses were burnt down and numerous people had problems with the scheme, which endangered the lives of many people. He stands up there and says he is worried about ensuring the safety of the participants in this scheme, but where was the Labor Party in ensuring the safety of those who died in the pink batts scheme. It is hypocrisy to the maximum by the Labor Party yet again.


The former Labor government transformed the previous program into a program where young long-term unemployed Australians were reclassified and continued to receive an income support payment, but with very little done to actually help the environment. The program failed to engage local communities to ensure that projects met local environmental needs, to motivate the long-term unemployed, to encourage the participation of young people who are passionate about the environment or deliver a program that engaged the participants for the duration of the project. I know that one of the first things I did as a candidate was to go to a site being run by the Green Corps under the Howard government and see a fantastic program employing young Indigenous people in the electorate of Swan. As I said before, I know we are limited for time, and I seek your indulgence to continue my speech at the next opening of parliament.

"Coulton, Mark, MP",Nats,2014-05-13,"



Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (16:36):  Before question time, I was extolling the virtues of the Green Army program and speaking about what I believe are the benefits for people in my electorate. The target participants are younger people who are predominantly unemployed. I am already working on projects in my electorate. Participants in the Boggabilla-Toomelah project, in conjunction with the Moree Plains Shire Council, will undertake training as well as mentoring in the work situation. I have also spoken to some employers in that area so that, at the end of the Green Army project, we may be able to offer some part-time employment in the last couple of weeks and convert this into longer-term employment.


There are jobs in my part of the world. At the moment, many of them are being undertaken by short-term backpacker visitors. Much of this work could be undertaken by local people, but we have to break their cycle of poverty and disconnection. I believe the Green Army program is a way of doing that. There are possibilities in other parts of my electorate. I have heard some of the comments from members of the opposition about environmental programs and the like. The environment is not just iconic sites. It is not just the Snowy Mountains, the Great Barrier Reef or the forests of Tasmania. The natural environment is in need of some attention. 


There has been some talk that the Green Army program may not have environmental outcomes. I have been in discussions with local land services and councils about the eradication of noxious weeds. One which is certainly in need of drastic attention is Hudson pear. For those of you who do not know about it, Hudson pear is a very nasty little cactus bush. The spikes are so sharp that, when it goes through the lips of animals or onto their legs as they walk through it, more often than not animals end up with an infection which is very detrimental to their wellbeing. Indeed, Hudson pear can lead to the death of kangaroos and domestic livestock like sheep and cattle because of the cruel way in which it attaches itself to them. Not only would a Green Army project give practical environmental outcomes but also it would provide opportunities for many people who now are disconnected from the workforce. 


The idea that people can just step up into a job when they come from a household where people do not have a job is incorrect. The Green Army projects in my electorate will come with suitable training and mentoring to help young people come to terms with the concept of turning up to a job every day and the commitment that entails, and also the rewards which genuine, worthwhile work can give to people. Hopefully it will lead to permanent employment.


Another project I have been working on in conjunction with RiverSmart Australia is remedial work in the public areas of the Macquarie Valley. There is an area of about 150 kilometres along the Macquarie River from Wellington down through to Warren and the Macquarie Marshes where a Green Army team could do worthwhile weed control, riverbank stabilisation and build boardwalks to make public areas along the iconic Macquarie River more accessible to the public so that more people can appreciate the beauty of this river. I have been in discussions with Dr Bill Phillips from RiverSmart, who has submitted a very worthwhile proposal for an employment program along the river. That would also include some really worthwhile remedial work in the Tiger Bay Wetlands on the outskirts of Warren along the Macquarie and in the river itself.


I have been a little disappointed by some of the contributions from members of the opposition who see this as some sort of assault on trade unions or some form of cheap, serf labour for young disadvantaged people. The greatest thing we can do to put stability into these young people's lives is give them the opportunity to undertake some form of employment which will be a pathway for them into a future involving work, not disconnectedness, impoverishment and isolation from the mainstream community. Indeed, this program will lead to better outcomes in employment. Also, it will lead to practical environmental outcomes which will benefit the environment, not highfaluting global targets which we may or may not reach but projects that will have a positive effect on the environment in which we live and which sustains us. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014 has my full support.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,13,2,speech
"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2014-05-13,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (16:43):  I note the contribution from the member for Parkes on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. I share some of his optimism about this program but would like to detail some concerns. I was in the Parkes electorate over Easter, on the Macintyre west of Yetman—a beautiful part of the world. I had a lovely time there. I have a soft spot for the Macintyre, which I assume is the northern border of his part of New South Wales. My mum was a Goondiwindi girl. We scattered my mum's ashes on the Macintyre three years ago. It is three years ago tomorrow, in fact, that she passed away. So I have always had a soft spot for that part of the world. It is beautiful.


Obviously, when young people go to particularly remote parts anywhere—even if they are from Toomelah, Parkes or any other part of his electorate—I have concerns about who these young people will be supervised by because of the cultures that can sometimes develop in work camps, in any work camp. My grandfather came from Goondiwindi and he told me many stories about how tough some of the work camps can be in really remote areas. I will go to some of these concerns in my speech.


This legislation is of particular concern because three Green Army projects were promised in the electorate of Moreton prior to the 2013 federal election. I am assuming—rather naively on budget day, I guess—that the Prime Minister will carry out the promise made by the LNP candidate for Moreton to roll out these three Green Army projects. Interestingly, the LNP candidate promised that there would be a jobs symposium within 100 days of the election. I have written to Minister Abetz and Minister Pyne, and still that jobs forum has not taken place.


But I still live in hope that the three Green Army projects that were promised for the Oxley Creek Common, the Archerfield Wetlands and the Granard Wetlands will take place. They are all in the middle of my electorate. Even though mine is an inner-city electorate, these areas—basically, around what I call the Oxley Creek Common area—are a twitcher's paradise. If you go there at any time, you will find a lot of birdwatchers. You can easily see about 70 different species in one hour, even though my electorate is only 10 or 15 minutes from the middle of Brisbane. If you go along there, you can even see jabirus. I have not seen them there, but you can see a jabiru—almost in the middle of Brisbane. Striped honeyeaters, spotted harriers, juvenile little bronze cuckoos and fairy wrens are just some examples. There have been up to 195 bird species seen in this Oxley Creek Common area.


The Green Army seeks to reinstate the failed Green Corps program that was started by the Howard government. The LNP government claims that Green Corps was undermined by the former Rudd-Gillard government; however, it was a Labor government that first introduced the Landcare and Environment Action Program, which aimed to provide work with opportunities for young people while achieving positive environmental outcomes. This grassroots environmental action is extremely important to any community, whether it be the remote communities mentioned by the member for Parkes or inner-city suburbs that have challenges, like those in the electorate of Moreton.


I support action to address these local issues. However, I am concerned that, with only a few months until the program is due to start, no-one is quite clear about the specific details as to how the Green Army will work. I had a look at the application from and there is still a lot of uncertainty about how it will run. I am particularly concerned about its exemptions from workplace health and safety laws, compensation laws, industrial relations laws and even bullying and harassment laws, because those who will be involved are young and because, generally—as you would find if you have had any dealings with such people in your electorate—many have not been academic successes or have had challenges at home and challenges in their family life, so they are often our most vulnerable. Taking away those protections, particularly health and safety laws and those preventing bullying, will make it a particular challenge.


I believe, and Labor believe, that we need to do everything we can to get people into work. We are the Labor Party. It is in our title; it is in our DNA. Every individual who can work should be given the chance to work, but we know that that can only happen if there is appropriate support and protection. We do not want work at any cost. That is the strategy of the economic 'let 'er rip' society. That is not what Australia is about, not since the Harvester Judgement and even before that, you could argue.


Environmental work and training programs are an effective way—I agree with the member for Parkes—of getting people employment, as well as providing environmental benefits that help the nation. Workplace training programs have the potential, if they are well designed and well implemented, to achieve these twin goals. But there still outstanding questions. 


Firstly, I am concerned about wages. We acknowledge that Green Army participants will be paid the equivalent of a training wage, which, while not overly generous, will be more than the income support payments many of them would likely be on. These payments will also be similar to the training wages received by thousands of other young Australians who are in vocational training or education. Certainly, that is the case now—before 7.30 tonight. But, unlike trainees or apprentices, participants in the Green Army are under the supervision of the Commonwealth. Denying them the status of Commonwealth employees leaves them in a no-man's-land in terms of the employer-employee relationship, which affords a range of workplace rights—an area of law I am quite familiar with. They are not considered workers and therefore they would not have the same workplace rights. The ACTU president, Ged Kearney, said:


This is about taking away well-paid, well-protected jobs from people and replacing them with low-paid, unsafe jobs.


Yet, every second day, we have someone from the government talking about the rollout of the insulation program and the concerns that came with that.


Youth unemployment is a significant issue within my electorate, and I do not want the coalition government to think that, if they see unemployment rates for youth improving, it is as a result of these projects, because the Green Army program's wages are not sufficient for our youth to survive on. Our youth need real jobs with real wages, real workplace safety measures in place and a career path.


Those recruited will do manual labour, including clearing local creeks and waterways, fencing and tree planting. I have seen similar programs in my electorate already. Yet this government has ensured that Green Army members will be exempt from Commonwealth workplace laws, including the Work Health and Safety Act, the Fair Work Act and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. One thing that concerns me about the amendments to this bill is that they mean it does not provide adequate protections—namely, in the areas of occupational health and safety, workers compensation and rehabilitation. Every Australian has the right to work in a safe and comfortable environment without concerns about their physical safety or the threat of emotional abuse. This government has a duty of care to these proposed workers and, if they are not protected under the Fair Work Act, this government needs to expose its plans in more detail so I can explain to my constituents what the protections will be.


On top of this, the 15,000 young people who are intended to be employed under the coalition's Green Army have no guarantee of protection against racial, religious, sex or other forms of discrimination while working in the program, and will not be protected by workplace bullying prevention laws. As I said, people in my inner-city electorate can go home at night, but if they are working out in Woop Woop or beyond the Black Stump—particularly young and vulnerable people—they might be exposed to abuse, I would suggest. The Human Rights Commission's website states under the responsibilities of employers:


Your employer has a legal responsibility under Occupational Health and Safety and anti-discrimination law to provide a safe workplace. Employers have a duty of care for your health and wellbeing whilst at work. An employer that allows bullying to occur in the workplace is not meeting this responsibility.


In this case, they will be employed by private service providers, and therefore they will fall under state and territory workplace health and safety regulations—regulations that are under threat in Queensland at the moment. I do not know the situation in other jurisdictions. 


We now know that participants will receive, at a minimum, some training in first aid and work safety. Where appropriate, cultural awareness training will also be provided. Beyond this, there is no explicit obligation on service providers to provide further training, although we understand the assessment process will ensure that additional training will be rated more highly. We also know that some participants may require work-readiness training, including literacy and numeracy. Young people in my electorate need a guarantee that they will be protected against forms of discrimination while working in the program.


This amendment to the Social Security Act, as proposed by the government, neglects to expose details related to workers' rights, benefits and protections, and it cannot be supported blindly. The associated statement of requirements is equally limited on detail. Since this bill was first introduced, further information has been released on how the Green Army will operate, but only piece by piece. At best, it is piecemeal. Access to formally recognised training delivered by a registered training organisation under the Australian Qualifications Framework is noted in the statement of requirements as an optional component of the program, to be negotiated with each participant. This gives me no confidence that participants will actually gain access to useful training.


The federal Liberal-National government boasts about improving waterways and environmental hubs, including the three promised projects within my electorate that I mentioned earlier. However, the LNP government in Queensland is selling off community garden spaces that this bill is trying to promote. Nyanda State High School in my electorate was closed down at the end of 2013. Running through the grounds of the Nyanda State High School is the Nyanda community garden, where the community has been working to rehabilitate the Rocky Waterholes Creek. This is a very important site for the local community and for training. Not far from the site, I am reliably informed, a platypus has been seen. The local community requested that any proposed development of the school site carve out the area where the garden was. I wrote to the Queensland education minister, John-Paul Langbroek, but unfortunately he refused to shave off this bit of land—even though the LNP government owed this community big time because when they were last in government they closed down the Acacia Ridge High School, moved the students to the old Salisbury State High School and turned it into a new school, Nyanda State High School. Now that they are back in government, they have closed down this high school, at a time when we should be investing in education and when the suburb's numbers are growing. There is a boom in the number of young people coming through local state schools, yet they closed down that high school. 


So, on the one hand, the Abbott government claims to be addressing the issue of youth unemployment through the Green Army Program; on the other hand, it is removing funding for the Youth Connections program, designed to stop young people who have not completed year 12 from falling between the cracks by working with them and their challenges to help them onto the path to work or education. Last year almost 75,000 young people were given the help they needed through Youth Connections, and by the end of this year it is expected to reach 100,000.


There is overwhelming evidence to show how critical the transition from school into work or study is to reducing the lifetime risk of unemployment and boosting lifetime earnings. We know how important it is to be learning or earning. BoysTown and the Smith Family, which have serviced youth in my electorate, will lose their funding under the LNP government, and so these vital services that look after the youth of Moreton will be lost.


Labor seeks a guarantee from the government that all participants in this Green Army Program who are on income support payments will be better off, regardless of their life situation. We need to ensure that participants are not worse off through any changes in income tax, childcare payments or the potential loss of low-income healthcare cards or associated concessions. I also have serious reservations about preserving existing jobs in areas that overlap with activities to be undertaken by the Green Army. The Green Army simply cannot be an excuse for putting Australians out of work in favour of using low-paid participants. The government needs to stop deceiving the Australian public that this is an environmental program. The coalition's track record on environmental policy, as seen in their disastrous Direct Action policy—a policy which they are embarrassed by and about which no environmentalist or economist can find anything good to say—is shameful, and I urge this government to stop ignoring the signs and start looking at effective climate policy and improved environmental preservation.

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2014-05-13,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry) (16:58):  I rise today to pledge my support for the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. The reason for this is very simple: it was a proven winner on a number of fronts when it was introduced as the Howard government's successful Green Corps program. The coalition government is delivering a key election commitment to establish the Green Army, starting from July this year. The Green Army will build on the former Green Corps program that was established in 1996 to employ young people on environmental projects to preserve and restore our natural and cultural environment.


The Green Army will offer young Australians aged from 17 to 24 the opportunity to support local environment and heritage conservation projects while gaining hands-on practical skills and work experience in conservation management. The experience and training received will count towards a qualification in land management, park management, landscaping or horticulture. The Green Army will make a real difference to the environment and to local communities through projects such as restoring and protecting habitat, weeding, planting, cleaning up creeks and rivers, and restoring cultural heritage places. 


This voluntary initiative is both an environmental and a training program. It will help young people increase their skills base, gain practical experience and enhance their job readiness. It also complements the government's Direct Action Plan on climate change. The Direct Action Plan gives the community the ability to address our environmental challenges and to reduce our emissions at the lowest possible cost. 


I support this bill because it provides a common-sense pathway of exposure to those still to decide whether they want to pursue further education in environmental disciplines. I am especially looking forward to rolling out this initiative in my electorate, as the community there has a high unemployment rate, particularly amongst our youth. I support this bill because it seeks to help the long-term unemployed to find and keep a job. In my electorate, we have an issue with youth unemployment and this bill focuses on that as an area of concern. 


At the start of this year, the Newcastle Herald published a study by the Centre of Full Employment and Equity, a think tank backed by the University of Newcastle. It named 14 Hunter suburbs as 'red alert'—high-risk localities for predicted unemployment rise. One of the report's co-authors, Professor Scott Baum from Griffith University, said parts of the Hunter—including Raymond Terrace, which is in my electorate—had been identified because of a low proportion of skilled workers, high rates of casual labour, low education levels among residents and a high concentration of workers in declining industries. He also said that it would hit particularly hard in areas where there is already high unemployment and a high concentration of employment in industries like mining, retail and manufacturing—the types of jobs they predicted to be more at risk or in decline. 


It is true that currently my electorate is experiencing a high rate of youth unemployment. While estimates of the exact figure for youth unemployment in my electorate vary widely, the Brotherhood of St Laurence recently launched a campaign to bring attention to the crisis of youth unemployment in Australia. According to their 'My chance, our future' youth employment campaign, the figure has risen across the country and sits at around 12.2 per cent nationally. That is up from 8.8 per cent in 2008. They include my electorate in the Hunter statistics. They estimate that the unemployment rate among 15- to 24-year-olds sits at around 9.5 per cent. The ABS statistics claim that it sits at 7.1 per cent. Any way you look at it, it is not a figure to be celebrated. 


We need to get these young people out of a life of welfare dependency and into the workforce. As I told the Newcastle Herald recently, there is no silver bullet to fix soaring teen unemployment rates in the Hunter. Over the past two to three years, there has been a general downturn in business confidence and people have not yet seen the light at the end of the tunnel. After six years of bad management and spiralling debts, the government have a massive workload ahead of us. We have to get the economy back on track and get people into jobs and out of unemployment queues. 


The Hunter is like most regional areas. When business is doing it tough, jobs become scarcer and apprenticeships dry up—and are treated as alternative cheap labour, which in turn affects our national skill base. That is why we are working hard to deliver new policies that encourage job growth and private investment. One of those policies of course is to kill off the carbon tax. Let us be frank about it: the carbon tax killed jobs, not just in my electorate but right across Australia. Businesses in the Hunter have told me that the carbon tax was an added pressure to their operations they could ill afford. It resulted in job losses. 


This year, we have seen many industrial companies in my electorate reconfigure their employment structures. In the past fortnight we have seen OneSteel announce plans to shed 100 jobs, Downer EDI announce plans to cut 200 jobs and Chain Valley Colliery confirm plans to cut 73 jobs. Falling commodity prices, lower business confidence and job cuts in mining and car manufacturing have a flow-on effect on youths searching for apprenticeships or indeed full-time jobs. The coalition have introduced legislation to repeal the costly carbon tax and the monstrous mining tax. We know from speaking to our constituents that this will boost business confidence. We will keep working towards cutting red tape for small business to assist the economy to grow. 


The Newcastle Herald also reported on a future constituent of mine—when I say 'future constituent', I mean that she has not yet reached voting age—Tabatha Tyne. The 17-year-old Ms Tyne has spent a lot of the last four months on the hunt for a part-time job. A former vice-captain of Raymond Terrace High School, she graduated last year and is a member of the volunteer youth reference group that provides early intervention mental health services to people aged 12 to 25. During her final years at school, Ms Tyne completed a TAFE course in community services and is now studying full-time for a certificate IV in youth work at TAFE. She plans to undertake a further diploma so she can be a youth worker. Ms Tyne travels from her Raymond Terrace home into Newcastle two days a week for her studies. She has been looking for a job in retail since finishing school. She is clearly a determined young woman, a hard worker, motivated and goal driven. However, she also falls into the youth unemployment category. For now she relies on a fortnightly youth allowance payment. She believes this is due to a lack of job experience. 


Job experience is what the Green Army Program will offer the young and unemployed. I believe we can, through programs like this, arm young Australians with the skills to get and keep jobs. It will not only actively improve hundreds of sites across the country but allow local young people to get training and learn to work as part of a team. I am hoping that joining the Green Army will become a rite of passage for hundreds of young people in the years ahead. Joining the Green Army will teach many young people about teamwork and local ownership—and about the value of belonging to something greater than themselves. 


In the lead-up to the election last year, we had already earmarked a project in the Paterson electorate at Lemon Tree Passage. Nine young people will receive training in environmental rehabilitation at the Tilligerry Peninsula as part of the 170,000 Green Army project. This project consists of the rehabilitation of up to five kilometres of foreshore pathways, boardwalks and walking paths. The work will consist of pathway upgrades, bush regeneration works and the renewal of the seven walking bridges in the area. The benefits of the scheme extend to the community. The existing pathways are extremely popular but are degrading to a point where they are no longer meeting safety requirements. Now the residents will be able to enjoy walking the area as a leisurely Sunday stroll rather than as an intense work-out. This project will also help reduce the burden on the Port Stephens council in fixing and upgrading council infrastructure. 


Tilligerry Peninsula has a large population of an endangered species: it is recognised as valuable koala habitat. The bush regeneration will assist in providing safer areas for the koalas to live in and allow better access for visitors to view the koalas. The workers on this project will receive training and experience in pathway construction, carpentry, landscaping and bush regeneration as well as occupational health and safety and first aid training. The participants will also receive a $400-a-week training wage and a TAFE accredited training wage upon completion of the program. 


I want to see this program grow and thrive like its previous version, the Green Corps program. Over the life of the Howard government's Green Corps program, its participants produced incredible results and the benefits are still evident today. The participants planted more than 14 million trees, erected more than 8,000 kilometres of fencing, cleared more than 50,000 hectares of weeds and constructed more than 5,000 kilometres of walking track or boardwalks. In my electorate, a Green Corps team removed over a tonne of rubbish from an almost two-kilometre long walkway at the Grahamstown canal. They also reduced the amount of lantana beside the walkway and planted thousands of trees and native grasses. 


There are four other sites in my electorate which received Green Corps grants under the Howard government. An example from the second round of the grant scheme was the Hunter Regional Organisation of Councils. This Green Corps project focused on revegetating the roadside corridors adjacent to the New England Highway in towns like Branxton, Lochinvar, Greta and Rutherford. The main focus of the project was to create corridors of green along major road reserves, restoration of native vegetation and habitats and the reversal of land degradation. The third round included a project for the historic Tocal Homestead on the CB Alexander Agricultural College at Paterson. This project involved the regeneration of riverine rainforest and wetlands, construction of post and rail fences and building conservation. In round 6, this college received another project grant when the Green Corps were called in to regenerate more of the riverine rainforest and wetland ecosystems at Tocal in the lower Paterson Valley. Tocal holds a large land mass and its campus spans broadacre land. 


Finally, in round 9, the Green Corps were called by the Tilligerry Habitat Association to the restio wetland area. This project was designed to prepare wetlands for public visitation. As such, this job required boardwalk and path construction, mulching, pruning, planting and water management. These projects all led to the participants gaining skills that they would not have attained had they just been claiming the dole. 


These projects also led to one of my constituents winning Paterson Corporate Citizen of the Year in 2006. Shane Bailey was a team leader in Green Corps projects. He won the award on the basis of his work mentoring young people. Mr Bailey worked with the Green Corps teams who were undertaking six-month projects in the Port Stephens area. He was an inspiration to these young people by providing career advice and also by acting as a referee for the youths when they had gained the experience and skills and were applying for jobs. To him it was more than a job; it was about the people. So I awarded him the honour due to his enthusiasm for training others in the environmental industry and for his ability to relate to his team members. He is a shining example of what can be achieved through the Green Corps program and, in turn, the revamped Green Army. 


When the former, Labor government took office, this important initiative was torn apart and then it was terminated in 2012. Young people no longer had the opportunity to gain practical skills and improve their local environment. The government is strongly committed to kick-starting the economy and offering the community the ability to address our environmental challenges and to reduce our emissions. I call on the Labor Party and all members of the parliament to support the Social Security Legislation (Green Army Programme) Amendment Bill 2014 for the benefit that it will provide to our environment, for the benefit it will provide to our young people and for the positive effect it will have on our community as a whole. I commend this bill to the House without any reservation.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2014-05-13,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (17:12):  The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014 is a poor excuse for an environment policy. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Social Security Act and the Social Security (Administration) Act to clarify social security arrangements for participants receiving the Green Army allowance paid under the Green Army Program. 



It is my understanding that the coalition's Green Army Program aims to recruit young people to perform environmental tasks across the country and to pay them a training wage to perform environmental tasks that are currently being performed by other employees and businesses throughout the country. There are two arms to the coalition's environment policy, Direct Action. The focus of Direct Action is to pay big-polluting companies a government subsidy in the hope and wish that they shall reduce their carbon emissions over time. It is a complete reversal, the complete antithesis, of the Liberal and conservative philosophy of government subsidies to business to pay big polluters in the hope that they will reduce their emissions over time. 


The program that we currently have in place, the carbon price, is one whereby the big polluters pay for the right to pollute in our economy. The money and revenue that is generated from those big polluters paying for the right to pump carbon into our environment is used to commercialise renewable energy. Half of the revenue that is raised from the carbon price is used to promote renewable energy in Australia and throughout our economy. The other half is provided to people on low incomes and pensioners to ensure that they can meet cost-of-living increases as a result of electricity price increases. That is the system we have at the moment. The polluter pays system is going to be replaced by a system where the government pays the polluter, and the coalition calls that progress! That is the first arm of this government's environmental policy, and what a backward step that is.


The second arm of their environmental policy is the one that we are debating here in the chamber tonight, the Green Army Program. This is a program that will see Australians being paid a training wage to perform environmental tasks throughout the country, replacing those who are already performing those tasks—the bush regeneration companies, the landscapers and the local government authorities—who are being paid a normal wage and are getting the protection of occupational health and safety and workers' compensation provisions throughout the country. They are getting paid an award wage for the work they perform. But the government are going to replace those employees and those businesses that are doing that work at the moment with a group of Australians on a training wage. The government are seeking to deceive the Australian public into believing that this is an environmental program. The reason for that is simple—they do not have a coherent environmental policy. In fact, many on that side do not believe earnestly in climate change and our nation taking action on this important issue.


The program we are debating here today is an employment program and as such the participants should be treated as employees. Labor believes that environment based work and training programs can be an effective pathway to work for many job seekers as well as providing environmental benefits. Workplace training programs have potential, if well designed and implemented, to achieve these twin goals; however, there are a number of questions that remain unanswered with respect to the Green Army Program. The bill does not, as is expected by the people whom I represent in Kingsford Smith, lay out the detail required for analysis or discussion. It is also clear that it is a pseudoenvironment policy from a government that could not care less about serious policies to tackle climate change.


In contrast, when Labor were in government we developed policies aimed at conserving Australia's pristine environment. One policy was Caring for our Country. Caring for our Country aimed to achieve an environment that was healthier, better protected, well managed and resilient and that provided essential ecosystem services in a changing climate. Under the first phase of Caring for our Country, from 2008 to 2013, the Labor government invested more than $2 billion to protect and rebuild the resilience of our environment. The second phase of the program was designed to support land managers; community groups, including Indigenous groups; industry; and local environment groups. Caring for our Country target area grants provided funding of between $50,000 and $2 million for projects to maintain ecosystem services, protect our conservation estate and enhance the capacity of Indigenous communities to conserve and protect natural resources across six target areas. The target area grants focused investment in critical areas of our environment, which were selected in recognition of their high levels of vulnerability and importance. Through the target area grants and the second round of the Biodiversity Fund Labor invested in landscape scale restoration of our environment, including some of our most valuable ecosystems.


In addition to Caring for our Country, Labor became the first government to seriously deal with the central challenge of restoring the Murray-Darling Basin to health after chronic neglect by the coalition. After decades of overallocation and disagreement on how to manage the river, Labor began to restore the balance in the system and bring the river back to health. Under the plan 2,750 gigalitres of surface water will be recovered for the environment and used to benefit wetlands, forests and river flows, including the Ramsar listed wetlands in South Australia. Importantly, the plan was designed to achieve the government's target of having the Murray-Darling river mouth open nine years out of 10.


Labor agrees that we need to do everything we can to get people into work. Labor in government had a record of creating jobs in our economy. Close to one million jobs were created over the six years of the last Labor government. We believe that every individual who can work should be given that chance. We know this can only happen with appropriate support. Labor put in place a number of important employment programs—such as Youth Connections, which I understand is facing the axe in tonight's budget—for people in our community living with disabilities, the young, elderly job seekers and the long-term unemployed to ensure that they have the necessary support to get back into the labour movement. Labor believes in helping people to get a job through the right training, work experience and incentives and, most importantly, with the appropriate level of support.


This bill as proposed by the government omits much of the detail related to workers' rights, benefits and protections. The statement of requirements is equally scant on some of the detail. The question that I pose on behalf of many businesses in Kingsford Smith is: what happens to those small businesses that currently work in this space—the bush regeneration businesses and local landscaping businesses that do local government work—businesses that are currently training staff, paying award wages, providing occupational health and safety and workers compensation support? They are providing training and apprenticeships for people to undertake and gain training in landscaping and environmental conservation. They will be forced out by a cheaper government scheme. Access to formally recognised training delivered by a registered training organisation under the Australian Qualifications Framework is noted in the SOR as an optional component of the program to be negotiated with each individual participant. This gives no confidence that participants will actually gain access to training.


Labor is concerned that the bill does not provide adequate protections for participants in the scheme, namely in the areas of OH&S, workers compensation and rehabilitation. We have been told that participants will be covered by relevant state legislation and insurance, while work safety will be audited by the department. Although this provides some protection, the price of safety will be constant vigilance.


Australians are right to be suspicious of the motives of this government when it comes to environmental and employment programs. The government has made it clear that protection of the environment is not one of its priorities through its Direct Action program. A further concern of Labor is the crowding-out aspect of this bill. The government must assure those hardworking Australians in local government and other authorities and those small businesses that work in this space that they will not be displaced and that their businesses will not be affected by the Green Army participants coming in and doing their work.


To conclude, I believe that the government needs to answer a number of questions before this bill is given passage through the House and the Senate. Those questions are as follows. Firstly, why are participants not considered workers or employees under the Work Health and Safety Act, the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Fair Work Act? Secondly, exactly what are the implications for participants not being considered workers or employees under these acts? Thirdly, how will the program support people into mainstream employment? That must be the focus of employment and training programs. It is not a quick-fix, quasi-environmental program. It is an employment program. How will people get into long-term employment through these pathways? That question has not been answered by the government in proposing this bill. Will there be minimum training outcomes? If so, what are they? And will there be minimum training hours required for those participating in the program? What protections will there be to ensure that no businesses currently providing and working in this space will lose business or that, indeed, no employees will lose their jobs as a result of the passage of this bill? They are the questions that constituents in Kingsford Smith, in our community, wish the government to answer before this bill is passed.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (17:25):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme Bill) 2014. I do so to support this bill wholeheartedly. Firstly, the practical measures of this bill amend the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999. They clarify the social security arrangements for participants that will be receiving the Green Army allowance. The Green Army is set to become Australia's largest ever environmental workforce. It will deliver work and jobs for 15,000 people, making it the largest standing environmental workforce in our history. It is a program that will provide real and practical solutions for clearing up our riverbeds and creeks, revegetating sand dunes and revegetating mangrove habitats, amongst the many other environmental remediation initiatives.


There are two bonuses for the community in this. Firstly, there are the environmental benefits that we will receive throughout Australia. Secondly, there are the training benefits for 15,000 young Australians who will receive the opportunity to have up to 20 weeks training in an environmental program. So, it is good news on both fronts.


I am very proud of the projects that have already been announced in my electorate, which are all based around the Georges River. The Georges River has a long history with Australia's settlement. It was first explored by Bass and Flinders back in 1795, when they took that famous little boat of theirs, the Tom Thumb, and sailed it all the way around from Port Phillip, around into Botany Bay and up the Georges River. They mapped the area all the way up to Georges Fair. That expedition opened up a lot of the land and farmland around Bankstown.


Another part of the Georges River that is very historically important is the weir at Liverpool. That was constructed in 1836. That was the dividing mark on the river, where on one side was the brackish saltwater and on the other was the freshwater. Everything upstream from the weir was all freshwater, which became the drinking supply for the township of Liverpool. Today, over one million people live in the catchment area of the Georges River. It is one of the most highly urbanised catchment areas in Australia. It has over 200 years of history behind it. It is an area that needs significant environmental remediation in many areas.


I am proud to say that we already have announced for my electorate six separate Green Army programs—one in Kelso Creek, one in Clinches Pond at Moorebank, one at Wattle Grove Lake, one at Yeramba Lagoon, another at Harris Creek in Holsworthy and one on the border of my electorate, under the Liverpool Bridge, at the famous Lighthorse Park. These programs will make a serious and significant improvement to the environment along the Georges River, for the thousands and thousands of people that use the river for recreation. In fact, I was down there late last week and a little fishing boat had pulled up. The guy who was fishing there had caught about a dozen blackfish. So the river is actually not in bad nick now, but a lot more could be done to improve the quality of the river and to bring it closer to what it was when Bass and Flinders first sailed down there in 1795.


While I am talking about the Georges River and the things on our environmental program, I would like to give my congratulations to the Chauvel Park Environmental Group. This is a group of citizens in the local community who are doing work similar to what the Green Army would do but on a volunteer basis. I have been down there and seen them working away on the weekend. They showed me the river banks, and there is that much work and clearing of vegetation to do that it is almost beyond explanation. When the member for Kingsford-Smith talks about how these programs will somehow crowd out what some other community members are doing, it is just absolute and complete nonsense. I would like to congratulate Robert Storey and Ian Bailey and all the other workers in that Chauvel Park Environmental Group for the great work that they do, and I am sure that that can be complementary to all the other things the green army project will be doing.


I have heard during this debate many members from the opposition making sad, sniping remarks complaining about this program and saying how truly wonderful their carbon tax program has been in taking action on climate change. This program provides a true example of the difference between the coalition and the opposition. What we are proposing here provides practical steps to improve the environmental areas of our country. In comparison, things like the carbon tax are purely symbolic and have absolutely no beneficial effect on the environment. This is the difference. The carbon tax actually does do a few things for the environment and that is exactly what I would like to get onto. What we see with Labor's carbon tax is a classic example of the law of leftist unintended consequences. That law simply states, for every leftist government law, hurriedly passed in response to a current or recent crisis, to give greater power to government or to provide for more centralised control over the economy, there will be two or more unintended consequences that will have greater negative effects than the problem it was designed to fix, often harming the very people the legislation is intended to assist. I would like to give an example of how the carbon tax does that and contrast that to the green army program. 


One thing the carbon tax does is push up the price of electricity. What is the average person's response to an increase in a price in one particular good or one particular way of producing things? They look for substitutes and alternatives. That is exactly what is happening in Sydney as we speak, today. People are finding that they cannot afford to turn on the heater to warm their house during winter. So what are people doing? They are going out to the bush or to their backyard, cutting down a tree and burning the wood. They are using wood fires as a substitute because of the high electricity prices. They are burning wood to keep themselves warm. What effect does that have? We know that when you burn wood you release into the atmosphere not only carbon dioxide but also particulate matter. In Sydney in winter, between 50 and 60 per cent of the particulate matter in the atmosphere comes about through people using wood fires in their homes to keep themselves warm. This action releases particulate matter, commonly known as PM10 or PM2.5. 


Why is there a concern about this particulate matter? I refer to a few recent reports. Firstly, the report of the World Health Organisation states: 


PM affects more people than any other pollutant. The major components of PM are sulfate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust and water. It consists of a complex mixture of solid and liquid particles in organic and inorganic substances suspended in the air. The most health-damaging particles are those with a diameter of 10 microns or less, which can penetrate and lodge deep inside the lungs. Chronic exposure to particles contributes to the risk of developing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as lung cancer.


A recent article written by Professor Bin Jalaludin notes:


… the world's leading experts on cancer, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified outdoor air pollution as a carcinogenic to humans. The agency's report, Air Pollution and Cancer, said there's now sufficient evidence that components of outdoor air pollution can cause cancer.


He notes that air pollution is:


… one environmental hazard that everyone is exposed to; we all have to breath the air around us.


Even unborn children are exposed to the potential harm of air pollution, a complex mixture of particles that can be solids or aerosols, and gases.


It was only a few years ago that the New South Wales Chief Health Officer, Denise Robinson, told a public inquiry at New South Wales Parliament House that the deaths of between 600 and 1,400 Sydneysiders every year could be attributed at least partly to air pollution. I will repeat that: between 600 and 1,400 deaths are attributed to air pollution in Western Sydney. The World Health Organisation rightly sets maximum recommend pollution levels. Although they say that there is no safe level, there is no threshold that they have identified at which no damage to health is possible, they do note that guidelines for the particulate matter PM10 is 20 microns per cubic metre as an annual mean. What has happened in Western Sydney since the carbon tax has been introduced? It has turned more people over to burning wood, releasing more particulate matter. We have the measurements of the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage from their monitoring station in Liverpool. Since the carbon tax was introduced in 2010, every single year the particulate pollution in Western Sydney has increased. Last year the particulate pollution in Western Sydney was above World Health Organisation standards for PM10.


For PM10, pollution has increased 25 per cent since the carbon tax was introduced. These levels of air pollution are caused by wood heating, which people converted to to try to keep their home warm in the winter, because of the imposition of the carbon tax. In Western Sydney we now have pollution levels above those the World Health Organisation recommends. The situation is just as bad for the more dangerous particulate, PM2.5. Since the carbon tax has been introduced, it has pushed up the prices of electricity and people have converted to heating their homes with wood. PM2.5 pollution, the most deadly of all the particulate pollutions, has actually increased by 50 per cent since 2010. 


These are the unintended consequences of bad policy and symbolic policy which is actually harming the environment and harming the air quality of people in Western Sydney today. That is what we are dealing with here in this parliament. It is not only a matter of the cost burden on the community. Policies like the carbon tax are actually harming the environment and they are harming the health of millions of citizens that live in Western Sydney today. This is what we get from the opposition.


We need to think through the unintended consequences of this bad policy. That is why I am so glad that we on this side of the House are taking practical steps to improve the environment in Western Sydney. We are taking practical steps with our Green Army Program to improve the quality and the health of the Georges River for the benefit of all Sydneysiders. That is what a good government does: take practical steps rather than simply symbolic steps that have these unintended consequences which today are harming the health of residents of Western Sydney, not only in my electorate but throughout the entire Western and South-West Sydney basin.


So I commend this bill to the House. Again, it shows the difference between the coalition and the opposition. We are here taking practical, real steps that will improve the environment in Western Sydney, while the opposition are intent on implementing these symbolic measures that not only have no effect but do the opposite—cause harm to people's health.

"Conroy, Pat, MP",ALP,2014-05-13,"



Mr CONROY
 (Charlton) (17:40):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. Labor supports training that helps people gain work experience and increase their opportunities to get a job. We agree that there is value in engaging unemployed people and empowering them with skills that they need to get a foot in the door with an employer. We also see merit in targeting environmental, conservation and heritage projects to deliver these practical work experience programs and teach people new skills. That is why Labor has a record of support for programs that share the core aims of the Green Army Program. Indeed, it was the Keating government that established the Landcare and Environment Action Program in 1992, which saw young people between the ages of 15 and 20 years broaden their practical know-how and which equipped them with new skills through various landcare activities.


However, this current incarnation, the Green Army program, contains a number of concerning aspects which deserve proper scrutiny. While this bill goes only to the social security elements of the Green Army, there are much broader issues to be debated, some of which have been the subject of an inquiry in the other place. More predictably, this bill serves to continue the tradition of this Liberal government of engaging in acts of empty symbolism. The government say they want to build a green workforce, but participants are not guaranteed they will be better off than if they were receiving income support payments. They say that this program is about skills and training, but, beyond basic workplace induction, there is no guarantee of further qualifications. They say they want to tackle climate change, but they have shown they are determined to take this country backward in its approach to protecting the environment and reducing dangerous carbon emissions.


In the electorate I represent, there are around 4,000 people receiving income support payments to look for work. In the Hunter region more broadly there are over 25,000 people receiving these payments. Of these, it is young people between the ages of 17 and 24 who will potentially be affected by this legislation. Some of these people may have only just left school, and almost certainly there will be a significant number who have little or no experience in a formal workplace. It is imperative, therefore, that the safety of these young people is guaranteed. Indeed, given that the program will engage volunteers in physical, outdoor tasks—such as landscaping, construction of boardwalks and walking tracks, and the cleaning of waterways and creek banks—ensuring the safety of participants is arguably the most important part of this policy.


The government has said that participants will be covered by relevant state legislation and insurance held by service providers and the Commonwealth. Work safety will also be subject to auditing by the department. Despite this, Labor remains concerned that this bill does not provide adequate protections for participants in the scheme. This is especially concerning for people in New South Wales, where the workers compensation and rehabilitation system has been severely eroded under the state coalition government.


The government predicts that the program will expand rapidly, up from 250 projects and 2,500 participants in the first year to 1,500 projects and 15,000 participants by 2018-19. This paints a scenario where a large number of people are moved out of the social security sector and into the skills and training sector. The change, as reflected in this bill, sees a participant shift from income support payments to a training allowance and provides an exemption from job search requirements throughout the course of the program.


We know that participants will receive first aid and work safety training. Where appropriate, cultural awareness training will also be provided. Beyond this, however, there is no explicit obligation on service providers to provide training. This represents a significant flaw in the program. For starters, we know that some participants may require work-readiness training, including literacy and numeracy if appropriate. Will they receive this training? Furthermore, it is important that young people in the Green Army are rewarded for their time and effort. The program must provide those who go through its ranks with relevant training that is formally recognised, and participants should rightly expect to come out of the program with marketable skills that are in demand by employers.


The equivalent program in the last Labor government, the National Green Jobs Corps, required organisations to provide participants with at least 130 hours of accredited training. That is around five hours per week of accredited training for participants over the six months. We strongly believe that accredited training should be a core element of this program—and it must be accredited training, not some sort of voluntary sham.


While they are a part of the Green Army, participants receive more pay than they would receive on the ordinary income support payment, albeit less than the minimum wage. Nonetheless, the government must guarantee that all participants on income support payments will be better off, regardless of their life situation. Income tax increases, reduction in childcare payments and the potential loss of low-income healthcare cards are important for families trying to make ends meet. We must ensure that this program does not have a negative impact on these concessions and that it will not mean these participants are worse off.


In predicting such a high participation rate, the government must also ensure that the Green Army does not come at the expense of other workers—for example, those in the local government sector. This program is supposed to be about empowering job seekers. It is not, should not and cannot be a vehicle to replace jobs that are already being done for a decent wage and with reasonable conditions, and substitute them with a literal army of low-paid workers. Given the agenda of this government, we are right to be sceptical of its motives. This is a government that does nothing when it comes to people losing their jobs or having their pay cut. Let us not forget that under this government more than 60,000 Australians have lost their job. Under this government the foundations have been laid for a full-blown attack on the penalty rates of the hundreds of thousands of casual, part-time shift workers. This is not a government that cares about jobs or about workers.


In contrast, the Labor Party will always be the party that fights for the rights and conditions of workers. The Labor movement has always fought for decent workplace standards, and safety at work is a fundamental part of this. We on this side ask Mr Abbott: how will you guarantee the safety of young people working for the Green Army? So far, the answer is that it is not their problem; it is not their concern. These young people must look to the state and territory governments for reassurance that they will be taken care of if they are injured at work. In my electorate this will sound a dark and ominous warning, because the workers of New South Wales, particularly those in my electorate, are currently suffering under a state coalition government that has completely dismantled the workers compensation system. Thanks to the New South Wales Liberals, a worker who is injured on the way to work now has no claim to compensation. Injured workers who already receive payments have had their access to the scheme drastically reduced, even if their injury is for life. We have even had suggestions that if you lose a limb—if you have an amputation as a result of a workplace injury—it is not an injury serious enough to demand compensation. All of this has been done with the support of the Prime Minister and the coalition here in Canberra, who at the same time have launched their own brutal attack on the livelihoods of working people.


Close to my home in Newcastle, the Liberals have abandoned funding for the community based Hunterlink Recovery Services, a venture that sees unions and employers working together to support young men and women in the Newcastle and Lake Macquarie areas who are experiencing addiction and mental health issues. As we know, these issues often manifest themselves as problems at work. Labor supported this program; the coalition does not. This is just one example of the coalition's approach to workers' health and safety.


We are also right to expose the empty environmental symbolism contained in this program. Those opposite say that this is all about improving the environment, but this government has no credibility when it comes to supporting Australia's environment. This government's failure on the environment has already attracted international notoriety for some of the most draconian attacks we have seen. Some of these attacks include undoing the management plans for the world's largest marine reserve system; turning back decades of bipartisan support for the Commonwealth's role in protecting matters of national environmental significance; and attempting to delist world heritage areas, making us one of only three nations attempting to delist a World Heritage area, in which we share the esteemed company of Oman and Tanzania. They have also destroyed the Tasmanian forestry agreement which has been worked on for so long by environmental groups, the forestry industry and workers.


However, the two most glaring attacks on the environment, committed by this government, have been its constant undermining of the renewable energy target and their attempts to stop Australia combating climate change. On the RET, they have commissioned a review conducted by climate change sceptics, particularly Dick Warburton. We have seen incredibly stupid remarks by the Treasurer about how he finds offensive the wind turbines he sees when he drives down to Canberra. We have seen them talk about undermining the RET, reducing it and possibly even abolishing it. Certainly, we have seen some very worrying remarks. If they do this we will see $18 billion of current investment in the renewable energy sector stranded. We will also see the jeopardising of another $18 billion in clean energy investment if the MRET policy is lost. This would directly affect the employment of 24,000 people who are employed in the renewable energy industry and would represent a breach by those opposite of a pre-election promise to maintain the renewable energy target. We saw very strong direct commitments by the Minister for the Environment when he was the opposition spokesperson. Any attempt to water down the renewable energy target would be another broken promise by a government that is specialising in broken promises.


On climate change, those on the opposite side are a fraud. They are made up of two different groups: a group that does not accept climate change and a group that, for pure political pragmatism, refuses to take action. We even heard the previous speaker suggest that taking action to combat climate change causes cancer. These people will grasp at any straw to oppose action on climate change. This is despite the fact that the science is well and truly in. Over 97 per cent of published scientific reports by climate change experts conclude that climate change is happening and manmade climate action is the direct driver. Scientists now say that climate change is occurring with a certainty of 95 per cent. To put that in context, that is the same certainty with which they say tobacco causes cancer. Those on the other side reject it, and when they pay lip service to combatting climate change, they have their ridiculous joke of a policy, Direct Action. It is a policy of centralised government control, a policy so woefully inefficient that the Grattan Institute has concluded it will cost over $100 billion to get to the Commonwealth's minimum target of a five per cent reduction in greenhouse emissions, even though a larger target is quite possible. So we see them paying lip service with a program that will cost over $100 billion and that will cost Australian households $1,300 per year. At the same time we see attempts to scrap the rational, efficient way of combating climate change, which the last government put in place: the 20 per cent renewable energy target, which I have already spoken about; the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which is filling a vital gap in the finance of new large power stations; and, if the reports are to be believed, the abolition of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, a vital agency supporting R&D innovation in renewable energy—another broken promise and another breach of their trust with the electorate. Ultimately, there is the abolition of the fixed price emissions trading scheme that we have now, the carbon price, and the refusal to engage in shifting it to flexible price emissions trading scheme.


We heard the last speaker say that the carbon price is not working. The facts are in; it is working. Since the carbon price began we have seen a 7.6 per cent fall in emissions from the electricity sector alone. That represents a 15-million-tonne reduction in carbon pollution emissions. That is equivalent to taking almost four million cars off the road. Emissions are relatively flat for the broader economy, but the growth in emissions has been in sectors not covered by the carbon price. The carbon price is working. It will be more efficient and effective when we shift to a flexible price emissions trading scheme linked to the rest of the world. But anyone who says it is not working and not reducing emissions is either trying to fool people or lying.


We have to combat climate change. We have to take care of our environment. We heard a lot today in question time about intergenerational equity. One of the most important obligations of this generation of the decision makers in this House is to leave the environment, the planet and Australia in a better position for our children and our grandchildren. I have an 11-month-old daughter and I want her coming of age in an environment that is better than now, where I can look her in the eye and say, 'This parliament, this government, this country took action on climate change as part of an international effort to reduce dangerous carbon emissions.'


To get back to this legislation, the Green Army Program is something the opposition will not oppose. We have serious questions marks about its implementation. I know our spokesperson is in meetings with the minister about it, and hopefully we can resolve the issues. Supporting on-the-ground conservation is important, but it cannot be done by sacrificing the safety of the workers involved, by putting out of work people who are already undertaking this work, or by paying them less than income support payments. We support this program, with appropriate safeguards. It builds on long-term programs run by the Keating, Howard, Rudd and Gillard governments. I think we just need to improve the implementation of it and we need to look at moving environmental action beyond empty symbolism to combatting climate change to ensure that our environment is in good hands.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2014-05-13,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (17:55):  I rise to support the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Green Army Programme) Bill 2014. The bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to clarify participation arrangements for the participants receiving the Green Army allowance paid under the Green Army Program. This is an exciting piece of legislation for the people in my electorate of Swan. It marks the start of a delivery of real environmental action on the ground in my electorate after six years of no action under the Rudd-Gillard Labor experiment.


This legislation, as much as any other, encapsulates the difference between the coalition and the Labor Party in general. Pretty much the Labor Party's only approach to the environment over the last few years has been a tax, the carbon tax—a plan that involves redistributing money, buying permits offshore and the expenditure of taxpayers money on a massive bureaucratic system of paper shuffling and redistributed money-go-rounds, all to produce no result. Despite the $7.6 billion tax, emissions for the first 12 months barely changed—it was by 0.01 per cent. It is a grand internationally focused macro scheme that does not recognise local environmental issues on the ground or trust that local people have the knowledge to improve our environment. Consequently the environment in my electorate of Swan received zero benefit from the previous government's policies. In fact, the Perth NRM received a funding cut of nearly half its budget under the Howard government. That funding cut was $2 million. This was cut from the Perth NRM funding under the previous Labor government.


The coalition's approach is different and it has always been different. It is an approach for real action on the ground to tackle environmental issues and improve our environment through practical measures. Take for example the Howard government's Green Corps program, which achieved results on the ground. The program propagated and planted more than 14 million trees; erected more than 8,000 kilometres of fencing; and constructed or maintained more than 5,000 kilometres of walking tracks and boardwalks. Under Labor's watch this important initiative was torn apart, rebadged and failed to improve the environment.


The previous speaker, the member for Charlton, spoke about ensuring the safety of the participants in the scheme. I know the member for Charlton was not here at the time under the Rudd-Gillard Labor government, but I see him stand there and talk about ensuring the safety of the participants in this scheme, yet we now have a royal commission looking into the pink batts scheme, where four people died and over 200 houses were burnt down and numerous people had problems with the scheme, which endangered the lives of many people. He stands up there and says he is worried about ensuring the safety of the participants in this scheme, but where was the Labor Party in ensuring the safety of those who died in the pink batts scheme. It is hypocrisy to the maximum by the Labor Party yet again.


The former Labor government transformed the previous program into a program where young long-term unemployed Australians were reclassified and continued to receive an income support payment, but with very little done to actually help the environment. The program failed to engage local communities to ensure that projects met local environmental needs, to motivate the long-term unemployed, to encourage the participation of young people who are passionate about the environment or deliver a program that engaged the participants for the duration of the project. I know that one of the first things I did as a candidate was to go to a site being run by the Green Corps under the Howard government and see a fantastic program employing young Indigenous people in the electorate of Swan. As I said before, I know we are limited for time, and I seek your indulgence to continue my speech at the next opening of parliament.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (20:02):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2014-2015, along with Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015,which was introduced earlier, and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015 are the budget appropriation bills for the 2014-15 financial year.


This bill seeks approval for appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of just over $8.4 billion. 


I now outline the significant items provided for in this bill. 


First, the Department of Communications would receive just over $3.2 billion once this bill commences as an act. This is required to provide funding to NBN Co to continue to roll out the National Broadband Network. This is in line with the government's updated Statement of Expectations. 


Second, this bill would provide the Department of Defence with just under $2.5 billion in capital funding. This reflects in part the budget measure Defence funding profile,which bringsforward funding from 2017-18 and distributes it over the period 2013-14 to 2016‑17, including $300 million in this bill. This funding will support important capabilities, including in the Approved Major Capital Investment Programme. The remaining $2.2 billion included in this bill provides funding for existing investment commitments.


Third, the bill would provide the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development just over $564 million, reflecting four matters. Those are: to incorporate the government's new Bridges Renewal Programme; the Roads to Recovery programme; funding local councils for non-network road projects; and funding for Latrobe Valley economic diversification.


Fourth, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would be provided with just under $294 million. This reflects a $200 million capital injection to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation as well as $10.3 million in capital expenditure for Australian embassies in Kabul and Baghdad.


The bill would also increase the general drawing rights limit for general purpose financial assistance payments to $5 billion and the general drawing rights limit for national partnership payments to $25 billion. These limits are being increased in prudent anticipation of forward expenditure in priority policy areas such as infrastructure, and will give the Commonwealth capacity to respond to changing circumstances.


Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedules to the bill and the portfolio budget statements tabled in the parliament.


Debate adjourned.

Dr Leigh


asked the Minister for Social Services, in writing, on 11 February 2014:


(1) Is he aware that it was the Productivity Commission's recommendation to establish an Australian Charities and Not-for Profits Commission (ACNC) to regulate the charity sector and support its effectiveness.


(2) Why does the Government plan to abolish the ACNC.


(3) Has the Government (a) sought, or (b) received, advice on the impact of removing the ACNC on the productivity of charitable organisations; if so, can he disclose the advice.


(4) Would the Government consider providing assistance to the charity sector in order to offset the loss of productivity that will result from the abolition of the ACNC; if not, why not.

"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2014-05-13,"



Mr Andrews:
  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 




(1) The 2010 Productivity Commission
'
s research report 
Contribution of the Not-for-Profit Sector
 did not recommend the establishment of the ACNC to regulate the charity sector and support its effectiveness.





Instead,


Recommendation 6.5 of the report states:




The Australian Government should establish a one-stop-shop for Commonwealth regulation by consolidating various regulatory functions into a new national Registrar for Community and Charitable Purpose Organisations.


While ultimately the Registrar could be an independent statutory body, initially it should be established as a statutory body corporate or organ in the Australian Securities and Investment Commission.





(2) The role of charities and not-for-profit (NFP) organisations in our society is important and the Australian Government believes that supporting the sector
'
s ability to self-manage allows organisations to focus more on their work in the community.





The Government is implementing a broad deregulation agenda to boost productivity by removing any excessive, unnecessary and overly complex red and green tape imposed on business, community organisations and individuals by at least $1 billion a year.





As part of this, the Government has committed to remove the ACNC and provide further support to charities and the NFP sector through a new National Centre for Excellence (NCE).


The NCE will foster innovation, provide education and represent the interest of charities 
and NFP agencies to government.





(3) (a) and (b) I have, and will continue to seek advice on the impact of removing the ACNC.


The outcome of this advice is a decision for Government.





(4) The department is working across government to ensure transition arrangements with the abolition of the ACNC run smoothly.


I


will continue to seek advice on the impact of removing the ACNC and the outcomes of this advice is a decision for Government.
