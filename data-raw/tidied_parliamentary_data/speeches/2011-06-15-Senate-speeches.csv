Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (09:32):  I rise to make some re­marks regarding the Higher Education Support Amendment (No. 1) Bill 2011. As people would be aware, FEE-HELP is available to eligible full fee paying higher education students and VET FEE-HELP is available to eligible full fee paying and certain state government subsidised VET students studying in higher level education or training, and provides a loan for all or part of a student's tuition costs. I think we all know in this chamber how important it is that we do continue to support our students in disadvantaged areas where they need that assistance and particularly in regional areas.


VET FEE-HELP was introduced under the former Howard government in 2007 recognising there was a need to encourage students to take up higher level skill qualifications by reducing the financial barriers associated with study. I am sure that colleagues would agree that over time the recognition of the VET sector has indeed increased and does play a very significant role in educating our young people today.


The bill will introduce a number of streamlining measures to the Higher Education Support Act 2003. This will streamline the process for the providers, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the program. There has been some concern in the sector that the difficulty in being able to access the program has acted as a disincentive. As I understand it there have only been a relatively small number of providers that have been part of this program and this piece of legislation aims to improve that accessibility. The coalition supports the bill, its effect being to improve the process and allow for a significant increase in quality education providers who apply for and are approved as providers under the act to be able to offer that FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP assistance.


I also note in the legislation the addition of the new requirement that bodies corporate seeking approval as either a higher education provider or a VET provider are 'fit and proper' for that purpose, which provides the appropriate level of scrutiny. I note also that the minister must specify, by legislative instrument, the criteria which must be taken into account in deciding whether a person is a fit and proper person before the body is approved. I think there is, on both sides of this chamber, the recognition that there was some need for streamlining this legislation. The efficiency that we will see as a result of the introduction of this legislation will make the process more workable and will allow more of those providers to be able to access this program which in turn is going to benefit the students. The priority for the coalition is to ensure that students are able to access that help as and when they can, and this legis­lation will certainly improve the efficiency and streamline the process in order for that to happen.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-06-15,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:28):  It is a pleasure to speak on the Product Stewardship Bill 2011. This bill establishes a national framework to support voluntary co-regulatory and regulatory product stewardship and extended producer responsibility schemes to provide for the impacts of a product being responsibly managed both during and at the end of its life cycle. Through these measure it is hoped, including on this side of the chamber, that the environmental, health and safety impacts of products, particularly those impacts associated with the disposal of products, will be more effectively managed.


The commitment to establish this national framework, underpinned by the legislation before us today, was made by the govern­ment in its November 2009 National Waste Policy: Less Waste, More Resources statement. This National Waste Policy has been endorsed by all Australian governments at state and territory level, through both the Environmental Protection and Heritage Council at the time, in November 2009, and COAG in August 2010.


The coalition fully supports the principle of product stewardship being, as it is outlined in the National Waste Policy:


… the shared responsibility for reducing the environmental, health and safety footprint of manufactured goods and materials across the life cycle of a product.


The bill itself offers a subtly different definition from the National Waste Policy, namely that it is:


… an approach to reducing the environmental and other impacts of products by encouraging or requiring manufacturers, importers, distributors and other persons to take responsibility for those products. 


I know this has been a long work in progress and work that has involved certain sectors of industry along the way. I am well aware that some sectors of industry are particularly enthusiastic to see this legislation passed. I especially note the national TV and computer sectors, who have a proposed national TV and computer product steward­ship program that we would expect, from the advice that both industry and government gave us during the negotiation phase, to be one of the first out of the starting blocks. This program already has members representing 70 per cent of total imports of computer brands into Australia and 80 per cent of sales in Australia. The TV and computer scheme obviously is of particular importance as we move through the phases of the switch over from analog to digital signals and because of the increased volume of the already significant supply of electronic waste that those industries will generate.


Importantly, the coalition is particularly supportive of the bill providing for voluntary product stewardship schemes, as set out in part 2 of the bill. These sit alongside the requirements and opportunities for co-regulatory and mandatory product stewardship schemes outlined in the bill. Part 2 of the bill establishes a mechanism to encourage and recognise product steward­ship without the need to regulate and also to provide assurance to the community that any voluntary product stewardship scheme is operating to achieve its stated outcomes, and it authorises the use of product stewardship logos in connection with these arrangements.


The Global Product Stewardship Council, an independent, non-profit organisation dedicated to understanding and advancing the principles of product stewardship, says that in its experience, as reinforced by overseas participants in the International Product Stewardship Summit, Australia has had greater success with voluntary programs than many overseas jurisdictions have. It also says:


Stakeholders are more likely to collaborate on and effectively implement voluntary and/or regulatory approaches than where approaches are in unilaterally mandated.


And that:


Approaches requiring greater levels of regulation should be pursued only after market-based, voluntary and co-regulatory approaches have been clearly shown to be relatively ineffective in achieving desired outcomes.


These are principles that the coalition would support and would urge and expect the government to keep in mind during its application of the powers that this legislation provides for. We do expect that where industries are able to deliver effective voluntary schemes then that is exactly what all sides of politics in this country would like to see.


The peak body for Australia's lighting industry, Lighting Council Australia, have several months experience in administering their own voluntary product stewardship scheme. They say:


The industry ownership bestowed by a voluntary or co-regulatory approach should lead to better outcomes among industries prepared to assume such responsibility. To reduce costs on both industry and government, all efforts should be made to encourage voluntary rather than regulatory approaches. 


However, this bill does provide for all three—voluntary, co-regulatory and mandatory—schemes. There is a place for all three, particularly in terms of the capacity to bring in recalcitrant parts of industries to ensure that the bill has a universal effect. Under the bill, accreditation of voluntary schemes will be on a cost-recovery basis through a fee for service.


I will spend a moment addressing some of the concerns that have been highlighted during consideration of this legislation. A Senate inquiry was held, as is customary, and I thank those who participated in that inquiry: the witnesses; the committee staff, as always, for their detailed report; and my colleague Senator Fisher, who engaged particularly effectively in this inquiry to examine some of the issues and concerns that industry and other groups had. We heard a range of concerns, some of them relating to the consultation approach, some of them relating to the expected effectiveness of the scheme and some of them relating to the potential for industry to be roped in or surprised by its inclusion in the scheme.


In many ways, we heard extreme views—from those who feared that all industries may suddenly find themselves subject to a mandatory scheme, at one extreme, and those who believed that the legislation was ineffectual and would achieve absolutely nothing at the other extreme. Those two extremes perhaps suggest that there is a middle way, and the legislation maybe has found that middle way. Nonetheless there were specific concerns raised about a range of factors, in particular concerns about the criteria as well as industry concerns about an element of surprise that theoretically could exist for industries to be roped in under the scheme.


I am very pleased that we have been able to work through this legislation and issues such as the criteria. A range of amendments standing in the name of the government, the Greens and the opposition have been circulated in the chamber. These have been worked on in a collaborative manner. I thank Senator Ludlam and Senator Farrell for their work, as well as the officers of the department who have worked with Senator Farrell and all parties to ensure that we can come up with some sensible amendments that we hope go some way to appeasing some of the concerns. Importantly, the amendments that will be moved will provide for a new definition of the product stewardship criteria—a definition that is, I think, less open-ended than the definition provided for in the bill as it stands and that ensures that criteria, though I suspect still relatively easy to meet for industries that genuinely should be included in such a scheme, are at least a bit more of a hurdle to ensure that you could not come up with a scenario where almost any product of any industry could fit or meet the criteria as they were previously drafted.


We have also put in place some provisions that will ensure that there is a degree of forewarning about products that the government is looking at or considering. So the government will, under the amendments proposed, be publishing lists of products being considered for accreditation or regulation under the act. There will be a committee established—a review mech­anism—to ensure that industry and key players in this sector all have some degree of input. These are important changes that we believe will provide at least for a greater level of involvement and consultation and hopefully a stronger outcome of industry confidence and participation in this scheme.


As the government confirms in the explanatory memorandum for this bill, the product stewardship criteria are only one factor in determining whether regulations, co-regulatory or mandatory, can be made with respect to a class of products. There are two other considerations in addition to the criteria. One is that the bill requires that the minister be satisfied that making the regulations will further the objects of the act, and again that is a factor that has been reinforced time and again during discussions and deliberations of the committee and behind closed doors about how this bill will function.


Second, and I think particularly important, is the requirement—of which the government assures us throughout the explanatory memorandum and in the parliamentary secretary's second reading speech—that, as a matter of government policy, the usual regulatory impact assessment requirements would also apply. This is very important. This is not a factor that is detailed in the bill. It is, however, a factor that has been used time and again as reassurance. I would invite the parliamentary secretary, when he makes some remarks in this debate, again to provide that assurance from the government as to what will underpin that regulatory impact assessment process so that this debate has those issues clearly on the record, especially given that the website of the Office of Best Practice Regulation within the Department of Finance and Deregulation simply explains that a regulatory impact statement is required under the Australian government's requirements. That is one of those nice circular statements. We, of course, would just like, for the sake of conclusion in this debate, to ensure that the government's expectations and understanding of how that regulatory impact statement arrangement will work in this legislation are made clear so that all those who may be dealing with it in years to come have a clear record to refer back to in that regard.


Lastly, I just raise another matter that I invite the parliamentary secretary to respond to and that I have foreshadowed with him. Very late in the inquiry into this bill, the Senate committee received a late submission from the Law Council of Australia—the Intellectual Property Committee of its Business Law Section—concerning the creation of product stewardship logos under the voluntary product stewardship provisions. As the committee did not have an opportunity to consider in detail the issues raised but simply drew it to the government's attention, I would invite the parliamentary secretary to provide advice on how the government has considered that issue and what advice he has received from the Attorney-General's Department or others about its relevance.


In closing, I once again express my thanks to all parties for their cooperation on this and restate the coalition's commitment to this scheme, to the principle of product stewardship and, importantly, to our belief that wherever possible these should be schemes driven and owned by industry to make sure that they have genuine stewardship of their products throughout the life cycle.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-06-15,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (10:42):  I also rise to make some remarks on the Product Stewardship Bill 2011 on behalf of the Australian Greens. This is framework legislation that arises from COAG agreeing that the federal government and the states and territories should together establish a national framework to support voluntary, co-regulatory and mandatory product steward­ship and extended producer responsibility schemes to responsibly manage the enor­mous quantities of waste that Australians are generating. This national approach is the kind of policy infrastructure that is necessary to separate contaminating products and valuable products and massively reduce our landfill.


Facts and figures about how we currently handle our waste stream make the case as to why this measure is well and truly overdue. As I have said in committee hearings time and again, on this issue and on related issues that I will touch on, this is a policy portfolio for patient people. This really seems to have taken an inordinate amount of time to come to fruition, and I would like to congratulate the parliamentary secretary for steering us through these final phases, because this is genuinely well overdue. It is often very difficult to detect a sense of urgency amongst policymakers where waste is concerned, because of course historically it has been cheaper to simply dump our trash on a pile than to do something about the extraordinary waste of resources and, of course, the contamination at landfill sites, greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution and so on that result—the hidden costs of the enormous profligacy of our consumer society. So it is good to at last be able to say that we can detect the faint stirrings of urgency. Australia uses over 12 billion beverage containers a year, for example. Only about half of those are recycled. Most of the remainder wind up as litter or in landfill. More than four billion plastic bags are given out at supermarkets. Barely any of those are recycled. Four million tonnes of packaging is used and discarded every year. Australians accumulate 18 million used tyres every year. Approx­imately four million tyres are landfilled every year, despite each tyre containing recyclable quantities, up to 1½ kilograms, of steel, half a kilogram of textile and seven kilos of rubber. And instead of responsibly dealing with our tyres, roughly 11 million, or about 60 per cent of them, are exported to Vietnam and China, where they are recycled—if you could call it that—under appalling labour conditions with really quite harmful environmental and public health impacts. In a portfolio where the crossbenches and the opposition support the moves that the government is making, I might call Senator Birmingham's attention, before we go too much further down the track of celebrating the importance of the RIS process, to the fact that this is one instance where a regulatory impact statement was undertaken. Through a process of arcane number-crunching, the economists decided that it was not worth bothering setting up any kind of product stewardship framework for tyres, so now we dump them in countries in our region where they are burnt and 'recycled', with enormously harmful conse­quences for host populations. So I think we need to be extremely cautious before we simply hand over the kind of policy-making decisions we are elected to provide to people with spreadsheets who will just plug a formula in and then two years later a result will fall out that says, 'Don't bother.' That is what happened in the instance of tyres.


Mobile phones, of course, are another nightmare. We have about 24 million in circulation in Australia as at 30 June 2010 in the hands of 70 per cent, or thereabouts, of Australians. They get replaced very often. I am convinced somewhere within each mobile phone there is a piece of software that says, 'Just before the next model is due to hit the market, this one will start getting flaky and then drop dead.' Again, that is a part of our consumer society that we need to draw attention to. We are getting very used to just taking these devices on and then, 20 minutes after they have been released, we feel like we are falling off the back of the curve and we turf them, and they wind up in landfill. Eighteen months to two years is the speed of product turnover in mobile phone markets. There are about 16 million old handsets in cupboards and drawers in Australian homes. Each one of these phones contains substances that we could contemplate as either being extremely hazardous, such as cadmium, lead, nickel, mercury, lithium, arsenic, or being valuable, such as metals like gold, silver and copper and plastics that can be shredded and reused as well.


The MobileMuster is a voluntary scheme, and here again is one example of why we had better be careful before we simply assume that the best solution across the board is for industry to just take care of these things itself. I appreciate the efforts of the people behind the MobileMuster. They have got 3½ thousand collection points around Australia and people can recycle their mobile phones by post. But the fact is—and the minister might like to contradict this figure, but it is the figure I have—we have about a five per cent recovery rate in that voluntary scheme. That is another way of saying we have a 95 per cent non-recovery rate of phones that find themselves in landfill or just wind up in drawers for all time, not being recycled and that material lost to us.


From November 1998 to 30 June 2010, 724 tonnes, including five-and-a-bit million handsets and batteries, were junked. Quite a bit of that can be recycled from the old mobile phones. The nickel in the batteries can be recovered, as can the gold and silver in the circuit boards, and the handset housings and casings can be used to make fence posts, pallets and other things that we make with recycled plastics. I was interested to read in the MobileMuster annual report that one tonne of mobile phone circuit boards can yield the same amount of precious metals as 110 tonnes of gold ore or 123 tonnes of silver-bearing ore and 11 tonnes of copper sulphide ore. So these things are valuable and we need somehow to figure out how to recover that material, and this obviously goes further than just what happens at the end of life. We need to look at the design and manufacture of these devices in the first place so that they are designed to be more easily disassembled. As one of the witnesses to the committee said, even if all the mobile phones that are being stored came out for recycling, MobileMuster does not have the infrastructure to take hold of those and recycle them. I will return to this as an interesting example where the industry has taken on itself to try and do the right thing, but it has not been sufficient, you would say, to actually come to grips with the overall scale of the problem.


Where there is better news is in the area of televisions, computers and so on, involving Product Stewardship Australia and the Australian Information Industry Association, which Senator Birmingham touched on. There we have industry peak bodies that have taken the lead based, I understand, on moves overseas. We are in a global market here and other countries are moving ahead. This is one quite clear-cut example where you can say industry has led from the front in requesting that the government take on and regulate for the entire industry so that people who want to do the right thing are not being competitively disadvantaged by free-riders. It looks as though we are in the process of getting that one right. There were 16.8 million televisions, computers and peripherals that died in 2008. Eighty per cent of those went to landfill; about 10 per cent were recycled. As the digital switchover occurs, as the NBN rolls out, and we know we are undergoing an enormous face of technological innovation in Australia at the moment, that pile of electronic or e-waste is only going to grow into a mountain. That is why it is good to notice that a focus on TVs and computers is welcome as the first scheme, otherwise we would be debating effectively empty legislation—a container bill with nothing in it. But we know that we do have an example of how this framework legislation will be used, and that is welcome.


If we do not get going with that properly, e-waste in Australian landfill will triple by 2020 and be close to 700 million items. That is an extraordinary waste of this material that we all know can be quite transitory as product cycles accelerate. As it is, there are 18 million TVs and 70 million computers and peripherals in landfill or on their way to landfill. These constitute about 38 per cent of current e-waste items in landfill. We know that we need to deal with items like fluorescent tubes, some of which contain mercury, and items like batteries that find their way into landfill and then pose enormous problems with water contam­ination as water percolates through the landfill piles and into local watertables. There is a good news story here about how many jobs, for example, would be created if we dealt responsibly with our waste. The Boomerang Alliance stated that a national recycling scheme for all e-waste would create 5,100 new jobs by 2015. That includes 1,440 direct jobs in the recycling of e-waste and another 3,660 indirect jobs. As Senators will know, I have been pushing for quite some time for a national container deposit scheme to handle the 12 billion beverage containers that are used in this country. If we put monetary value on those containers, we would see many fewer of them end up in our waterways, parks and bushland. So, just as we propose to tax carbon emissions so that the market suddenly sees a price signal on something that we do not want to throw away, we would be placing a tiny premium on the beverage container to give them an economic value. That, in effect, would reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by nearly one million tonnes of CO2 per year. That is the equivalent of switching 135,000 homes to 100 per cent renewable energy. All that is based on is the 50-odd per cent of beverage containers that at the moment find their way into streams, the side of the road and landfill, the stuff that we buy, use and discard when we are away from home where recycling rates are obviously very poor. It is about bringing those into the system and recovering those materials—a million tonnes of CO2 per year.


It would save enough water to perman­ently supply more than 30,000 Australian homes. Because we would no longer be discarding the stuff, we would be getting those materials back. It would deliver air quality improvements equivalent to taking 56,000 cars off the road and create approximately 1,000 direct jobs. Our bev­erage containers made up, we are aware, of about 60 per cent of all glass items, 47 per cent of metal items and about a third of plastic items during the 2010 Clean Up Australia Day. Nine out of the top 10 items collected on that day were packaging materials which made up about 80 per cent of all waste collected. This is a huge volume of material at the moment simply going to waste.


There is broad, consistent and very high support in the community for a container deposit scheme. There is a demonstrated willingness to pay. The study was done twice, and now we are buried in the swamp of a regulatory impact statement process being undertaken by the Commonwealth on container deposits that simply has this proposal buried in quicksand. It is not good enough. At best, we think this could result in a scheme being implemented in four years time. Thanks to this analysis paralysis, we have to get faster and better and develop a sense of urgency when something is so obviously a good idea. For every 12 months that we drag our heels on this, another 12 billion beverage containers are used.


On 25 January this year, Northern Territory Chief Minister Paul Henderson put out a blazing press statement calling on the beverage industry to stop their misleading campaign against the cash for containers legislation. It is one of the sharpest pieces of language I think I have ever seen come out of a Premier's or Chief Minister's office where he said that the beverage industry should simply stop wasting its money on deceptive advertising to stop it. How different the situation is when we have got the industry peaks in the case of e-waste, computers and TVs backing a scheme and demanding coherent legislation for their sector and so of course things are moving. The case of the beverage industry could not be in starker contrast where they have dug their heels in and progress has been painfully slow because of the deceptive conduct of the beverage and packaging industries. I still do not completely understand why the hostility is so stark.


I have put these figures on the record to make the point that national approaches to our national waste crisis are very much needed. We have historically had a very weak response to this issue in Australia. We have got litter campaigns which are valuable: they marshal volunteers and get people out to pick material up. We have got industry-led voluntary programs that are limited in extent and need some kind of coherent framework and approach.


The main industry government program is of course the Australian Packaging Covenant, which sounds great but it does not really deliver as much as industry seems to think, despite what we continually hear about in the course of various pieces of committee work that have contributed to this debate. We acknowledge the benefits of the APC, but I do not think they are as great as some in industry believe that they are.


We still have very serious concerns at the extent to which voluntary schemes are emphasised at the expense of mandatory schemes in this bill. I know there is some kind of reflexive opposition on the coalition side to forms of mandatory regulation where a voluntary industry scheme might serve us better. We believe that the amendments that have been jointly negotiated between the Greens, the government and the opposition will sharpen the distinctions between the three kinds of schemes that this bill seeks to bring into force.


We know that if a voluntary program has sufficient resources and organisational capacity then infrastructure can be developed and the outcomes can be very strong. What this bill, I think, will do with a bit of goodwill—and I am happy if the minister wants to confirm this—is put some teeth into the voluntary schemes. Let's hear what the targets are and, if they are not being met, then let's review them and assess whether a scheme should maybe shift from being voluntary to co-regulatory. If a co-regulatory scheme is letting us down, then let's assess if those targets are failing to be met; let's move it up to a mandatory scheme.


Co-regulatory programs work when the industry wants them to, and I am very happy to give credit where it is due to the television and computer industry who obviously want to do something about their waste, as I say, driven by international imperatives to bring our extraordinary waste production under control.


We have worked with the government to ensure that the bill does not use federal powers to extinguish good state schemes. I would hate to see, for example, a defective container deposit scheme get up that squashed the good work that has been done in South Australia over the last 30 years or the initiative taken by the Northern Territory. We will be asking the government, when we drop into the committee stage, to clarify how that is going to work.


We have also worked constructively to address an issue that came up during the committee inquiry into the bill regarding the need for the minister to have some guidance and input from experts to help identify priorities and monitor progress and next steps. I think that is something that every single witness who came before the committee said should happen and I am glad that we have government and, I think, opposition support for those amendments by the Australian Greens to set the priorities. Such an advisory panel existed to guide the New South Wales product stewardship legislation. The independent committee in New South Wales was made up of experts, non-government organisations and industry reps. That was involved in establishing a list of priority products so that industry knew where the system was going and the prioritisation process was transparent for the community. That advice was offered on an ongoing basis.


We will also, when we get to the committee stage, make amendments to the objects clause of the bill that we think is very important, and I will discuss that shortly. I would like to thank the committee for its excellent and very useful report that provided a very useful distillation of the waste crisis in our country. We perhaps take our committee staff here for granted from time to time because of how regularly they astound us by their professionalism and efficiency but this report, I think, actually stands out. I would also like to thank the non-government organisations who work very hard in an, I suppose, unglamorous area of waste policy. It is work that is nonetheless extraordinarily important for the larger project of creating a genuinely sustainable Australia, for cleaning up our act, for cleaning up our fouled waterways, our parklands and our wilderness from rubbish and for recovering those valuable materials that go to waste.


I would also like to acknowledge my colleague in Victoria Colleen Hartland MLC, who I think today is reintroducing in the Victorian parliament her bill on container deposits because she shares the frustration of many people in this place that the Commonwealth has simply decided to bury a national container deposit scheme under endless reviews and analysis. Colleen my colleague in the Victorian parliament and her office have done an enormous amount of work in building support in Victoria for a state scheme. I still think that a national scheme is the right way to go and I suspect that industry would prefer a coherent set of regulations that applied across the country, but I really strongly commend Colleen Hartland MLC for bringing her bill forward to simply get on with the job of getting containers out of waterways and verges and into recycling centres where they belong.


One of the great benefits of a container deposit scheme is that it would mandate and fund the creation of a network of neighbourhood recycling centres. Once you get those up and running for beverage containers initially they become the drop-off point for batteries, fluorescent tubes and other objects that we might find intractable that simply end up in landfill.


I would again like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water, for the constructive way in which he has approached this bill. It is always good to get an exposure draft of a bill so that you can see where a particular area is headed. I would like to thank all sides for the constructive spirit in which negotiations were entered into for this bill. It is a rare bit of good news. I would like to see this, very strictly speaking, as the first step of many. This simply sets us up with a framework which will be free to succeed or fail depending on the amount of effort and energy that is put into it. I look forward to discussing some of these matters in greater detail in the committee stage and indicate that the Greens are happy to support the bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Product Stewardship Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2011-06-15,"



Senator FISHER
 (South Australia) (11:02):  Now you would not necessarily know it from the title of the Product Stewardship Bill but, yes, this bill is largely about waste and largely about the management of it. So why have we wasted so much time in getting to this point? Why have we wasted so much time when the Howard government supported the concept of a national scheme to reduce the impact on the environment and on health and safety of products and substances during their life and then at the end of their life? The Howard government supported that principle and that concept yet it is some years upon years later that we finally find ourselves in this place in the noncontroversial section of the legislative consideration hopefully poised to give passage and implement such a scheme.


Why has it taken so long? Why have we wasted so long in working out what to do nationally with our waste when, for example, the television and computer industry, largely composed of manufacturers and importers wanting to do the right thing, has recognised that we still use TVs with hazardous substances in them and we need to take TVs and computers off the footpath and get them out of landfill? That industry is one that has been working for a long time towards an industry resourced national scheme. The unnecessary distress caused to that industry and its largely well-meaning and hardworking people, when it needs some legislative enablement to get its scheme up and running before the end of this year, because this government has left its run until the 11th hour is indeed regrettable.


We know that we are about to be at a happier place in terms of the bill. Thanks to the departmental officers, and Ms Kelly Pearce and Dr Wright in particular, for their constructive engagement with us as members of the opposition, under of course the fine tutelage of the Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water, Senator Farrell. Thank you for your consideration of our views but also those views of industry. Taking so long in the gestation of what to do with our waste, the government claimed it had extensively consulted with industry last year culminating in the putting out of the discussion paper, which the government tried to say resulted in a whole lot of submissions as the precursor to this bill. The problem is that the government dumped—talk about waste—this bill in the House of Reps in March this year without having the forethought, the preparedness to release an exposure draft of the bill. It dumped the bill on the House of Reps in March and then thankfully, it decided to refer it to a Senate committee for inquiry.


But having referred a bill of that sort to a Senate committee inquiry without the benefit of an exposure draft, the man in the street would not know what product stewardship is when it is at home. Most people would not know. The man in the street would not know it if he fell over it. So it was all very nice for us to get excited as members of the Senate committee and say, 'Whoopee, we are having an inquiry into this bill, so it will all be sorted.' The trouble is even some of the stakeholders involved in the process through government last year were caught unawares by the inquiry and indeed the relevance of this bill to them and their industries. Product stewardship has existed as a term, no doubt, in the industry, bureaucratic and probably government vernacular for quite some time but, as I say, the normal man or woman in the street would not know it if they fell over it. The Senate Environment and Communica­tions Legislation Committee inquiry heard from a range of witnesses, who did realise that product stewardship had some consequences for them and their respective industries. They drove home mainly two messages: firstly, that the criteria that a product or substance has to meet before being able to be subject to the voluntary co-regulatory or mandatory regime set up by the bill were so wide you could drive a truck through them—the department did a very brave job giving evidence and suggesting that the criteria were filters, but in my warped interpretation of the English language filters reduce things that come through the other end and the trouble with these criteria is they do none of that—and, secondly, the bill gives industry no practical place to start. It potentially says that every product and every substance under the sun—indeed, every product on the supermarket shelf, so said witnesses—is potentially subject to this bill. Those in industry want to do the right thing, but they know not where to start as the bill gives no suggestion—in the language of some witnesses, 'Pick the low-hanging fruit; please suggest where we might start.' It leaves industry swinging in a stewardship wasteland.


Thankfully, following the Senate inquiry, as I said, the government has taken quite some note of the Senate committee's report and that has resulted in discussions taking place. It also resulted, very importantly, in belated consultations with industry stake­holders including between the government and industry stakeholders. For example, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry became far more involved in consideration of the bill and was able to contribute constructively in where we find ourselves today.


In looking forward to supporting the bill and supporting a range of amendments that have been tabled and circulated, I also hope that the government will learn some lessons from this process. This should be and will be not only a bipartisan but a tripartisan or a quadruple-partisan policy. It is a good thing, but just because something sounds good does not mean that it will do good unless you make sure that you implement it the right way. That means—please, government, and please, Senator Farrell—that the message for your colleagues is explain things to the people, to the stakeholders, consult with the stakeholders and do as the Prime Minister says: let the damn sunshine in. We are all deprived of vitamin D these days, did you know? Let the sunlight in; do not leave it to the last minute to consult with those who could help you achieve a constructive outcome.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Product Stewardship Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2011-06-15,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (11:10):  I thank all the contributors to this debate on the Product Stewardship Bill, particularly Senators Birmingham, Fisher and Ludlam. I noted the complimentary remarks from Senators Fisher and Ludlam, but really the credit should go to my staff and also to the people from the department, Diana Wright and Kelly Pearce, who have worked so hard to ensure that this legislation passes the parliament. It is reassuring that we have had such strong support and such strong cooperation from the opposition and the Greens so that we get a more effective and consistent approach to reducing the impact of products and hazardous substances in products on the environment and on human health.


Senator Birmingham raised a couple of issues, which I would like to specifically address. The first related to the regulatory impact statement. The bill sits within a strong governance framework that encourages consultation and evidence based decision making. Before any decision to regulate a product can be made, a regulatory impact analysis is required. As explained in paragraph 19 of the explanatory memoran­dum, this is both government and COAG policy. The regulatory impact analysis is a robust process that articulates the problems to be addressed. It assesses not only the economic but also the social and environ­mental benefits and costs in taking action to address a particular problem. There is no preconception that a particular solution like product stewardship is the best approach; a range of options is considered.


The impact analysis process typically involves significant consultation. For example, the television and computers con­sultation regulatory impact statement was released and public meetings were run—also a requirement to publish the results of this process. Once a decision to regulate is made, taking into account the impact analysis in section 17, the Legislative Instruments Act requires consultations on the regulation.


Senator Birmingham raised the letter that the Law Council sent to the committee. The letter raised the issue of use of the logo to support accreditation of voluntary schemes and, in particular, the interaction of the bill with the Trade Marks Act. In essence, the Law Council's concern was that the bill duplicates elements of the Trade Marks Act dealing with what are known as certification trademarks. These provisions in the Trade Marks Act allow, for example, a body like the Heart Foundation to register the Heart Foundation tick and certify that certain goods meet the Heart Foundation's standards. I have sought advice from my department and, through the department, from IP Australia on this matter. I am advised that the bill complements rather than duplicates the Trade Marks Act provisions. In fact, it is anticipated that the product stewardship logo would be required as a certification trademark under the Trade Marks Act, which I hope answers Senator Birmingham's question. Without any further discussion, I commend the bill to the Senate.


Question agreed to.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Product Stewardship Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-06-15,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (11:14): The first amendment that the Australian Greens will move on sheet 7078 is a very simple addition to the objects clause in the Products Stewardship Bill 2011 to make explicit that the scope of product stewardship legislation should rightly be:


(c) to contribute to reducing the amount of virgin resources used in products by preferencing recyclate.


I would have thought that was a reasonably commonsense thing to insert in a bill such as this to make absolutely explicit what this is about. 


This bill seeks to do a number of things. In respect of the recovery of material and taking this material out of landfill, what we are trying to do here is then plug that material back into product cycles. I think there is a very well understood principle of industrial ecology or cradle-to-cradle product cycles, which says that if you are recovering valuable materials you want to then close those loops and plug that material back into the product cycle so that you are actually reducing the impact of manufacturing in the first place on the raw materials and on the virgin materials that we mine, chop down, refine and so on. So we wish to put a clause into the objects section of the bill because we believe a very important part of the whole enterprise of recycling and encouraging responsible products stewardship is that it reduces the amount of materials being drawn on to create the product in the first place. While the bill will not have a huge impact on the front end of creating the products, and I understand that is not specifically its intention, it is mostly focused on the end of pipe—it is focused on waste and what falls out of the system.


One overall, quite obvious and uncontro­versial aim I would have thought of doing this work is to impact on the way these products are made in the first place. That is obviously a piece of legislation for another day and, if anything, that is even more complex than what we are contemplating here. But I do not think that there is any harm at all—quite the reverse—in inserting a clause into the objects of the bill that at least tips the hat and acknowledges the fact that as we are in the business today in this parlia­ment of recovering materials in the first place, that those materials then be used at the front end. We are trying to encourage recycling. We believe that it should have an intent of impacting on the way that products are made in the first place, so we can take the first tentative steps in Australia towards a closed-loop economy or closed-loop product cycles.


I am happy to speak more on this perhaps once I have heard the views of the opposition and the government on this amendment, and I move Greens amendment (1) on sheet 7078:


(1)   Clause 4, page 7 (line 30), at the end of subclause (3), add:


   ; and (c)    to contribute to reducing the amount of virgin resources used in products by preferencing recyclate.


[objects]

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Product Stewardship Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-06-15,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (11:19):  This amendment by the Greens to add clause (c) to the objects of the Product Stewardship Bill 2011 is certainly a well-intentioned amendment and the spirit of the amendment is in some ways difficult to disagree with. Certainly it is a statement that we would hope would be an outcome ultimately of product stewardship schemes in the operation of this act and that there would eventually be, as a result of product stewardship schemes, a reduction in the amount of virgin resources used in product through a higher use of recycled materials. That is something we would hope and expect. This bill will provide for product stewardship schemes that will see, we would hope and expect, an increase in the amount of materials recycled at the end of product, and obviously those products or those materials will be recycled into some other products and will be a substitute for virgin resources.


However, we do not see that there is a need to add this extra part to the objects of the bill, and we do not see that there is a need for a couple of reasons. The objects as they currently stand certainly do not exclude this as a point of consideration. Subclause (1)(a) of the objects is to reduce the impact that products have on the environment throughout their lives and subclause (1)(b) is to reduce the impact that substances con­tained in products have on the environ­ment and on the health and safety of human beings throughout the lives of those products. Neither of those subclauses exclude, I think, what Senator Ludlam is attempting to achieve by virtue of paragraph (c). Indeed, both are relatively broad.


I would make the additional point that of course there are some circular aspects of this act in terms of the way products are accredited for their application. To have a scheme accredited, to have a product stewardship scheme applied, there is a criterion where the minister deems that doing so will meet the objects of the act. That means, that in addition to the product stewardship criteria, which we will debate in a second, the objects are one of the two tests. Obviously, if you inserted paragraph (c) to the objects, there would be a new, additional test for consideration. I suspect that this would not be Senator Ludlam's intent, but it would be possible that, in the way the bill is written at present, all objects would have to be met for something to be accredited, and that would mean that paragraph (c) would have to be met along with paragraphs (a) and (b).


That may not be the case for some schemes that people would wish to accredit. In fact, in particular, when we were working through the product stewardship criteria, we found the importance of issues around hazardous substances and the need for this bill to comply with Australia's international obligations in the treatment of hazardous substances. These are not necessarily substances that will be recycled, and certainly not substances that will be recycled in a manner that would displace the use of virgin resources in making other products. This is simply a way of ensuring that a scheme is in place for the safe and sound management of hazardous substances. I think there is a potential risk that by inserting the proposed paragraph (c) as one of the objects we could create a trip-up within this legislation that would impede its effective operation.


For the reasons that we think the intentions are good but they are by no means excluded by the existing objects and we think there could be some inadvertent issues with the operation of the bill were it to be passed with this amendment, the coalition will not be supporting the amendment. But we hope and expect that, as I said, the sentiments in the amendment are an actual outcome of the operation of this legislation.

Senator FISHER
 (South Australia) (11:25):  In addition to the shortcomings identified by Senator Birmingham, I will identify a couple of further ones within this very well-intentioned amendment moved by Senator Ludlam. I am sure that the Greens, and Senator Ludlam in particular, know what is meant in the amendment when it refers to reducing the amount of virgin resources used in products by preferencing recyclate, but neither 'virgin' nor 'recyclate' are terms that are defined in the bill. No doubt the Greens have a concept of 'virgin resources'. Indeed, Senator Hanson-Young once did an advertisement, I think, around that concept, but in a slightly different context. So, whilst the Greens might be clear on what they mean by 'virgin resources' and 'recyclate', those terms are not defined in the bill. That would add additional uncertainty and potential unintended consequences, as Senator Birmingham outlined. The amendment is very well intentioned, but we will oppose it.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-06-15,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (11:26):  You know you are in trouble when you get called 'well intentioned'. That was when my heart sank. I thought perhaps there would be a last-minute change of heart. I would be delighted to work with coalition senators on definitions. Senator Fisher is correct that these are not terms of art—they are not defined in the bill. They are concepts that are very clearly understood in the industry, in the waste management sector in particular. If Senator Fisher feels that some definitions would improve the drafting, I would be more than happy to work up some language to make her happy.


I want to draw the chamber's attention back to when this issue was addressed by the committee as it was evaluating this bill. A number of organisations, particularly Keep Australia Beautiful New South Wales and the Total Environment Centre, raised significant concerns with explicitly men­tioning this. I suppose I have to disagree with both the comments of Senator Birmingham and the parliamentary secretary that these objectives are implied in the existing objects of the bill, because of course the existing objects of the bill refer principally to what happens at the end of life of the materials that we are discussing. They are silent, as they are on many other issues, on the implied consequences of creating new product streams, new resource streams, of material that we are capturing rather than simply throwing away.


For example, Keep Australia Beautiful New South Wales highlighted that one of the ongoing trends in the production of modern goods is their reducing life span. I addressed this in my speech on the second reading in the context of mobile phones. Quite an important part of the enormously increasing waste volumes that we are subject to and are trying to come to grips with here today is this concept of planned obsolescence, the throwaway or consumer society, where it is seen as a very good marketing strategy to get your customers to throw goods away so that they have to buy the new ones that you have produced. That is directly at odds with all sane objectives for creating a sustainable society. It would not matter so much if they were contemplating goods that were essentially biodegradable, completely harmless and made from recycled materials in the first place, but of course, in the instance of mobile phones and so on, that is absolutely not the case. Mobile phones are packed with toxic materials, valuable metals and so on that we would seek to recover. We would seek not to stockpile them in a warehouse but to reuse them. Keep Australia Beautiful New South Wales made the point very clearly that modern consumers will simply throw a product onto a kerb side for council to clean up and buy a brand-new one because the parts are too expensive or too difficult to find. We know in the field of consumer electronics in particular that things that are made these days are designed not to be repairable; when something goes wrong you are supposed to turf it. That is quite a troubling feature of our consumer society. Keep Australia Beautiful highlighted in their submission that when you produce any type of product, there is a set amount of energy and resources that are used and the longer the product is used, the better return on the embodied energy and input of resources. If you can make something last twice as long, its impact, its footprint if you will, is obviously half as heavy. They recommended that the objects of the act be amended to ensure that the lifespan of a product be considered for its impact on waste streams in the environment.


As you will see from the language that we have proposed, we did not quite go there. But we did simply want to insert a paragraph that acknowledges the importance of closing those loops. The Total Environment Centre, who have done an enormous amount of valuable advocacy on this issue over many years, argued more strongly for language that we effectively lifted and proposed—that is, that we should be making a contribution to reducing the amount of 'virgin resources used in products by preferencing recyclate'. It does not go as far as to raise the concerns that Senator Birmingham spoke of—that is, that various products streams will find themselves at odds with this object of the bill if all you were seeking to do, for example, is simply to remove hazardous waste for which you have no further use. It is a contribution to reducing the amount, and I do not think we would face the problem of particular product streams falling foul of the object of the bill when it is worded as generally as that.


The committee report says:


The TEC argued that in addition to the benefit of limiting the amount of new resources used in creating a product, expanding the objects of the Act would have the effect of encouraging the domestic recycling industry …


This is something that is tremendously important that is continually missed in the processes of doing the regulatory impact statements. TEC told the committee:


You create a market for the recyclate and that leads to very significant economic benefits. The fact is that for every tonne of waste that goes to landfill there is one job, but if you take it right through the whole processing and manufacturing system and include that recyclate in a product you create nine jobs.


That is modelling that the Total Environment Centre and some of their colleagues in the waste management industry have been promoting for many, many years—that is, it is more labour intensive but less capital intensive to simply close some of these product loops in the first place.


The committee noted those concerns and came to the view, as I think the minister has stated, that the objects of the bill, while silent in this particular aspect, imply that we should reduce the impact of these virgin resources and instead be preferencing recyclate, for both environmental reasons and sound economic reasons. If you can plug these materials back into product cycles, then again you have created an economic value for them that the market will see, will take note of and will overall reduce the footprint of material cycles. I invite the coalition, if they will, to sharpen the definitions of the materials that Senator Fisher observed are not terms addressed or acknowledged specifically in the bill, and I commend this amendment to the chamber.


Question negatived.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-06-15,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (11:34):  I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7081:


(1)   Clause 5, page 8 (lines 1 to 34), omit the clause, substitute:




5  Product stewardship criteria



      The product stewardship criteria are satisfied in relation to a class of products if:


   (a)   the products in the class are in a national market; and


   (b)   at least one of the following applies in relation to the products in the class:


      (i)   the products contain hazardous substances;


      (ii)   there is the potential to significantly increase the conservation of materials used in the products, or the recovery of resources (including materials and energy) from waste from the products;


      (iii)   there is the potential to significantly reduce the impact that the products have on the environment, or that substances in the products have on the environment, or on the health or safety of human beings.


Note:   Whether the product stewardship criteria are satisfied in relation to a class of products is relevant for determining whether:


   (a)   to accredit a voluntary arrangement in relation to that class of products (see subsection 13(3)); or


   (b)   regulations can be made under this Act in relation to the class of products (see sections 19 (co-regulatory product stewardship—liable parties for class of products) and 39 (mandatory product stewardship requirements)).


[criteria]


This amendment seeks to replace section 5 of the bill. Section 5 outlines the product stewardship criteria and was a section that was the subject of intense debate and concern during the Senate committee inquiry into this bill. As drafted, section 5 'Product stewardship criteria' states that the criteria are satisfied in relation to a class of products if two or more of a range of paragraphs apply. Those paragraphs are, in some cases, quite broad when compared to the objects of the bill that we have just been discussing. These criteria, as drafted, include a statement that 'the products are in a national market' and a statement:


… taking action to reduce those impacts will offer business opportunities that would make a contribution to the economy.


They would have been two criteria in the bill that would be satisfied, and obviously for those who looked at it and thought this was an extremely broad way to apply criteria and a way that did not necessarily ensure that criteria were applied to ensure that the overriding intention and objects of this bill, which of course are to reduce environmental impacts, to better conserve materials and to ensure an increase in recycling, were the core criteria that had to be met with regard to the legislation.


As I did in my second reading debate speech, I thank the government in particular as well the Greens for working with us on redrafting these criteria and coming up with a tighter, neater form of criteria for the bill, which I believe the amendment does. The amendment provides that products will meet the criteria. Firstly, they must be in a national market and, secondly, they have to meet one of three other criteria. The first, namely that they contain hazardous substances, relates to some of the issues I discussed in regard to Senator Ludlam's amendment. Of course there are chemical substances that we do wish to better regulate and better manage the treatment of, either by Australia's own initiative or as a result of compliance with international obligations, and this legislation could provide a framework to do so. The other two criteria relate very specifically to the objects of reducing environmental impact, achieving better re-use of materials or conservation of materials and minimising the impact or use of those virgin materials that we were just discussing. The other two parts a product category would have to meet have been drawn from the words used in the original section 5 to ensure that we have not thrown the baby out with the bathwater in regard to all of the good consultation that the government did with industry and others with regard to working through the types of words and phrases. But they do ensure that products regulated by this legislation will have to significantly increase the conserva­tion of materials or significantly reduce the impact that the products have on the environment or on health or safety.


So we have very clear tests now. There are essentially three ways for a scheme to be accredited under this legislation: the products contain hazardous substances; there is the potential to significantly increase the conservation of materials used in the products, or increase the recovery of resources from waste from the products; or there is the potential to significantly reduce the impact that the products have on the environment, or that substances in the products have on the environment, or on the health or safety of human beings. These are three very distinct criteria. Under the amendment, one of them will have to be met. I know that it does not totally satisfy all of the concerns of industry or of those who wanted a very prescriptive criteria standard to apply, but I think it provides a far more certain criteria framework, a very clear test that has to be met. In applying that test, the parliament can have far greater confidence that this bill and the operation of this bill and the application of regulations under this bill will actually achieve what we all believe to be the objects of introducing a product stewardship bill.


I commend the amendment to the chamber. I thank in advance the other parties for their cooperation. This amendment works in tandem in a sense with some other amendments that form part of a package that we have all agreed upon to ensure better operation of this bill and of course to ensure the passage of this bill. I will be happy to address any other issues that may be raised by Senator Ludlam or the parliamentary secretary.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Product Stewardship Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-06-15,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (11:40):  I indicate at the outset that the Australian Greens will be supporting this amendment. When it was first proposed, or perhaps when some of the arguments were being tested during the committee process, I had some strong concerns about where the coalition was heading. Senator Fisher, I think, raised on a number of occasions the idea that ultimately product stewardship frameworks could be applied to nearly anything at all. Senator Fisher and other coalition MPs at the time were stating that with a sense of horror, as though it would be a terrible thing if many products which are familiar and in everyday use were to be discarded and then find their way into this framework legislation at some stage. I fail to see why that would necessarily be a bad thing. 


The coalition, however, argued in their additional comments that the product stewardship criteria be reworked. I will acknowledge that every witness, with the exception of the department, who came in front of the committee said it is very difficult to detect where the government is heading with this. No priorities have been set. We have no idea whether this is intended to cover the field. How do we know that you are going to go after what some described as the low-hanging fruit or whether you are going to tie us up in going through regulatory impact statements and so on for products that are not necessarily at the top of the list for a product stewardship scheme? 


So we are convinced that there are grounds for this. We welcome this amend­ment. I acknowledge that we fought for a little while over the term 'significantly'. I think if that ends up being addressed as too harsh a test by the government—and I invite the parliamentary secretary to address this issue specifically—we may end up finding that nothing finds its way into the scheme, if we are not careful. I know that that is not the government's intention. But I also acknowledge the way that some of the witnesses put this; we are in effect taking it on trust that the political will is there to move products into this framework so that we can actually start to reduce waste volumes in a serious way.


We support criteria that capture all of the potential products that might be appropriate for a scheme like this. I understand the opposition's intention is not to needlessly exclude products that we could usefully pull out of landfill or off the side of the road. They need to have clear meaning. I think it was successfully argued by coalition senators that indeed nearly anything at all could have found its way into this framework. That contributed to the unease expressed by people in industry and by non-government organisations that work on improving waste policy—opposite ends of the spectrum. There was no sense at all about where the government was going to take this. 


In evidence given to the committee, Mr Jeff Angel from the Total Environment Centre was asked whether ministerial discretion would set appropriate boundaries or whether in fact this framework would end up applying to every substance and every conceivable product. He said:


What in this bill makes it apply to everything? On paper everything; in practice potentially nothing, as I have outlined.


We could set this framework up and, if it were not for the good work that is being done in the e-waste area, I would be very sceptical as to the value of this bill at all. Mr Angel went on to say:


So it will be somewhere in the middle, or somewhere closer to not very many.


That is: not very many product streams are going to find their way into this framework. He continues:


Knowing how government processes work, how government regulatory assessments work, how industry negotiates and how we have had to work on the various committees, in reality it does not apply to everything. Frankly, I think it is the sort of fiction that puts the bill in a completely wrong perspective and light. What legislation makes everything happen unless it says that everything is going to come under it? It is a discretionary exercise and discretion in ministerial and government terms is very bounded.


That is from the point of view of groups like the Total Environment Centre, which are obviously concerned to see the maximum value and the maximum benefit gained. In some contexts, that might mean that a very wide variety of products wind up in this scheme.


The Australian Food and Grocery Council took a slightly different perspective on it during the same hearing, but effectively arrived at the same conclusion. Mr Mahar from the Australian Food and Grocery Council said:


… based on the broad interpretation. While we support that, our concern is that it leaves too much scope opportunity for secondary regulations to be made in relation to a range of products that are not necessarily compatible with product stewardship schemes or do not lend themselves to arrangements, mandatory or otherwise, that can be implemented under that bill. In our view the criteria currently in the bill are too broad, too wide and too numerous to allow any certainty for business.


Somewhere between those two perspectives there is a range of views that I think all witnesses were very consistent on, which said, 'We need a process here for a prioritisation,' and the coalition, I think, took the view that one way of guiding the government's discretion in that area is to narrow the range of criteria to which this kind of scheme can apply. We think that that is entirely appropriate.


We will support this bill, but I would seek for the minister, in his remarks before we close debate on this amendment, to address his understanding of the term 'significantly' as the government intends it to apply to the way that the criteria will be used.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2011-06-15,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (11:46):  I indicate that we support this amendment and that it was part of the extensive negotiations that occurred between the various parties which resulted in a consensus about the legislation.


Just on the issue that was raised by Senator Ludlam: the criteria, as amended, do tighten the test for the coverage of a product, whether it is voluntary or regulatory. We would expect that there would be sufficient discretion within the words, for example, 'potential to significantly increase the conservation of materials' to allow for most of what the witnesses referred to as the 'low-hanging fruit' to be covered. That answers your question, and I indicate that we support the amendment.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Product Stewardship Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-06-15,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (11:47):  Just to add to the issue: Senator Ludlam is right to highlight that in the discussions about these amendments we had a discussion about the significance of the word 'significantly'. Indeed, we did have some debate. In fact, when first drafted—




Senator Fisher:
  Significant debate!




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  It was not a 'significant' debate, Senator Fisher, but nor was it an insignificant debate. It was a good moderate discussion.


When first drafted, we actually had inadvertently placed the word 'significantly' in, I think, part B(2) but not in part B(3) or vice versa. We then had to have the discussion as to whether to apply it as a test to both or to neither. In the end the coalition felt it is important to apply it to both. We would not want to see a situation where, especially, co-regulatory or mandatory schemes were put in place if there were only a marginal benefit. I guess that is where we would draw the distinction. We do not see that 'significantly' is a gargantuan test to leap over, but we see it as a way of making sure that we are not entering a realm where it is within the scope of this legislation to apply schemes that would only be of negligible or marginal benefit rather than of a reasonable or significant benefit.


In the end, once all of the low-hanging fruit—to borrow Senator Farrell's words—is picked, then if there is good argument and scope to revisit these definitions I am sure the parliament will be happy to do so. But I suspect it will be quite a period of time before that harvest and bounty is picked. These definitions, as applied, and the use of the word 'significantly' will ensure that we have consistency in the definitions and will ensure that where schemes are being applied they do actually make a difference; a tangible difference that people can see and that will therefore will help to improve the support and embrace of those schemes.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Product Stewardship Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2011-06-15,"



Senator FISHER
 (South Australia) (11:50):  Obviously, in speaking in support of the amendment I look forward to it enabling the picking of more than just low-hanging fruit. Indeed, feeding into the low-hanging fruit part of the equation is probably best achieved by amendments which we will discuss shortly.


This is tightening the criteria so that they can indeed do as Dr Wright suggested was the government's intent during the inquiry into this bill—that is, to filter. The amendment ensures that the criteria now filter the flotsam and jetsam, if you like, of products and substances which otherwise could have been subject to this bill.


It was not quite the projection of mass hysteria implied by Senator Ludlam that came from some witnesses about the confusion that could result from the fact that the bill, in its current unamended termin­ology, could apply to every product and every substance. But there was significant concern, and for good practical reason. There is no point in having criteria or words in a bit of legislation if they are so wide as to cover everything and to be meaningless. Just as it is a waste to have words in legislation to that end, it is also a waste for any government, as would have been the consequence with the bill in its current terms, to potentially leave industry uncertain about the targets of a particular piece of legislation and the product stewardship regulatory regime which would result.


The government of the day will need the arms and legs of industry to get this cracking. You have only to look at the television and computer industries to see that. We are not going to get TVs off the footpath and out of landfill without the industry, be it in that case a co-regulatory scheme that is being proposed or be it in other sectors mandatory, co-regulatory and/or voluntary. Whatever the mechanism and whatever the means, the government of the day is going to be best placed to achieve its wishes with the cooperation, support and hard work of industry, and you had best get that, Temporary Chair Hutchins, as you would know from your hardworking days prior to coming to the Senate, from industry by getting them onboard on day 1 and getting them understanding and involved in the point that you are aiming at. So these amendments are good.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (11:53):  I was ultimately persuaded by arguments that coalition senators raised on the use of the word 'significantly', and I will ask the minister in a moment about where he sees this process going from here. I visualise the fact that anything that would lead to insignificant recovery of materials or recycling would not be worth anybody's while, so we were happy that that test remains in there. But I wonder whether, for the benefit of the chamber but also for the industry and the various sectors that will be intimately affected by the operation of this when it becomes an act, we could be told where this is heading next. What are the priorities? What are the low-hanging fruit? Where is this whole process going? At the moment, we have been speaking, apart from the instances of TVs, computers and so on, mostly in the abstract. I am interested in knowing where the parliamentary secretary sees this process going once this legislation clears the parliament.

We have set up a mechanism to deal with that. That was all part of the discussions that we had. There will be a number of products which I think are likely to come on the radar very soon. The first is tyres. I think fluorescent lighting and packaging will be issues that will come up in the very near future. Of course, our priority is to ensure that we get the TV and computer program up and running. That is going to be our immediate priority.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (11:56):  I thank the minister for that answer. So as not to tie the chamber up, so we can move through the remainder of the amendments that we have, can the minister point me to somewhere on his website or the department's website—or indicate whether such a document exists as part of the COAG process—that has a list of what the various product types are. The parliamentary secretary named a couple at that point. Are they intended to be voluntary, co-regulatory or mandatory schemes? What recovery targets are anticipated for each of those product streams? When would they proposed to be met? I am not suggesting that the minister necessarily detail that unless he has that information at the table right now, but I would be very interested in knowing whether such a document exists in the first place and whether the parliamentary secretary and the officers at the table would undertake to create such a thing.

[Advisory Group]


Our second set of amendments introduces a product stewardship advisory group. This in many ways goes to the same issues that we have been dealing with so far this morning. It is an idea that was raised by quite a number of those making submissions to the committee.


There were two broad categories of reasons why the Australian Greens felt that this was a valid suggestion and something that would materially improve the way that the bill operates. The first is the lack of priorities established in the legislation that I think we have already canvassed in some detail. Industry and community groups who follow this process have absolutely no idea where it is due to head apart from some very broad-brush issues that the minister outlined there. The second is that the minister, under the way that this act will operate, has very broad powers without any particular accoun­tability mechanism or opportunity for input. So there is enormous discretion there to take issues on, to take various product streams on or not. Environment ministers obviously all get together within the EPHC and as an entity within the larger COAG process, which we find almost completely opaque because what goes on behind those closed doors can be very difficult to influence or even to know, in many cases, what the propositions are. Our amendments pick up the suggestions made by those in the sector who proposed that an advisory group would best comprise experts from industry groups, consumer advocates, community groups, environment groups and scientific groups who would be valuable in providing expert advice on new products that could potentially come under the framework legislation. That not only gives the government some guidance as to where the industry, in the broadest concept of that term, thinks that this process should go but also provides the minister and the community with that advice, that you have the experts around the table when these decisions are being made.


The use of an expert panel was seen as providing forthright advice from outside the bureaucracy. This would be seen to strengthen the governance arrangements. This is nothing against the bureaucrats who have been managing this process to date, but we feel that diversity of opinion and having the experts in the room when the decisions are being made is a way of providing unfiltered advice to the government that can also generate and transmit a sense of urgency coming from the community for various things. For example, we are aware of media reporting a fortnight or so ago about four shipments of e-waste intercepted by Customs, presumably on their way to South-East Asia. That is not what the industry wants, it is not what people think is happening when their computers and televisions are picked up or they drop them off at a neighbourhood recycling centre, but it is still going on. For the government to be able to respond through this expert advisory group to changing circumstances or new information that arises, like the degree of a black market in e-waste shipping and dumping in some of our neighbouring countries, can guide the direction and help give a sense of urgency. WALGA, the Western Australian Local Government Association, said that a panel:


… would ensure that the most important products and those with the biggest potential to create an environmental impact were selected for product stewardship schemes. 


As I noted, this is a way of prioritising that has support from industry right through to the community groups and so on. 


An example of such an advisory committee being established to manage waste and determine priorities is the statutory Waste Advisory Board in New Zealand. That board is tasked with providing advice to the responsible minister on a range of issues, including:


declaring priority products— 


it is not required to develop a priority list—


making guidelines for product stewardship schemes 


…   …   …


specifying criteria for the funding of waste minimisation projects 


…   …   …


regulations on records, information and reports.


The committee's report details the New South Wales model established under that state's Waste Avoidance and Resource Recovery Act 2001 which established a non-statutory committee with expert, business and non-government representatives to assist the Director-General of the DCCW to develop the list of wastes of concern. I know that the department were probably pretty cautious about establishing this, and I am pleased that the committee process that we went through and the evidence that we received convinced all parties that advice to the minister is ultimately very useful. It convenes and facilitates engagement by the industry and it is effectively an opportunity for the government to get it right. I commend these amendments to the chamber.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (12:03):  I indicate the coalition's support for this package of amendments which essentially establish the Product Stewardship Advisory Group. This ties in with amendments that are to be moved by the government. We hope these amendments will together provide greater certainty for industry and for all those who are stakeholders within the operation of this act once it is passed.


We heard the concerns that Senator Ludlum outlined, that people were not sure that there was sufficient certainty about where things were going under the operation of the product stewardship scheme, the priorities for future schemes and whether they would be considered in the context of voluntary, co-regulatory or mandatory schemes, exactly how these things would work, how priorities would be set and how much forewarning there would be that an industry could be captured by such a scheme.


Whilst the government has been at pains throughout to emphasise that processes of the regulatory impact statement and otherwise will take some time, that the prioritisation work done by the Environment Protection and Heritage Council will take some time and that there should be in the normal operation of things a good period of time for anyone to become aware that their industry is under consideration, the expec­tation is that these things will always be done in a consultative and cooperative framework. You will get the best outcomes by involving industry along the way. All of those things aside and despite the assurances given, it was still thought to be beneficial to the trans­parency of the operation of the scheme for other stakeholders to have the opportunity to have input about the priorities and, for the certainty of industry, that within the legislation there was a framework for input and prioritising and that that framework ensured that there was some public awareness of it.


The amendments moved by Senator Ludlam to establish the Product Stewardship Advisory Group provide for a structure for that input, for advice to the minister and to the council and for prioritisation. The amendments to be moved by Senator Ludlam shortly require the publishing of products that are being considered for accreditation or regulation under the act. They tie in with this and will ensure that there is public awareness and certainty for all parties. Again, I express my thanks to the other parties for the cooperative approach in addressing the concerns that the Senate committee identified and indicate the coalition's support for these amendments.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-06-15,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:07):  Before we move on, I want to put to the minister a question around an issue that I raised earlier, which is whether he considers the establishment of this advisory group as providing a mechanism for doing a couple of things: firstly, having the expert views in the room and, secondly, publishing lists of particular products or categories of waste that might soon fall under the scheme. As has been made very clear, we have three different ways of regulating different kinds of waste: voluntary schemes, where the industry goes ahead and sets up its own scheme, of which I guess the MobileMuster is an example; the co-regulatory scheme, where we see the industry working with government to establish a scheme that it can then be held to; and mandatory schemes—for example, with very hazardous materials where you do not want things left to chance.


In the broadest conception of this, if we get it right the first time and there is all the goodwill at the table and industry comes to the party and so on, the right products will be put in the right one of those three categories and all of a sudden, within a couple of years, we will see dramatic reductions in landfill; we will see dramatic increases in resource recovery and efficiency of recycling; we will see a huge reduction, for example, in greenhouse gas emissions from landfill as organic material is removed; and the scheme will be working as intended. My question to the minister is: at what point will assess­ments be made as to whether the targets for the various product streams—let us take the example of mobile phones—have failed to be met or are not strong enough in the first place and we still have huge volumes of material just heading out to landfill or being thrown away? What will the process be for re-evaluation of whether something should go from voluntary to co-reg or from co-reg to mandatory? What will be the levers that will drive take-up of higher recycling? What will be the penalties, for example, for missing a particular target? How does the minister envisage the advisory group driving those improvements in performance if, with a particular product or class of materials, we are still sitting here in five years time with, for example, five per cent recovery rates of mobile phones under a voluntary scheme? What will be the process of assessment whereby it is taken out of the voluntary space and, for example, we initiate a co-regulatory mechanism?

I have the greatest of confidence that with the amount of effort that we have put into this legislation, and the amount of time that you and the opposition have put into it, we have developed a program which will ensure that we move forward in the direction that you certainly want us to head in. I cannot predict the future, but I do have the greatest of confidence that we will progress in the area of recycling and the areas that you are concerned about as a result of this legislation. If it turns out that it does not work in the way in which we hope or expect then obviously we will look at that and relook at it. But I think the effort that all of the parties have put into getting to this point will result in this legislation working in the way that we intend it to work. Obviously if it does not then the issue is going to have to be revisited, but I have the greatest of confidence that this legislation will do exactly what we intend it to do.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:11):  The reason that I raise this issue is that it is good that the parliamentary secretary has this high degree of confidence that the system is going to work because there is goodwill—as we have seen, there is tripartisan consensus, in this chamber at least, that this is a scheme that needs to get up and go forward—but, when you say that the bill will act as intended, there are no targets; it is an empty framework. There are no levers, for example. I would seek to have the parliamentary secretary address speci­fically the issue that I asked about: what triggers or thresholds will be set, either legislatively or as part of the work of this advisory group, that would move a product category or product scheme from one tier to the next? At what point do we say a particular voluntary scheme is not working and needs to be tightened up? There is nothing in the bill—maybe you could point it out if I have missed it—that would require that kind of transition to a higher standard of performance if we are failing in one particular area.

The key inputs to the legislation, of course, are the advisory groups, the international agreements and the environment ministers council. If any one of those groups is of the view that the legislation is not working then of course it will raise that and we will deal with it on a case-by-case basis. We have the TV and computer program; that will be the first test. I am very confident that that will, particularly once we have written the regulations, demonstrate to the community that this legislation works. But there are processes by which organisations can raise any concerns about failing to meet the expectations of the legislation, and I am sure that that is what will happen.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (12:14):  Equally in the interests of time, I indicate that I addressed the primary substance of these amendments in my comments with regard to Senator Ludlam's amendment. These are comple­mentary to a number of the other things that we have done and particularly to the establishment of the advisory group. These amendments will provide for the publication of those materials that are being considered for accreditation or regulation under the act and in doing so will basically give industry and groups 12 months of forewarning that an issue is on the books and under considera­tion. The likelihood is the processes will end up taking much longer than that to get from beginning to end, but at least there is in a sense a minimum time frame in here, aside from special circumstances, that ensures there is some certainty and awareness. The coalition will be supporting the amendments.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Product Stewardship Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-06-15,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (12:15):  I will address some brief remarks to these amendments. I am a bit surprised that the minister did not see fit to at least briefly describe to the chamber what they actually do. There are a number here, and I am happy to address the issue of publication in advance. As Senator Birmingham has indi­cated, you would have to be not paying attention for a very long period of time to be caught out by the government's intention to regulate in one of these product stewardship schemes; these things I think are agreed well in advance. All the same, the Greens cer­tainly will not be opposing the listing in advance. That was one of the things that the committee recommended should happen to provide clarity. We would see that these amendments would work in concert with the creation of the advisory group, whereby, after the whole process has been gone through of setting priorities and hopefully establishing targets and at least implied consequences for failure to meet some of those targets, they would then make their way onto the proposed register to give everybody in the community and the industry clarity about where the process seeks to go. I do not think there is anything controversial about those amendments.


I should also acknowledge that the amendments the government is seeking to batch up here and move also affect the way that this legislation will interact with state and territory laws. As I said at the outset we know that, in the policy vacuum that effectively has been the Commonwealth response to waste management in recent decades, the states and territories have gone ahead and done their own thing in many areas. So one or two of the amendments that the government is seeking to pass here ensure, for example, that state laws that might be stronger or more effective than processes established at the Commonwealth level are not expunged or wiped out by the bill. The importance of this could be seen in the example of South Australia, where we have a container deposit scheme that is very much worth preserving.


The South Australian container deposit scheme has been operating since 1977 and it has been an inspiration for the rest of the country. We have seen that initiative now spread to the Northern Territory and, as I said earlier, Colleen Hartland MLC, my colleague in the Victorian parliament, is moving possibly as we speak to introduce a similar scheme in Victoria. In South Australia the service has expanded to include kerbside collection, expanded the range of containers to which deposits and refunds apply and increased the deposit to 10c. But that is a scheme that careless legislation by the Commonwealth could accidentally wipe out, if we were not careful.


South Australia now has a drink container recovery rate of over 80 per cent and there is a notable lack of litter on highways, on parks and on beaches. South Australians recycle over 1½ tonnes per person per year. The container deposit system in South Australia also benefits community organisations like scout groups that operate container collection depots. That is one of the areas where, again, we could accidentally do quite a bit of damage in here if we wipe out a scheme that has been operating successfully in South Australia. The collection depots that the Australian Greens seek in our national container deposit bill would be paid for by the operation of the scheme which would establish a network of neighbourhood recyc­ling places. While they would start out as being just for beverages they would end up being used to collect a great deal more. Scout groups in South Australia, for example, earn $9 million a year from that recycling activity, and 92 per cent of South Australians report a high level of support for their container deposit system.


Today in the Victorian parliament, as I said, Colleen Hartland MLC is reintroducing her bill for a 10c refundable deposit on drink bottles, cans and cartons in Victoria. In 2009 her private member's bill passed in Victoria's upper house, the Legislative Council, where it gained support from all opposition parties. The then government quite famously refused to debate the bill in the lower house, where they had an absolute majority. It is worth noting that the Victorian opposition MPs who supported her 10c deposit legislation in 2009 are now in government, so it will be very interesting to see the outcome now. What this means, of course, is that because of Commonwealth inaction in this space we now have developing a patchwork of different pieces of legislation. All of them, I suspect, will work very well, but nonetheless there will be different sets of regulations applying to industries differently in the states and territories when the Commonwealth could have taken a leadership position rather than simply burying the proposal for a national scheme.


In the Northern Territory, 10c deposit legislation passed unanimously. It did not end up getting party political; it ended up being the Northern Territory assembly versus the beverage industry, which was fascinating to watch. We do not seek to politicise these issues, as we have seen in the way this debate has been conducted today. What I would invite the minister to do, though, is address something that these amendments are silent on, and that is: what will happen when a Commonwealth scheme comes into effect? We know that it will not squash a state or territory scheme that is better, that it will operate at a Commonwealth level, and that is appropriate. But what will be the case where the Commonwealth brings in legislation that is better than a state or territory scheme? What will be the impacts when a product stewardship scheme introduced under this framework legislation conflicts with a state or territory scheme when the Commonwealth scheme might be an improvement? How will that actually work?

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2011-06-15,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (10:28):  It is a pleasure to speak on the Product Stewardship Bill 2011. This bill establishes a national framework to support voluntary co-regulatory and regulatory product stewardship and extended producer responsibility schemes to provide for the impacts of a product being responsibly managed both during and at the end of its life cycle. Through these measure it is hoped, including on this side of the chamber, that the environmental, health and safety impacts of products, particularly those impacts associated with the disposal of products, will be more effectively managed.


The commitment to establish this national framework, underpinned by the legislation before us today, was made by the govern­ment in its November 2009 National Waste Policy: Less Waste, More Resources statement. This National Waste Policy has been endorsed by all Australian governments at state and territory level, through both the Environmental Protection and Heritage Council at the time, in November 2009, and COAG in August 2010.


The coalition fully supports the principle of product stewardship being, as it is outlined in the National Waste Policy:


… the shared responsibility for reducing the environmental, health and safety footprint of manufactured goods and materials across the life cycle of a product.


The bill itself offers a subtly different definition from the National Waste Policy, namely that it is:


… an approach to reducing the environmental and other impacts of products by encouraging or requiring manufacturers, importers, distributors and other persons to take responsibility for those products. 


I know this has been a long work in progress and work that has involved certain sectors of industry along the way. I am well aware that some sectors of industry are particularly enthusiastic to see this legislation passed. I especially note the national TV and computer sectors, who have a proposed national TV and computer product steward­ship program that we would expect, from the advice that both industry and government gave us during the negotiation phase, to be one of the first out of the starting blocks. This program already has members representing 70 per cent of total imports of computer brands into Australia and 80 per cent of sales in Australia. The TV and computer scheme obviously is of particular importance as we move through the phases of the switch over from analog to digital signals and because of the increased volume of the already significant supply of electronic waste that those industries will generate.


Importantly, the coalition is particularly supportive of the bill providing for voluntary product stewardship schemes, as set out in part 2 of the bill. These sit alongside the requirements and opportunities for co-regulatory and mandatory product stewardship schemes outlined in the bill. Part 2 of the bill establishes a mechanism to encourage and recognise product steward­ship without the need to regulate and also to provide assurance to the community that any voluntary product stewardship scheme is operating to achieve its stated outcomes, and it authorises the use of product stewardship logos in connection with these arrangements.


The Global Product Stewardship Council, an independent, non-profit organisation dedicated to understanding and advancing the principles of product stewardship, says that in its experience, as reinforced by overseas participants in the International Product Stewardship Summit, Australia has had greater success with voluntary programs than many overseas jurisdictions have. It also says:


Stakeholders are more likely to collaborate on and effectively implement voluntary and/or regulatory approaches than where approaches are in unilaterally mandated.


And that:


Approaches requiring greater levels of regulation should be pursued only after market-based, voluntary and co-regulatory approaches have been clearly shown to be relatively ineffective in achieving desired outcomes.


These are principles that the coalition would support and would urge and expect the government to keep in mind during its application of the powers that this legislation provides for. We do expect that where industries are able to deliver effective voluntary schemes then that is exactly what all sides of politics in this country would like to see.


The peak body for Australia's lighting industry, Lighting Council Australia, have several months experience in administering their own voluntary product stewardship scheme. They say:


The industry ownership bestowed by a voluntary or co-regulatory approach should lead to better outcomes among industries prepared to assume such responsibility. To reduce costs on both industry and government, all efforts should be made to encourage voluntary rather than regulatory approaches. 


However, this bill does provide for all three—voluntary, co-regulatory and mandatory—schemes. There is a place for all three, particularly in terms of the capacity to bring in recalcitrant parts of industries to ensure that the bill has a universal effect. Under the bill, accreditation of voluntary schemes will be on a cost-recovery basis through a fee for service.


I will spend a moment addressing some of the concerns that have been highlighted during consideration of this legislation. A Senate inquiry was held, as is customary, and I thank those who participated in that inquiry: the witnesses; the committee staff, as always, for their detailed report; and my colleague Senator Fisher, who engaged particularly effectively in this inquiry to examine some of the issues and concerns that industry and other groups had. We heard a range of concerns, some of them relating to the consultation approach, some of them relating to the expected effectiveness of the scheme and some of them relating to the potential for industry to be roped in or surprised by its inclusion in the scheme.


In many ways, we heard extreme views—from those who feared that all industries may suddenly find themselves subject to a mandatory scheme, at one extreme, and those who believed that the legislation was ineffectual and would achieve absolutely nothing at the other extreme. Those two extremes perhaps suggest that there is a middle way, and the legislation maybe has found that middle way. Nonetheless there were specific concerns raised about a range of factors, in particular concerns about the criteria as well as industry concerns about an element of surprise that theoretically could exist for industries to be roped in under the scheme.


I am very pleased that we have been able to work through this legislation and issues such as the criteria. A range of amendments standing in the name of the government, the Greens and the opposition have been circulated in the chamber. These have been worked on in a collaborative manner. I thank Senator Ludlam and Senator Farrell for their work, as well as the officers of the department who have worked with Senator Farrell and all parties to ensure that we can come up with some sensible amendments that we hope go some way to appeasing some of the concerns. Importantly, the amendments that will be moved will provide for a new definition of the product stewardship criteria—a definition that is, I think, less open-ended than the definition provided for in the bill as it stands and that ensures that criteria, though I suspect still relatively easy to meet for industries that genuinely should be included in such a scheme, are at least a bit more of a hurdle to ensure that you could not come up with a scenario where almost any product of any industry could fit or meet the criteria as they were previously drafted.


We have also put in place some provisions that will ensure that there is a degree of forewarning about products that the government is looking at or considering. So the government will, under the amendments proposed, be publishing lists of products being considered for accreditation or regulation under the act. There will be a committee established—a review mech­anism—to ensure that industry and key players in this sector all have some degree of input. These are important changes that we believe will provide at least for a greater level of involvement and consultation and hopefully a stronger outcome of industry confidence and participation in this scheme.


As the government confirms in the explanatory memorandum for this bill, the product stewardship criteria are only one factor in determining whether regulations, co-regulatory or mandatory, can be made with respect to a class of products. There are two other considerations in addition to the criteria. One is that the bill requires that the minister be satisfied that making the regulations will further the objects of the act, and again that is a factor that has been reinforced time and again during discussions and deliberations of the committee and behind closed doors about how this bill will function.


Second, and I think particularly important, is the requirement—of which the government assures us throughout the explanatory memorandum and in the parliamentary secretary's second reading speech—that, as a matter of government policy, the usual regulatory impact assessment requirements would also apply. This is very important. This is not a factor that is detailed in the bill. It is, however, a factor that has been used time and again as reassurance. I would invite the parliamentary secretary, when he makes some remarks in this debate, again to provide that assurance from the government as to what will underpin that regulatory impact assessment process so that this debate has those issues clearly on the record, especially given that the website of the Office of Best Practice Regulation within the Department of Finance and Deregulation simply explains that a regulatory impact statement is required under the Australian government's requirements. That is one of those nice circular statements. We, of course, would just like, for the sake of conclusion in this debate, to ensure that the government's expectations and understanding of how that regulatory impact statement arrangement will work in this legislation are made clear so that all those who may be dealing with it in years to come have a clear record to refer back to in that regard.


Lastly, I just raise another matter that I invite the parliamentary secretary to respond to and that I have foreshadowed with him. Very late in the inquiry into this bill, the Senate committee received a late submission from the Law Council of Australia—the Intellectual Property Committee of its Business Law Section—concerning the creation of product stewardship logos under the voluntary product stewardship provisions. As the committee did not have an opportunity to consider in detail the issues raised but simply drew it to the government's attention, I would invite the parliamentary secretary to provide advice on how the government has considered that issue and what advice he has received from the Attorney-General's Department or others about its relevance.


In closing, I once again express my thanks to all parties for their cooperation on this and restate the coalition's commitment to this scheme, to the principle of product stewardship and, importantly, to our belief that wherever possible these should be schemes driven and owned by industry to make sure that they have genuine stewardship of their products throughout the life cycle.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-06-15,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (10:42):  I also rise to make some remarks on the Product Stewardship Bill 2011 on behalf of the Australian Greens. This is framework legislation that arises from COAG agreeing that the federal government and the states and territories should together establish a national framework to support voluntary, co-regulatory and mandatory product steward­ship and extended producer responsibility schemes to responsibly manage the enor­mous quantities of waste that Australians are generating. This national approach is the kind of policy infrastructure that is necessary to separate contaminating products and valuable products and massively reduce our landfill.


Facts and figures about how we currently handle our waste stream make the case as to why this measure is well and truly overdue. As I have said in committee hearings time and again, on this issue and on related issues that I will touch on, this is a policy portfolio for patient people. This really seems to have taken an inordinate amount of time to come to fruition, and I would like to congratulate the parliamentary secretary for steering us through these final phases, because this is genuinely well overdue. It is often very difficult to detect a sense of urgency amongst policymakers where waste is concerned, because of course historically it has been cheaper to simply dump our trash on a pile than to do something about the extraordinary waste of resources and, of course, the contamination at landfill sites, greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution and so on that result—the hidden costs of the enormous profligacy of our consumer society. So it is good to at last be able to say that we can detect the faint stirrings of urgency. Australia uses over 12 billion beverage containers a year, for example. Only about half of those are recycled. Most of the remainder wind up as litter or in landfill. More than four billion plastic bags are given out at supermarkets. Barely any of those are recycled. Four million tonnes of packaging is used and discarded every year. Australians accumulate 18 million used tyres every year. Approx­imately four million tyres are landfilled every year, despite each tyre containing recyclable quantities, up to 1½ kilograms, of steel, half a kilogram of textile and seven kilos of rubber. And instead of responsibly dealing with our tyres, roughly 11 million, or about 60 per cent of them, are exported to Vietnam and China, where they are recycled—if you could call it that—under appalling labour conditions with really quite harmful environmental and public health impacts. In a portfolio where the crossbenches and the opposition support the moves that the government is making, I might call Senator Birmingham's attention, before we go too much further down the track of celebrating the importance of the RIS process, to the fact that this is one instance where a regulatory impact statement was undertaken. Through a process of arcane number-crunching, the economists decided that it was not worth bothering setting up any kind of product stewardship framework for tyres, so now we dump them in countries in our region where they are burnt and 'recycled', with enormously harmful conse­quences for host populations. So I think we need to be extremely cautious before we simply hand over the kind of policy-making decisions we are elected to provide to people with spreadsheets who will just plug a formula in and then two years later a result will fall out that says, 'Don't bother.' That is what happened in the instance of tyres.


Mobile phones, of course, are another nightmare. We have about 24 million in circulation in Australia as at 30 June 2010 in the hands of 70 per cent, or thereabouts, of Australians. They get replaced very often. I am convinced somewhere within each mobile phone there is a piece of software that says, 'Just before the next model is due to hit the market, this one will start getting flaky and then drop dead.' Again, that is a part of our consumer society that we need to draw attention to. We are getting very used to just taking these devices on and then, 20 minutes after they have been released, we feel like we are falling off the back of the curve and we turf them, and they wind up in landfill. Eighteen months to two years is the speed of product turnover in mobile phone markets. There are about 16 million old handsets in cupboards and drawers in Australian homes. Each one of these phones contains substances that we could contemplate as either being extremely hazardous, such as cadmium, lead, nickel, mercury, lithium, arsenic, or being valuable, such as metals like gold, silver and copper and plastics that can be shredded and reused as well.


The MobileMuster is a voluntary scheme, and here again is one example of why we had better be careful before we simply assume that the best solution across the board is for industry to just take care of these things itself. I appreciate the efforts of the people behind the MobileMuster. They have got 3½ thousand collection points around Australia and people can recycle their mobile phones by post. But the fact is—and the minister might like to contradict this figure, but it is the figure I have—we have about a five per cent recovery rate in that voluntary scheme. That is another way of saying we have a 95 per cent non-recovery rate of phones that find themselves in landfill or just wind up in drawers for all time, not being recycled and that material lost to us.


From November 1998 to 30 June 2010, 724 tonnes, including five-and-a-bit million handsets and batteries, were junked. Quite a bit of that can be recycled from the old mobile phones. The nickel in the batteries can be recovered, as can the gold and silver in the circuit boards, and the handset housings and casings can be used to make fence posts, pallets and other things that we make with recycled plastics. I was interested to read in the MobileMuster annual report that one tonne of mobile phone circuit boards can yield the same amount of precious metals as 110 tonnes of gold ore or 123 tonnes of silver-bearing ore and 11 tonnes of copper sulphide ore. So these things are valuable and we need somehow to figure out how to recover that material, and this obviously goes further than just what happens at the end of life. We need to look at the design and manufacture of these devices in the first place so that they are designed to be more easily disassembled. As one of the witnesses to the committee said, even if all the mobile phones that are being stored came out for recycling, MobileMuster does not have the infrastructure to take hold of those and recycle them. I will return to this as an interesting example where the industry has taken on itself to try and do the right thing, but it has not been sufficient, you would say, to actually come to grips with the overall scale of the problem.


Where there is better news is in the area of televisions, computers and so on, involving Product Stewardship Australia and the Australian Information Industry Association, which Senator Birmingham touched on. There we have industry peak bodies that have taken the lead based, I understand, on moves overseas. We are in a global market here and other countries are moving ahead. This is one quite clear-cut example where you can say industry has led from the front in requesting that the government take on and regulate for the entire industry so that people who want to do the right thing are not being competitively disadvantaged by free-riders. It looks as though we are in the process of getting that one right. There were 16.8 million televisions, computers and peripherals that died in 2008. Eighty per cent of those went to landfill; about 10 per cent were recycled. As the digital switchover occurs, as the NBN rolls out, and we know we are undergoing an enormous face of technological innovation in Australia at the moment, that pile of electronic or e-waste is only going to grow into a mountain. That is why it is good to notice that a focus on TVs and computers is welcome as the first scheme, otherwise we would be debating effectively empty legislation—a container bill with nothing in it. But we know that we do have an example of how this framework legislation will be used, and that is welcome.


If we do not get going with that properly, e-waste in Australian landfill will triple by 2020 and be close to 700 million items. That is an extraordinary waste of this material that we all know can be quite transitory as product cycles accelerate. As it is, there are 18 million TVs and 70 million computers and peripherals in landfill or on their way to landfill. These constitute about 38 per cent of current e-waste items in landfill. We know that we need to deal with items like fluorescent tubes, some of which contain mercury, and items like batteries that find their way into landfill and then pose enormous problems with water contam­ination as water percolates through the landfill piles and into local watertables. There is a good news story here about how many jobs, for example, would be created if we dealt responsibly with our waste. The Boomerang Alliance stated that a national recycling scheme for all e-waste would create 5,100 new jobs by 2015. That includes 1,440 direct jobs in the recycling of e-waste and another 3,660 indirect jobs. As Senators will know, I have been pushing for quite some time for a national container deposit scheme to handle the 12 billion beverage containers that are used in this country. If we put monetary value on those containers, we would see many fewer of them end up in our waterways, parks and bushland. So, just as we propose to tax carbon emissions so that the market suddenly sees a price signal on something that we do not want to throw away, we would be placing a tiny premium on the beverage container to give them an economic value. That, in effect, would reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by nearly one million tonnes of CO2 per year. That is the equivalent of switching 135,000 homes to 100 per cent renewable energy. All that is based on is the 50-odd per cent of beverage containers that at the moment find their way into streams, the side of the road and landfill, the stuff that we buy, use and discard when we are away from home where recycling rates are obviously very poor. It is about bringing those into the system and recovering those materials—a million tonnes of CO2 per year.


It would save enough water to perman­ently supply more than 30,000 Australian homes. Because we would no longer be discarding the stuff, we would be getting those materials back. It would deliver air quality improvements equivalent to taking 56,000 cars off the road and create approximately 1,000 direct jobs. Our bev­erage containers made up, we are aware, of about 60 per cent of all glass items, 47 per cent of metal items and about a third of plastic items during the 2010 Clean Up Australia Day. Nine out of the top 10 items collected on that day were packaging materials which made up about 80 per cent of all waste collected. This is a huge volume of material at the moment simply going to waste.


There is broad, consistent and very high support in the community for a container deposit scheme. There is a demonstrated willingness to pay. The study was done twice, and now we are buried in the swamp of a regulatory impact statement process being undertaken by the Commonwealth on container deposits that simply has this proposal buried in quicksand. It is not good enough. At best, we think this could result in a scheme being implemented in four years time. Thanks to this analysis paralysis, we have to get faster and better and develop a sense of urgency when something is so obviously a good idea. For every 12 months that we drag our heels on this, another 12 billion beverage containers are used.


On 25 January this year, Northern Territory Chief Minister Paul Henderson put out a blazing press statement calling on the beverage industry to stop their misleading campaign against the cash for containers legislation. It is one of the sharpest pieces of language I think I have ever seen come out of a Premier's or Chief Minister's office where he said that the beverage industry should simply stop wasting its money on deceptive advertising to stop it. How different the situation is when we have got the industry peaks in the case of e-waste, computers and TVs backing a scheme and demanding coherent legislation for their sector and so of course things are moving. The case of the beverage industry could not be in starker contrast where they have dug their heels in and progress has been painfully slow because of the deceptive conduct of the beverage and packaging industries. I still do not completely understand why the hostility is so stark.


I have put these figures on the record to make the point that national approaches to our national waste crisis are very much needed. We have historically had a very weak response to this issue in Australia. We have got litter campaigns which are valuable: they marshal volunteers and get people out to pick material up. We have got industry-led voluntary programs that are limited in extent and need some kind of coherent framework and approach.


The main industry government program is of course the Australian Packaging Covenant, which sounds great but it does not really deliver as much as industry seems to think, despite what we continually hear about in the course of various pieces of committee work that have contributed to this debate. We acknowledge the benefits of the APC, but I do not think they are as great as some in industry believe that they are.


We still have very serious concerns at the extent to which voluntary schemes are emphasised at the expense of mandatory schemes in this bill. I know there is some kind of reflexive opposition on the coalition side to forms of mandatory regulation where a voluntary industry scheme might serve us better. We believe that the amendments that have been jointly negotiated between the Greens, the government and the opposition will sharpen the distinctions between the three kinds of schemes that this bill seeks to bring into force.


We know that if a voluntary program has sufficient resources and organisational capacity then infrastructure can be developed and the outcomes can be very strong. What this bill, I think, will do with a bit of goodwill—and I am happy if the minister wants to confirm this—is put some teeth into the voluntary schemes. Let's hear what the targets are and, if they are not being met, then let's review them and assess whether a scheme should maybe shift from being voluntary to co-regulatory. If a co-regulatory scheme is letting us down, then let's assess if those targets are failing to be met; let's move it up to a mandatory scheme.


Co-regulatory programs work when the industry wants them to, and I am very happy to give credit where it is due to the television and computer industry who obviously want to do something about their waste, as I say, driven by international imperatives to bring our extraordinary waste production under control.


We have worked with the government to ensure that the bill does not use federal powers to extinguish good state schemes. I would hate to see, for example, a defective container deposit scheme get up that squashed the good work that has been done in South Australia over the last 30 years or the initiative taken by the Northern Territory. We will be asking the government, when we drop into the committee stage, to clarify how that is going to work.


We have also worked constructively to address an issue that came up during the committee inquiry into the bill regarding the need for the minister to have some guidance and input from experts to help identify priorities and monitor progress and next steps. I think that is something that every single witness who came before the committee said should happen and I am glad that we have government and, I think, opposition support for those amendments by the Australian Greens to set the priorities. Such an advisory panel existed to guide the New South Wales product stewardship legislation. The independent committee in New South Wales was made up of experts, non-government organisations and industry reps. That was involved in establishing a list of priority products so that industry knew where the system was going and the prioritisation process was transparent for the community. That advice was offered on an ongoing basis.


We will also, when we get to the committee stage, make amendments to the objects clause of the bill that we think is very important, and I will discuss that shortly. I would like to thank the committee for its excellent and very useful report that provided a very useful distillation of the waste crisis in our country. We perhaps take our committee staff here for granted from time to time because of how regularly they astound us by their professionalism and efficiency but this report, I think, actually stands out. I would also like to thank the non-government organisations who work very hard in an, I suppose, unglamorous area of waste policy. It is work that is nonetheless extraordinarily important for the larger project of creating a genuinely sustainable Australia, for cleaning up our act, for cleaning up our fouled waterways, our parklands and our wilderness from rubbish and for recovering those valuable materials that go to waste.


I would also like to acknowledge my colleague in Victoria Colleen Hartland MLC, who I think today is reintroducing in the Victorian parliament her bill on container deposits because she shares the frustration of many people in this place that the Commonwealth has simply decided to bury a national container deposit scheme under endless reviews and analysis. Colleen my colleague in the Victorian parliament and her office have done an enormous amount of work in building support in Victoria for a state scheme. I still think that a national scheme is the right way to go and I suspect that industry would prefer a coherent set of regulations that applied across the country, but I really strongly commend Colleen Hartland MLC for bringing her bill forward to simply get on with the job of getting containers out of waterways and verges and into recycling centres where they belong.


One of the great benefits of a container deposit scheme is that it would mandate and fund the creation of a network of neighbourhood recycling centres. Once you get those up and running for beverage containers initially they become the drop-off point for batteries, fluorescent tubes and other objects that we might find intractable that simply end up in landfill.


I would again like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water, for the constructive way in which he has approached this bill. It is always good to get an exposure draft of a bill so that you can see where a particular area is headed. I would like to thank all sides for the constructive spirit in which negotiations were entered into for this bill. It is a rare bit of good news. I would like to see this, very strictly speaking, as the first step of many. This simply sets us up with a framework which will be free to succeed or fail depending on the amount of effort and energy that is put into it. I look forward to discussing some of these matters in greater detail in the committee stage and indicate that the Greens are happy to support the bill.

"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2011-06-15,"



Senator FISHER
 (South Australia) (11:02):  Now you would not necessarily know it from the title of the Product Stewardship Bill but, yes, this bill is largely about waste and largely about the management of it. So why have we wasted so much time in getting to this point? Why have we wasted so much time when the Howard government supported the concept of a national scheme to reduce the impact on the environment and on health and safety of products and substances during their life and then at the end of their life? The Howard government supported that principle and that concept yet it is some years upon years later that we finally find ourselves in this place in the noncontroversial section of the legislative consideration hopefully poised to give passage and implement such a scheme.


Why has it taken so long? Why have we wasted so long in working out what to do nationally with our waste when, for example, the television and computer industry, largely composed of manufacturers and importers wanting to do the right thing, has recognised that we still use TVs with hazardous substances in them and we need to take TVs and computers off the footpath and get them out of landfill? That industry is one that has been working for a long time towards an industry resourced national scheme. The unnecessary distress caused to that industry and its largely well-meaning and hardworking people, when it needs some legislative enablement to get its scheme up and running before the end of this year, because this government has left its run until the 11th hour is indeed regrettable.


We know that we are about to be at a happier place in terms of the bill. Thanks to the departmental officers, and Ms Kelly Pearce and Dr Wright in particular, for their constructive engagement with us as members of the opposition, under of course the fine tutelage of the Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water, Senator Farrell. Thank you for your consideration of our views but also those views of industry. Taking so long in the gestation of what to do with our waste, the government claimed it had extensively consulted with industry last year culminating in the putting out of the discussion paper, which the government tried to say resulted in a whole lot of submissions as the precursor to this bill. The problem is that the government dumped—talk about waste—this bill in the House of Reps in March this year without having the forethought, the preparedness to release an exposure draft of the bill. It dumped the bill on the House of Reps in March and then thankfully, it decided to refer it to a Senate committee for inquiry.


But having referred a bill of that sort to a Senate committee inquiry without the benefit of an exposure draft, the man in the street would not know what product stewardship is when it is at home. Most people would not know. The man in the street would not know it if he fell over it. So it was all very nice for us to get excited as members of the Senate committee and say, 'Whoopee, we are having an inquiry into this bill, so it will all be sorted.' The trouble is even some of the stakeholders involved in the process through government last year were caught unawares by the inquiry and indeed the relevance of this bill to them and their industries. Product stewardship has existed as a term, no doubt, in the industry, bureaucratic and probably government vernacular for quite some time but, as I say, the normal man or woman in the street would not know it if they fell over it. The Senate Environment and Communica­tions Legislation Committee inquiry heard from a range of witnesses, who did realise that product stewardship had some consequences for them and their respective industries. They drove home mainly two messages: firstly, that the criteria that a product or substance has to meet before being able to be subject to the voluntary co-regulatory or mandatory regime set up by the bill were so wide you could drive a truck through them—the department did a very brave job giving evidence and suggesting that the criteria were filters, but in my warped interpretation of the English language filters reduce things that come through the other end and the trouble with these criteria is they do none of that—and, secondly, the bill gives industry no practical place to start. It potentially says that every product and every substance under the sun—indeed, every product on the supermarket shelf, so said witnesses—is potentially subject to this bill. Those in industry want to do the right thing, but they know not where to start as the bill gives no suggestion—in the language of some witnesses, 'Pick the low-hanging fruit; please suggest where we might start.' It leaves industry swinging in a stewardship wasteland.


Thankfully, following the Senate inquiry, as I said, the government has taken quite some note of the Senate committee's report and that has resulted in discussions taking place. It also resulted, very importantly, in belated consultations with industry stake­holders including between the government and industry stakeholders. For example, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry became far more involved in consideration of the bill and was able to contribute constructively in where we find ourselves today.


In looking forward to supporting the bill and supporting a range of amendments that have been tabled and circulated, I also hope that the government will learn some lessons from this process. This should be and will be not only a bipartisan but a tripartisan or a quadruple-partisan policy. It is a good thing, but just because something sounds good does not mean that it will do good unless you make sure that you implement it the right way. That means—please, government, and please, Senator Farrell—that the message for your colleagues is explain things to the people, to the stakeholders, consult with the stakeholders and do as the Prime Minister says: let the damn sunshine in. We are all deprived of vitamin D these days, did you know? Let the sunlight in; do not leave it to the last minute to consult with those who could help you achieve a constructive outcome.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2011-06-15,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (11:10):  I thank all the contributors to this debate on the Product Stewardship Bill, particularly Senators Birmingham, Fisher and Ludlam. I noted the complimentary remarks from Senators Fisher and Ludlam, but really the credit should go to my staff and also to the people from the department, Diana Wright and Kelly Pearce, who have worked so hard to ensure that this legislation passes the parliament. It is reassuring that we have had such strong support and such strong cooperation from the opposition and the Greens so that we get a more effective and consistent approach to reducing the impact of products and hazardous substances in products on the environment and on human health.


Senator Birmingham raised a couple of issues, which I would like to specifically address. The first related to the regulatory impact statement. The bill sits within a strong governance framework that encourages consultation and evidence based decision making. Before any decision to regulate a product can be made, a regulatory impact analysis is required. As explained in paragraph 19 of the explanatory memoran­dum, this is both government and COAG policy. The regulatory impact analysis is a robust process that articulates the problems to be addressed. It assesses not only the economic but also the social and environ­mental benefits and costs in taking action to address a particular problem. There is no preconception that a particular solution like product stewardship is the best approach; a range of options is considered.


The impact analysis process typically involves significant consultation. For example, the television and computers con­sultation regulatory impact statement was released and public meetings were run—also a requirement to publish the results of this process. Once a decision to regulate is made, taking into account the impact analysis in section 17, the Legislative Instruments Act requires consultations on the regulation.


Senator Birmingham raised the letter that the Law Council sent to the committee. The letter raised the issue of use of the logo to support accreditation of voluntary schemes and, in particular, the interaction of the bill with the Trade Marks Act. In essence, the Law Council's concern was that the bill duplicates elements of the Trade Marks Act dealing with what are known as certification trademarks. These provisions in the Trade Marks Act allow, for example, a body like the Heart Foundation to register the Heart Foundation tick and certify that certain goods meet the Heart Foundation's standards. I have sought advice from my department and, through the department, from IP Australia on this matter. I am advised that the bill complements rather than duplicates the Trade Marks Act provisions. In fact, it is anticipated that the product stewardship logo would be required as a certification trademark under the Trade Marks Act, which I hope answers Senator Birmingham's question. Without any further discussion, I commend the bill to the Senate.


Question agreed to.

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-06-15,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (12:45):  Following eighteen months in the planning, on Friday, 13 May a delegation from members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade's Defence Subcommittee left Australia for the purpose of visiting Australian Defence Force personnel in areas of Afghanistan. I as chair, deputy chair Dr Dennis Jensen, the member for Tangney, Ms Gai Brodtmann, the member for Canberra, and Mr Stuart Robert, the member for Fadden, along with defence advisor Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Kenny, made up the delegation.


From the outset I held no preconceived views of the country, the security situation or our ADF personnel serving in the country. Notwithstanding that, based as it was on my previous involvement with the Defence Subcommittee and the parliamentary defence programs I have been involved in, my long­standing opinion of the professionalism and competence of our ADF personnel was only further enhanced.


The Saturday took us into Dubai and directly onto the Joint Task Force 633 Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates. The base is strategic to the supply and staging of operations into and out of Afghanistan for our ADF personnel. The role and importance of HQ JTF 633, which provides the national command of Australian forces deployed across the Middle East area of operations, is quickly understood once you receive the briefings which are supplied.


Throughout the day briefs, opportunities to meet our ADF personnel and basic training were provided to the delegation. This included training in improvised explosive device detection and an explana­tion both of the composition of the devices and of the improvised techniques used by the insurgents in making these insidious devices, which have taken the lives of so many of our young ADF personnel. These devices are made with the most basic of materials, and this left me astonished at how they could ever detonate. Despite that fact, these explosives have taken so many lives, such as that of our last brave digger, Sergeant Brett Wood, who was tragically killed seven days after we had been in Kandahar during a partnered, dismounted patrol by Provincial Response Company Uruzgan and Special Operations Task Group. During our briefing we were informed that one particular digger had stood on IEDs on two occasions without having them detonate.


Additionally, we were given the oppor­tunity to be provided with trauma first aid treatment using the latest techniques available to our troops in the battlefield. This included use of bandaging for critical upper body circumstances. All of us were provided with opportunities to fire the standard Steyr rifle on the base firing range, and before heading back to the main base for dinner we were measured up for our protective vests and helmets and introduced to commandos serving with the 2nd Commando Regiment personal security detail, who provided complete security for us while we were in Afghanistan.


The three- to three-and-a-half hour trip to Tarin Kowt, Oruzgan province, in the south of Afghanistan in the C130 Hercules provided a good opportunity both to see from the cockpit of the aircraft the environment we were entering and to talk to troops being dispatched to the province. The flight into Tarin Kowt provided the opportunity to see what have been determined to be 'green zones', in which the population irrigate their produce with the melting winter snows from the mountains and which provide a stark contrast with the surrounding desert land.


Landing on the recently provided sealed airstrip, which was built as a result of a commitment by the ISAF, the initial impression was that we could have been arriving at an airstrip anywhere in the world. The only indications of the reality that we were in a war zone were the many uniformed ADF personnel, being escorted from the flight while dressed in our vests and helmets and, of course, the many defence craft on the ground.


The visit to Tarin Kowt provided a unique opportunity to observe the success of our involvement in Afghanistan. In addition to the briefings provided throughout our short stay, the most telling examples of our success in the country were provided when we visited a patrol base in Mirabad valley, which is outside the wire. The flight there and back in two Black Hawk helicopters provided opportunities to see at first hand infrastructure building in the region, such as a new sealed road—which is opening up the region to areas in north-western Afghan­istan—and the new mosque, both of which were built as a result of our commitments.


Having arrived at the patrol base we witnessed mortar training and engagement on the ground, which involved both ADF personnel and the Afghan National Army. Having met the senior officers and a number of our troops, we were then summoned to a meeting with several local Afghan elders. In spite of the fact that the two parties required interpreters in order to communicate, the clear message from the elders was of the need for infrastructure rather than anything about safety. Additionally, the elders pro­vided overwhelming endorsement of our ADF officers and personnel, complimenting them on the excellent work that they had been achieving in the valley. No doubt feedback like this clearly demonstrates that our involvement in Afghanistan is winning the hearts and minds of these people.


HQ Combined Team Uruzgan, CT-U, has been achieving in the following areas. It has responsibility for mentoring and developing the Afghan 4th Brigade of 205th Corps. It has made significant progress in security since taking over from the Dutch. It has expanded security coverage from 18 patrol bases to 36 patrol bases. It has a strong relationship with a very effective provincial governor and provincial chief of police, which has lead to improved governance and development and thus improved security. It has had a very effective winter campaign—a mild winter has allowed successful operations during which CT-U has increased the area under ISAF and Afghan control and security. SOTG has been key to the winter gains, as they have taken 19 mid- and low-level Taliban leaders off the field. CT-U's focus for the 2011 fighting season is to hold onto what has been gained over winter.


Oruzgan is a difficult area for develop­ment projects due to its remoteness and the harshness of its terrain. It is the poorest province in Afghanistan, and its demo­graphics are really challenging. Across the province the literacy rate is 10 per cent overall and 0.2 per cent for women. School attendance is 20 per cent, whereas nationally it is 50 per cent. Thirty-seven per cent of children do not reach the age of five years, and typically 50 per cent of each village is under 18 years of age. During our stay in Kandahar we were able to visit the Rotary Wing Group, which provided for the operation of two CH-47D Chinook heli­copters supporting ISAF operations. Additionally, we were afforded briefings of the Heron detachment, which provides surveillance and intelligence in the country and the Kandahar Role 3 Hospital. Lieutenant Marcus Case, Australian Army Aviation Corps, who was killed on 30 May while serving on operations in Afghanistan, was from the Sydney based 6th Aviation Regiment and had been deployed to Afghanistan as a Heron unmanned aerial vehicle operator. The Chinook he was in was effectively destroyed in the crash; however, the five survivors, I understand, are being rehabilitated and are in a satisfactory condition.


Turning to Kabul: alongside the opportunities to meet some members of parliament from the government and the Australian Ambassador to Afghanistan, Paul Foley, seeing further work by the joint forces in training the Afghan National Army was a worthy experience. Parliamentarians we were fortunate to meet included Khalid Pashtoon, the Deputy Speaker of the Afghan parliament; Fawzia Koofi, chairwoman of the defence and territorial affairs standing committee; and Hasham Watanwal, representing Oruzgan province and deputy chair of the defence and territorial affairs standing committee.


Later the next day, before we left Kabul, we went up to another base to visit the Artillery Training Team Kabul, or ATT-K. The ATT-K was established by Lieutenant Colonel Richard Vagg in 2010 from scratch, and is now considered a model ANA school. The ATT-K is an Australian artillery-led coalition team, with nine nations providing personnel and equipment. The Australian Army provides 20 personnel to the team. The ATT-K mission is to facilitate the training, advice and mentoring of ANA field artillery soldiers and officers so that they become capable of sustaining a professional ANA field artillery independent of coalition support.


Key to training ANA members to become artillery soldiers and officers has been literacy. ATT-K has embedded literacy training throughout all of its courses, and that model is now being exported by NATO Training Mission Afghanistan to all other ANA schools. Soldiers arrive at basic artillery training without being able to read or write; by the end of their basic course they can do so to a grade 1 level, and each subsequent course will increase their level of literacy. I think the best example we saw whilst at the ATT-K base was an elderly Afghan solider—I would put him at around 53 or 54—who was reading, for the first time, to the rest of the class his writings from the whiteboard. Six weeks earlier he could not read or write at all. So once again, that just demonstrates our commitment and success in this country and this conflict.


Has there been progress in Afghanistan's development over the past nine years? Put simply, yes. There has been a dramatic increase in school enrolments, from around one million in 2001, none of whom were girls, to over six million today, one-third, or two million, of whom are girls. There has also been a significant increase in the availability of basic health services, which were available to less than 10 per cent of the population under the former Taliban regime but are now extended to around 85 per cent of the people. Further, there has been the identification and management of over 39,000 community based infrastructure projects, such as wells, clinics and roads, in over 22,000 communities across Afghan­istan, through the Afghan led National Solidarity Program. Almost 10,000 km of rural roads have been rehabilitated, sup­porting the employment of hundreds of thousands of local workers, through the National Rural Access Program. The telecommunications industry has created about 100,000 jobs since 2001, and 10 million Afghans today have access to telecommunications, compared to only 20,000 in 2001.


The ISAF has effectively, over the past Afghan winter, denied the Taliban its spiritual heartland in the south of the country. Notwithstanding that, General Krause has described the situation in Kandahar as not all milk and honey. But we have secured the area. He attributed this outcome to the mild winter, the poppy harvest being slightly later and Ramadan being earlier this year. The Afghan National Army stands at 159,400, with a projected growth to 171,600 by November 2011. Equally, the Afghan National Police has a strength of 125,000, with a target of 134,000 by November 2011. Literacy is a major obstacle, with 86 per cent of new ANA recruits totally illiterate and innumerate. At 31 March 2011, there were 70,000 ANSFpersonnel in literacy training, while 72,000 had already completed some degree of training. In the words of General Krause, 'Transition is no longer a dream; it is actually going to happen for the first provinces.'


I wish to thank the Deputy Commander JTF 633 Air Commodore Oddie; Commander CTU Colonel Jim Creighton from the US army; Officer Commanding Force Support Team and Camp Commandant Major Peake; Major General Michael Krause; Commander JTF 633 Major General Angus Campbell; all of the other officers and ADF personnel who provided us with detailed information and hospitality; and all DFAT, AusAID and AFP personnel. In particular, I wish to single out all of the highly dedicated and professional escort and personal security detachment who ensured our safety throughout the trip into Afghanistan. Additionally, we thank Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Kenny for his support.


The journey to Afghanistan has had a profound effect on me personally, deepening my strong empathy for our Australia Defence Force men and women. Compounding this experience was learning of the news, seven days following our visit to Kandahar, during a Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee estimates hearing, of the death of Sergeant Brett Wood, and then learning of the additional tragic deaths, of Lieutenant Marcus Case and Lance Corporal Andrew Jones a week following, and then, most recently, of Sapper Rowan Robinson.


To digress slightly, on the subject of our troops and what they are doing over there in the Middle East: it was only two Sundays ago, during a Building the Education Revolution event, not far from my home, that I had the opportunity to speak to one of our ADF personnel from Enoggera base. I think that, by that stage in that particular day, there were some results coming in from some survey where people were saying we should withdraw our troops. But he made the point to me—and it is a compelling argument—that we need to support our troops. We need to give them the confidence in the work they are trained to do in this country and the good work they are performing. I think that is a point that needs to be reflected on every time that argument comes up about withdrawing our troops. We also need to remind ourselves that the Taliban monitors the news that is being delivered around the globe about these matters. We do not need to give them ammunition to detract from and reduce confidence in the good work our troops are doing. In closing, may I sincerely pass on my deepest respect for those heroes who gave their lives. I give my condolences to their families and mates and to those injured in those terrible events, who were serving our country with such dignity and patriotism.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (14:00):  My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. Is the minister aware that as a direct result of his decision to suspend the export of cattle to Indonesia, within one month alone up to 150,000 head of stock will exceed body weight limits, making them ineligible for the Indonesian trade export while being too light for processing elsewhere in Australia?


Does he understand that this will leave graziers, including Indigenous land council managers, with no saleable cattle or income at the height of the winter growing season?

Has the minister taken into account while making his decision to suspend the live export trade that graziers may have no option but to turn hundreds of thousands of cattle out onto rangelands, with the resulting animal welfare disaster as feed runs out and the inevitable environmental catastrophe as the rangelands are destroyed?

Opposition senators interjecting—





Senator Conroy:
  We will just juice them up—




Senator LUDWIG:
  There is only one pat on the other side, and you take the hat on that.




The PRESIDENT:
  Let's just get down to the question. Ignore the interjections, both sides.




Senator LUDWIG:
  What I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted by those on the other side is that this government is working diligently to ensure that the trade can be put back into place whilst maintaining appropriate animal welfare outcomes. Those on the other side are all at sea in relation to this point. They do not know whether they want animal welfare outcomes to be upheld or not. What they are arguing for is simply that the trade should resume immediately without taking into account animal welfare outcomes. Those on this side of the chamber want to ensure that we can do both.


I do understand the impacts that are being felt across the Northern Territory and Western Australia. And to that end we have written to Meat and Livestock Australia to ensure that they can provide $5 million worth of compensation for that industry and to provide onshore assistance for feed and watering. Those on the other side are adopting—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  It is your decision, not theirs!




Senator Conroy:
  You don't know what you are talking about!




The PRESIDENT:
  The time for debating this is at the end of question time. If senators wish to do that then, they are most entitled to. Senator Ludwig, will you continue, please?




Senator LUDWIG:
  Of course, those on the other side simply want the trade to commence without the welfare of animals taken into account. What the other side says is that the government made the decision. That is correct: the government made the decision in the face of animal welfare abuse that no-one on the other side would say is acceptable practice. No-one on this side says it is acceptable practice.




Senator Brandis:
  Senator Back cares a lot more for the welfare of animals than you do!

In the meantime, exporters have indicated that they are seeking alternative markets for the cattle.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (14:05):  There are two parts, at least, to that question. One, of course, is that the opposition fail to appreciate—or are ignorant of it—that abattoirs which meet OIE standards in themselves are not sufficient. It is about ensuring that we do have in place a supply chain so that we can track, and also monitor and verify, from the point of leaving the port to the point of a feedlot in Indonesia, and to the point of the slaughterhouse in Indonesia so that there is not any leakage.



What those on the other side want to accept is that animal welfare would not be taken into account in their proposal of simply looking at an abattoir alone, because there would be leakage in the system. What those opposite are now saying, of course, is, 'Restart the trade without taking animal welfare considerations into account'. That is what the opposition are putting to the parliament today.

Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of answers given by the Minister for Small Business (Senator Sherry) and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Abetz) and Senators McGauran and Humphries today relating to the coal industry and a proposed carbon tax.


This debate about the government's proposed carbon tax is not about the need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. All major parties in this place agree, at least on the basis of risk management and minimisation, that action should be taken to reduce global emissions. The principle that is often termed the 'precautionary principle' is applied.


No, this debate is about whether the method proposed by the government, its carbon tax, which it went to the election promising it would not introduce, will actually achieve this reduction and at what cost to Australians. The fact is that even on the little that we currently know about what the Labor-Green government proposes for this carbon tax, it is not likely to reduce global emissions; in fact it may even increase global emissions. And it will come at great cost to Australians and Australians' jobs.


It is often said that Australia has the highest per capita emissions, and maybe that is the case. I think there is conflicting evidence out there as to who actually does have the highest emissions, but certainly we are amongst the highest emitters in the world on a per capita basis. That is primarily because we do not use nuclear power and because we have access to a huge, cheap and efficient coal resource, which we make good use of.


But what of this? How does this work into the global task of reducing emissions? If we start on the basis that we and others in the world should be able to maintain and even grow our standard of living, then we need to assume that we will on a global basis still need to produce and manufacture an equivalent amount of goods and services to that we manufacture now. So surely in doing that, in manufacturing that equivalent amount of goods and services, we should be doing it in the most efficient manner at a global level and in a way that will reduce global emissions, not increase them. As such, if we can produce a tonne of aluminium or concrete or steel in Australia with the lowest or near-lowest emissions in the world, then surely this is a good place to produce that even if it increases the emissions per Australian as it will decrease the emissions per person on the planet.


This is why we are arguing for a global solution to a global problem and not one where Australia solely takes the lead in a way that costs Australians and delivers nothing for the environment. Notions of leading may sound nice. They may even make some people sleep better at night and feel a little bit warm and fuzzy. But what must be the key in addressing the issue of global warming is that we impose a global solution. Imposing additional costs that make it uneconomic to produce goods and services in Australia, leading to carbon leakage, just makes no sense whatsoever. It does not fix the problem yet it will cost jobs in Australia and increase the cost of living. Even Senator Wong agrees with this. In a speech at an AiG luncheon on 6 February 2008, the then Australian climate change minister stated:


The introduction of a carbon price ahead of effective international action can lead to perverse incentives for such industries to relocate or source production offshore. There is no point in imposing a carbon price domestically which results in emissions and production transferring internationally for no environmental gain.


Over the past few years, we have seen a lot of independent modelling on the impacts of an ETS, and now a carbon tax, on specific industries. Almost all of these have highlighted that there would be thousands, if not tens of thousands, of jobs lost in those industries. Just in the last couple of days we have seen independent modelling released by the Australian Coal Association, to which Senator Sherry referred, looking at the impacts on their industry. It was conducted, I would note, independently by the ACIL Tasman modelling group. They found that carbon pricing could greatly reduce the expected boost to the economy from the resources boom as potential mines do not go ahead. That in itself is interesting because we have heard a lot about how this government will return the budget to surplus in 2013-14 based on conservatively high terms of trade. If the ACIL Tasman modelling is correct, the carbon tax will have a serious impact on any future boost to the economy from the resources boom from coal mines alone, which will upset the assumptions on terms of trade and will upset the likelihood of a surplus in a few years time. If that is correct just for the coal industry, imagine the impact it will have on industries economy wide.


The report estimates that between 22,700 and 31,020 man years of jobs will be forgone as a result of new projects not proceeding and that between $23 billion and $45 billion in export earnings will be forgone in the decade to 2021-22. They say:



Conservative estimates of employment losses from applying emissions pricing to potential new coal mining developments would be elimination of 25-37 per cent of potential new jobs.


Those are jobs that could have been created in this industry over that period of time. (Time expired)

Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (15:09):  I rise in response to opposition's motion to take note this afternoon in relation to the issue of carbon pricing and our position on climate change. I welcome some major and very distinguished people in Australia taking out full-page ads in papers around the country today calling on those opposite, the climate sceptics, to acknowledge that taking action on climate change is an imperative.



Senator Bernardi interjecting—




Senator CROSSIN:
  We continue to have the battles with the deniers and the sceptics, Senator Bernardi, sitting opposite us, who pretend that they do not need to do anything and that nothing has happened.


This government is committed to reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions as part of global action. There have been comments made about that over a number of weeks and months. Yesterday, the Prime Minister released some fact sheets to show that Australia is not alone here, that plenty of countries have policies and initiatives to take action on climate change. We have determined that the best way to achieve this is through putting a price on carbon, a price that will allow businesses to make decisions on how to best manage their emissions, including through investments in low-emission technologies, while meeting Australia's energy security needs.


The equation is very simple. A price on carbon will encourage large polluters and business to change the way they operate and to reduce their high-emission technologies. I note that the business sector more broadly remains supportive of a carbon price to reduce long-term investment uncertainty. So we do have businesses that are starting to get on board and want to be part of this debate, this discussion, this negotiation.


We recognise that the coal industry is a vital part of our economy. The vast majority of Australia's coal-mining industry is not emissions intensive and will not face materially increased costs under a carbon price. However, there are a small number of gassy underground mines that have high fugitive methane emissions, and they will face increased costs. They know that and we know that. That is why we are consulting closely with the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee on assistance measures for these coal-mining operations, including nego­tiating with them to come up with a way to deal with this. We remain committed to assuring the competitiveness of our mining sector through all of these negotiations.


I turn to the issues that Senator Bushby raised in terms of the ACIL Tasman report on coal-mining jobs. Certainly under a carbon price we expect to see strong growth in the economy, in jobs and in average incomes. We expect that that growth will be particularly strong in the resources sector. The latest capex numbers show that busin­esses are confidently investing in growing their operations. Based on ABARE's estimates, the total investment pipeline for coal alone was over $72 billion as at April 2011. The pipeline of investment for the broader resources sector reached a remarkable $430 billion in April. So many of our largest resources companies have made it clear that they support a price on carbon. Companies like Santos, Shell, BP, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton support a price on carbon. They are on board. It is a shame the people opposite are not. Those companies know that we need to reduce contribute pollution and want to be part of that solution and part of that dialogue. Putting a price on carbon is the cheapest and most effective way to do this, so many of these big investors have already built a carbon price into their investment plans. So what do we have before us? A bright future for sectors like coal and LNG. It is true that the carbon price will affect some operators, but we are working with industry on an assistance package that will manage that.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:14):  In hearing Senator Crossin's speech, and Senator Wong's statements earlier during question time, I am reminded of the great showman PT Barnum who said something like, 'You can fool all of the people some of the time, and some of the people all of the time.' Senator Crossin and Senator Wong are clearly part of that group that can be fooled all of the time. They are defending what this government cannot defend with any strength or temerity. The reason is this government was elected with a promise not to introduce a price on carbon and, more specifically, not to introduce a price on carbon dioxide—that odourless gas which we all expire when we talk and exhale. Senator Crossin will repeat the myths and the suggestions that carbon is pollution when actually we are talking about carbon dioxide. She will repeat the assurance that business wants certainty. Well, they had certainty at the last election when her Prime Minister promised not to introduce a price on carbon dioxide.


But that is conveniently forgotten in their self-perpetuating infliction of misery on the Australian people. Make no mistake, Mr Deputy President, the Australian people are struggling with cost-of-living pressures right now. They are worried about hanging onto their jobs and they are worried about how they are going to pay their electricity bills and their gas bills. They are worried about the cost of fruit and vegetables. They are worried about the cost of transport. And this government is only worried about taking more money out of Australian families' pockets. That is an absolute disgrace. The reason they are doing it is because they are sending this country broke, unfortunately quite rapidly with $50,000 million worth of additional debt to be incurred in the next 12 months alone. Many people will say that is the government living for today by mortgaging the future. This government does not care about that. I glance around this chamber now, look up in the gallery and see the future of Australia having a look at what is happening. The children up there do not realise that the myths being pedalled by this government are going to result in all of them paying much more tax for the next several decades. This is an appalling indictment on the management of Australia.


It is also dressed up in that cloak of environmentalism in which it says, 'We're going to save the planet from climate change or global warming.' And yet when pushed, when this government is asked how much this massive new tax, which is going to start at around $12 billion next year and grow every year after that in perpetuity, is going to change the temperature, it will not answer. It cannot answer. Even its self-appointed climate change spokesman, the man who has a reputation for creating more myths than anyone else in the country, is getting paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to peddle nonsense—even though it has been proved incorrect time and time again. So when it cannot answer the questions, when it will not provide the detail, when it is putting enor­mous pressure on Australian families simply through a self-indulgent reluctance to reduce its expenditure and to live within its means and to cut its cloth, like every family in this country does, we should be appalled. The Australian people should be appalled. Indeed they are, because most Australians today do not buy what this government is peddling. They do not buy it because there is no credibility attached to it.


The minister, Senator Wong, today in answering the questions is on the record as saying a carbon tax is less efficient, that it is not a silver bullet. She tried to put forward all of the same sort of rhetoric and nonsense once before in getting up her emissions trading scheme, which would have destroyed the economy and the country. Then she went off to Copenhagen, proclaimed it a great success, came back and ditched her policy. Why should we believe her now? It is the same Penny Wong who is lecturing us on fiscal conservatism and being responsible economic managers as she spends $50,000 million more of taxpayers' money than they are going to take. That is what this is all about: a government that cannot control its spending; it cannot control its tortured distortion of the truth in order to peddle its ideological and obsessive regime to indoctrinate and get itself involved in everyone's lives.


They want both of their hands in our pockets, and the Australian people cannot afford it. They cannot afford it and they cannot afford to put up with more of the myths and lies masquerading as policy that this government continues to generate. They should stand condemned, and the Australian people will render their verdict at the next election.

Senator MARK BISHOP

 (Western Australia) (15:19):  Sometimes in a debate you really do have to have someone who tries to avoid the hyperbole and the exaggeration and the political pointscoring and the Chicken Little statements that we have had from the two opposition speakers to date—someone who is prepared to address the issue at hand, the facts in a debate. Fortunately for the chamber, I am the person who is more than comfortable to address just the facts concerning the climate change issue and the carbon tax debate.


Let us go right back to the beginning, to basics. Some six or nine months ago, the Prime Minister made it quite clear that we were going to introduce a carbon tax. She made it quite clear at the time as to why we were seeking to introduce a carbon tax: to cut pollution and to drive investment in clean energy. She also made the point at the time, and has repeated it regularly since, as has the relevant minister, that there would be some modest cost impact through the imposition of the carbon tax. Of course, that modest cost impact will be paid by fewer than 1,000 of the companies that are the largest emitters in industry around the Commonwealth of Australia. So, yes, there was going to be a carbon tax. It was there to cut pollution and to drive investment in clean energy. It would have modest cost impacts, and those modest cost impacts would be paid by fewer than 1,000 of the largest emitters, the largest polluters, in this country.


We acknowledged at the outset that some industries would pass on all or part of that cost to consumers, and we also said at the outset that it would be terribly unfair that those who are least fortunate in our community, those who are least able to bear the cost, should wear that cost from that modest cost impact. That is why we said up-front that the cost impact would be modest and that there would be fair and generous assistance to households. The government made its position quite clear at the outset and time and time again the relevant minister has repeated that. We said that we would help pensioners and we would help low-income earners. But, more than that, it is not a revenue grab, a revenue take, a revenue steal, as Senator Bernardi constantly recited; 100 per cent of the revenue raised from this carbon tax will be returned to industry, to consumers or to those low-income house­holds around Australia—pensioners and low-income persons generally—who are least able to bear that price. Almost 3½ million maximum-rate and part-rate pensioners will receive assistance—assistance in addition to the normal indexation of their pension and their welfare entitlements—to compensate them for the burden that they will wear.


We say that the approach of the government will have the outcome that the carbon price, which is a price on emissions and pollution, will make dirty energy more expensive and clean energy, like the alternatives we have been talking about for some time—solar, wind and gas—cheaper. In that context, as I said, the tax is only going to fall on the largest 1,000 emitters in this country. Some of those emitters will have the ability to pass on the price increase—some in whole, some in part. But we are very concerned about where it is passed on. We have been concerned from the outset that it does not fall unfairly on those parts of the community least able to bear it. That is why we said up-front that there is going to be significant compensation to low-income families, there is going to be significant compensation to low-income households and there is going to be significant compensation to those who are on the pension—whether on a part pension or on a full pension. That is going to be done in addition, as I said before, to the normal indexation requirements that pensioners enjoy when their pension goes up on a regular basis.


We are about having a sustainable economy, efficient industries, growth in the economy, additional jobs, less pollution and less pollutants, and we are about having altered energy supplies and alternate energy firms— (Time expired)

Senator KROGER
 (Victoria) (15:25):  I rise also to address the answers that were given on the carbon tax by those on the government benches. It would be remiss of me not to note Senator Crossin's remarks in relation to the advertisements that carbon tax supporters are placing in papers around the country. She suggested that this was indica­tive of the tremendous support that the carbon tax has. To Senator Crossin, who I wish was in this chamber to hear this directly and had not left, I can only say: those who are advertising in those media outlets today must be some of the one-third left of Gillard supporters. We have seen Prime Minister Gillard's personal support plummet; it has crashed. They must be the last remaining few who still believe her and support her. There aren't many of them left.


I have to go back to Minister Wong's remarks during question time when she suggested that those on this side of the chamber were playing politics with this. What sort of hypocrisy is that? What gobsmacking hypocrisy! It is those in government, those on the government benches, who have been playing politics with this issue, because we did not have a carbon tax on the table until Prime Minister Gillard did a deal with the Leader of the Greens, Bob Brown, to form government.




The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:
  Order! You must refer to a senator by his proper title, Senator Kroger.




Senator KROGER:
  Thank you, Deputy President. I was getting very emotional with the magnitude of my concerns on this issue. It is because of the formal alliance that was declared. It was because of this coalition of Labor and the Greens that have formed government that we now are dealing with a carbon tax. So it is no wonder that the Australian public do not believe a word of what those on the government benches say. It is no wonder that they do not believe what the Prime Minister says. If I can quote the Prime Minister in a speech she made in the other place on 10 May 2005:




... the Labor Party is the party of truth telling. When we go out into the electorate and make promises, do you know what we would do in 
government: we would keep them.



I remind her of her election promises last year. The Prime Minister went on to say:




When we say them, we mean them. That is the difference between you and us. If I were minister for health in an elected government, it would be my duty to implement lock, stock and barrel—word for word—exactly what we had promised in the election cam
paign. That is your obligation.



So said Julia Gillard, the then minister. I say to her: what happened to her election promise that there would be no carbon tax under any government that she led? That promise went up in smoke when she formed an alliance with the Greens. That is what happened to that promise. So the suggestion that the opposition are playing politics with this is total hypocrisy. It is the government that have been playing politics with it. We would not be considering a carbon tax today if they had not formed an alliance with the Greens.


This is something that goes to the very heart of the problems that the government are facing and that they are facing in the Labor Party as a party. We have had the senior elder statesman, Senator John Faulkner, as recently as today discussing the fact that the government are poll driven—their whole direction is based on pollster results. They have lost sight of what their membership want. They have lost sight of what their caucus want. We have the Socialist Left leader, Senator Doug Cameron, breaking out and wanting to exercise a public voice because he feels he has no voice in the caucus. It is those problems which are driving the fact that we have a government that is not only not listening to its own members, backbenchers or caucus: this government is not listening to the Australian public. The government only has to pick up a newspaper to see that.


This is an incredibly serious issue. It is one that is going to cost this country for a very long time, and we will do everything we can to ensure that that does not happen.

I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill.


Leave granted.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I table an explanatory memorandum and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



Live Animal Export (Slaughter) Prohibition Bill 2011


This bill will put an immediate end to the horrific treatment of Australian cattle in overseas abattoirs.


Since the ABC's Four Corners program, an episode aptly titled A Bloody Business, was aired two weeks ago my office has been inundated with emails and phone calls from constituents all over Australia who were appalled and outraged by the footage of Australian cattle being subjected to cruel treatment. Australians were horrified to see eye gouging, kicking, tail twisting or breaking, as well as cattle experiencing an average of 11 cuts to the throat, whilst conscious, with one animal suffering 33 cuts to its throat.


The very next day I, as the Australian Greens spokesperson for animal welfare, announced a two-pronged approach to ending live export, calling for the immediate suspension of export licences, followed by a legislated ban on live exports.


It took the minister days to announce a ban on exports to 11 identified abattoirs and days again still to announce a suspension of all cattle exports to Indonesia. The Australian Greens support the ban of exports to Indonesia. Indonesia has no domestic animal protection laws to enforce mandatory stunning or OIE guidelines, and enforcement of standards in over 4000 slaughter locations across Indonesia will be near impossible and very costly. Indonesia is already a signatory to the OIE and Australia has no power to make Indonesia comply with these guidelines. OIE guidelines are minimal standards for developing countries that allow practices that are illegal in Australia to take place.


As a Senator for Western Australia I have a particular interest in this industry. On average, 180,000 cattle are exported from WA to Indonesia from the WA ports of Broome, Fremantle, Geraldton and Wyndham. In 2010 a total of 170,555 cattle were exported to Indonesia from Western Australia. Already this year, 7,010 cattle have been exported to Indonesia.


That is why I have introduced this bill. The Live Animal Export (Slaughter) Prohibition Bill 2011 amends the Export Control Act 1982 to prohibit the export of live animals for slaughter. The bill provides definitions of livestock and livestock for slaughter to limit the application of the bill to livestock, as defined in section 3 of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 as cattle, calves, sheep, lambs, goats or other prescribed animals, that is intended to be exported and slaughtered overseas. The ban will be in place immediately, with no delay and no continued cruelty. My colleague, Adam Bandt MP, will be introducing the same bill in the House of Representatives in order to maintain pressure on the government to take swift action to end the trade.


The footage shown on Four Corners was provided by Animals Australia investigators who visited 10 abattoirs in four Indonesian cities in March 2011. The RSPCA then conducted a full scientific assessment of the evidence from this investigation.


6.4 million Australian cattle have been sent to these conditions in Indonesia over the last 20 years. The cattle travel from northern Australia to Indonesia in ships with 2,000-3,000 head capacity and the trip can take between 5-10 days, with between one and five animals dying during each shipment from injury, heat stress or pneumonia. Cattle are then feed-lotted in Indonesia for 90 days before being trucked to slaughter. Cattle in Australia are stunned prior to slaughter, including those cattle for the halal-certified export market, but in Indonesia less than 10% of cattle are stunned before having their throats cut, meaning the vast majority of cattle are fully conscious when their throat is cut.


The evidence collected by these two peak animal welfare organisations, Animals Australia and RSPCA, shows that the Mark I cattle restraint devices, which were commissioned under the Meat and Livestock Australia & Livecorp program, facilitate Australian cattle being subjected to cruel practices. The industry program installed 109 of these devices in Indonesia abattoirs since 2001 and was subsidised to the tune of $1.2 million in taxpayer funds. The restraints enable a method of slaughter that trips the animals onto their sides, allowing their throat to be cut. As Animals Australia and the RSPCA state ""footage shows terrified animals falling violently onto a sloping concrete slab and during the process of trying to get up crashing their heads and faces against the sharp edge of a concrete blood drain. The force of these blows has chipped away at the cement and has been known to break jaws"".


Serious questions need to be asked about the roles of organisations as Meat and Livestock Australia and LiveCorp. MLA has received $5 per head of cattle exported to address animal welfare issues–clearly that has not happened appropriately. The Australian Greens will be moving to have this issue examined by the Rural Affairs and Transport Committee to determine how it was allowed to eventuate.


With around 100 abattoirs in operation in Indonesia taking Australian cattle, the Four Corners program was not highlighting a one-off or an isolated incident. This is widespread, systemic and appalling mistreatment. Previous investigations by Animals Australia have shown equally cruel treatment of Australian animals, for example cattle in Egypt in 2006, sheep in Kuwait in 2010 and 2003, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman and Jordan in 2007. The evidence is mounting that no matter what animal or what country we export to we cannot guarantee that those Australian animals will be treated humanely at standards which Australians expect.


The sheer numbers of animals involved in this industry are astounding. Between 2008 – 2010 approximately 2,697,569 cattle were exported from Australia, in the same three years 10,751,169 sheep were exported and 254,798 goats.


The range of countries to which animals are exported is also vast. Sheep are exported from Fremantle, Portland and Port Adelaide to Kuwait, Jordan, Bahrain, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Israel, Lebanon, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. Breeder cattle are exported from Darwin, Fremantle and Broome to Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Jordan, Japan, Israel and Brunei. Goats are exported from Adelaide, Fremantle and Sydney to Malaysia, Singapore, Mauritius and Brunei.


Exporting Australian animals to the type of conditions we consistently witness is not acceptable. The Australian Greens propose that we need to be looking at how to improve and increase processing in Australia to support local producers and jobs. The community benefits of processing meat in Australia have been underestimated for too long and are being talked down by the live export industry. An ACIL Tasman report in 2009 found that the phasing out of live sheep exports would have a minimal impact of farmers. A 2010 report, commissioned by Australia's leading meat processors, found that live cattle exports compete with and undermine Australia's domestic beef industry leading to lost processing opportunities in Australia.


Processing animals in Australia protects them from inhumane treatment and ensures our laws and standards regarding animal welfare can be upheld.


By growing our meat export trade we can create more local jobs, support communities and maintain economic viability for producers. We should be investing in these economic opportunities rather than maintaining the live export trade which sees animals being treated so badly once they leave our shores.


The Australian Greens will continue to call for an immediate ban on all live exports until the cows, sheep and goats come home.


I commend this bill to the Senate.

Leave granted.




Senator BOB BROWN:
  I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.



The speech read as follows— 



Smoking is the number one preventable cause of death and disease in Australia, accounting for approximately 15,500 deaths per annum. Tobacco also has a massive social cost for Australia, calculated at over $30 billion per year even when the tobacco excise is taken into account. The revenue from tobacco tax does not come close to covering the social costs of tobacco use to our community.


Australia’s tobacco control achievements over the past decades have been substantial. Tobacco control measures have prevented a significant number of premature deaths, and saved far more in health and other costs than the amount spent on the measures themselves.


Such measures include restricting the advertising of tobacco products, increasing the excise on tobacco products and now the government’s plans to mandate plain packaging for all cigarettes sold in Australia by 1 July 2012, which the Greens support.


And yet we still allow tobacco companies to donate to political parties in Australia. In fact tobacco companies have a history of donating to major political parties. This practice is untenable and the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Tobacco Industry Donations) Bill 2011 seeks to remedy this situation by banning political donations from the tobacco industry.


The bill amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to:


make unlawful the receipt of a gift from manufacturers or wholesalers of tobacco products by political parties or candidates; and


introduce new offences related to this measure.


Currently the only legislation in Australia prohibiting political donations from tobacco companies is in New South Wales due to major reforms to the state’s political funding and disclosure legislation passed last year. The changes commenced on 1 January 2011 and reflect amendments proposed by the NSW Greens to include prohibitions on donations from a range of players, including tobacco industry business entities.


No other states or territories legislatively prohibit donations from tobacco companies.


The bill is an opportunity for the Com­monwealth parliament to take the lead and legislate to ban the insidious practice of tobacco companies trying to exert influence over our democratic decision making processes.


In 2004 the Australian Labor Party com­mendably stopped accepting donations from the tobacco industry. However, the Liberal and National parties continue to accept money from big tobacco. Between 2005 and 2010, the Liberals and Nationals received a combined total of over $1.4 million from the two major tobacco companies—British American and Philip Morris. By its own admission, British American Tobacco states that on the issue of political donations, 'such payments can only be made for the purpose of influencing the debate on issues.'


Notably, the Western Australian Premier, Colin Barnett, has stated that he does not support accepting donations from tobacco companies and that the state parliamentary Liberal Party also takes that position. Furthermore, individual federal Liberal MPs have stated their opposition to their party accepting donations from big tobacco, and are now publicly calling on their leader Mr Abbott to end this appalling practice.


Research published in 2008 in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health revealed that approximately 61.6 per cent of smokers and 78.4 per cent of non-smokers surveyed were against political parties accepting tobacco industry donations.


I commend Mr Shayne Neumann MP, member for Blair, for his motion in the House of Representatives on 30 May 2011 which in part calls on all members and political parties to immediately stop accepting political donations from tobacco companies.


It is Greens' policy that there should be public funding of elections to eliminate corporate funding, with the exception of small donations by individuals. Donations by tobacco companies are particularly insidious, peddling death. Public health is at risk if we continue to allow big tobacco to exert influence over our policy making.


Australia is leading the world by mandating plain packaging for all cigarettes. We can reinforce our leadership and bipartisan support in the area of tobacco control by banning political donations by tobacco companies and prioritising public health over the interests of big corporations and political parties.


I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (19:19):  Before I proceed to talk to you about the issue I have on adjournment tonight I want to put forward my best wishes to the retiring senators who spoke tonight, Senators Troeth, Barnett and Trood.


Senator Troeth led, with three other senators, a moment in this parliament. The issue of RU486 showed we can come together as a parliament across political barriers to debate the issues that divide parties. I was so very happy to be able to be involved in that debate, and also very happy to see the leadership that was given by Senator Troeth and, of course, Senators Moore, Nash and Stott-Despoja. It was an extraordinary experience, and I thank you, Senator Troeth.


And I have to say to Senator Barnett–with whom I do not normally have too many issues that we agree on–that if he had given that speech when I was here in the beginning I think I would have had a different perspective on him. And if he had told me that the Pollie Pedal took in chocolate factories, wineries and cheese factories I think I would have been there, even though my cycling days are long gone. I also look forward to receiving the pedometer that he said he will give to each of us, because certainly I do need to pick up my fitness rate.


Senator Trood has obviously been spoken of in glowing terms. Whilst I have not personally had much to do with Senator Trood in committee meetings we have had the occasional chat in the hallway, and I have always found him to be extraordinarily generous with his time and informative in the issues which he has been interested in. I thank all three senators for the time they have given to the Senate and I wish them well in their future endeavours. Tonight I would like to speak on mental health. 


As we strive to build a more inclusive community and a more inclusive workforce here in Australia, the reality is that people with mental illness still face a number of setbacks and challenges. Those who have experienced mental illness can often find it difficult to fully participate in our society, in study or in the workplace whilst also trying to maintain their mental health. With at least one in every five Australians each year experiencing mental illness, there is no doubt that all of us here in this chamber have at some time supported a friend or a family member or perhaps endured our own personal challenge with mental illness. Too often we focus on what is not being done to promote awareness of mental illness or to support those who have suffered from or are caring for those with mental illness.


That said, tonight I want to take this opportunity to share a few success stories in the area of mental health. I have had the privilege of attending a number of events associated with mental health services in Tasmania. At these events I have met with a range of inspirational people who are working hard to support those with mental illness in our community. I also have had the opportunity to meet with a number of people who have suffered from mental illness and who are now strong advocates for those with mental illness in our community. Many of these individuals have been willing to share their personal experiences—both the setbacks and the successes—as they continue to manage their mental health.


One such event I attended was the launch of the National Disability Coordination Officer Program booklet. The Tasmanian NDCO, in conjunction with the University of Tasmania, Tasmanian Polytechnic, Mental Health Council of Tasmania, Advocacy Tasmania, Wise Employment, CRS Australia and Choose Employment, developed a resource for graduates from university or a VET course with mental illness who are making the transition to employment. The resource is appropriately titled Mountain Climbing: a resource for tertiary graduates with lived experience of mental illness making the transition to employment and is the perfect way to describe the challenges faced by people who are trying to navigate their way through study and the workforce whilst maintaining their health. The resource chronicles personal triumphs and setbacks that a diverse range of jobseekers with mental illness have experienced in the pursuit of their careers. They also mythbust issues associated with mental illness.


I want to share just one of the many stories in the booklet. This is Ryan's story:


Ryan turned 51 in August. When he was a little kid something bad happened to him that he doesn't like talking about. The doctors called it trauma and now they say he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.


Ryan's had mental health issues all his life. He can count on one hand the years when his health has been plain sailing. But Ryan never gave in to his condition.


Over the years he built a strong support network made up of friends, family and counsellors. He spent time in hospitals in Tasmania and interstate.


He worked more jobs than he can count but never got a qualification. Finally this year, he completed a Certificate IV in Counselling and landed a job at a Job Network straightaway.


Even though he was really excited to be offered a role so quickly, Ryan found his anxiety build as the start date for the job drew nearer.


When his first day arrived, Ryan was a wreck. His hands were shaking and his thoughts were racing. He knew he couldn't go to work in that state so he contacted his own Disability Employment Services provider and asked for help. His case manager helped him calm down and asked if he'd disclosed his mental health issues when he applied for the job. Ryan said he had disclosed so his case manager simply called the workplace and told them what had happened. Ryan went to see his psychiatrist who changed his medication. Two weeks later he started at the job.


In reading through this resource, you appreciate the mountain climbing metaphor that both inspires hope and fosters a sense of achievement. For people managing their mental health, the experience really is like navigating a mountain range rather than just climbing to the top of one summit.


As Keith Mahar describes in the foreword of the booklet—Keith is a native, or rather a Canadian, but one who now lives in Tasmania; he made a very wise choice—climbing a mountain requires us to prepare to tackle the challenge. This preparation involves insight, skills, knowledge, the right equipment and the support of a good team. With the right resources and the right networks, we know that we can support and equip those jobseekers to succeed in their journey.


I have no doubt this resource will give graduates and jobseekers with a mental illness the confidence to navigate pathways through study and into the workforce and beyond. I know this resource is already making a difference to the lives of people who refuse to let their mental illness stop them from building a career, giving them the tools necessary to navigate their own journey both in Tasmania and around Australia. Whilst we have some way to go in terms of building a better system and improving the way we care for and support people with mental illness, it is also important to celebrate resources such as the Mountain climbing booklet as part of our progress so far. The Mountain climbing booklet is also a resource that I hope will help assist prospective employers to understand more about mental illness and how they may best be able to support employees with a mental illness.


That said, I am confident that there is a growing willingness amongst employers who foster a more inclusive workplace. At the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service Awards function in Tasmania earlier this year, I had the benefit of hearing a number of Tasmanian employers share their stories about taking on employees with mental illness. I was heartened that so many employers were committed to supporting people with a mental illness in their transition back to the workforce. Those employers truly understand the importance of an inclusive workplace and were more than willing to negotiate flexible conditions for employees who were struggling to balance their work and their mental health. For those employees that I met at the CRS function, I truly appreciate that for them having a job was not about getting paid; it was about feeling connected to the workplace and to the community. They were able to feel comfortable disclosing their mental illness at the outset, which means that managing their mental health and their work responsibility was far less stressful. What is more, their employers are in a better position to provide them with the support they need to continue to carry out their jobs and stay healthy.


The more we do in the community to build awareness of mental illness and break down the stigma, the more success stories I hope to hear.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2011-06-15,"



Senator Wong:
  The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:


Taxation Determination 2010/D9 is not a proposed measure. Taxation determinations do not alter the existing tax law, but rather set out the Commissioner of Taxation's interpretation of how the existing law works. In a determination, the Commissioner is simply expressing his view of the law enacted by Parliament and he applies accepted principles of statutory interpretation in doing so.


Determinations are not legally binding on taxpayers (that is, they do not create legal obligations under the tax law for them). Once finalised, they are only binding on the Commissioner. Their legal effect is to protect taxpayers who choose to follow the Commissioner's views expressed in them. Taxation determinations have no policy intent, and the government has no involvement in the issuing of taxation determinations. The Commissioner releases draft taxation determinations for public comment before finalising them.


Many taxation determinations are considered by the ATO's Public Rulings Panel. The Panel advises the Commissioner on the issues proposed to be dealt with in taxation rulings and determinations and is made up of senior ATO officers and external experts.


Taxation determinations do not have a revenue impact on the forward estimates because, as far as the law allows, the Commissioner interprets the law consistent with policy intent on which revenue estimates were based. However, they may have a compliance leverage impact by protecting the forward estimates to the extent that revenue is at risk from taxpayers not applying the law properly.


The ATO is therefore unable to provide an answer to questions (1), (2), (3), (5) (c), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10) and (11).


(4) Yes. This draft Determination addresses taxpayers' concerns by providing taxpayers with options to prevent a deemed dividend arising under Division 7A of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITAA 1936) (Division 7A) as a result of the operation of new section 109XI of ITAA 1936. The ATO also consulted closely with tax professional bodies to ensure the draft Determination issued quickly to avoid potential compliance costs for taxpayers.


(5) (a) Individuals, micro enterprises and small and medium enterprises may be affected by this Determination to the extent of the options available to them in relation to section 109XI. No specific industries will be affected.


(5) (b) The normal consultation process for determinations is being followed. The draft determination was published on www.ato.gov.au on 15 December 2010and public consultation closed on 4 February 2011. In addition, the ATO has consulted with representatives from peak professional bodies prior to issuing this draft Determination and has received submissions from tax practitioners.


(5) (d) No, apart from the consultation process mentioned in the answer to (5) (b).
