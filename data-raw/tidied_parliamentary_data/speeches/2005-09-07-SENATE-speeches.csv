"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-09-07,"—Yesterday, we were debating the question of whether this definition is appropriate for the ills that it is supposed to address. The minister remarked that, if the definition of building work caught up those that were not intended by it, there was the ability of the government to pass regulations which would remedy the problem. There is an issue with that. The minister indicated quite rightly that the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005 indicates that regulations may be passed which can exclude as well as include categories of persons and therefore would affect, subsequent to the legislation, those who might otherwise be covered or not be covered in the intended definition. The minister indicated, of course, that that was a remedy for someone caught up who should not be caught up. But the difficulty with the bill and the explanatory memorandum is that the regulation can also include additional people. So it goes both ways.
Minister, I want to ask you, therefore, with respect to that issue whether clause 78(3)(a) would permit the first regulations made under clause 5(3) to be expressed to take effect from 9 March 2005. Clause 5(3) permits the definition of ‘building work’ to include any activity that is prescribed by the regulations. Clause 36, which provides definitions for the purposes of clauses 38 and 41, includes the phrase ‘building work’. It is therefore possible that a regulation passed subsequent to this bill, expressed to take effect from 9 March 2005, may render a person or body liable to a civil penalty for conduct which not only was lawful at the time that it was engaged in but also had not been described by any bill put before the parliament as being potentially subject to a civil penalty. The reason I raise that is that the definition does not stand on its own in the legislation; it is specifically designed, in terms of the law, to be varied by regulation. I quite like the idea of it being there as a remedy but, if it includes others, you can see the potential difficulty we are in. Therefore, I would appreciate your comments on that issue.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-09-07,"—I think I see the point that Senator Murray is making in relation to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005. Yes, the legislation and the framework will allow it to cut both ways in relation to backdating to 9 March. We would not intend to use it in that way. In any event, as I understand it—and it has just been confirmed—these regulations would be disallowable by the parliament. I indicate that it would not be the government’s intention to use it in that way but, even if any future government were to get a rush of blood to its head in relation to that, it would be open for the parliament to disallow the regulation.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-09-07,"—I appreciate the assurance of the minister, and I hope that it has some binding effect on the department and the relevant minister. I assume the department will note it and convey that assurance to the minister for inclusion in the operating guidelines, because it is helpful. I just want to make some further remarks with respect to yesterday’s debate. I made some remarks about the outcomes of the royal commission and said I thought a disservice had been done by going for an industry specific regulator. Of course that does not reflect on the commissioner.
As the chamber knows, the Democrats have been strong supporters of royal commissions, including the Cole royal commission. We did not oppose it; we supported its establishment. We supported improvements—and so did the Labor Party—to the Royal Commissions Act at about the time of the HIH royal commission. Having supported that and having supported its establishment, it does not necessarily bind you to agree with all its findings and outcomes. Our view was that what it did find, which we thoroughly agreed with, was that more regulation and enforcement was necessary in the building and construction industry. However, we came to a view, as a result of a very intensive Senate committee inquiry and other input, that that would need the establishment of an independent national workplace relations regulator for all industries and for the enforcement of the law in all respects involving both employers and employees and with cross-fertilisation between the tax office and other offices which are affected by poor behaviour. So we have in-principle opposition to industry specific regulators, and that is a problem for us.
We included in our recommendations increasing penalty provisions under the Workplace Relations Act for all industries because they were exposed as being too weak. The chamber will recall that last year penalties were in fact increased by a factor of three. This bill proposes to increase them even more, and we do not quite see why that is necessary when the new penalty regime has not yet been tested. We initiated increased penalty provisions, which was a recommendation of the royal commission, and that occurred. The quantum, of course, was different to what the government were after. We also recommended the inclusion of whistleblower protection provisions in the Workplace Relations Act, which has occurred.
We believed there should be increased powers and capacity for the Industrial Relations Commission to make good-faith bargaining orders, to resolve disputes on their own merits and to make more determinations—in other words, we felt that it should be more active than it had been in ensuring that the act was as effective as it should be. We believed the Workplace Relations Act should enable genuine project agreements to be reached and certified for major projects. We thought legislating a definition of ‘employee’ in the act would improve matters. We believed that the Building Industry Taskforce should play a more active role in pursuing the underpayment of employee entitlements, breaches of awards and agreements, and other matters. In fact, we supported an increase in their powers. It was a passionate debate, but it clearly indicated that we wished to take stronger action to address problems identified by the royal commission.
We also thought that the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Workplace Relations Act should be amended to ensure that democratic control regarding donations remained with members of registered organisations and shareholders, that donations should be capped, that donations which have strings attached should be prohibited and that better disclosure requirements should be provided. You might say to yourself, ‘What has that got to do with this debate?’ Effectively, it is trying to curb any possible relationship between politics at the local, state and federal government levels and building industry matters. We also reaffirmed our belief that a national unitary industrial relations system would improve matters.
As a party we are not against change or reform, but right at the heart of our belief is simply the fact that the present laws that we have are not being properly enforced. We have been pleased to see, as a result of pressure by the Senate through its various committees, that ASIC has picked up its game on, for instance, phoenix companies. That is a direct result of the efforts of all parties and of the information that has come to us on this matter, particularly from people in the union movement and certain employer organisations. If you act to ensure that the Crimes Act is attended to, that the tax act is attended to, that the Corporations Law is abided by and that workplace relations law is properly regulated and enforced you can indeed address the issues which have been raised.
I will remind you again that the government has stated that it is proud of the work that it did on the wharves of this country. The fact is that that work was achieved under existing law. The changes and improvements to competition and productivity did not require changes to the existing law. It was a result of political will. It was controversial, yes—people have strong opinions about it, yes—but the existing law was used. Our great concern is that we are not using existing law well enough and that overkill is occurring. Take, for instance, the blue flu epidemic issue in Western Australia. If 200 workers do not turn up on a Monday morning and they have sick certificates from doctors, and those certificates have been wrongly achieved—they have been signed, say, by the same doctors or there has been a plan to do this—that is covered by existing law. That is a crime; that is fraud. The health authority can go after the doctors for giving people certificates which are untrue and allow them to claim Medicare on wrongful grounds. There are all sorts of ways to address this matter.
It is a crime to pretend to do something which is untrue. The existing law covers that. You do not need to change the law to have the Building Industry Taskforce go after it. If it is fraud, it is fraud. I am very concerned that industry specific law is going to be dramatically increased when we already have the available tools to address the wrongs and ills that the government see before them. In summary, my criticisms of the royal commission are that I felt that they did not attend enough to the tools that we already have in law and to the ability to change behaviour and performance through existing mechanisms. That is where my criticisms lie.
Coming back to the amendments before you, given that I am concerned about the reach of these new laws, it is obvious that I am concerned about the definitions. When you see that the AiG, the CPU, the TWU, I think, and other unions have all said that there is real danger with these definitions going through then you see that it can be remedied through regulation. Perhaps the regulations take time to come to the surface—these things do take time and you can see why there is a concern on our part to narrow the definition. We have not sought to rewrite a definition. We have included much of what the government proposes; it is not as if we have invented something new. We have just tried to narrow it down. I guess that the government is not going to change its mind on this matter but in conclusion I seek an assurance from the government that, if it finds that these definitions are not workable, reach too far or have unintended consequences from its perspective, it will move rapidly to remedy the matter.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2005-09-07,"—I want to make some comments in regard to these amendments and also to put a particular question to the minister that I would appreciate a response on. I commence by indicating that what has just been stated by Senator Murray is a very valid point. Whilst I have not always agreed with Senator Murray on some industrial relations legislation issues in the past, I think that the comments that he has made this morning and has made throughout this debate are very pertinent.
As he said, if there are problems in this industry then, as in any other industry, there are mechanisms available under existing legislation to deal with those problems. There is both the workplace relations legislation and other legislation, and he has pointed to some instances of potential fraud and so on. I remind the government and the minister that breaches of workplace relations legislation and industrial legislation occur constantly in this country. Indeed, unions are well aware of this, because they are constantly pursuing claims against employers for underpayment of wages and pursuing employers and companies to ensure that entitlements and other conditions of employment as specified in an award or agreement are adhered to.
I know from my own experience of 18 years as a union official that each year my own organisation, the Australian Workers Union, and indeed other unions, were instrumental in recovering millions of dollars in unpaid wages and entitlements. The union had lawyers constantly engaged in taking action in state and federal commissions to deal with these issues or going to the industrial registrar and asking them to take these issues up. If you know anything about the rural industries in this country, you know it is a fact that quite often employees would not be receiving their full entitlements. I could bring report after report, documentary evidence that this situation has occurred. Oftentimes we thought we were probably only scratching the surface in trying to ensure that employees, for instance, in an industry like the horse training industry were properly treated.
I will tell you something about the horse training industry where young kids are getting a start as stable hands. I have been made aware and have pursued in the past situations where some of those kids, instead of being paid their proper entitlements such as overtime, were given a meat pie and a bottle of Coke as the equivalent payment. We pursued cases against some of Australia’s leading horse trainers, people who were handling thoroughbred racing stock worth millions of dollars, who breached awards and treated their employees very badly. I am sad to say that I think that situation still exists in many respects in the industry today. Young people who, if they dared to say to their employer, ‘Boss, I think that I am entitled to be paid overtime or Saturday penalty rates for a race day,’ were threatened. Indeed, in some instances violence was taken out on them. They were taken out the back of the training shed or the stables and given a belting. That occurred and there have been documentary programs about it. We used existing laws to deal with those issues, and I think that is the point made by Senator Murray. His point is well put: if there are issues in this industry, the mechanisms already exist to take action, whether it be against unlawful action or breaches of awards or the law by employees, employers or registered organisations.
Health and safety is another example of where we see breaches of both industrial legislation and other legislation. As I said in a speech a couple of days ago on this bill, when young kids in this industry fall from high-rise building sites because of a lack of safety railing, to my mind that is the sort of serious—it could be said criminal—negligence that needs to be addressed. But nowhere did I really see any evidence of the $60 million royal commission wanting to even address that issue. I do not see it in this legislation either.
Yesterday Senator Marshall asked a question of the minister regarding the coverage of this legislation and its definitions of the building industry. He particularly asked the minister to give him some indication of the number of employees who could be affected. The minister responded with a dismissive approach and sought to draw an analogy to other legislation. He specifically referred to legislation for breathalysers. There was a bit of an exchange across the chamber. I do not want to spend too long on this, but I thought the minister’s response demonstrated a complete lack of understanding of the bill that he is taking through this chamber.
This bill, through its definitions clause, is specific. It targets a specific industry, specific groups of employees and employers, and it has exemptions in that clause—those occupations that are not intended to be caught up in clause 5 of the bill. Clause 5 says:
Definition of building work
(1) Subject to subsections (2), (3) and (4), building work means any of the following activities ...
It then lists them from (a) through to (d). I might say that many of them are descriptions that have appeared for many years in building and construction industry awards. I am very familiar with those words. Then the definition clause goes on to say ‘but does not include any of the following’. It talks about drilling for oil or natural gas, the extraction of minerals, including tunnelling, boring or constructing underground works, and makes specific reference to the domestic housing industry and single dwellings. So the legislation seeks to set up a specific application and to specify exemptions to its coverage.
The minister has said on the record that the regulations can be used to clarify the definition of building work. On Monday he said:
Importantly, the definition of ‘building work’ is able to be modified by regulations. Any non construction related activity that is inadvertently captured can be excluded from the operation of the act. Similarly, it will enable the addition of other categories of building work should the need arise.
A sort of catch-all power is to be available through regulations. Just as a straight point of law, that is a completely different position from breathalyser legislation. The breathalyser legislation applies at large. No-one is exempt from the application of the laws regarding driving under the influence and over the legal limits. So the minister’s attempt to compare breathalyser legislation with this legislation is a nonsensical proposition. The breathalyser legislation has application generally across the entire community. No-one is exempt. You run foul of that legislation, you breach that legislation, if you commit the relevant offence. But no-one is exempt from the jurisdiction of that legislation.
Here, this bill seeks to specify a discrete industry and sector of the work force. My concern is that this regulatory power that would be used to extend the definition of building work could create real problems, not just in the industry but also at law. During my years of involvement in industrial relations I can recall that there were at least six High Court cases dealing with the issue of defining the building industry, defining building operations or defining what was in connection with the building industry. They were cases that had to consider the definition of the civil construction or civil engineering industry as against the building industry. I was intimately involved in many of those cases. They arose over demarcation disputes between what was covered by building industry awards and what was not—whether it be in civil construction work or manufacturing work and so on.
So there is a history of law where these issues have been looked at and where decisions have been made on them. I would have thought that the government would have been aware of that history. I would have thought that they would not have drafted this legislation without having some regard to previous binding decisions of the High Court. If they had been doing their job, that is what they would have done. But I am concerned for two reasons: firstly, that this legislation seems to ignore all of that precedent; and, secondly, that this catch-all regulatory power to extend the definition is likely to become an issue for future litigation.
I have not had the opportunity to pursue this in detail but I would like the minister to advise this chamber how it is that that regulatory power that he referred to in his comments does not go beyond the legislative power in the act. In other words, how is it that the regulation will be able to extend this definition of building work in effect to infinity, to include anything? A second and related question is about local government work. Local councils, as we know, are engaged directly in a lot of work that could be described as building work: the construction of roads, community facilities, footpaths. I want the minister—I hope the minister is listening—to advise this chamber whether it would be possible for this legislation to apply to work directly performed by local government employees—(Time expired)

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-09-07,"—We are debating the definitions of building work, building agreement, building association and building certified agreement. What lies at the core, as I understand it, of the Democrats’ amendments and why Labor are supporting them is that these amendments go to the delineation of the application of this industry-specific legislation. We share the concerns of the Democrats and, I think, of some of the other members of the crossbench about creating industry-specific legislation to deal with a perceived problem. Whether or not you agree with the government about the extent of issues in the building industry—and there are differences of view about the extent of those problems and the cause of them—if you read the royal commission’s findings and do some analysis of the issues which are identified in the industry it becomes very clear that the primary issue, the primary problem, the primary failing is not in the drafting of the legislation which applies to the building industry and the various aspects of the legislation; the primary weakness is in the enforcement of existing law. That is a point that Senator Murray has made a number of times in the context of these debates: that if government agencies, the police and other regulatory, investigative and enforcement bodies enforced and applied the law more particularly or more effectively in the building industry that would deal with many of the problems which were identified by the royal commission. But, instead of dealing with that, what we have is a piece of legislation which is creating not only a new enforcement mechanism, which is a different argument, but a whole new set of penalties and prescription and regulation.
We on this side of the chamber have concerns about that. Where we differ with the Democrats is that we have concerns about creating an enforcement body specific to this industry. Those concerns, which I will speak about later, primarily revolve around this issue: we do not think it is appropriate for there to be within government this type of coercive power. We go back to the very basic principle of the separation of powers, the notion that the determination of existing rights and obligations and the enforcement of them should be a function separate from the executive. When we have a situation, as we do under this legislation and also under the codifying contempt legislation which preceded it and which this will supersede, of enforcement powers being drawn into the executive in this way, we have real concerns with that. There are times when the executive does have some enforcement powers, but we are talking here about coercive powers which are very substantial and are associated with significant penalties which, if this bill is passed by this chamber—as it looks like it will be—will be even more substantial than previously applied. We say it is not appropriate for those types of coercive powers, which have the capacity to interfere to that great an extent into the lives of individual Australians, to be drawn to the executive in the way that was constructed under the Building Industry Taskforce.
Leaving aside the issue of enforcement, I will turn specifically to the issue of the definitions that Senator Murray has moved and make some comment about the submissions that were put to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee inquiring into this bill. It is quite clear that unions and also some employer groups had significant concerns as to the extent of the ambit of the definitions in the bill. It is quite clear also from the evidence put by the department that it was a very conscious decision by government to draft the definitions in a way that gave quite a wide ambit to the application of this legislation. As anyone who has been around any sort of legal drafting or watched the application of laws in certain areas will know, when you draft a definition you may have things in your mind about what is included in it but it is often the case that things you do not think of end up being included in the definition. Our concern on this side of the chamber is that that is precisely what will happen if the existing definitions in this legislation which define its ambit are passed unamended.
I refer to a number of submissions to the committee. First, and perhaps most importantly from the government’s perspective, is that of the Australian Industry Group, who oppose the broad definition of ‘building work’. There were various bases on which they opposed it. Their concerns relate to the fact that there is the potential for this definition to intrude into what is normally regarded as the manufacturing sector. Perhaps the minister can address the question of whether or not the government has amended the legislation to take account of the AiG’s concern, or whether or not the views of what is Australia’s peak manufacturing industry body were taken into account when drafting this definition.
I also point to the submission by a number of unions, which the minister, given his view about trade unions, may well just simply disregard. But there was some cogent evidence put about the way in which the statutory definition proposed in the bill would apply to particular sectors. For example, the Rail, Tram and Bus Industry Union made the point that members involved in infrastructure maintenance work would potentially, in their view, be performing building work as part of the building and construction industry. These include persons working as fettlers, track repair machine operators, gang protectors, track inspectors and gangers. I would think, as the union put it, that most of those employees would have a hard time thinking of themselves as being part of the building and construction industry. The view the union put was that the current definition set out in the bill in fact would include them. That may not be correct; these issues are a matter of legal opinion. But I do not see in the minister’s answers in the debate or, frankly, in the submissions by the department in the context of this inquiry, the answer to the delineation questions that have been raised both by employer and employee groups.
In fact, DEWR gave advice to the committee as follows:
The definition is deliberately broad to ensure that application of the bill extends to the conduct of building workers, employers and organisations. The definition is appropriate to bring about the structural and cultural change the industry requires.
That is one of those tautological, circular definitions where you say, ‘A hat is a hat because it is a hat and we want it to be a hat.’ We have a situation where the government is saying, ‘We want a broad definition so that we get in building workers, employers and organisations’, and it has to be broad because it is ‘appropriate to bring about the structural and cultural change the industry requires’. It is not joining with the issue. The issue is one that arises specifically from Senator Murray’s amendments, and we look forward to the minister explaining very clearly why it is that a more precise, narrow or accurate definition of the building industry is inappropriate. I recall the minister at the outset of this debate making some comments about it but, with due respect to him, it did not seem to us on this side of the chamber that he answered the specificity of the issue raised by the Democrats.
A characteristic of this legislation is that wide definitions have been included so as to ensure the widest possible catchment for building work. Different definitions around industrial action and the statutory concept of unlawful industrial action are designed to make activity by employees in pursuit of their industrial interests more difficult. That is indisputable when you look at the terms of this legislation—it is indisputable that this legislation is about making it more difficult for employees and their unions to advance their industrial interests.
An example is the definition of building industrial action, and in particular the scope of the exemption for work being ceased for health and safety purposes. As Senator Forshaw has previously said, this is one of the most dangerous industries in Australia. The commercial building industry is a dangerous industry.

Senator Webber interjecting—

—My colleague Senator Webber, who is from Western Australia, points out that the mining industry is as well, and I concur with that. As the minister keeps reminding everybody, I worked for a short period as a legal and industrial officer for this union, and during that period there were times when we did have members die. We had members die on building sites and it is a very tragic thing to occur. Unfortunately, in Australia we still have situations where deaths occur far too often on building sites. One of the areas I worked in also was workers compensation. Despite the fact that the minister or the government members might pooh-pooh it and say, ‘It is all about people faking bad backs,’ I can tell you there are also a lot of injuries. There are a lot of people with injuries arising from building industry work. I recall one of the first members I acted for in relation to an industry accident. I noticed halfway through the interview that he did not have very many of the top parts of his fingers left. That was because he had been in a number of industrial accidents.
These are not easy industries to work in; these are industries which require high levels of safety, and in which there has been an improvement in safety over the years. Some of the organisations and movements that have been at the forefront of that are the trade unions. Yes, at times trade unions have stopped work on building sites in order to ensure the safety of their members. Certainly, when an accident happens, work is stopped to ensure that another person is not injured. I would think most Australians would think that is a pretty legitimate basis on which to stop work or take industrial action—that there is a prospect of injury, serious injury or even death.
There is an interesting difference between the exemption regarding health and safety concerns in the legislation being proposed in this bill and that in the Workplace Relations Act. Under this legislation building industrial action excludes action by an employee based on a reasonable concern about an imminent risk to his or her health or safety, provided that the employee did not unreasonably fail to comply with a direction to perform other work that was safe for the employee to perform.
This is an important exclusion—we should exclude from the ambit of unlawful industrial action circumstances whereby an employee refuses to work because it is unsafe. That is what this exemption is supposed to be about—enabling people to refuse to work if it is unsafe. What is interesting is that this exemption also exists in the Workplace Relations Act but it is wider. The government is saying that building employees only deserve a narrower exemption for health and safety concerns—and industrial action resulting from, or associated with, health and safety concerns—than employees in the wider work force. The Workplace Relations Act requires an employer to direct an employee to perform work that is safe and appropriate. The words ‘and appropriate’ are missing from this legislation before us. The Workplace Relations Act specifies work that is safe and appropriate for the employee to perform.
In a further change in this bill from the Workplace Relations Act, when a building employee seeks to rely on this exemption the onus is on the employee to prove that the action was based on a reasonable concern about an imminent risk to health and safety—that is in clause 36(1)(g). So the government is saying that building employees have lesser rights than employees in the general work force to refuse to work on the basis of a concern about health and safety. Not only that, the employee actually bears the legal onus of establishing that that was a reasonable position for them to be in; that they, in fact, had a reasonable concern about their health and safety. This is a far greater onus than applies to the general work force. What is the public policy argument for this in such a dangerous industry? (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-09-07,"—If I may make a brief response. In relation to this legislation, as with all legislation, the question a government should ask itself is, ‘What is the social evil that they want to overcome?’ Without going back into the breathalyser debate that we had last night, the social evil there was drink drivers. Here we are dealing with legislation trying to overcome the social evils—if I can use that term—that the royal commission found after 171 days of hearings. The issue is not about the number of people who may or may not be covered, but rather the conduct that should be covered by the legislation.
Suggestions were made by Senator Murray about the existing laws and why they are not good enough. I would simply refer to paragraph 13 on page 5 of the revised explanatory memorandum as being some of the reasoning and rationale for this specific legislation. We were then asked about the regulatory power. I think that was Senator Forshaw’s question. Section 5(3) of the bill clearly provides the power to vary the scope of the definition of building industry by regulation. The government is confident that the power to make such regulations is technically sound and will withstand any legal challenge.
Senator Wong asked questions about enforcement. The ABC commissioner will be an independent statutory officer who can investigate breaches of workplace relations laws, including agreements and awards, and bring proceedings to appropriate courts for determination. So there is no breach of the separation of power principles there. We were then asked about the definition of building work, as I understand it, and what our discussions were with the Australian Industry Group. An exposure draft of the bill was released in 2003 and comments were received from all sectors of the community, including the AiG, and their views were considered. The government’s primary concern was to ensure that those engaging in inappropriate conduct could not avoid our regulation. The facts are that this is an industry where the participants are well versed in evading their legal obligations by taking advantage of every loophole available.
The question was again raised by Senator Wong as to why we have the industry specific legislation. We have been through that a number of times, and it was as a result of the royal commission’s recommendations after 171 days of public hearings. Senator Wong also raised the issue of occupational health and safety in this industry. The evidence from the royal commission demonstrated that it was common for the unions to manipulate occupational health and safety issues, but industrial action based on a reasonable concern about an imminent risk to a person’s health or safety will not be unlawful. We have had a long and full debate about these amendments and I suggest that, other than if Senator Murray wants a brief right of reply, we move to a vote.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech

(4)    Clause 16, page 16 (line 22), after “commissioner”, insert “in accordance with the merit selection process specified in Section 15”.
I will speak briefly to these amendments. This is another of our principles that we try to get established in law and that is that appointments should be on merit. Government inevitably answer that they are and that their appointments are good ones. Often that is true; however, sometimes it is not true. More important than it not being true of course is the perception that surrounds the nature of appointments. It is particularly important for statutory appointments that there are the proper checks and balances.
These amendments of ours have been opposed by the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Labor Party 26 or 27 times. That is not going to stop us moving them, because times change and people move on and accept that better standards are necessary. I would hope that in due course, as with other accountability mechanisms, the government parties and the opposition party accept the necessity of this sort of approach. We think it is a principle that should be accepted to ensure that appointments to the governing organs or public authorities are based on merit and that the processes by which these appointments are made are transparent, accountable, open and honest. The Democrats think that an independent body should be given the responsibility of scrutinising government appointments against a set of established criteria.
We have not just invented this as one of our little fetishes or obsessions, although I confess freely to the Senate that it is an obsession. We looked at the United Kingdom experience after Lord Nolan headed the 1995 Nolan commission. He and his commission managed to persuade the United Kingdom government—which has the numbers always, it seems, in their system—to accept that appointments should not only be based on merit but should be based on merit according to set criteria. What this sought to do was to go some way to ending the perception of the privilege and patronage associated with government appointments.
Lord Nolan set out key principles to guide and inform the making of such appointments. These were that a minister should not be involved in an appointment where he or she has a financial or personal interest; ministers must act within the law, including the safeguards against discrimination on grounds of gender or race; all public appointments should be governed by the overriding principle of appointment on merit except in limited circumstances; political affiliation should not be a criterion for appointment; selections on merit should take account of the need to appoint boards that include a balance of skills and backgrounds; the basis on which members are appointed and how they are expected to fulfil their roles should be explicit; and the range of skills and backgrounds that are sought should be clearly specified. In response to the Nolan committee’s recommendation the United Kingdom government subsequently created the Office of Commissioner for Public Appointments, which has a similar level of independence from the government as the Auditor-General in the United Kingdom, to provide an effective avenue of external scrutiny.
The Democrats have used the Nolan committee’s recommendations in our amendments over the last five to six years because they are tried, tested, proven and work. Meritorious appointments are the essence of accountability. In making these remarks I put no reflection at all on the person or persons that the government may seek to appoint because in fact they might meet all the necessary criteria that I have outlined. But it is important that governments recognise that this issue of appointments on merits is a live issue in the community, is a live issue in public perception and sooner or later needs to be addressed in a better way than it is at present.
This is not a fault of the present government; it is a fault of all governments—state, territory and federal. It is an important issue of accountability which we need to keep pushing forward where the legislation is relevant, and this is a relevant matter. This is going to be a controversial body, it is likely to have a lot of focus and it may well be involved in highly visible public occurrences. It is very important that the person or persons who head it and lead it are seen to have been appointed on the criteria we have outlined, which in item (3) are spelt out:
... selection and appointment is to be made, including but not limited to:
(a)      merit;
(b)      independent scrutiny of appointments;
(c)      probity; and
(d)      openness and transparency.
I find it very difficult to understand why such an amendment would not meet with the approval of the Senate.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-09-07,"—I would be happy to hear what the minister had to say about that, but I also rise in support of these amendments. They are clearly very important amendments. One would find it very difficult to understand why the government could not accept such amendments if, in fact, they were trying to achieve what they publicly say they are trying to achieve—that is, a balanced approach and improvements in the building and construction industry. I do not believe what they have said publicly. I do not believe that what we have here today in this legislation is based on anything they have really put forward in this debate.
The government keeps coming back to the royal commission. The initiation of that process all that time ago demonstrates why we need such amendments—to ensure that appointments of this nature are done openly, transparently, independently and based on merit. The government always relies on the findings of the royal commission, but let us understand and recall when and how the royal commission was set up in the first place. It was 26 July 2001 when the government announced the establishment of a royal commission into the building and construction industry, to be headed by retired New South Wales Supreme Court judge Terence Cole.
As to the timing of the inquiry, it was a few months before the calling of a federal election. It was based on an 11-page letter from the then Employment Advocate—a letter that was based on accusations with no basis of proof to back them up; just simple allegations—that was requested to be written by the then minister for industrial relations. It was clearly a political stunt. They were going into an election with no issues. They were a government that had run out of ideas. What they wanted to have was an election based on union bashing. That was where they wanted to be. What actually happened in that period of time was that the Tampa came along. The government did not have to proceed with a union-bashing election campaign; they were able to have a race based election campaign. That is where the election took us at that point in time. But the royal commission went ahead anyway. Let me tell you what the Australian newspaper said at that time. The Australian clearly called it a political stunt, because it was a political stunt. The Australian Financial Review—

(Senator Troeth)—Order! Senator Marshall, I would ask you to relate your remarks to the amendments before the chair.
—Thank you, Madam Temporary Chairman, but I am clearly doing that. I am making the point that there is a need to have transparent, open and honest appointments to these bodies in order to give the process some credibility. The backdrop to all this legislation before us today—as has been said time and time again by the minister—is the royal commission. I think it is well in order for me to argue about the failed process and the political stunt of the royal commission which has got us to the point we are at today.
What did the Australian Financial Review editorialise at the time that the royal commission was established? It said that the royal commission inquiry was as much about propaganda and the political cycle as about policy. It was absolutely right. Time has moved on. We are now in 2005. They have had the royal commission. I sat through many of the royal commission hearings. I saw the way it was handled. I must say that I was appalled—and I am not a person with any legal background or training. We had a process where the newspapers reported what was going to be in the royal commission the next day. You got morning headlines before the royal commission started. You had the counsel for the prosecution, in effect—that is, the counsel representing the royal commission—getting up, making a statement for an hour or so and making all sorts of allegations, which just happened to be the same things that were reported in the morning’s newspapers, and then sitting down. For the rest of the day no evidence was led to those issues. No witnesses were called to back up the allegations that were made. It was simply a process of propaganda. That royal commission was as much about propaganda and pursuing the political agenda of this government as it was about anything else. It did royal commissions no justice whatsoever.
The minister talks about all of the days of hearings and how this government relies on the hearings. Allegations made time and time again against union officials and others and against individuals were made and left to stand. People were not allowed to challenge them. The people accused were not allowed to challenge them. What a lot of people forget is that royal commissions are not open court processes. They do not have the same judicial standing. Royal commissions are not bound by the rules of evidence; therefore, evidence that would normally be inadmissible in a court, such as hearsay evidence, can be received and used by a royal commission. It can be parroted by a royal commission and used in their findings, as it was in this royal commission. It can then be picked up time and time again by this government and put up as if there had been some formal judicial process and the evidence had been challenged, tested and found to be true. No such thing happens in royal commissions. The recommendations are an opinion of the commissioner.
What we put, and what I argue very strongly, is that, if we had had amendments and selection criteria similar in nature to what Senator Murray is moving in the amendments to this piece of legislation today, we would have had much more of a chance of having a fair, open and transparent process. That is why these amendments are crucial. If we are going to have a supposedly independent body—and we oppose that actually taking place to monitor this industry, but it looks like we are going to have it because the government now has unfettered power, having the numbers in this chamber as well—we ought to have the head of such a body open to a selection process that has some independence; is based on merit; and has probity, openness and transparency. They are some of the major criteria, as outlined in these amendments. They are important and worthwhile amendments.
Let us not be conned by the constant catchcry of this government that we can rely on the royal commission. We cannot rely on the royal commission. From my point of view, that was purely a political stunt, a witch-hunt and a propaganda exercise. It is really only the government that remains convinced that it was anything else. You do not hear a lot of people other than those in the government getting up and saying that this was the be-all and end-all and that everything that the royal commission said was appropriate.
Senator Murray has a slightly different position to me on that, but he did quite rightly make the point that, even though he supported the process of the royal commission, that does not automatically mean that people actually have to accept all of the commission’s recommendations. He obviously does not accept some of them, and the Australian Labor Party accepts even fewer of them.
Let us be clear about the backdrop of the royal commission. When this government totally rely on it, they simply hope that people forget about why it was set up in the first place. It was set up as a political stunt; as a witch-hunt on unions; and as a way to try to deliver their long held belief that there ought not be an organised labour movement in this country, because organised labour stands in the way of their mates making big bucks. That is what it really gets down to.
We heard Senator Johnston the other day attacking working people who had actually been successful—working people who had share portfolios and working people who had ownership in some businesses. From the government’s point of view that is not for the likes of us; that is not for the likes of working people. Working people have no right to shares. As far as the government are concerned, only the people they represent ought to have the ability to have share portfolios and have any wealth whatsoever. As I understand it, Senator Johnston was accusing one particular union official of having the gall to live in a suburb that was right next door to him. Obviously, that is a little bit too close for comfort. We cannot have the working class living too close to the elite lawyer class, which is well represented on the other side.
What it is all about is trying to destroy organised labour in this country. If you destroyed organised labour, what would it mean? It would mean there could be a free-for-all for employers. Then they would get the choice which the government champion so much. And the choice is to take it or leave it: you either want a job under the conditions that they will set for you or you leave it. That is not a choice that we accept. That is not a choice that is based on equity and fairness. That is not a choice that we in the Labor Party will ever accept. We will fight that sort of choice all the way.
They are an extreme government. We know they are an extreme government because they tell us so. They have an extreme agenda in industrial relations. They now have the majority in both houses of parliament and they intend to introduce these extreme measures. Why don’t they just say that? Why don’t they just be honest with the Australian people and tell us that that is their agenda, instead of trying to hide behind the idea that this process is somehow balanced and that there is enormous criminal activity going on in the building and construction industry?
We hear that point parroted time and time again: ‘The royal commission said there was criminal activity.’ The royal commission reported a long time ago now. How many prosecutions have there been as a result of the royal commission’s findings? Not one. If the industry was riddled with organised crime, intimidation and thuggery—all the things that they accuse the building industry of—then, after a royal commission that the government spent $69 million on and which produced secret volumes of findings that have been handed to every state department of public prosecutions, don’t you think that there would have been at least one prosecution?
This is an industry which they tell us makes up seven per cent of our economy. There are hundreds of thousands of employees in it. It has important flow-on effects for the economy. Don’t you think that, if any of their claims were even remotely true, there would have been at least one prosecution? But there has not even been one. It really makes their claims sound very hollow. Very little of what they say in this debate about industrial relations rings true. When you actually challenge some of the evidence put up, there is nothing behind it.
This is the rub; this is how they do it. They make allegations in this place. Other people repeat the allegations. Then other people repeat the allegations as if the allegations have been tested and proven. They convince themselves—there is no question of that—that they are true. But the reality is that there is no basis behind them; there is no truth behind them. They are an absolute con. This is how the government work. They are going to keep developing that con over and over again by saying the same things over and over again, because they believe that if they say them often enough, forcefully enough and passionately enough they will become true.
Minister, they will not become true. You do not have the evidence. You have some statements made by a royal commissioner who presided over a royal commission that was set up months before a federal election as a political stunt. That is all you have. I know you will fall back on it; I know you want to rely on it. But we on this side of the chamber know the truth about the industry and it is not as you portray it.
That is not to say—in case anyone gets the wrong impression—that the industry is perfect. We acknowledge that it is not. Anything that involves large numbers of people and businesses, very complicated structures and very complicated building techniques is never going to be perfect. There are always going to be some rogues in the industry—on all sides. No-one says it is pure. It is a rough and a tough industry. But it is not the basket case that this government talks about.
Last night we heard the minister starting to argue against his own legislation. He started to tell us that since the government came to power all the workers are happier. I think the quote was, ‘Workplaces are happier places. They are more efficient and more productive and they have higher pay.’ He talked about how the economy has been booming and how there is low unemployment. He was dressing it up. Given the size of the construction industry in our economy, why do we need all of this? What is the serious problem? There have been no prosecutions. We know there is a lot to be done. If the government wanted to concentrate on tax evasion—(Time expired)

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-09-07,"—I want to put on the record Labor’s view about Senator Murray’s amendments. We do not agree with the establishment of this body, but in general we believe governments have the right to appoint persons to appropriate statutory authorities. As I think Senator Murray said previously, we have voted against similar amendments. We acknowledge that. However, we have great concern about the objectivity of the proposed building and construction industry commission and the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner, and our concerns as to his or her objectivity are well grounded. They are based on our experience of the Building Industry Taskforce, their record to date, their practice and, as has been documented in the debate, what many observers would regard as a significant weighting towards investigating unions and employees and a significant underweighting in relation to the investigation of other aspects of noncompliance, such as breaches of awards, underpayment of wages and the like. So, in the context of our concerns regarding the Building Industry Taskforce, this legislation and the Building and Construction Commissioner, we will on this occasion be supporting Senator Murray’s amendments.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2005-09-07,"—The government will be opposing the Democrat amendments for the reasons that we have outlined numerous times in the past. Unlike the Labor Party, at least we are going to be consistent again. There is some certainty with this government. I will briefly put on the record the reasons why. First of all, the government does not support the proposed Democrat amendments in this tranche of amendments we are looking at.
We believe the first proposed amendment is unnecessary as the definition of ‘commissioner’ already includes ‘deputy commissioner’. The government do not support the second or third proposed amendments as they are unnecessary and inappropriate. The bill already requires that the nominee has suitable qualifications or experience and is of good character. That is set out in section 15(3) of the bill. Probity checks are routinely conducted by the department on significant appointments. As well as requiring nominees to be appropriately qualified and experienced, cabinet guidelines apply additional procedures to appointments concerning the relatives of ministers, members of parliament, ministerial staff, departmental secretaries and agency heads. Departmental reporting requirements also ensure openness and transparency.
We had a last minute flourish and an attack on the royal commission by Senator Marshall. I respond by saying that, if you have the proof, you do not need a royal commission. You get allegations or suggestions and, if you believe that they are serious enough, that is what motivates a royal commission to make findings in relation to the allegations that are made. I also indicate that it was not the role of the royal commission to prosecute offences. The work undertaken by the royal commission has informed the activities of a number of people, but I think mainly the Building Industry Taskforce. However, the commission had over 700 witnesses give evidence to it. It is hardly a conspiracy set up by the government when you have 700 witnesses detailing, chapter and verse, the culture of the building and construction industry.
I indicate that in the 23rd volume of the royal commission’s report there were 33 recommendations relating to the protection of workers’ entitlements. Why do we not hear that about the royal commission’s findings and that they were undoubtedly referred to and dealt with?
—Why don’t we see legislation about it? Where’s the legislation?
—Because I would assume that in those cases the vast majority of it was protected by existing law and had not been flushed out. Even with the union’s activities in looking after workers, the royal commission flushed out 33 extra cases, and that was of course to the benefit of workers. But, as I indicated, the Building Industry Taskforce took on the findings of the royal commission. Yes, Senator Marshall is right—did the royal commission prosecute anybody?
—I never said that. I said ‘resulting from’.
—Resulting from it we had the Building Industry Taskforce and, as at 16 August 2005, the task force has put a total of 29 matters before the court—15 are still before the court, 11 have been successfully prosecuted and only three have been unsuccessful. So we have a situation where the findings of the royal commission did inform the task force and certain prosecutions have been taken. As is the wont with prosecutions, some will fail and some will get up, but I think that is a fairly high success rate by anybody’s standard. As I have indicated, the amendments that are before us are opposed by the government.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2005-09-07,"—Once again the minister, maybe not deliberately, has tried to misrepresent me. What I was clearly identifying were the prosecutions resulting from the royal commission itself. They are not to be undertaken by the royal commission. It is about all this so-called evidence that the government claims is based on their decisions. All that information was passed on in the secret volumes to each state’s department of prosecutions, and there has not been a single prosecution arising out of that, and that is clearly what I said. If you want to talk about the Building Industry Taskforce, let us do so. Let us talk about a couple of things we should note about that particular body.
Let us look at a bit of their record and some of the statistics I have at my disposal on this. They are from the task force’s web site. Between 1 October 2002 and April 2005 the Building Industry Taskforce received 2,827 hotline inquiries. This was over a period of 942 days. Across Australia that equates to around three phone calls per day or around $8,631 per phone call, according to its budget. Remember that this is from 1 October 2002 to April 2005, with the backdrop of the task force’s budget—its total cost—of $24 million. Let us look at its cost-effectiveness for a moment as well. The task force has conducted 2,734 site visits in this time. That equates to around $8,925 per site visit. The task force claims to have conducted 115 investigations during this time. That equates to around $212,174 per investigation. Of these investigations, only 11 have actually been to court and have had resolution. That equates to around $2,218,181 per completed matter. A further 11 matters are still before the courts at the moment.
In total, only 22 matters have been to court at all. These have cost the taxpayer around $1,109,090 each. Penalties recovered through this process have ranged from $500 to $8,500. That gives you a measure of the sorts of things that the task force is actually prosecuting. From the successful prosecutions, fines have ranged from $500 to $8,500, so the final figure for total penalties recovered to date comes in at a grand $39,200—hardly a figure proving the government’s constant rhetoric that this is an industry dogged by illegal behaviour.
What do some of the courts say about this body? Justices in courts such as the Federal Court of Australia have made numerous comments and remarks in a number of cases about the operations of the Building Industry Taskforce. For instance, Justice Hughes in the case of Alfred v CFMEU described the task force as—and these are the justice’s words—a ‘shadowy group’. In the case of PG and LJ Smith Plant Hire v Lanskey Constructions in 2005, in which the Building Industry Taskforce was backing the applicants, Justice Wilcox remarked:
... the applicants’ case was beset with legal difficulties that would have required it to be dismissed in any event. Even on the view of the facts propounded by the applicants, their case was hopeless. It was instituted without reasonable cause.
And of course that is one of the cases the task force add into their statistics—cases that have been instituted without reasonable cause. In the decision in Pine v Seelite Windows and Doors Pty Ltd, Justice Finkelstein remarked:
In these circumstances this action is much ado about nothing. True it is that the laws of the land must be obeyed. It is also true that the Building Industry Taskforce is entitled to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the laws, for which it has some responsibility in enforcing, are complied with. As I have said, not every contravention of every law needs to be punished. Often a caution will suffice. But, as it has been decided that there should be an action, I must deal with it.
The judge went on to say:
Should I impose a penalty on the respondents? No harm has been done to anyone. The contravention was inadvertent. It is unlikely to occur again. The amount of wages involved is insignificant. In these circumstances it would be quite wrong to punish the respondents. Nothing would be achieved by the imposition of a pecuniary penalty. There is no need for a specific deterrent: it is simply not necessary. And if any penalty were imposed it would be so low that it could not act as a general deterrent.
Again, the point I am making is that these are the cases that the task force include in their statistics, the very small handful of statistics over the last few years from a body that has spent $24 million going around hunting for breaches of the Workplace Relations Act in an incredibly large industry across the country—an industry, according to this government, that is beset by lawlessness and criminal activity. Again, it just does not ring true.
As the justices have said in those cases—and I am not saying it is all cases—that add to the statistics in that very small handful of cases, they are trivial in nature and much ado about nothing. That is the extent we have got to. But it does not matter, because this government want to prosecute. They think they are on a good thing. They have got a propaganda machine going. They have invested $69 million in the royal commission. They have got an agenda waiting for working people in this country. It is not going to be a pretty agenda; it is going to be a very painful agenda. That is where they are going, but we will be arguing against it all the way. Based on what the minister said in his last contribution, I just wanted to put some of those things on the record, because the government’s claims and their rhetorical flourishes do not stand up to proper scrutiny. Unfortunately, given their new-found arrogance with their numbers in the Senate, although we will challenge them all the way, at the end of the day they will march on regardless.
Question negatived.

BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL) BILL 2005

Bill—by leave—taken as a whole.
Bill agreed to.
Bills reported without amendment; report adopted.",SENATE,<title>BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,0,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-09-07,"—I rise to speak on the motion moved by Senator Ellison. What Senator Ellison has moved today is a procedural motion to allow the Telstra legislation to be introduced. It is a motion for the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 to not apply to these bills, which then means that they can be considered during this sitting. What we saw yesterday was an abuse of the Senate by the government. What they did yesterday was to amend a reasonable motion to allow reasonable consideration of a government bill by a legislation committee to ensure that there was proper scrutiny of that legislation. They moved that amendment yesterday, which, as I have said, was an utter and complete abuse of the process and procedure of the committee.
That amendment yesterday also had a couple of barbs in it. Not content to destroy the processes and procedures of the committee once, the government did it a number of times within that amendment. What that amendment did was to ensure that not only would the scrutiny of the legislation be reduced to fewer than four days but also in reality there would be the ability to have only a one-day examination of it by a committee. It also said that the second reading debate would be started on the introduction of the legislation, at the time when senators would want to read the legislation to see what was contained within it. This motion seeks to ensure that the bills are introduced. The motion yesterday was trying to second-guess what was going to happen today, which also makes it completely inappropriate. I will come to what today’s motion does.
The amendment to yesterday’s motion means that the second reading debate will proceed after the exemption from the cut-off motion today and then the bills will be referred to a committee. The usual process, the usual procedure, in the Senate is that the second reading debate is held after a committee has reported so that senators can be informed by that committee report during the second reading debate. That procedure has been followed for years now. This government does not want to do that. This government wants to set its own agenda in a very short time frame to suit the exigencies of its own political imperatives. What the government seeks to do in this motion is to use the devices of the Senate to ensure that its way of proceeding with the legislation is dealt with.
The government has used the phrase ‘reasons for urgency’ in its statement on these bills. The statement says:
The bills are part of a package of measures relating to the further privatisation of the government’s remaining shareholding in Telstra and future proofing of telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote Australia.
Senator Joyce might want to read that more closely. I think that there, in that statement, is a falsehood told by this government—that is, that there will be future proofing of telecommunications services for regional, rural and remote Australia. It is very unlikely. But I will come to that debate during the substantive part of the bill.
The issue is that the passage of these bills is necessary to ensure that these measures are in place before 1 January 2006. So where is the urgency to start the second reading debate today, before the bills have gone to a committee, before the committee has been able to look at them, even within a reduced period? There is no urgency. A bill that is introduced into the parliament in this session can still be available for debate in November. These bills could still be available in November and completed before December—and certainly before 1 January 2006—even under the model that exists now. Senator Conroy’s motion yesterday gave a hint of an even better situation when he indicated that a reasonable basis would be to ensure that the committee stage went for at least one month, to allow for reasonable scrutiny of the bills. Thereafter, if the government were to speak to the opposition and ask to introduce the bills to be dealt with, I have no doubt that that would be given proper consideration by the relevant shadow minister.
But in this procedure the government has now sought to throw out the rule book and say: ‘We’re going to write the rule book each day. We’re not going to tell you in future what rules we might adhere to.’ What Minister Ellison needs to explain in his contribution to this debate is what rules he is going to obey in this place, what procedures he is going to adopt, which ones he is going to throw out because they do not suit him any longer or which ones he might decide he does not want to deal with from here on in. Without the rule book it is going to be Rafferty’s rules. Senator Ellison is going to make the rules up as he goes. We are going to have Rafferty’s rules apply in this place, because each time there is an impediment because of a rule the government is going to throw it out. Each time the government finds that a rule is inconvenient or inconsistent with its plans, or it is not happy with a rule, or a rule does not suit Senator Joyce, or a rule affects the government’s ability to have a matter dealt with or heard, it is going to bring in an amendment to throw it out or to get around it, to circumvent its operation, in order to ensure that the Senate will not be able to properly scrutinise or deal with legislation.
If it has not been apparent up until now, I make it clear that the opposition will not be supporting the exemption from the cut-off, because this is yet another attempt by this extreme government to force this legislation through without attracting too much public attention. What it wants to be able to do is slip it under the carpet and say, ‘We want this legislation and we want it now.’ This is just another example of this government trying to use its numbers in the chamber to take power away from the Senate and turn the Senate from a house of review into a sausage factory. That is what Minister Ellison would like it to be.
The cut-off was introduced to prevent exactly what is happening today, to prevent a government from doing what this government are doing now. Under the cut-off, a bill introduced by a minister or received from the House of Representatives is to be deferred until the next period of sittings unless it was first introduced in a previous period of sittings and is received by the Senate in the first two-thirds of the current period. What that means is that a process was available to this government, if they had got their house in order, to get the bill dealt with if it got it in before two-thirds of the current sittings had finished. But, no, they could not manage that. So what they have now said is: ‘We’ll exempt it from the cut-off. But what we will not do is explain fully why.’ They do not need this legislation until next year, so they could introduce it today and have it dealt with in the ordinary course of events in the next sitting period. Senator Brown, who might also want to contribute to this debate, might detect that on many occasions the opposition have agreed to an exemption from the cut-off, sometimes against his wishes. But, in those instances, there has been consultation, dialogue and an acceptance that the bill is urgent, and the government has been able to demonstrate that there is an urgency that requires that the bill be dealt with.
The opposition have always accepted the point that if there is a demonstrated urgency requirement and there has been consultation by the government, including with the minor parties, then there is a case that can be made. The opposition have always said that, in determining whether or not we will accede to a request for exemption from the cut-off, we will treat it on the principle that has been espoused in the Senate over many years—we will treat it on its merits. In this instance the government has not been able to make its case. It has not consulted widely on this. It has simply sought to punch the bill through using its numbers. It has not acceded to our view that the matter should be dealt with by a committee for a reasonable period of time to ensure that the debate can be informed during the second reading stage. What we have not agreed to unless really special circumstances permit, and only where there is agreement, is to have second reading speeches proceed whilst the committee stage is dealt with afterwards. The whole purpose of having a legislation committee looking into the bill is to have it inform the senators here so that they can contribute to the second reading debate, and if there are any recommendations that come out of that then they can inform the committee stage of debate in the Senate.
It is interesting to note what Senator Hill said in a speech in this place back in August 1993. Of course, at that time he was in opposition. He said:
This chamber was constantly frustrated by large numbers of bills being introduced at the end of a session and the chamber therefore not have the opportunity for proper deliberation of those bills. Former Senator Macklin, the Deputy Leader of the Democrats at the time, put to the Senate a cut-off date—it became known as the Macklin motion—a deadline, usually about a month out from the end of a sitting, where we said to the House of Representatives, ‘If you do not have to legislation before us by this date, it will not be considered by the Senate.’ The result was that the Government did get to the Senate by that date legislation it regarded as essential for passage within that particular parliamentary session.
Before the cut-off was introduced, the Senate was repeatedly plagued with end-of-sitting rushes of legislation which would see huge amounts of government bills being introduced or received. This would result in the legislation being passed with greater haste than during the earlier part of sittings, leaving inadequate time for proper consideration of the bills. In proposing the cut-off in 1993 Senator Hill said:
All that is being proposed in this motion today is the setting up of a structure that would enable both houses of this parliament a reasonable time to consider the government’s legislation.
Hollow words now, Senator Hill.
This bill is being introduced in the Senate today at the very same time that the government asks for the exemption from the cut-off so that not only is the bill to be introduced but it will also be heard, moved to the first reading and then moved to the second reading today if the government’s plan eventuates. It appears that this is exactly what it planned to do the whole way through. The government’s intention has been to confine and reduce the debate to ensure that the bill would not get proper scrutiny.
Of course, the consequence of that, if their plan succeeds—as it is likely to given that they have the numbers and the power in the Senate to bully their way through—is that the committee stage is then also likely to be truncated. This government would like nothing more on this issue than to conceal and cover it up, as the latest Telstra fiasco shows. They do not want to give Senator Joyce the opportunity to change his mind, either. They want to ensure that they have tucked under their wing the ability to sell Telstra now, rather than deal with it in a reasonable time over the course of the coming months. They do not need that ability until next year, as I have said.
The government do not want us to think about this bill. The government do not want delay in relation to this legislation. And the opposition have said, ‘Neither do we.’ We have offered a reasonable compromise to ensure that the bill could be dealt with, but the government—and perhaps this is the true reason behind it all—do not want scrutiny thrown on Telstra. They do not want the Senate to turn the spotlight on it. Instead, they want to scuttle away into the dark corners where they are perhaps more comfortable in relation to this debate.
Let us examine a little history, because it was the same characters that make up this government that first introduced the cut-off, and it is now coming back to haunt them. I hope I hear Senator Hill’s contribution in the exemption from the cut-off debate because it was in fact Senator Hill, the then Leader of the Opposition, who put this procedure in place. To quote him again:
The parliament does not set the program; the government sets the program. But, in our view, the parliament has the right to have a reasonable time to consider that legislation. I do not care whether we are in government or the Labor Party is in government in this regard: when masses of bills are guillotined through either chamber without the parliament having time to consider them, the process does not operate well. We should all regard that as unsatisfactory. We simply do not accept that a government putting good faith into practice cannot organise its program in a way that allows the parliament to fulfil its responsibility.
They are words said by Senator Hill in 1993 and which this government today has abandoned completely. He crossed his heart and said, ‘I do not care whether we are in government’. He needs to explain himself today, because it is a question now of whether he still holds that commitment or is in fact joining with his fellow moderates, and perhaps Mr Ruddock, in their descent into the dark side.
The original reason the cut-off and its predecessor the Macklin motion, later amended by the Greens, were introduced has been put down to the fact that ministers or departments were deliberately delaying the introduction of legislation with the intent that it would be passed without proper scrutiny through the Senate. Of course, you can be sure that a government might want to use that process and say, ‘We will not put a bill up. We will hold back, because it may be able to slip through without proper scrutiny.’ That is what this government is doing. Many ministers often used the excuse that the government bills which accumulated at the end of sittings were urgent, but this was usually contradicted by the fact that the legislation’s urgency had not been stated at the time of its passage. In this instance we are not even at the end of sittings and the government is using this device to bring a bill on for debate. We are not even at the point where bills are accumulating and I suspect this government will say something on the lines of, ‘We have only got four or five weeks of sittings left to deal with this legislation.’ It is the government’s program and agenda. They have the right to manage their program. No-one is arguing about that. But the government is unable to schedule bills—to deal with in seriatim and finalise bills. Ministers do not have their bills ready. Ministers do not have their bills available for debate.
This is but one example, but it is a cogent example of a government that is rorting the system. The opposition always looks critically, as I have said, at any bill the government seeks to exempt from the cut-off. This is not one that should be. The government now have a majority and they are planning to abuse their numbers in the chamber and wield their power like a club to bludgeon the Senate into submission. That is what they are doing today. They did it yesterday. They did it when they reduced the number of questions for the opposition and minor parties in question time. This is the third iteration of their opportunity to do it, and they have another amendment on the books where they are going to force the Senate to operate within certain hours, again without consultation and without agreement. This place has operated with agreement—(Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,BUSINESS,2,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-09-07,"—If there was ever a major piece of legislation where the Senate should be judicious and have plenty of time, it is this piece—this collection of legislation to sell Telstra. And when you look at the reasons for urgency given by the minister, Senator Ellison, there are none. The word ‘urgent’ does not appear in amongst those reasons. This is simply a facilitation of a sale on a political whim, with the Prime Minister using the Senate as a rubber stamp. This is the executive reducing the Senate to a rubber stamp on a time line that is politically convenient for the Prime Minister.
I will move an amendment to the government motion which we are dealing with by adding a new clause which reads:
In the meantime the Prime Minister desist from any further injudicious influence on Telstra, or its executives, to falsely talk up the company’s interests.
What a remarkable dereliction of prime ministerial duty it was for the Prime Minister yesterday in this place to counsel the executives of Telstra to talk up how the company is going. The Prime Minister, fresh from condemning the very same executives for what he said was talking down Telstra, then says, ‘But you should talk it up instead.’ One does not have to be an expert in the way in which markets work to know that it is an executive’s duty to neither talk it up nor talk it down but to tell the truth. We have a prime minister whose record on that score is wanting. We have a prime minister who did not tell the truth when it came to the children overboard affair, who was wanting for the truth when it came to weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and there are legion other events. Whichever way one lines up on political spin, the advice of the Prime Minister that the executives of Telstra should be involved in spin to the people whose money depends on being accurately informed of when to buy, sell or hold shares was remarkably bad. One has to ask the question, ‘Is the Prime Minister above the law?’ Is the Prime Minister above telling other people to breach their executive duties? The answer to both questions is no. This is a prime minister who has behaved badly not only to potentially millions of Australians who may be involved in share dealings in Telstra but also to everybody in Australia who has an interest in telecommunications. The Prime Minister should be censured for having been so remiss in making the statements he did yesterday. Had it been said by somebody else in this parliament the Prime Minister would no doubt have immediately tackled them about it.
Somebody observing this in the commercial world said, ‘The Prime Minister should take a chill pill.’ I suggest that the Prime Minister take a truth pill, and that the Prime Minister advise executives in Telstra to tell the truth. That is all that is required. The executives are not politicians, nor should they try to be. It was remiss of an executive to be informing the market that he would not advise his mother to be taking shares in Telstra. That is a direct signal to the market, and the market took that signal and down went the price of Telstra shares. But the Prime Minister was no better yesterday when he indicated to exactly the same people that they should be talking up Telstra’s wellbeing. He did not tell them to tell the truth, but to talk it up, spin it and misinform the market—which ultimately means the shareholders of Australia. It was a very faulty day for prime ministerial behaviour and politics in Australia.
This motion is a clear signal to the Prime Minister to improve, to pick up on that behaviour and to do better. He should apologise for the injudicious statements he made yesterday. It is not the duty of the Prime Minister to intervene in that way—in fact it is a failure of his duty. I noticed that the authorities are looking at whether Telstra executives have not been releasing to the market all the information that should be passed on—at least that is what the papers are saying. Information, including the predictions coming out of Telstra about how it is going to perform in the market in the future, is one thing—and, yes, it should flow to those people who are affected by the internal workings of Telstra—but for a prime minister to come in over the top of that when he has a political bee in his bonnet to sell Telstra is another thing.
He has suddenly got the National Party to agree. By the way, where are they? Here we are at the start of this truncated debate and we only have one of the five of them in here. Where is Senator Joyce, where is Senator Boswell at this moment when we are discussing the way in which this debate is going to be rammed through the Senate without a proper input from the people of Australia because the government says, ‘We want to get out of here, with this legislation through by the end of next week.’ It is an appalling way for the government to be behaving towards those Australians who have an interest in this matter, and I submit that there are more than 20 million of them. Whatever else, the National Party, which is saying, ‘We must consult our constituents all the way down the line,’ ought to be ensuring that when these bills do hit the Senate they go back to their constituents and consult with them. That is not possible under these circumstances of effectively cutting off that period of time built into Senate law in standing order 111 which will be removed by this suspension of standing orders that we are dealing with.
Where is Senator Coonan, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts? She was just saying in here yesterday that the Senate will follow due process. She said that the normal processes of the Senate will be followed. It is not normal to suspend standing orders; to cut the ability of the public to have input to the Senate. We pride ourselves, and our committee system, as being the house of review. If there is no time, there is no review. The Friday committee hearing is effectively a hollow gesture to the idea that the Senate ought to be able to go to the people and to seek feedback and be informed by the people before it debates an issue. That is what is being abolished here.
The Prime Minister will say that he is there for all of us but he is not. He is not there to allow the Australian people to have a say. You cannot have a say if you do not know what you are dealing with, and so far these bills have not been published. The Australian public does not know about them. We do know that there is one to two million shareholders out there who have a mightily high interest in what is going on. The government and the Prime Minister are saying, through the 39 members opposite—none of whom is going to vote against this and all of whom are going to fall into line—that those shareholders and those phone users should not have a say, should not be able to feed back into this debate as it gets rammed through the Senate, which is being treated as a rubber stamp by a Prime Minister who for too long has treated the House of Representatives and its committee system as a rubber stamp. We have government by the executive. The parliament is simply being sidelined.
You can predict what the vote will be next week. People may think that Senator Joyce or somebody else might cross the floor or could be influenced but no, that is not going to happen. The watchdog has become the biscuit puppy. Senator Joyce is not going to make a stand against this, nor will Senator Boswell, nor will the other National Party senators who should be, above all, ensuring that the public has time to feed their point of view into this debate. I oppose the motion as put by Senator Ellison and I move:
After paragraph (b), insert:
; and (c)        in the meantime, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) desist from any further injudicious influence on Telstra or its executives to falsely ‘talk up’ the company’s interests.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,BUSINESS,2,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2005-09-07,"—I also wish to speak in this debate. Today the government have brought to the parliament, again, the proposal for the full privatisation of Telstra. They intend to use their Senate majority to force it through with indecent haste. We have been given six sitting days to deal with five major pieces of complex legislation. The government are just trying to ram through these very fundamental changes to the telecommunications industry in this country. The legislation is important to the economy as a whole. The legislation impacts on every Australian and we know that 70 per cent of Australians are opposed to it. And yet, the extent of the scrutiny the government is prepared to allow is a referral of these five bills for consideration to a Senate committee for a perfunctory one-day hearing on Friday of this week into the detail of this legislation.
Two of the bills, the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005 and the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005 are being introduced into the Senate and we are now debating the cut-off motion in relation to those two pieces of legislation. Three other bills are being introduced into the House of Representatives today: the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Future Proofing and Other Measures) Bill 2005, the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Charges) Amendment (Industry Plans and Consumer Codes) Bill 2005 and the Appropriation (Regional Telecommunications Services) Bill 2005-2006.
Earlier today, just one explanatory memorandum for these bills was available on the parliamentary internal electronic system. I checked a few moments before I came down to the chamber and now it is two out of the five explanatory memoranda that are available online for the members and senators to examine. So when the government spins that there is no need for any more debate about Telstra and that the Senate does not need to examine the detail of these bills because, they argue, we have had the debate already, they are being deliberately misleading. In the case of the Telstra sale bill, it is true—it has been debated before. In the case of the competition and consumer issues bill, it has never been seen before. It is new. In the case of the future proofing bill, another version of that bill has been debated previously. In the case of the Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Charges) Amendment (Industry Plans and Consumer Codes) Bill, it is new. It has never been debated or seen before in this parliament. In the case of the Appropriation (Regional Telecommunications Services) Bill, which I prefer to call the ‘slush fund bill’ because that is precisely what it is—even though it is a pretty pathetically miserable slush fund it is nevertheless a slush fund bill—it is a new bill. It has never been seen before. So it is a monstrous lie for the Howard government to say that these matters have been examined by the parliament before. They have not been examined by the parliament before: by any committee, at any stage, in any detail, ever.
Even with the totally inadequate reference for the examination of these bills for a few hours on Friday of this week, the committee, by virtue of the resolution of the Senate, is very limited in what it can examine. It is in fact prevented by resolution of the Senate from looking at the issue of privatisation. The government does not want the committee to go there. The government has turned this miserable and pathetic committee inquiry on Friday into a complete joke by constraining the committee in what it can examine. But this is what I expect with the Howard government now in total control and with a majority in both houses of the parliament. I expect this sort of extreme agenda. I expect this sort of arrogance. And doesn’t it, combined, make a very ugly and undemocratic situation for us to deal with!
Senators should ask themselves why we are having this indecent haste. What is the rush? Why does this debate have to be completed by Friday of next week? Why do we have the remaining six sitting days in this sitting period to finish debate on these five bills? Why the indecent rush? I can tell senators why. At the end of this sitting fortnight the Federal Council of the National Party meets, and the sale of Telstra has to be signed, sealed and delivered before that meeting takes place on the weekend after next. The National Party sell-out on the Telstra issue has to be concluded by the end of next week, before the Federal Council of the National Party meets, because the National Party has completely sold out its constituency. We are used to that, I suppose.
We heard the Queensland Nationals beating their breasts about the fact that they had allegedly consulted the electorate on the sale of Telstra. Had they consulted the 70 per cent of ordinary Australians who do not want Telstra sold? They say they have consulted the electorate. What does that mean? It means that one Queensland Nationals senator has gone up to Queensland and rolled out the numbers on the Queensland State Executive of the National Party. That is what consultation means in this case: talking to the Queensland State Executive of the National Party.
Meanwhile, 70 per cent of Australians are opposed to the full privatisation of Telstra. But does Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, listen to those 70 per cent of Australians? Does the National Party of Australia listen to those 70 per cent of Australians or even those Australians who live in regional and rural areas? Of course not. The National Party continues an absolutely unbroken record of never delivering for country people, never standing up to the Liberal Party, never standing up to John Howard, never crossing the floor in the Senate and always selling out. That is the modern National Party for you.
The same group of National Party senators has been consistently treated with utter contempt by Mr Howard himself. Not one National Party senator in this chamber in the history of the Howard government has ever made it to the ministerial bench—not one. Imagine Black Jack McEwen copping that! Not one of them has ever been good enough to make the miserable ministerial line-up of incompetents, duds and no-hopers of the Howard government. Not one of them has ever made it to the ministerial leather in the Senate. That says it all. They are all wannabes or has-beens—the whole lot of them. None of them ever made the grade.
Here we have a situation where one of them could have made a name for himself. But none of them have the intestinal fortitude to do so. I do remember that one Queensland National Party senator—that is, Senator Joyce; I have not yet met Senator Joyce and I look forward to doing so sometime in the weeks or months ahead—said before the last election, on 7 September 2004:
I agree with John Howard on most things, but I won’t be endorsing the sale of Telstra.
Oh, really? That is what the then Mr Joyce said.
—That was last year!
—It was last year. What about the former President of the Queensland National Party, Mr Terry Bolger? I think he was President of the Queensland National Party for about six years. What a job! He said on 15 March 2005:
We won a Senate place in our own right, saying we would oppose the sale of Telstra. It was not with the Coalition ...
Thank you very much, Mr Bolger. Thank you, Mr Bolger, for your comment on 13 October 2004 that said:
Our policy is Telstra should not be sold. We are against any sale of Telstra unless the community tells us to do otherwise.
Mr Bolger, 70 per cent of Australians say, ‘Don’t do it.’ And the proportion and percentage is higher in rural and regional areas. And the proportion is higher again in Queensland. I must admit that just a few weeks ago—although it seems longer—Mr Bolger ceased to be the President of the Queensland Nationals, so I suppose all the rules have changed because he no longer has the gig.
This is all happening at a time when Telstra is in unprecedented turmoil. Everyone knows that the government forced out Dr Ziggy Switkowski. The Howard government appointed board gave him the flick; they told him to go. Then, with very great fanfare, a new Telstra chief executive was appointed, a chief executive who recently—in fact, less than three months ago—was described so warmly by Howard government ministers.
I saw what Mr Howard said yesterday about Mr Trujillo, so I went back and checked what the Howard government ministers said when this self-same gentleman was appointed as the new chief executive of Telstra. Let me quote, for the benefit of other senators, what they said.
I congratulate Telstra chairman Donald McGauchie and the board on securing the services of such a highly regarded chief executive with deep knowledge and understanding of the telecommunications industry.
Senator Minchin said that. He also said:
Mr Trujillo’s experience covers the full range of business operations in which Telstra is engaged, including fixed line, mobile, broadband and directories.
And, Mr Acting Deputy President, you will not believe what good old Senator Minchin said next:
He—
Solomon Trujillo—
has a proven track record in delivering services to customers, returns to shareholders and maintaining a constructive relationship with regulators.
Wouldn’t you know it? This is the man who is now described by Prime Minister Howard as a disgrace!
What is Mr Trujillo’s offence? He has committed a cardinal sin under the Howard government: he has told the truth. And you cannot get away with that under Mr Howard and his government. He has told someone the truth. Telstra executives have reported to the government on the parlous state of Telstra. They have reported on Telstra’s underinvestment in infrastructure. They have reported that the dividends have been paid from reserves. As I am now a backbencher, I have a bit of time on my hands these days and so I checked out this wonderful document. The problems were outlined in dot points: the company did not make the investments it needed to make; they received 14.3 million fault calls; over 14 per cent of all lines have faults—that is nearly 1½ million phone lines; replacement of obsolete or non-vendor supported equipment was needed; the work force is ageing and there is a lack of training for new workers; and legacy IT systems are not capable of handling the volumes in new services currently being offered. Then Mr Trujillo says—and this is the killer blow—that $2 billion to $3 billion in additional investment should have been spent over the past three to four years.
Instead of making the investments it needed to make, the government has been obsessed with tarting up Telstra for sale. We know from the document that Telstra is borrowing from reserves to pay the dividend. On page 3 it says that Telstra is borrowing from reserves to pay the dividend—more than $550 million in 2005, rising to more than $2.2 billion in 2006. It also says that the Telstra board has already recognised that this kind of borrowing to pay dividends is not a sustainable policy or practice. Mr Trujillo reports this, and he is then branded a disgrace by the Prime Minister because he has told the truth.
What a classic example this issue we have before us is of government arrogance and deceit. The government knows the difficulties with Telstra. They have been informed that Telstra has been underinvesting in infrastructure. They know that dividends have been paid from reserves. But they are furious with Mr Trujillo and the board for actually telling the government and the public the truth.
The government says that the CEO’s job is to talk up the share price. I happen to think that the CEO’s job is to tell the truth—that happens to be my view. I do not brand anyone a disgrace if they tell the truth. The whole thing is an exercise in ensuring that we do not hear the truth. They do not want to hear the truth from Mr Trujillo; they do not want to hear the truth from the board of Telstra; they do not want to hear the truth from a Senate committee about five bills that should be subject to the most exhaustive, thorough and proper examination at this time. The way forward here is clear: the Senate should fulfil its accountability role. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,BUSINESS,2,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-09-07,"—We are debating at the moment a motion by the government to allow the Telstra sale bills—the entire package—to be exempted from the cut-off motion. That sounds a bit obtuse. What it means in reality is that it allows bills that have not appeared until this very day to be debated straightaway without any examination at all. It is worth spending a few minutes looking at the context of the standing order that we are trying to waive. Senator Ludwig gave a reasonable history of this standing order, and it is one that I am particularly interested in because, as he said, it was originally called the Macklin motion, and Senator Macklin was my Queensland predecessor in the Democrats. I can trace my own seat in this place directly back to him. It is important to emphasis this, because we do have a lot of new senators in this place—I think 16 senators have entered this place in the last couple of months—and many of them might not be aware of that history and why this is a significant issue.
What this motion does in effect is overturn the principle and precedent, going back to the 1980s, that was put in place precisely to prevent this sort of grotesque abuse of process. The standing order that the government is seeking to waive in relation to the Telstra bills is one that requires that any bill that is introduced in the Senate is not to be debated until it has been in the Senate for 14 days. I would not have thought it was too much to ask on any significant piece of legislation to give the Senate—and of course it is not just the Senate but also the people in the community with expertise who provide feedback to senators—two weeks to look at the legislation and examine the consequences of it. This motion from the government seeks to overrule that standing order that has now been in place since the 1980s and which would otherwise simply provide the Senate with 14 days to look at the legislation.
Of course, we quite frequently exempt legislation from that cut-off motion. In fact, we did it just yesterday. But in my view the bills we did it to yesterday were relatively minor; they were neither complex nor controversial. As we all know, the Telstra legislation is not only controversial but also, more importantly, complex. It is complex and detailed, and yet it has appeared just today and we are expected to start debating it today. If we had not spoken on this motion and had just agreed to it straightaway, we would have been into the debate on the legislation before most of us had even had a chance to see it. As Senator Faulkner said, the details on many of the bills are still not available for us to start looking at. That is a significant subversion of the process.
I was speaking on this matter late yesterday and indicated that it was perhaps for the best that there were not the usual number of school students watching us and seeing this sort of travesty. We actually have a number of them in the galleries now, and it is unfortunate that they are witnessing such a serious perversion of democracy and of the parliamentary process. One of the core things you would teach any of the school students who are in here today learning about the parliament, learning about our democratic system, finding out how it really works in practice and getting that basic bit of education about it is that the government does not equal the parliament. The parliament, and the Senate in particular, are here to examine what the government puts forward. We are here to examine the laws. It is simple Civics 101: government proposes laws and parliament examines them.
However, what we are seeing here today is that crucial second part—that fundamental leg in our entire democratic system—being pulled away. When you have any system that is held in place by three different legs, as with the separation of powers, and you pull one away, the system falls over. That is not just unfortunate from some nice theoretical point of view; it is unfortunate because the people who bear the cost and consequences are the people of Australia. So we are seeing a fundamental undermining of the political process here, as well as a deliberate, calculated spit in the face to a principle that the Senate adopted nearly 20 years ago.
Senator Ludwig pointed out some of the comments that Senator Hill made in support of the principle behind allowing proper scrutiny. Of course, Senator Hill does not hold the same view today. Senator Faulkner, perhaps a touch unkindly, pointed out that some of the National Party members here have not made it to the ministerial leather. Personally, I do not think that is too bad a thing. As I said, the parliament is important. You do not have to be a minister; I am not going to be a minister. Backbenchers can make a valuable contribution, but they make a valuable contribution by standing up for what they believe in, not just by being a number, a cog in the machine.
However, they may want to follow Senator Hill’s example. Let us look at Senator Hill’s example. He has been a great success. He has been Leader of the Government in the Senate for 10 years or more. He is possibly the longest-serving Leader of the Government in the Senate in our history. I would not be surprised by that. So I urge all new senators—and there are many of them here, including two National Party senators—to follow Senator Hill’s example. What did Senator Hill do when he was a young, fresh-faced senator first elected to this chamber back in, I think, 1981? He crossed the floor. He crossed the floor on issues he believed in. It did not hurt his career. He has been the longest-serving Leader of the Government in the Senate in history. Obviously that is the way to go. Follow the example of your leader, be true to yourself and cross the floor on issues of importance and you too may end up in the same position as Senator Hill. To all of those new people here who want to look to their superiors and find out how it is done, there is a good example for you.
We do have a serious situation here with the whole matter of where Telstra is placed at the moment. The motion before us is specifically about whether we should start debating the legislation straightaway, so I do not want to stray too far from that, but one of the reasons it is problematic to be overturning this principle is the incredibly serious debacle that Telstra, the whole telecommunications environment and the whole corporate environment now is.
Maybe now we are getting a sign of why the government was not so concerned initially about the regulators going a bit soft on Mr Vizard, because we have the Prime Minister of this country saying to the executive of one of our largest companies, ‘Your job is to talk up the price.’ Speaking as the majority shareholder who wants to flog this asset off, he is saying, ‘Your job is to talk up the price.’ As Senator Faulkner said, and as my colleague Senator Murray said outside this place earlier today, the role of the chief executive and that of directors when they are talking about their company is to tell the truth. Their role is not to talk up the price so the government can get as much money as possible—it is to tell the truth so that shareholders and people who are thinking of buying shares actually know what they are getting into. It sends an extremely serious message to company directors and executives around the country when you have a majority shareholder, in effect, who everybody knows wants to sell off their holding, telling people: ‘Talk up the price. Stop telling the truth—don’t talk about the facts, don’t lay out some of the problems, just talk up the price.’ That is an incredibly serous situation.
That leaves aside the issue of whether or not as the majority shareholder the government were given what I would say was clearly price sensitive information about major issues to do with the problems inside Telstra when that information had not been made available to other shareholders. That in itself raises some problematic questions, but we will leave that to the regulator to deal with in terms of the law. What I am concerned about is the message that it sends at a time when a lot of people across the political spectrum have done a lot of work trying to improve corporate governance and trying to improve the culture of the way our corporations operate.
There is a really significant principle at stake with this motion, as there was yesterday with the resolution to establish a farcical, impractical and unworkable Senate inquiry process. This motion today compounds that problem, because what this motion expects us to do is to start debating the legislation before the committee has even had a chance to look at it. At least in their grand benevolence the government have allowed one day of hearing for the Senate committee to hear from people with expertise in this area about the legislation and what it might mean. But they will not even give the Senate the courtesy of allowing us to hear from those experts—to hear from the Senate committee, to read the submissions and to read the Hansard transcripts of the evidence—before we have to start debating it. They want us to debate it straightaway before the Senate committee has sat, before the submissions are in and before the evidence is in.
As I said yesterday, it is a pretty clear example of the arrogance of this government when they do not even feel they need to bother about looking reasonable and fair. They do not care how farcical it looks, because they do not think it matters. They think they can get away with anything. They think, ‘People don’t want Telstra to be sold, but they’ll get over it.’ But there is one thing far worse, in my view, than governments doing something the public do not want. Sometimes governments need to do that; sometimes parliaments decide to do that, based on the evidence, for the public good, and they go out and explain why. But when you do it in a way that is so contemptuous of public input and due process, and in a way that is designed specifically to prevent proper scrutiny of what is being done, then there is no way you can convince people that you actually have the public interest at heart.
The government do not have the intestinal fortitude to put and carry the case, and to argue the detail here. They do not want anybody to see the detail. They just want it through and out of the way so they can create some other issue—terrorism or something—and get everybody’s mind off the problem. It is a serious indication not only of the indefensibility of what the government are doing but of their complete contempt not just for the parliament but for the Australian people.
To revert to speaking about my own state of Queensland for a moment, it is particularly sad that it will be Queensland senators who will be delivering the numbers on this motion, as occurred yesterday. It would take only one senator to vote with the non-government senators—without pre-empting how Senator Fielding might vote, but assuming he votes against this motion. I hope my arguments have been persuasive in relation to that. It would take only one government senator to take that short walk across the chamber and sit with us for only a few minutes. We are not that unfriendly. You will be all right. You will be safer over here, because Senator Heffernan will be on the other side. You can stop this motion happening and send a clear signal that you do have some concern for proper process.
But if that does not happen then this travesty will be allowed to happen because of the numbers that Queensland will deliver. Because, unlike every other state and territory, it will be a clear majority of senators from Queensland that will be giving the government that extra crucial number. If it was not bad enough losing the State of Origin this year, we have actually got Queensland handing over Telstra on a plate to the southerners. I apologise to some of my colleagues from other states—the non rugby league states—who might not understand some of these things, but it is a terrible thing for Queenslanders to lose the State of Origin. But if there is one thing worse than losing, it is not putting up a good strong fight.
I say to Senator Joyce and my fellow Queenslanders: ‘What would Wally Lewis do? What would Darren Lockyer do?’ Darren Lockyer is a good country boy. ‘What would Marty Bella do?’ Marty Bella was a National Party candidate. Marty Bella would not just give up halfway through. You have given up before half-time, Senator Joyce. You have got to fight right through to the final siren. Even if you are going to lose, you have got to keep taking the ball up. Even the grasshopper, Barry Gommersal, would blow the whistle on this one. I think he stood for Liberal and Labor at some stage—I am not sure—and then as an Independent. He had a go all around. But he would have blown the whistle. He would at least have sent it to the third umpire for a proper look before letting it through. Show a bit of that Queenslander spirit, Senator Joyce. At least do us proud; at least go down fighting. Do not just hand it to them on a plate. Do not just let them steamroll through. It has been a bad enough year for Queensland already without this sort of thing happening.
It is, as I said yesterday, in many ways more significant to prevent proper scrutiny than it is to support the sale or not. It is a policy decision about whether or not to sell Telstra—and I accept that some people genuinely believe it is the way to go, although I am finding it harder and harder to see how they could see it as the way to go, given the debacle that is playing out in the public arena at the moment. But in some ways I think you have more of an obligation, if you support that approach, to make sure that it is done properly. Even people who support the sale of Telstra will recognise that you have to get it right: you have to get the regulatory regime right, you have to get the powers of the Competition and Consumer Commission right and you have to set up the funding proposals right to ensure proper infrastructure down the track, or at least give yourself the best chance. So I would argue that there is actually more of an obligation on those that support this to ensure that it is properly scrutinised and, as much as possible, guarantee that they will deliver on the promises that accompany the sale.
So you are preventing that proper scrutiny and having the farce that people have to start to debate a matter on the day it is brought in, before they have even had a chance to look at the legislation and before they have had a chance to hear from the community—the people who will be directly affected and the operators who will have to engage with this mammoth privatised corporate gorilla of Telstra. Before we can even hear from them we are supposed to give informed comment on that. We can all talk about whether or not we think it should be privatised, as we have done before, but there are deeper issues than that simple fact. There are deeper issues, as we all know and as Senate committees have looked at in the past, about the regulatory regime, about competition, about vertical integration, about trade practices and about predatory pricing—let alone the structure of the funding that has been promised in relation to that and how real and genuine that is.
I pointed out before for the benefit of Senator Joyce and the other new senators that I have been the victim of promises from this government in the past. They have promised us pools of money to go to certain areas and then, after the legislation is through, the money disappeared down all sorts of different plugholes. So you have to be really careful about that sort of thing. You have the record of this government to go by. You cannot say you were not warned; you cannot say you do not know. The experience is there and the record is there. To allow this through and to allow the travesty of a debate like this to occur is in many ways a much poorer reflection particularly on those that have made statements from the government side that they were going to stand up for their constituents and stand up about the issues of concern on Telstra. Preventing any scrutiny is, in many ways, much poorer form than whether or not you vote for it at the end of the day. I would urge coalition senators, once again—as it only takes one—to think about that before allowing this disgraceful motion and this total perversion of process to go through.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,BUSINESS,2,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2005-09-07,"—I want to make two quick points, because Senator Bartlett invites us to draw the attention of new senators to what is occurring in the chamber here this morning. Can I firstly make it clear that I do not intend to close the debate. I am not speaking in my capacity as a minister; I am speaking as a senator.
It is important that Senator Fielding, all other senators and, in fact, the children who have packed themselves into the gallery see what is happening here. We have seen two things happen. Firstly, we have seen, for the benefit of the schoolchildren in the gallery, a filibuster. We are now approaching what I remember from my schooldays as lunchtime, and the Senate has done virtually no business this morning. It has just spoken about when it might have a debate. We are debating when we might have a debate. We have seen a series of senators from the other side—a series of Labor senators and now a Democrat senator—speaking for the full available time, and this is what is called, for the benefit of everyone listening, a filibuster. This is a bunch of senators lining up because they would rather not deal with the legislation.
I remind all honourable senators that this is legislation that has been before the Senate on four previous occasions. This is legislation that the government promised in the lead-up to the 1996 election and was thwarted in 1996-97 when we debated the legislation. We went, very honestly, to the people in 1998 and said, ‘We want to sell Telstra.’ We put out all the reasons and we had a huge debate on it. We had the Senate committee inquiries into it again in 1998, and again we were thwarted after the 1998 election. We went to the people in 2001 and said, ‘We want to sell Telstra.’ We won that election, we came into the Senate and we were thwarted again. We went to the people again in 2004. So at four elections we have had the honesty and the integrity to go to the Australian people and promise something that we know is not popular.
Senator Bartlett, to his credit, said that sometimes governments have to do things that they believe are in the public interest but that are not popular. The introduction of the A New Tax System was an example of that. It was very brave politically to do it; it was something that we knew would be good for Australia and we did it in spite of its unpopularity. We believe in that with Telstra. We promised it at four elections and now we want to do it. But what we have seen today is a filibuster. The other thing Senator Bartlett will not tell you is that the Australian Democrats on a number of occasions, and the Australian Labor Party on many occasions, have brought into this place, in recent history, large and complex pieces of very important legislation and have supported an identical motion—identical in wording to the motion we have before us today.
—But the bill has been available for scrutiny!
—Senator George Campbell, by interjection, misleads the Senate. I will cite the mother of them all. I am on the record as criticising the government of the day when former senator Gareth Evans, the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, brought into this chamber in the middle of December, a few days before Christmas, the Native Title Bill—a complex, complicated and massive piece of legislation that changed the land management system in Australia for all time. There was no legislation and there were no amendments available. He had hundreds and hundreds of amendments, and we did not even have a speakers list. He brought it into the parliament, and he needed the cut-off motion. And who voted for it? The Australian Democrats. By the time the bill had been put through with a guillotine brought in by former senator Gareth Evans, not only had former senator Cheryl Kernot allowed them to put it through—and the Australian Democrats voted for the cut-off motion, the gag and the guillotine to get it rushed through the parliament—at the end of it she wandered right over here and gave Gareth a great big kiss on the lips to celebrate it.
For the benefit of the schoolchildren and the new senators, please do not be misled by senators who come into this place and in effect display what can only be described as hypocrisy when they say that this is some sort of travesty. It is not. This is what the Australian Labor Party did in power, and it is what the Australian Democrats did when it suited them. It does not suit them this time. We promised this in the 1996, 1998, 2001 and 2004 elections. And what is our sin? We are trying to keep our promises to the Australian people and do so in a timely way.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The minister accused the Democrats of hypocrisy, which is unparliamentary and I ask him to withdraw that. The minister is jealous because somebody got a kiss on the lips. I will come over and give him one if it makes him feel better! The circumstances were very different to what he is describing has happened today. I ask him to at least create his misleading rhetoric without reflecting in an unparliamentary way on the Senate.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2005-09-07,"—As I interjected on Senator Ian Campbell in his contribution—one of bluster and very little substance—he has to know that this is a sorry day for democracy in this country. Senator Ian Campbell, you know that the government’s approach in dealing with these bills is absolutely outrageous. It is an absolute outrage to suggest that, on such an important issue to the Australian people as the sale of Telstra, you can introduce bills into this parliament without giving a copy of them to the opposition or the minor parties and put up a motion that suggests that we should immediately proceed to the second reading debate on bills that we do not know the contents of.
We know you have the bills. It was put to you last night that you ought to give us embargoed copies of them. What was your response? ‘No, you can’t have them. You’re not getting them. You’ll debate them sight unseen.’ I will remind you what the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts said on Monday, 5 September with respect to a question from Senator Brown. The minister assured the Senate:
... the proper processes of the Senate will be followed in the debate on the bills.
That would normally include making the documentation—the explanatory memorandums and copies of the bills—available in sufficient time so that people can look at them, understand the detail of them and be able to make a considered response to them. The minister also said that she would be put out a ministerial statement. I think she said that on Meet the Press on Sunday morning. She certainly said it back in here. I understand the ministerial statement has gone up in smoke. It has disappeared off the radar screen—we are not going to get a ministerial statement. So we are not even going to get an explanation from the minister on what she views these bills as generally seeking to do.
We are being asked to facilitate the passage of a piece of legislation to sell the major telecommunications carrier in this country without seeing the conditions under which the sale will take place. We are being asked to buy a pig in a poke. We are being asked to put our names to a proposal to sell the rest of Telstra without knowing what conditions will ultimately be attached to that sale. That is an outrage in dealing with assets of the Commonwealth in a proper, democratic and transparent way.
The minister has said that she will go and work out the details of the sale in a backroom with the executives of Telstra. From 11 August, over the past two or three weeks, having watched the dealings of this government with the executives of Telstra, we would not want them in too many locked-up rooms doing deals. At the end of the negotiations on the sale of Telstra, we would finish up with the question of whether or not we actually had a company to sell off. But that is what is being proposed—not an open debate about what the conditions should be, not an opportunity for the opposition or the minor parties to have input into the process, not an opportunity for scrutiny to ensure what is done is aboveboard, open and transparent, but something that will be done in backrooms in secret, so we will not be able to make any criticisms or value judgments.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2005-09-07,"—A few weeks ago the Israeli Defence Force completed its withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Several thousand Jewish settlers from about 21 settlements scattered over the territory were removed by the IDF, some peacefully of course and some by force, thus ending almost four decades of Israeli presence on this very small piece of land abutting the Mediterranean Sea.
The Israeli withdrawal is to be welcomed. Indeed, the status quo, while perhaps still sustainable from a military point of view, was arguably no longer sustainable from a political point of view. Something had to change in the dynamic of this conflict that has been tearing the region apart for decades now and, of course, sending periodic shockwaves throughout the rest of the world. The Israeli withdrawal from Gaza is one such step. As Israel’s Ambassador to Australia, Mr Naftali Tamar, wrote recently in the Australian, the hopes are that the Gaza withdrawal will achieve several objectives. He wrote that it will:
Reduce friction with the Palestinian population, who will find themselves under the governance of the Palestinian Authority rather than the Israeli government; give Palestinians the opportunity to break out of the cycle of violence in those areas no longer under Israeli control; dispel claims by the Palestinians regarding Israel’s overall responsibility for the Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip; and allow for any future permanent status arrangement by clearing all Israeli settlements and installations. In addition, the plan carries with it the potential for improvement in the Palestinian economy and living conditions.
The ambassador, it seems, is quite optimistic. There are, however, far more sceptical views. For example, the American columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote:
The Israeli abandonment of Gaza is a withdrawal of despair. Unlike the Oslo concessions of 1993, there is not even the pretense of getting anything in return from the Palestinians. Nonetheless, unilateralism is both correct and necessary. Israel has no peace partner—Mahmoud Abbas has nothing to offer and has offered nothing—and in the absence of a partner, there is only one logical policy: Rationalize your defensive lines and prepare for a long wait.
Gaza was simply a bridge too far: settlements too far-flung and small to justify the huge psychological and material cost of defending them. Pulling out of Gaza leaves behind the first truly independent Palestinian state—uncontrolled and highly militant, but one from which Israel is fenced off.
If Israel can complete its West Bank fence, it will have established a stable equilibrium and essentially abolished terrorism as a regular and reliable means of attack—i.e., as a usable strategic weapon. That will leave the Palestinians a stark choice: Remain in their state of miserable militancy with no prospects of victory or finally accept the Jewish state and make a deal.
So Krauthammer writes. There is of course truth and merit in both positions. There is a need to provide Israel with defensible borders and a hope that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can finally be resolved in a peaceful manner through the creation of a Palestinian state.
However, we need to be watchful for this end is far from certain. Statehood is not—as recent history indicates—always a magical solution. There is a lot more to it than just a piece of land with a flag and a national anthem. The Palestinian-Israeli conflict can only be fully resolved if a free, democratic and prosperous state of Israel exists in peace next to a free, democratic and prosperous state of Palestine. Palestine cannot be allowed to degenerate into another impoverished, backward cleptocracy run by crooks, thugs and fanatics—what David Frum calls a ‘Mediterranean Somalia: an unstable failed state in which gangs compete for power and extremist Islam finds a sanctuary.’
Unfortunately, Yasser Arafat’s tenure as the leader of the Palestinian Authority has not laid any useful foundations for a healthy Palestinian state. In a long cover story for the latest issue of the Atlantic Monthly David Samuels paints a frequently heartbreaking picture of the betrayal of the Palestinian people by some of their leaders. Writes Samuels:
The amounts of money stolen from the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people through the corrupt practices of Arafat’s inner circle are so staggeringly large that they may exceed one half of the total of $7 billion in foreign aid contributed to the Palestinian Authority.
It is absolutely appalling. And sadly, Palestinian democrats and liberals who want normal lives and a decent future for their people and their children are stuck between the rock of corruption and the hard place of extremism. We have to remember that unfortunately too many on the Palestinian side still do not believe in the two-state solution, but a one-state solution with Palestine from Jordan to the Mediterranean and the Jews into the sea. Hamas leader, Dr Mahoud Al-Zahar, told Arabic newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat recently:
We do not and will not recognise a state called Israel. Israel has no right to any inch of Palestinian land. This is an important issue. Our position stems from our religious convictions. This is a holy land. It is not the property of the Palestinians or the Arabs. This land is the property of all Muslims in all parts of the world.
As an Israeli group, Palestinian Media Watch, notes of Hamas:
The Hamas website publicized numerous posters that declare the same religious victory theme. The Hamas poster below, showing a face of Hamas founder Ahmad Yassin laughing, superimposed over a somber religious Jew, presents the Sharon evacuation plan as a victory of the Koran over the Talmud. The words on the poster: ‘Our Koran proves that we were right and your Talmud proves that you were wrong ...’ Another Hamas poster shows a rifle and the Koran with the words: ‘With those two together the victory has been achieved.’
Hamas, by the way, is in a very strong position to win the parliamentary elections in Gaza scheduled for next January. But as Israeli finance minister Mr Ehud Olmert said recently, the pullout is a ‘calculated risk’. He said:
There comes a time when you have to take a risk in order to break this cycle of violence.
Israel has now withdrawn from Gaza. Soon it will be vacating virtually all of the West Bank, and the ball will very much be in the Palestinian court. It will be time for the Palestinian leadership, as well as the Arab leadership in general, to demonstrate to the world the commitment to a parallel future. It will be time for a final and unequivocal recognition of the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state. It will be time for the final and unequivocal renunciation of terrorism as a political and military weapon. It will be time for the end of the obsession with Israel—that sliver of land less than one-third the size of Tasmania, stuck in the middle of a region stretching from the Atlantic to Central Asia.
It will be time for no more excuses, distilled, quite appallingly, in a statement by one Arab participant in last year’s World Economic Forum in Davos. He said:
We cannot reform ourselves as long as Israel occupies Arab lands.
No more misplaced blame for the appalling lack of freedom and opportunities for tens of millions throughout the Middle East. It will be a time also of great challenge and great opportunities, both for the peoples of the Middle East and for the rest of the international community. President Bush said very recently that the Gaza withdrawal will create an opportunity for the Palestinians to begin laying the foundations of a peaceful, democratic state. He said:
I see relations with a peaceful Palestinian state ... that is founded on democratic institutions. That’s what I believe can happen and should happen. ... in order to ultimately defeat terror—whether it be in Palestinian territories or Iraq or Iran—there must be open, transparent societies based upon rule of law.
Fortunately, the Palestinian National Authority Chairman, Mahmoud Abbas, seems to understand what is at stake. He said a few days ago before a Palestinian youth parliament:
... ‘lesser jihad’ [had ended and that the Palestinian people were now] standing before the ‘greater jihad’, which is construction, development, and achieving security and tranquility for our people. We want to live like the rest of the peoples of the world. After the evacuation of the settlers from Gaza, a solution needs to be reached for the West Bank and Jerusalem and a just solution must be found for the refugee problem.
He continued:
We will sign a peace treaty with Israel. In that way, we will have peace and they will have security.
Chairman Abbas later reiterated in a talk with the wounded and disabled in Gaza that the Palestinians are now ‘standing before the “greater jihad”, which is the development of the homeland and its construction and changing our people’s lives’. He said:
From here we will begin to develop, to build, to invest, and to protect our land and homeland ...
The road ahead is by no means smooth, even if we assume that it is paved with good intentions. Controversial points remain, like those mentioned by Chairman Abbas, such as Jerusalem and the so-called right of return by Palestinians and their descendants to their former homes in Israel proper. There seems to be very little hope for compromise at least on those two issues. After visiting Israel, just before Christmas in 2003, I came away with an abiding hope that one day, on the grey hills of the Holy Land, Israelis and Palestinians will be able to, if not in the words of Martin Luther King: ‘Sit down together at a table of brotherhood,’ then at least, at long last, sit alongside each other in peace.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST,3,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-09-07,"—My question is to Senator Coonan, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. I refer the minister to comments by the Prime Minister yesterday that he had advised the chairman of the Telstra board that ‘the obligation of senior executives of Telstra is to talk up the company’s interest not to talk them down’. Is the minister aware that section 184 of the Corporations Act requires company directors and officers to act in good faith and in the best interests of the company? Doesn’t the Corporations Law also require Telstra executives to tell the truth about the company’s operations instead of breaching the act by misleading shareholders in order to advance the government’s privatisation plans?

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-09-07,"—Mr Deputy President, I ask a supplementary question. Does the minister accept that Telstra’s other shareholders are entitled to know that the company has pursued an unsustainable dividend policy and has underinvested in its network? Can the minister explain why the government is now asking Telstra executives to talk up the company, to join with them in misleading the Australian public about the true state of the company?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,question
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-09-07,"—Thank you to Senator Wong for the question. My understanding of what the Prime Minister said was that he stated there is a directors’ duty that applies to all corporations in Australia, and applies under the law, to not knowingly talk down or damage a company’s interests. I think he said in his interview this morning—and I must say I concur with that sentiment—that that is a matter of commonsense. Telstra, of course, have a very good story to tell and I think we would all like to see them start telling it. The management have a duty to create value and to help Telstra grow. I think everyone would welcome them focusing on these issues.
Nobody is asking a company director or a senior executive of a company to lie or tell any mistruth in the interests of talking up the value of the shares, but that is a very different thing from speaking against the interests of the company. We are not asking for any mistruth or any misrepresentation at all. In fact, the Prime Minister has said that if you have a senior position with a company you have a general obligation not to talk against the interests of the company, and that is perfectly in accordance with the law. I might add that you also have the obligation, I would have thought, not to exaggerate the impacts on a company, for example, of regulation. Even Mr Tanner, who seems to have bumped Senator Conroy as the opposition spokesman on communications, has questioned the accuracy of Telstra’s claims that $850 million of Telstra’s profits and forward estimates would be destroyed by regulation. Mr Tanner thinks that Mr Trujillo gilded the lily as he went around over the past weeks, or those under his direction did, talking about the impact of regulation on the company. So, put in context, the Prime Minister’s comments are not only comments that I agree with but they are comments that fall fairly and squarely within the law and fairly and squarely within the obligations of directors.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer

But, as Senator Minchin has said, the dividend policy of the company is entirely a matter for the Telstra board. This government denies completely having influenced any decision of the board in relation to their dividend policy. It is the situation that all directors have an obligation not to trash the value of the company, not to trash the value of the shares and to put in context and to truly state the impact of various factors on the company. That is what needed to be put into context, and I agree with the Prime Minister’s comments.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1,answer
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-09-07,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Coonan) and the Minister for Finance and Administration (Senator Minchin) to questions without notice asked today relating to Telstra.
Over the last number of years but particularly over the last number of sitting weeks, the Labor Party has been putting a number of fundamental questions to Senator Minchin and Senator Coonan because they carry the responsibility at the present time for the proposed privatisation sale of the majority Australian government ownership of Telstra. What a shambles we are seeing unfolding with respect to the sale of Telstra—an ideologically driven obsession by the Liberal government to sell the majority government ownership of Telstra. In fact, the Financial Review, which is not renowned for its embellishment of a particular mess, got it spot-on when earlier this week it described the sale process and the various mismanagements of this Liberal government as akin to a John Cleese training movie. In fact, it makes an episode of Fawlty Towers look good.
Today we have posed a number of critical questions to the two ministers responsible for Telstra in the Senate. For example, Senator Coonan, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, has been asked on a number of occasions whether the board informed the minister under the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 about the underinvestment by Telstra in its network in order to boost dividends and to fatten it up for sale. Senator Coonan avoided answering the question. She avoided acknowledging that she must have received documents from Telstra that would have shown that underinvestment was occurring and, in fact, that the artificial boosting of dividends was occurring. Why does the minister want to avoid acknowledging that she received that? Because it is convenient in relation to the government’s ideological obsession to sell Telstra. That is why she wants to avoid acknowledging that she received that. It suited the government for there to be a cover-up of the underinvestment in our telecommunications network in order to boost the dividends to fatten it up for sale.
As a result of the exposure of this secret Telstra report, which Minister Coonan and certainly the Minister for Finance and Administration would have read, largely but not exclusively we are seeing a significant drop in the Telstra share price. So, as the government wanted to cover up this information in order to artificially fatten the Telstra share price, and now that this approach has been uncovered through the release of this secret Telstra document, the share price has continued to slide. The mum and dad shareholders in this country are the victims of this government’s mismanagement of the Telstra sale obsession—an obsession of this government to privatise Telstra. The share price has now dropped to the low $4.30 mark, and there are predictions that it will drop even further, possibly below $4. If you were a purchaser of T2 Telstra shares—and there are well over a million of them in this country—you would be very disappointed with the drop in the share price from over $7 down to the $4.30 mark and possibly going down to below $4.
This has all come about as a result of the mismanagement by Minister Minchin, the finance minister, and Minister Coonan, and of course it is added to by the Prime Minister, who now apparently believes he can breach the law and instruct Telstra executives to boost the share price by talking the price up. The onus is on the Telstra executives and the board to disclose the truth, not, as the Prime Minister claims, to talk the price up to suit the government’s sale purposes and to try to get the share price up artificially back to the $5.25 mark, which is contained in the budget papers. This is a total shambles from beginning to end. (Time expired)

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2005-09-07,"—I also want to talk about the mums and dads that Senator Sherry has just talked about and I want to tell the Senate about the experience that the mums and dads had under Labor and the good experiences that they have had under the Howard government. There is no doubt that most Australians would agree that Labor’s telecommunications record in government was appalling, particularly with respect to regional services. For example, Labor’s record on mobile phones is shameful. Instead of extending coverage, Labor reduced coverage, something which Senator Sherry or subsequent Labor Party speakers cannot deny. Labor forced the closure of what at the time was a most extensive regional mobile network. The extraordinary mistake was rectified as a matter of urgency by the Howard government which required a replacement CDMA network to be rolled out. I am also particularly pleased to note that even Senator Conroy is beginning to see the error of Labor’s ways. Earlier this year he said:
Not all the decisions we’ve made in the past as a government were right.
A truer word has never been spoken by him or anybody else on the other side.
While Labor has recognised its mistakes of the past, it has not moved on. In the same speech earlier this year Senator Conroy made the extraordinary statement that the central plank of Labor’s telecommunication policy is its opposition to the privatisation of Telstra. How does Labor, for example, think it is going to regulate Optus or Vodafone or AAPT if it does not own them? It just does not make sense. Labor’s policy of Telstra is all over the shop.
During its 13 years in government Labor placed no requirements on companies to either install or fix phone services within any statutory time limits. Under Labor the most remote customers in Australia could expect to wait up to 27 months for a new phone line to be installed. Under the Howard government’s customer service guarantee no customer has to wait more than 20 working days for a new phone service. Labor tries to mislead people into believing that fundamental consumer safeguards are tied to the public ownership of Telstra. In reality—and it knows it—it is the legislated universal service obligation that guarantees telecommunications access for all Australians.
On the other hand it is good to have a look at what the coalition has achieved in this vital area of service delivery. Since 1996 the coalition has delivered unprecedented benefits to Australian consumers and businesses through the development of a highly competitive telecommunications regime. Research conducted for the Australian Communications Authority by the independent Allen Consulting Group found that the Howard government’s telecommunications reforms have increased the size of the Australian economy by more than $10 billion, created approximately 26,000 new jobs, delivered benefits to small business of $2.1 billion, and resulted in Australian households being on average $720 better off.
There are now more than 100 telecommunications carriers operating in Australia. That is good competition and it must be good for consumers. There are now more than 16 million mobile phones in operation in Australia, operating on a variety of networks, including Hutchison’s 3G network, and the number of broadband subscribers in Australia is now well over one million, and—surely, Labor senators opposite would have to acknowledge that this is a good sign for competition—almost half of Telstra’s ADSL subscriptions are wholesale services being resold by competitors.
If you have a look at that key section of the Australian economy and Australian society in regional Australia, regional Australians particularly have significantly benefited in the area of telecommunications under the Howard government. Since 1997 the Howard government has committed, and will spend, more than $1 billion on improving communications infrastructure and services in Australia. Most of this has been spent in regional Australia and, as senators opposite will know, more money has been committed recently. This expenditure covers a range of programs, including Networking the Nation, the Social Bonus, initiatives in response to the telecommunications service inquiry—known as the Besley inquiry—and the regional telecommunications inquiry, Estens. The most recent commitment was more than $180 million in response to the Estens inquiry.
In terms of specific regional achievements, the Howard government has provided more than $140 million to support the extension of mobile coverage to 98 per cent of the population. Under the coalition 40,000 customers living in remote Australia have received access to untimed local calls for the first time. In addition, these customers have been given the opportunity to take up subsidised two-way high-speed satellite internet services. Through the coalition’s customer service guarantee people now wait only 20 working days for a phone service or an interim service. As I said before, under Labor they had to wait up to 27 months. That is what this debate is all about: highlighting Labor’s mismanagement and failure in terms of this vital area of service delivery and policy development and comparing it to what the coalition government has achieved since 1996—a better deal for consumers in both urban and regional centres. It is about time that the Labor senators opposite faced up to that. (Time expired)

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2005-09-07,"—Again we are gathered here to talk about the issue of Telstra. Our questions today were directed mainly to Senator Coonan but also to Senator Minchin. The questions directed to Senator Coonan were looking specifically at the information that we were able to find out several weeks after the event about what information was shared between members of the executive of Telstra and the minister. Direct questions were asked about when information was shared and what the known information was, whether people knew exactly what the state of the Telstra budget was and how the dividends were being used—quite specific technical questions about what was going on in the management of Telstra.
The minister was very quick to tell us that the legal responsibility was with the board of Telstra to explain to people what was happening with the board. She consistently mentioned that the legal responsibility was with the board. In terms of the process and the understanding of the legislation, it seems to me that we as the major shareholders of Telstra at the moment need to know what is going on before we go through the sham of the committee and the vote that is going to happen—before the end of this fortnight we have been told. We are the major shareholders of Telstra at the moment and it seems to me that we need to know what is going on and exactly what is happening in Telstra now.
That is the relationship that we have been told will go out to the Australian people. To all those people who are emailing and writing and telling us how concerned they are about what is going to happen to Telstra after the government gets its way and sells it off, we have been told that there will be in place strong regulation and strong limitations on what this particular company—the new privatised Telstra—will be able to do. We have been told that the community is to trust the organisation. There is to be built up a position of trust and the universal service regulations and the obligations will be in place and that of course the people of Australia will not be worse off—in particular, the people of regional Australia will not be worse off. We have been told that there is no need for further consideration by any committee process because we have already heard all those arguments and the government are certain and convinced that they will have in place sufficient regulation and understanding.
I do not think the people have heard that message effectively—certainly the ones who are contacting my office have not. I know they are also contacting everybody else’s office because you can see that on the emails containing these questions, these concerns, these cries from people who are worried about what is going to happen to their service delivery in the future. The emails are being directed to all representatives from all parties in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. These people are saying that they do not have a particularly strong trust in what is going to happen in the future. It is worrying when we hear that even now, in the relationship between the board and the minister, that real issue of trust is one that we need to work on. Certainly, the board of Telstra has a legal responsibility to be honest with the community about what is going on so that we know exactly where Telstra stands now.
We say that that situation should be so clear and so firm that of course we know exactly what is going on with the financial arrangements of the company, we know exactly how service delivery will be maintained and we know exactly what will happen to the staff who are working in that agency. Senator Minchin gave answers to questions on what was to be the future of the superannuation process for a number of staff. We have already been told, through various questions and answers in the media, about the expected loss of staff numbers in the agency, which is very worrying. It comes at the same time as the government are saying to the people of Australia: ‘Don’t worry; service delivery will be maintained. You will still be able to access services no matter where you are.’ They say that regardless of a number of inquiries that we have had over the last years where it became clear that people were not happy with the way service delivery was operating. They wanted security. In fact, they needed security in their telecommunications. We have talked about that before.
We are concerned, and I think the people of Australia are concerned, that there is such a commitment to selling Telstra. It has become almost an item of faith for the government that they must sell Telstra to fulfil whatever obligations they have. Nothing will stand in their way. It does not matter how the operations are going. It does not matter what the financial position is. The commitment to sell Telstra is there. The minister was saying today that the questions are getting sillier and sillier. What is happening is that the questions keep coming, because the people need to know about the security of telecommunications and about future directions. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,5,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2005-09-07,"—I will wrap up this absurd debate—a debate that has been going on for many years now. The opposition are no better now than they were at the time of the first sale of Telstra. Senator Moore, I will pick up just one of your points in the limited time that I have. You say that you cannot trust Telstra in the future to implement the universal service obligation or the customer guarantee. You do not have to trust the board of Telstra one way or the other. The point is that it will be law. It will be legislated and regulated, Senator Moore. As a matter of law, there will be penalties imposed that will go straight to the licence of any communications carrier. So it is absurd to say that we need to trust a future independent board of Telstra, because in fact it will be regulated by the law of the land.
I would like to address the sheer opportunism that the opposition has displayed this whole week with regard to the Prime Minister’s comments. That is what Senator Coonan was talking about: how silly this debate has become. This debate has been reduced to the desperate, the shriek, the hysterical, when you grab the perfectly normal comment made by the Prime Minister that the Telstra board should be talking up the company. That is perfectly consistent with what any board of any company should be doing—talking up the best parts of their company to point out to the market, to their shareholders, the benefits of the company. That does not mean not to tell the truth at all. The Prime Minister’s comments were consistent with what is the responsibility of every board.
Also, paying dividends out of a company’s reserve is quite a normal process. In fact, I am informed that 14 of the top 100 companies are doing that right now. They are paying out dividends, over and above their recorded profit, from their reserves. There has been no better friend to the mum and dad investors than this government in its nearly 10 years in government. The share market has, in that 10 years, reached extraordinary heights and broken records. It has brought new wealth to the mums and dads. There have never been more mum and dad investors in the share market than there have been over the term of this government.
As I said, this debate has reached its most hysterical point as we close in on the final sale of Telstra. This will be my third debate on the sale of Telstra. I have seen T1 and T2. I guess you can call this the final sale of Telstra or T3. The debate has reached its most hysterical point, as none less than Senator Faulkner showed this afternoon when he addressed the chamber. He reached his full volume today. Senator Faulkner was most scary when he said, as the Labor Party have all been saying, that this debate is being closed down and that they have not been given enough time to debate this issue. What a load of nonsense! We have faced the people on this issue at four elections. On each occasion the Labor Party attempted to make it a central plank of the election, but on each occasion they were rejected. But, more than that, we have had some 11 inquiries into telecommunications, two primary inquiries by the Senate into the sale of Telstra, and of course we have had the Besley and the Estens inquiries.
This has been the most debated and scrutinised legislation ever to go through the parliament. It surpasses almost all those other debates that we have had—for example, on native title—but not that which we had on the Commonwealth Bank, which you sold. You made a commitment to the people of Australia that you would not sell it. You went to an election on that. Do you know how many days you gave this chamber to inquire into the 70 per cent sale of the Commonwealth Bank? Five days. So do not come in here and say that we are cutting the debate short on the final sale of Telstra. It is a load of nonsense. The processes are being followed and there will be debate.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,5,1,speech
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2005-09-07,"—I rise to take note of answers given to questions asked of Senator Coonan in question time today. We heard the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts in question time tell the Senate that it is not the government’s job to know whether Telstra has made appropriate disclosures in its company report. She said that the government would not necessarily even know what Telstra was disclosing. We say, and we have tried to emphasise this here today, that what Senator Coonan says is not her job is, in fact, the job of the government to find out. The government are the ones who are telling the Australian people that Telstra services are up to scratch. They are the ones who are telling the Australian people, and fooling Nationals such as Senator McGauran and others, that there is a proper strategy in place for rolling out decent communications around the country. The government are in charge. The government ought to know—they ought to have made these things known to themselves—and once they had found out this information they should have passed it on to the public.
The government are really bitter and annoyed because they have this driven view that they must privatise Telstra. It is this driven view that is causing them to want to talk up Telstra—that is, not tell the truth about Telstra but talk up its operations, talk up the situation with regard to faults and say that everything is perfect out in regional Australia—in order to be able to sell Telstra, in order to brainwash the Nationals into supporting the government legislation that we are told will be introduced later this week, if not today, and that we will be required to vote on in the next week or so.
What do we know? We know that a document is now circulating which has such details as 14.3 million fault calls currently per year for Telstra and more than 14 per cent of all lines with faults. There is also a concern that Telstra has an ageing work force. This document clearly demonstrates that the government has lied to the Australian people. It lied to the Australian people in the course of the last election when it said to them that services in regional Australia were up to scratch. The document says that the company has been systemically stripped through dividends in order to prop up the share price for privatisation. We see, as a result, that investment in infrastructure, services and training has been neglected.
Most importantly, it is pretty clear that highly market-sensitive information that was made available to the majority shareholder of Telstra a month ago was not disclosed to the mum and dad shareholders, the poor minority shareholders—the ordinary mums and dads. Whether or not there is a legal obligation on the government to do so, clearly the government had a moral obligation to advise those mums and dads who are shareholders in Telstra, who bought those Telstra shares in good faith and who rely on the company doing well so it can return significant dividends to them. If this information was in the hands of the government, it should have disclosed it, if it acknowledges that it has a moral obligation to do so, to the mums and dads out there. This information was available to the big end of town but not to the ordinary Telstra shareholder.
What we see today from the Telstra data is what Labor has been saying for years and years: investment is declining in the Telstra network, it is deteriorating and faults are increasing. What we see is the truth that we have been trying to bring to light and that the government has been trying to cover up. This is what it lied about to the Australian people at the last election. It is now quite clear that the situation is much worse than the government has been prepared to admit.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2005-09-07,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that 15 sitting days after today I shall move:
That the following delegated legislation be disallowed:
Crimes Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 1) as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 81 and made under the Crimes Act 1914 [F2005L01124]

I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—

Crimes Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 1), Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 81

These Regulations prescribe certain laws of Queensland concerning forensic procedure as ‘corresponding law’ for the purposes of section 23YUA of the Crimes Act 1914.
Section 17 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 directs a rule-maker to be satisfied that appropriate consultation, as is reasonably practicable, has been undertaken particularly where a proposed instrument is likely to have an effect on business. Section 18 of the Act provides that in some circumstances consultation may be unnecessary or inappropriate. The definition of ‘explanatory statement’ in section 4 of the Act requires an explanatory statement to describe the nature of any consultation that has been carried out or, if there has been no consultation, to explain why none was undertaken. The Explanatory Statement that accompanies these Regulations makes no reference to consultation. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on whether consultation was undertaken and, if so, the nature of that consultation.

Social Security (Means Test Treatment of Private Trusts—Excluded Trusts) Declarations 2005 [FACS] dated 26 April 2005


Social Security (Means Test Treatment of Private Trusts—Excluded Trusts) Declarations 2005 [DEWR] dated 29 April 2005


Social Security (Means Test Treatment of Private Trusts—Excluded Trusts) Declarations 2005 [DEST] dated 17 May 2005

These Declarations were made by the Secretary of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations on 29 April 2005, the Acting Secretary of the Department of Education Science and Training on 17 May 2005, and the Secretary of the Department of Family and Community Services on 26 April 2005. Each instrument revokes a previous Declaration and specifies classes of trusts that are excluded trusts. The title of each Declaration is identical, and the substance of each Declaration is nearly identical.
The instrument made by the Secretary of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations contains a sunset clause that provides for the cessation of the Declaration on 30 June 2006. The equivalent instruments prepared by the two other Departments do not contain such a clause. The Committee has written to the three Ministers seeking advice on the reason for this difference and whether there is any possibility that instruments having the same purpose might come to operate for different periods of time in relation to different clients or Departments.
The Committee has also sought advice on the process for proving that a relevant trust is an excluded trust.
The Committee has received some advice and is awaiting further information to allow it to finalise its consideration of these Declarations.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,NOTICES,6,1,speech

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-09-07,"—The developments of this week have caught out the government in its failure to be open and honest with the Australian public and Telstra shareholders over the sale of Telstra. In the same week as it has tried to rush through its extreme plans to sell Telstra, against the wishes of the vast majority of the Australian public, the government’s incompetence and mismanagement of telecommunications policy has blown up in its face. The events of this week have revealed the effects of nine long years of deception from the Howard government regarding the sale of Telstra. After staunchly telling the Australian public for almost a decade that all was well with Telstra and that services were up to scratch, the developments of this week have caught the government out. Yesterday Labor revealed a secret briefing document that Telstra provided to the government on the state of Telstra’s business. This document was a damning indictment on the impact that the government’s privatisation agenda has had on Telstra. The report outlines the fact that in the last two years special dividends have stripped $1.9 billion out of Telstra. It is clear, even to the casual observer, that the object of this dividends strategy was to prop up Telstra’s share price in the short term. It is clear that the object of this policy was to encourage investors to buy Telstra shares not because they thought they were a good buy but because they would receive a juicy dividend from them in the short term.
We all know why Telstra decided to pursue this policy. While the government has stridently insisted in the past that it does not interfere with the day-to-day operations of the management of Telstra, it is obvious to all who are following this debate that Telstra’s dividend policy has been pursued in the furtherance of the government’s privatisation agenda. The impact of this policy on Telstra’s consumers and its long-term share price has been disastrous and this week the government has reaped what it has sowed. As has been recognised in the past by the Minister for Finance, the pursuit of an extremely generous short-term dividend policy undermines the capacity of the company to make capital investments.
Telstra’s briefing document confirms that the dividend policy implemented by Telstra in pursuit of the government’s privatisation agenda has left it without the cash to invest in infrastructure and to improve services to regional and rural Australia. The report concedes that over the past few years Telstra has failed to make the necessary investments in its network. The report also states that the consequences of this underinvestment have been dramatic. Telstra’s report reveals that, as a result of this strategy, Telstra has received 14.3 million fault calls on its lines and that 14 per cent of all Telstra’s lines have faults. Let me repeat that: 14 per cent of all Telstra’s lines have faults. In total, 1.4 million Australians currently have a faulty telephone line because Telstra has underinvested in its network as it has tried to prop up its share price in pursuit of the government’s privatisation agenda. Even worse, because Telstra had returned so much of its capital to shareholders instead of investing in new markets, it has now realised that it will not have sufficient revenues in the future to continue these dividends.
To make matters worse, when Telstra told the government this, what was the reaction of the Prime Minister? He shot the messenger. He called the messenger a disgrace. He attacked Mr Trujillo and blamed him for the problems facing Telstra. Mr Trujillo is not to blame for the current mess that Telstra is in; he has only been at the helm for two months. The real culprit for the mess that Telstra is in is the Howard government. It is the consequences of the Howard government’s extreme privatisation agenda that are to blame for this situation.
So after trying to blame Sol Trujillo for Telstra’s problem, the Prime Minister then reverted to form and tried to avoid his own responsibility for the disaster that has affected Telstra’s shareholders and consumers. He is the one who handpicked the Telstra board. He is the one who encouraged them to prop up the share price by draining reserves to strip the company of billions through inflated dividends and share buybacks. This is a company that has underinvested in its own network to the tune of at least $3 billion. It has 1.4 million faulty lines. It has IT systems which are simply incapable of supporting new products.
Labor says that, as the majority shareholder in Telstra, the government has a moral obligation. It was obliged to make small shareholders aware of the parlous state—welcome, Senator Barnaby Joyce! We invite you to join in. We invite you and the $7 billion woman over there to participate. We are very pleased to see you. There are 1.4 million faulty lines. That is going to take more than your shonky $200 million a year to fix—your bandaid $200 million a year.
—That is the first time you have diverted from the script.
—Go back to your script.
—It might have helped if you had stuck to your guns with the $7 billion woman next to you. You recommended $7 billion in the Page Research Centre’s report. That was a great way to fill in three months while you were waiting to take your seats—a great waste of time, a complete sell-out, a complete pretence.
Government senators interjecting—
 (Senator Marshall)—Order! Senator Conroy, please address your remarks through the chair, and I ask other senators to cease interjecting.
—I accept your admonishment, Mr Acting Deputy President. The fact that the revelation of the truth would undermine the government’s privatisation plans does not absolve them of this moral responsibility. The Prime Minister sat back and let speculation in the marketplace take place, he let shares be traded and he let Telstra’s mums and dads take a bath simply because he could not afford to have the truth be confirmed. This is too important to the mum and dad shareholders, consumers and the Australian economy to be swept under the carpet.
As Telstra acknowledged in its briefing document that it gave the government on 11 August, the company has:
... systemic weaknesses and vulnerabilities that have far reaching implications and need to be recognised and addressed—not only for the future of T3 but also for the future of Telstra itself.
But the idea of a moral obligation is a foreign concept to the Prime Minister—not normally for Senator Brandis, but for the Prime Minister, the ‘rodent’ as Senator Brandis affectionately refers to him, the idea of a moral obligation is a foreign concept.
At his press conference today, he looked like he needed a dictionary to work it out. Like a drowning man searching for a life raft he sought refuge in the provisions of the Telstra Corporation Act. The Prime Minister claimed that under a provision of the Telstra act, allegedly introduced by the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, the government was not able to disclose the information it obtained in its private briefing with Telstra.
—Are Labor going to sell or not? What side are you on?
—We will be on the no side, Senator Joyce. I know you are new to the chamber but what will happen is that the bells will ring. That means you have to come and vote. The people opposed to the privatisation of Telstra will sit on one side of the chamber and that will be us: the Labor Party, the Democrats, the Greens and probably Senator Fielding. We will all be sitting on one side of the chamber. Do you know how you will know that you are voting yes? You will be sitting on the other side of the chamber.
Government senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Conroy, please address your remarks through the chair. I again ask other senators to cease interjecting.
—You will very easily be able to tell because for the third, fourth and the fifth time that the government has moved a bill to sell Telstra, Labor will be opposing it. Senator Joyce went to the election and he told Queenslanders that he was going to oppose it. At least you, Senator Nash, did not fall for that one. At least you, with a clear conscience, can rat on the constituents of New South Wales. At least you have got a clean conscience; you did not promise to oppose it. I give you some credit, Senator Nash.
—You can give me credit for the biggest telecommunications deal of all time.
—What happened to the $6 billion?
—I can explain it to you.
—Excellent. I am looking forward to it. Even Senator Coonan and the Prime Minister will not get on board the $6 billion but you keep on peddling it, Barnaby. There is not one commentator in the country, not one journalist, not one other senator in the building who wants to tie themselves to it—and the PPP $6 billion is on the way. You go for it, Senator Joyce.
Like a drowning man searching for a life raft the Prime Minister sought refuge in the provisions of the Telstra Corporation Act. He claimed Kim Beazley introduced the obligations. We again heard this trotted out by Senator Coonan. Both of them got it wrong. The relevant provision, section 8AW, was introduced by John Howard in 1996 as part of the T1 sale, strike one. More importantly, there is nothing in the section that would prevent the government disclosing the information contained in the briefing paper that they received, especially to ASIC, the corporate regulator.
—That is not correct.
—That is the case; it is. So this was just a distraction thrown out. Feel free to read it, Senator Brandis. Our esteemed tax avoiding QC can stand up and give us a rundown—
—You are a disgrace!
—It is a court case. He had to pay the fine; not me. He paid the tax fine.
 (Senator Marshall)—Order! Again, I ask senators to cease interjecting. Again, Senator Conroy, please address your remarks through the chair.
—Senator Brandis is one of my favourite senators. I know you are going to become one, Senator Joyce, but Senator Brandis tips you at the moment. When you actually read what the section says, as opposed to what the Prime Minister claims it says, Senator Brandis, I know you are going to support the Prime Minister as you always do. He sends you into the chamber to bail him out. We know what you said at the Liberal Party bribes meeting. We know what you said about the rodent at the meeting. You said, ‘I’ve got to go in there and rescue the rodent again.’ Here he is again, rescuing the rodent from his own misreading of the legislation and his false claim about the Leader of the Opposition.
ASIC could have been informed because they are public servants. They are officers of the Commonwealth.

Senator Wong interjecting—

—We have got so much form on selling Telstra; we have only voted against it five times! We should not allow the Prime Minister to turn this into an argument about the legal interpretation. The key issue here is one of moral obligation, not of legal obligation. All John Howard had to do was say to his hand-picked board: ‘Guys, it’s time to tell the truth. Senator Barnaby Joyce would actually like to know the truth.’ And I think Senator Barnaby Joyce would like to know the truth about the state of affairs in the Telstra network, because I do believe that, deep down, he cares about it.
Yesterday the Prime Minister picked up the phone to tell his mate Mr McGauchie to get the Telstra executives to talk the stock up. As the Financial Review today noted, he actually asked them to breach the Corporations Act. Come on down again, Senator Brandis! Help the rodent out of this one as well. The obligation of the directors and officers is to tell the truth, not to simply propagandise on behalf of the government’s privatisation agenda. How much easier would it have been for the Prime Minister to ring up the chairman and ask the company to actually comply with the law? Of course he did not, though. It is pure political expediency. All he had to do was pick up the phone and say, ‘About the briefing you gave us on 11 August, I have seen that there have been some comments about how some of the issues in the briefing have gone public.’ All he had to do then was say: ‘I think it is now a market-sensitive issue. We have the information. It has been speculated on in the media. There are journalists who have been given copies of the briefing. Analysts have been given copies of the briefing. We think you should come clean.’ Why should he have done this? Because, when he encouraged investors—mums and dads of Australia—to buy T2 at $7.40, he told them it was a good deal; he encouraged them into this stock. He sat back for the last month at least and allowed trading to be going on while mum and dad Telstra shareholders have taken a bath.
—You have attempted to run the shares down.
—Oh, please! It is our fault today, is it, Senator McGauran? I thought it was the disgraceful Telstra management, or did you get your lines wrong? (Time expired)

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2005-09-07,"—If there is one thing the debate in the last couple of days has demonstrated beyond argument, it is the absurdity of the situation in which the government continues to be a majority shareholder in Telstra. As Senator Minchin said in question time today, there are impossible conflicts in a situation in which the government, which is the repository of certain functions under the Telstra Corporation Act—including the receipt of information from the Telstra board itself—is also the majority shareholder.
Under division 3 of the Telstra Corporation Act, with which Senator Conroy is unfamiliar, there are obligations imposed upon Telstra to report information to the government. The things that the board of Telstra has to report to the government include its corporate plan. They include significant events which may or may not be market-sensitive information. They are the very sort of information which no board could, under the ordinary Corporations Act, report to a substantial shareholder to the exclusion of other shareholders without being in breach of the Corporations Act. But what do we find in section 8AI of the Telstra Corporation Act? We find that those bizarre obligations are exempted both from the provisions of the Corporations Act and from the general law. So you have this extraordinary situation in which there is a statutory obligation on Telstra to provide information that would not ordinarily be disclosed to the market or to other shareholders to one shareholder, namely, the Commonwealth government. It is conduct which, but for this act, would be the most flagrant breach of the Corporations Act. There is this inconsistency built into the legislation. It puts the company into a totally false position.
On 11 August, at this meeting of which we have heard so much during the course of the debate, Mr Trujillo and other senior officers of Telstra had a discussion with the Prime Minister and other senior members of the government and, in fulfilment of Telstra’s obligations under division 3 of the Telstra Corporation Act, they provided the Prime Minister with certain information—arguably market-sensitive information. That is certainly what ASIC seems to think. We have heard Senator Conroy ignorantly say that the Prime Minister ought to have revealed that information to the general public. I say ‘ignorantly’ because, when Senator Conroy makes that argument, he does it in ignorance of section 8AW of the Telstra Corporation Act, which specifically prohibits the recipients of reports under division 3 of the act from passing it on to others, to the general public or to other shareholders, except in defined circumstances.
What are those defined circumstances? They are that information provided under division 3 may be used in entering into or carrying out a Telstra sale scheme. That is a defined term, and, on any view, the discussion between Mr Trujillo and the Prime Minister was not that. Under section 8AW(3), we see that the information might be disclosed in formulating a Telstra sale scheme. On any view, the conversation between Mr Trujillo and the Prime Minister was not that. Another exception is created in subsection (4):
If subsection (2) or (3) does not apply, the Commonwealth, or an associated person, may use or disclose the information for a purpose in connection with the Commonwealth’s capacity as a shareholder in Telstra, so long as the use or disclosure does not involve giving the information to a person who is not an associated person.
This is the point that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan, was at pains to make in question time today, but of course the Labor Party, who are not interested in where the legal rights and wrongs of this situation lie, were not prepared to listen to what she was saying. The Telstra Corporation Act specifically prohibits somebody like the Prime Minister, who has received information of the kind which, it is now common ground, was revealed to him on 11 August, from disclosing it except in the defined circumstances of section 8AW, of which on any view this was not one. So it is just a nonsense. It is absurd to say that the Prime Minister did something wrong by obeying the law. It is absurd to say that the Prime Minister did something wrong in not disclosing this information to the market, when the very act that establishes and regulates Telstra prohibited him from revealing it to the market.
We even heard Senator Kirk before, who—and, if I may say so, Senator, as I know of your legal background I am a little disappointed in you; perhaps you had not read the section closely—suggested that if the Prime Minister did not have a legal obligation to disclose, he certainly had a moral obligation. Not so, Senator Kirk, not so. The Prime Minister not only did not have a legal obligation to disclose, he had a legal prohibition against disclosing. He would have been breaking the law if he had disclosed, as any of the participants in the meeting on 11 August—this celebrated meeting—would have done.
Listen carefully, Senator Allison, because I hope you are not going to say a few loose and untidy things when you participate in this discussion, as the Australian Democrats usually do. Just stick to the law. The law prohibited any participants in that meeting from making the disclosure that Senator Kirk and other Labor senators, including Senator Conroy, have declared they had a moral obligation to make. How can they have a moral obligation to breach the very statute itself? It is as simple as that. The Prime Minister, in saying nothing about the matter, was complying with the prohibition contained in section 8AW of the Telstra Corporation Act.
That is not the same question, of course, as to whether or not Telstra should have disclosed that information to the market at that time. Arguably, they should have—arguably. That is the matter which the Australian Securities and Investment Commission is now looking at. But if there was an obligation to disclose, it lay upon the party which did not suffer a legal prohibition against disclosure—that is, Telstra, not the members of the government.
There are a couple of other things that I want to say, because the Prime Minister is being chastised for having said that the comments, particularly of Mr Burgess, were outrageous. He is being chastised for saying in the House of Representatives, ‘I think it is the obligation of senior executives of Telstra to talk up the company’s interest not to talk them down,’—as if there is something wrong with saying that.
The obligation of directors and senior officers of a corporation is, first and foremost, an obligation to the corporation itself. So much is quite clear from section 181 of the Corporations Act. Beyond that, directors and senior officers also have an obligation to the shareholders of the corporation. They are fiduciaries. They have, as Senator Kirk, Senator Wong and you, Mr Acting Deputy President, know perfectly well, a fiduciary obligation to protect the shareholders’ interests. Wherein lie the shareholders’ interests? They lie, first and foremost, in the value of their asset—the value of their shares. That is where the Commonwealth of Australia and all the other shareholders of Telstra do have a commonality of interests. How can it not be a violation of the obligation to protect the interests of shareholders gratuitously to talk down the value of the shareholders’ assets? That is what Mr Burgess did. His remarks were foolish, fatuous and feckless. He was rightly chastised by the Prime Minister for doing so. The sooner this impossibly conflicted position is removed, the sooner Telstra can return to ordinary commercial operations and the sooner these problems will disappear.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,13,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-09-07,"—It will surprise Senator Brandis to know that I agree with him. The Democrats have been saying that all day, Senator Brandis—that it is true that the Prime Minister did not have an obligation to reveal that information to the rest of the shareholders. It was certainly not the Prime Minister’s obligation, moral or otherwise. However, what he did have an obligation to do was to advise Telstra as the major shareholder that this information was not market sensitive—and I will go through why it was not market sensitive in a moment—and that it should be revealed to all of the shareholders, the public, the Stock Exchange and everybody else who needs to know about these matters. That is the obligation. It is all very well to come in here and quote chapter and verse out of the Corporations Act, but what we are talking about here is the government having very damaging information to hand in a report that it received from Telstra—in fact, part of the negotiations that Telstra was hoping to engage in with the government.
Let us just run through those so-called market-sensitive pieces of information. There is a table in this report headed ‘the problem’ and ‘what is required’. The first of those dot point problems was: ‘Received 14.3 million fault calls (over 14 per cent of all lines have faults).’ If Senator Brandis can explain to me why he thinks that is market sensitive I will be pleased to hear it, but it seems to me to be downright about the problems of Telstra in delivering services. The second point is: ‘Replacement of obsolete or non vendor supported equipment.’ What is required? ‘Replacing the obsolete equipment and technologies.’ Then there is ageing of the work force and lack of training of new workers. What is the solution? ‘Investment for tools, equipment and training to bring the work force to benchmark levels.’ The fourth dot point problem is: ‘Legacy IT systems not capable of handling the volumes and new services currently being offered.’ The solution is ‘investment in fixing and replacing IT systems to handle volume’. The proposal is:
Telstra and the government commit to build a world-class, high-capacity broadband infrastructure within 3-5 years.
That would give 98 per cent of Australian homes and businesses access to high-capacity next generation broadband service—six megabytes—and advanced services. Roll-out would begin as early as next year and the build-out would be completed in three to five years. It goes on:
The Government and Telstra, working together, would assume obligations to each other and to the public to build the network:
-    Telstra commits to provide next-generation ... broadband to 87% of homes and businesses ($3.1B)
-    Government covers the remaining 13% ($2.6B)
Pricing at nationally averaged prices (both retail and wholesale)
Everyone would benefit under this proposal. There would be jobs to do the build-out, jobs and productivity increases resulting from the build-out, greater choices for ICE—that is, information, communications and entertainment—more flexibility and more choices at home, at work and on the move. This proposal would spur economic growth, create new opportunities for rural and remote Australia and encourage genuine and sustainable competition. That is what the government did not want either this place, as we consider the matter of the sale of Telstra, or the other shareholders to know. And it did not want its customers to know either, because that is exactly what they are asking for. What they want is a plan that tells them when they will get broadband that is affordable, fast and modern and that reaches the vast majority of Australians.
The government has knocked that back. The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts today, in answer to my question, said, ‘No, we’ve got a better plan.’ The fact that it is only worth $1.1 billion in the first instance and then $100 million a year after that as a result of the interest on $2 billion and that that is well short of the proposal that Telstra is making seems to have gone by the minister in terms of her judgment as to what was the better plan. Let me tell you that customers would be delighted to know that there was actually a plan that Telstra has devised, and disappointed in the extreme that the government rejected that plan in favour of a far inferior plan which is not a plan at all. At least, we do not think it is a plan at all; we have not seen the details of it other than what is in Telstra’s proposal.
So all this stuff about the government having other ideas and the proposal falling through and the fact that the government just wants to put it under the carpet now and not let anybody know has fortunately been blown out of the water because everybody now knows what is in this report and everybody now knows that the government has rejected the most sensible proposal that could be on the books. That is the great pity of this debate. Whether the Prime Minister should have mentioned to Telstra that it was actually their obligation to let all the shareholders know about this appalling state of affairs, the underinvestment in infrastructure, the number of faults and all of that stuff ought to be out there in any case. Whether or not he told Telstra to do so is beside the point. The real issue here is Australia’s access to modern telecommunications infrastructure. That is what has been missing. That is what the Democrats have argued for, probably since 1996 when this government came to power.
Where is the plan? How do we know who is going to get what and when, and who is going to pay for it and how? We have never had any indication from the government that they were prepared to go down that path, despite so many complaints from people. I get them, so I am sure the government members do as well. There are the people who say: ‘The phone line keeps dropping out; it costs me a fortune. I’ve got to pay for it to be extended to my household from the exchange, and it’s a waste of time and money.’ There are people who say: ‘When are we getting fibre optics? When is something decent going to come down our street? When are we going to be able to access the sorts of services that are routine in many other parts of the world?’ That is the other point. The minister crows about how the uptake of broadband has been so successful in this country. That is only because we started from a very low base. Sure, people are applying for it but that does not mean that our rate of take-up is anywhere near comparable. In fact, we are No. 21 out of all OECD countries, and we have fallen backwards. That Telstra report reveals why. It is because of the underinvestment of money in infrastructure. (Time expired)

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2005-09-07,"—I rise to speak on the matter of public importance tabled by Senator Ludwig, discussing the failure of this government to be open and honest with the Australian public and Telstra shareholders over the sale of Telstra. This week, what we have seen is a litany of revelations in the public domain which demonstrate absolutely categorically and clearly this government’s failure to be open and honest with the Australian people when it comes to how it is handling Telstra and the extent to which the government has deceived the Australian public when it comes to Telstra.
What do we know? We know that on 11 August there was a briefing provided to the government by Telstra management—a briefing which went to quite a number of issues which I will come to shortly. It was a briefing which contained what is considered to be likely to be market-sensitive information. As a result of this and subsequent events, we now have an investigation by the corporate watchdog, ASIC. We know from public reports that the briefing included such gems of information as the fact that $2 billion to $3 billion in additional investment should have been spent over the last three to five years, that the IT systems of the company are not capable of handling the volumes and new services being offered, that Telstra received 14.3 million fault calls and over 14 per cent of all lines have faults, that retail sales on profitability decline has continued to accelerate and, perhaps most importantly, given that we are supposed to shortly be debating the legislation to enable the sale of Telstra, that Telstra is borrowing from reserves to pay dividends—that Telstra has an unsustainable dividend policy and that this has been disclosed to the government. Perhaps this is one of the most important things about the information which is in the public arena and which, frankly, suggests that this government has been party to a cover-up around a policy that it knows is unsustainable in order to keep the share price up and to try and fatten up Telstra for privatisation in its blind and ideological pursuit of a privatisation agenda.
In terms of the sequence of events, on 31 August Mr Phil Burgess made the comment, ‘I wouldn’t sell Telstra shares to my mother.’ Then on 4 September Senator Coonan said, ‘I don’t know whether or not there is such pressure on the share price that there would need to be any information given to the Stock Exchange.’ The minister responsible for Telstra, who some two or three weeks earlier had been given information that clearly went to the profitability and performance of the company, and clearly there was a reasonable argument that it was market sensitive and went to the issue of dividend policy, said, ‘I don’t know if there is actually any pressure on the share price such that there would need to be any information given to the Stock Exchange.’ The day after, on Sunday 4 September, Telstra announced that the government had been informed of a possible downgrade. Then on the Tuesday, ASIC announced its investigation.
It is important to remember the obligations in regard to continuous disclosure. There are provisions in the Corporations Act which require officers and directors of companies to continuously disclose appropriate information to the Stock Exchange. We also have the Australian Stock Exchange listing rules. Section 674 of the Corporations Act outlines the requirements as to continuous disclosure. The Stock Exchange listing rules say that, once an entity becomes aware of any information concerning it that a reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of the entity’s securities, the entity must immediately tell the ASX that information. No-one on the other side of the chamber has said, ‘We don’t think that this was information that was covered by either the continuous disclosure provisions of the Corporations Act or the Stock Exchange listing rules.’ I do not recall anybody saying that. The minister certainly has not gone down that path in her answers. The government are saying that they did not have to ensure that this was complied with. I will come to that shortly.
What have we seen since the events I have just outlined? From what is on the public record, we understand that this briefing was given to the Prime Minister, to Senator Coonan and, I believe, also to Senator Minchin, and that there was selective provision of this document to certain journalists—certainly it was in the public domain. There is a suggestion that it was given to some other bodies, but certainly it was not released publicly so that ordinary shareholders—families who bought Telstra shares—could have access to this information that was arguably going to have an effect on the share price. What have we seen since that time? We have seen the share price dive.
There are two very important questions this government is not answering. Firstly, after the government was briefed, why did it not ensure that the information was disclosed when, arguably, there was a very strong case for it to be disclosed under the ASX listing rules or the continuous disclosure provisions? The government has not answered that. What we have had in the parliament is a technical legal argument, ‘The Prime Minister could not actually disclose that because the particular division in the Telstra legislation, which talks about the provision of this information, does not enable him to disclose that.’ We had Senator Coonan in question time today saying something similar: ‘We don’t have the legal obligation to disclose.’ What the government is not answering is this: as the majority shareholder, if information was given to it that it knew ought to have been disclosed to other parties and ought to have been disclosed to the Stock Exchange—my colleague Senator Mason is smiling at me; I wonder if that means he agrees with me.
—I am always smiling.
—When the majority shareholder was in possession of that information, why didn’t it say in the meeting, ‘Is this information that you should be providing to the Stock Exchange and to the market in accordance with the law and in accordance with the listing rules?’ We have not yet heard from the Prime Minister or from any of the ministers responsible that that advice was given to the Telstra management. They say: ‘It’s not our fault. It’s not our responsibility.’ That is a case of, ‘See no evil, hear no evil.’ If the Prime Minister or Minister Coonan were of the view that it was appropriate for this information to be in the public arena, that this was information that actually was required to be disclosed under the act or under the listing rules, they should have said so to the Telstra management. As yet, we have not heard them say that. We have heard the Prime Minister—talk about compounding your errors—come out and have a whack at the senior executives of Telstra. We know that yesterday the Prime Minister advised parliament that he had told the chairman of the Telstra board, ‘The obligation of senior executives of Telstra is to talk up the company’s interests, not talk them down.’ It is pretty extraordinary when a Prime Minister of this country actually says, ‘We want you to talk up the company; that’s what you should be doing.’
—That’s unusual?
—Yes, actually it is unusual, because the legal obligation on the directors, of which the Prime Minister should be aware, is to act in the best interests of the company and in good faith and to disclose truthfully information to the market. It is not to talk up the company’s prospects so that you can fatten this company up for sale. It is not their obligation to do that. In fact, suggesting that they do it is arguably to suggest that they breach the Corporations Act. It is not just us who are saying this. I am sure that senators on the other side have read the financial press today. Peter Morgan of 452 Capital wrote:
I find the Prime Minister’s comment that it is the obligation of senior executives of Telstra to talk up the company’s interests, not to talk them down, very disappointing. If I were to make similar comments in public, I would expect to have the regulators around and disciplinary action taken quickly. Quite frankly, such comments are what you would expect from one of the corporate rogues of the 1980s, not the leader of Australia. Without a doubt, it is not the job of a management team to talk up a share price. It is their job to provide honest information to all investors so that they can make a fully informed investment decision.
That is pretty clear, isn’t it? What have we had in question time in this chamber and what have we had in this parliament from this Prime Minister? We have had no clear explanation of why the government did not require this information to be disclosed as it ought to have been. We have a legal argument that there was no legal obligation on the Prime Minister or on Minister Coonan, as joint majority shareholder, to require that the company disclose this information or even to encourage them to do so. What we do have is the revelation that was contained in the briefing that the dividend policy is unsustainable. We know that the dividend policy is one of the things in the corporate plan that, under the provisions of the Telstra legislation, the government receives a briefing on. (Time expired)

"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2005-09-07,"—It is quite extraordinary to continually hear Labor tell us how much they care about telecommunications and how much they care about telecommunications in rural and regional areas. Labor do not care about the bush. They are continually—they always have been and always will be—dominated by city interests and doing things in the interests of the cities. We only have to look at Senator Conroy to see a perfect example of this. He is supposed to be trying to run the Labor show on telecommunications, and I notice he has not even bothered to stay in the chamber to be part of this debate. He is the quintessential city slicker. He rarely gets out of Melbourne, unless he is coming to Canberra, and he is trying to tell this place that he cares about rural and regional Australia! He does not know where he stands on Telstra. He continues to contradict himself.
In just one interview yesterday, in the course of only a minute, Senator Conroy said that Telstra was ‘starved of capital and had not made the necessary capital investments to keep the company profitable’. ‘That is the real problem,’ he said. Less than a minute later, he said, ‘I mean, this is a company that under the current regulations has just posted the single largest corporate profit in Australia’s history—a few weeks ago—$4 billion.’ So which is it, Senator Conroy? He is not even here to answer. Is Telstra starved of capital and failing to maintain profitability or a rampant monopoly making enormous profits? You do not know where you are. On 28 July, he said:
Labor knows that the vast majority of Australians believe that the best way to ensure that Telstra provides reasonable services in rural and regional Australia is to keep it in majority public ownership.
Then, on 16 August, he said that the ownership structure of Telstra made no difference to most Australians one way or the other. So which one is it? Here is a senator who is trying to lead his side’s debate on telecommunications and he has no idea where he is on this entire issue.
The hypocrisy of Labor on this issue is nothing short of breathtaking. Who sold Qantas? Labor did. Who sold the Commonwealth Bank? Labor did. Make no mistake, they would sell Telstra too without doing anything to make sure that there is a way forward to improve services and infrastructure in our rural and regional communities. Their leader, Kim Beazley, has admitted that, as finance minister, he attended a meeting with BHP to discuss the sale of Telstra and that his department consulted with investment banks and prepared a strategy paper for a five-stage sale of Telstra. So we have Labor saying, ‘Don’t sell Telstra,’ and their leader is on the record as previously having discussed how to do it. It is absolutely hypocritical.
Labor, in government, were the party that forced the abolition of the analog network in 2000. They took absolutely no steps to secure a replacement. They left a huge mess in rural and regional Australia and, as a person of the bush, I remember only too well the effect that that had. All I can say is: thank goodness that this government took steps to put the CDMA network in place, which was the only thing that saved us. And Labor try and tell us that they care about telecommunications in the regions. They have no plan for improving service and infrastructure in the regions—none at all. They bleat on, saying, ‘Don’t sell Telstra,’ but they have no constructive ideas at all on how to improve telecommunications not only in the bush, but right across this nation.
Just saying, ‘Don’t sell Telstra,’ will not fix telecommunications services in the bush. What will fix telecommunications services in the bush is this government’s package that we are putting in place to deliver to the people right across this nation. I would like to make a few comments about that. The Howard-Vaile government has put forward a very honest and open package that addresses the key issues of competition, service delivery and infrastructure funding for telecommunications in the bush. Make no mistake, there is quite a simple comparison here: Labor has no plan; we do.
Under the Connect Australia program, $1.1 billion over the next four years will go to upgrading mobile and broadband internet services in regional Australia, and we expect to see a great deal of private sector investment going into the regions to make sure that we have the services and infrastructure we need. This government will spend $2 billion on a communications fund to future-proof regional telecommunications in the long term, help fund the roll-out of new technology and address areas of market failure. It is about getting those telecommunications technologies out there and in place to make sure that the platform goes forward into the future.
Make no mistake, the Howard-Vaile government has a plan. Labor has nothing: nada; not a thing. We plan to boost competition by ensuring the operational separation of Telstra, which will enable greater transparency through the separation of the wholesale and retail arms of Telstra. It will ensure a fair and level playing field for new players entering the regional telecommunications marketplace and it will allow other telecommunications companies to access the Telstra network on the same conditions as Telstra’s own retail arm. We should not under any circumstances allow a monopoly telecommunications carrier to operate in rural and regional Australia.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—If you listen, you might learn something and you might come up with a plan. A monopoly carrier will not provide the level of telecommunications services and infrastructure necessary to grow our regions in the future. Unlike the Labor Party, this government realises that competition is the best mechanism to deliver services and infrastructure out into our rural and regional communities. We only ever hear bleating from the other side, who say, ‘Don’t sell Telstra.’ We hear nothing about the way forward for telecommunications. Under the current legislative framework, there is effectively little opportunity for competition to deliver other than basic telecommunications services, and there is little incentive for Telstra as the existing major provider to deliver services capable of carrying our regions into the future. Our rural and regional communities need a telecommunications platform that will take them into the future, and that is exactly what the package that the Howard-Vaile government is proposing will do.

Senator Wong interjecting—

—Labor has done nothing. You sit over there and bleat and carry on, but you have not done a thing except to switch off the analog network—which worked so well in the bush—and you had no plan whatsoever to actually put things in place. This government’s package will deliver competition, it will deliver services, and it will deliver better infrastructure out into the regions so that we will have a better telecommunications platform for everyone in Australia—not just rural and regional areas but everybody right across this nation. We have a plan, you don’t, and we are going to implement ours.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,13,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-09-07,"—This is very irresponsible of the Howard-Vaile government, or, to put it another way, the ‘veiled Howard’ government. The remarkable speech we have just heard from Senator Nash was a complete disappearance of everything that The Nationals have said they stood for in defending telecommunications in the bush over the years that I have been in this place. Central to that was the assurance that communications in the bush would be fixed up before any sale would be supported by The Nationals.
Let me read to the Senate the outcome of the secret report from Telstra which was dot pointed on the front page of today’s Canberra Times. Senator Nash might listen to this. Here is the situation that you are handing the government, on a platter, through acquiescence to the sale of Telstra:
Retail sales and profitability decline continued to accelerate.
Telstra received 14.3 million fault calls (over 14 per cent of all lines have faults).
Workforce is ageing and there is a lack of training in new workers.
IT systems are not capable of handling the volumes and new services being offered.
$2-3 billion in additional investment should have been spent over the past 3-5 years—
but wasn’t.
Telstra is borrowing from reserves to pay dividend.
Regulations to be imposed after the sale will stunt growth.
I do not think it has been worse. It has not been worse in the time I have been in this parliament. A report like that handed to regional and rural Australia is the opportunity for The Nationals to stand up. And what do they say? They have got a Future Fund which is not even equivalent to the shortfall of what should have been spent in recent years. The Prime Minister has said it will be good for us. This is a sell-out of the bush by The Nationals. Talk about the big city; The Nationals are selling out to the big end of town. This is The Nationals selling out to the big end of town while the bush can deal with all these problems. Millions of calls are coming in each month about the faults in the telecommunications system, and The Nationals roll over and say: ‘We’ll go with the government. We’ll sell out.’
Before the election The Nationals said, ‘We’ll stand by and have Telstra kept in public hands until the services are right.’ After the election they have rolled over to the Howard government, and not one of them has the gumption to stand up to it—not Senator Joyce, not Senator Nash. Not one of them has the gumption to stand up for the bush this side of the election. They get some biscuits; they collapse. (Time expired)

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2005-09-07,"—It is Groundhog Day in the Senate. In my time in the Senate there have been two great debates that have taken up an awful lot of time. The first was the debate on the introduction of a goods and services tax. The second, of course, is the sale of Telstra. On both occasions, the debates have been marked by hypocrisy from the Australian Labor Party. They are willing to sacrifice the medium- to long-term interests of this country for votes in the short term. They did it with the GST, and they will do it with Telstra.
I recall in the GST debate the sanctimony from the other side. When people like Mr Keating, Mr Beazley and former senator Gareth Evans were all in favour of the GST, this lot opposed it because they thought it would win them votes and they would coast to an election victory. It was against the medium-term interest of this country, and they were prepared to sacrifice it for votes. That is happening again with the sale of Telstra. Mr Beazley himself considered selling Telstra. He discussed it with investment banks.
—So did Mr Keating.
—And Mr Keating. They considered that Telstra should be sold. They thought that, as we moved into the 21st century, it was absolutely inappropriate that government should own Telstra. It was totally inappropriate. The government could not be both a player and a regulator. Yet, the ALP oppose the sale of Telstra, and they say it is because of concern for the bush.
I have never heard the ALP really being concerned about the bush. They do not hold any seats there, they never go there, and the inner-city swingers and bow-tie wearers never go there. The Liberal Party and The Nationals understand the bush. I accept what my friend Senator Nash said. I accept there is concern in the bush, and I understand that most Australians do not want Telstra sold. I agree with that, Senator Brown; you are right on that. I accept that. But they were also against the GST and they were also against the lowering of tariffs. But governments have to make decisions in the medium- to long-term interests of the country. That is where you fail, and that is where Labor fail. You are quite prepared, for short-term votes for a few inner-city trendies, to oppose it.

Senator Wong interjecting—

—No, Senator Wong, that is the problem. That is the difference between you and me, and between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. You opposed the GST and it was good public policy. The Labor Party opposed it and the Labor Party was wrong.

Senator Wong interjecting—

 (Senator Chapman)—Order! Senator Wong, you know that interjections are disorderly. You have had your opportunity to contribute to this debate; it is now Senator Mason’s opportunity.
—The Labor Party oppose good public policy for a few cheap votes. They did it on the goods and services tax and they will do it again on Telstra. It is pathetic. Even if we do privatise, the one thing about this government is that we have been honest with the Australian public about it. We have gone to four elections saying we will sell Telstra. The Australian Labor Party, however, always privatised by stealth. Remember Qantas. Mr Beazley said, ‘We’re not going to sell Qantas,’ and he sold a bit; ‘We’re not going to sell any more,’ and he sold a bit more, 49 per cent; and ‘But we’re not going to sell any more,’ and he sold the whole damn lot. It was the same with the Commonwealth Bank.
—What did he leave behind for the bush?
—What did he leave behind for the bush? In fact, what did he leave behind for the country? Nothing. There is not one legacy from the sale of those two great institutions. The difference is that the Australian Labor Party could not manage the economy. The living standards of the average Australian went down and unemployment went up. Those institutions were sold to pay the bill for Labor incompetence. That is the difference.

Senator Bob Brown interjecting—

—This time, when we sell Telstra, there will be a Future Fund, and it is to pay, Senator Brown, for the pensions of you, me and all the other public servants in this country and for other things. It is a good thing. It is better that we have a Future Fund than government continue to own Telstra. That is the difference.
Today we heard Senator Conroy, Senator Sherry and others in question time say, ‘The government said this,’ ‘Mr Howard’s complicit with Telstra,’ ‘They’re not doing the right thing by shareholders,’ ‘They’re fattening the calf,’ and so forth. That illustrates better than anything else why it is absolutely ridiculous for the government to own Telstra. It cannot be both a player and a regulator. It is inconsistent and ridiculous. You cannot be half pregnant, so they say. The only institution half pregnant in this country is Telstra. It cannot exist in this ridiculous twilight zone, as a pathetic hybrid where the shareholders are not being dealt with appropriately and Telstra cannot continue to invest. The current situation is absolutely untenable.
What is going to have to happen is for the Australian Labor Party to come to the party. They know that Telstra should be sold and that it is in the interests of the Australian people. While I accept that most Australian people do not want it sold, politics is about leadership; is not about cheap points. If anyone thinks the coalition are winning votes by selling Telstra, they are mad. We are not winning votes; we are doing what the country needs, just as we did with the introduction of the goods and services tax.

Senator Bob Brown interjecting—

—That is the difference, Senator Brown. Now everyone says the GST is a great idea. You opposed it, and now everyone thinks it is wonderful. I tell you what—in five years time the sale of Telstra will be the best thing this country ever did and it will be a great legacy of the Howard-Vaile government.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2005-09-07,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The tabling of this statement of corporate intent is not, it must be said at the outset, a matter of any great importance or consequence. In fact, the statement is little more than a glossy statement of mission and values. As such, it looks good and it is warm and friendly. Underneath that veneer, however, there are some real issues that need to be addressed. Those issues are revealed in much greater detail in the annual report of the corporation. The last of these, for the financial year 2004, was tabled late last year. On the basis of the 2004 annual report, we certainly look forward to reviewing the 2005 report when it is tabled in due course.
It is common knowledge that much has happened recently with respect to decisions on naval shipbuilding in this country. Putting aside all of the years of drama connected with the Collins class submarines, it does seem to be fair to comment that the future for the ASC is indeed a bright one. The corporate history and the whole sorry saga of a major defence procurement project way over budget and way over time are now, it must be said, matters for the past and matters of academic interest to historians. Unfortunately, though, we keep seeing the same pattern developing over and over again within the realm of defence procurement.
From the ASC’s viewpoint, though, we are pleased to see the state of its current corporate good health. Last year’s annual report showed a healthy profit stream. With the finalisation of the through-life support contract for the submarine fleet, that result should continue. Indeed, it would be surprising if it did not. Certainly as a centre of excellence for submarine construction and maintenance, the ASC has now established itself. That is a tribute to its board and to its work force. It goes without saying that the ASC has now become a base element of industry in South Australia. It is of course important for West Australian industry as well. It goes without saying that the ASC has now also become, and should be into the future, a major part of the Australian shipbuilding industry.
The successful bid for the three air warfare destroyers can, I believe, only be interpreted as a vote of confidence in the ASC. This massive project is important for a number of reasons. First of all, it will employ many Australians, all around the country. These ships are to be constructed in modular fashion in both the west and in New South Wales. These sections will be brought together at the ASC site in Adelaide, which is now being prepared for expansion. As a consequence of that, there will be demand for a whole new set of skills.
It should be noted, too, that the cooperative approach with the South Australia government will see a whole new phase of training begin. That was one of the commitments that that government gave to the Commonwealth as an aid to getting the project into South Australia. At a time when the motor vehicle industry in that state has taken some knocks, it is fair to say that this is a useful development. It is also pleasing to see that the government did not procrastinate with the question of local construction and the alleged price advantage of overseas options. No doubt the needs of South Australia had a part in that decision—as, one could say, given that the state is doing it tough, it should. No doubt establishing the company on a sound basis for future sale was also part of it.
But it is a great pity that, when it came to the decision to build the two amphibious lift ships, the same commitment was not forthcoming. In fact, the government has reneged on its election promise. That promise was unequivocal: both these ships were to be built in Australia with Australian labour. One might ask, then: what happened between the decision to tender in Australia for the three AWDs and the decision for these two heavy lift ships? As a warning shot to Australian industry to get serious on pricing, it may be a legitimate ploy. But let us hope it is only that. We as a nation have to take shipbuilding seriously. We need to recognise that, competitively, we will struggle with the gross construction task. That is of course simply a feature of relative cost structures around the world.
But where we can be competitive, to balance the issue, is in the value added components. The experience of the ASC in juggling competing technologies should be of great value. The learning curve of the submarines, while no doubt painful and expensive, should be an asset in this matter. We welcome these developments, and we will monitor them over time.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>ASC Pty Ltd</title>,DOCUMENTS,21,1,speech
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2005-09-07,"—I also rise to take note of ASC’s statement of corporate intent for the period 2005-08. The document outlines the future plans of ASC Pty Ltd, better known in its home state of South Australia as the Australian Submarine Corporation or Sub Corp. Of special mention in the document is ASC’s intention to prepare to build the three SEA 4000 air warfare destroyers. As Senator Bishop has mentioned, the ASC was awarded the contract as preferred shipbuilder for this $6 billion project earlier this year. It is certainly a welcome addition to the work of the ASC.
I note also that in order to get the nod from the federal government for the air warfare destroyer project, the South Australian based company had to fight off strong competition from other states, in particular from Victoria. Just as we beat the Victorians in the 2004 AFL grand final, we beat the Victorians in this fight and we won the main prize. And what a prize it is—a project that will provide additional employment for more than 1,000 people in South Australia and keep South Australia at the forefront of innovation in defence technology and manufacturing.
I note in the foreword to the document that the managing director of ASC, Mr Greg Tunny, says:
The progress made by ASC can be directly attributed to its people.
A truer word has rarely been spoken. The workers at ASC are to be commended on the work that they have already done on the Collins class submarine project. I know they are looking forward to the work that this new project is going to bring to them. I also mention a comment by Mr John Prescott, chairman of ASC, in a press release dated 31 May 2005. Mr Prescott said:
The company also recognises South Australia’s union leadership for negotiating a groundbreaking enterprise agreement.
That groundbreaking enterprise agreement he is referring to would be a collective bargaining agreement. That agreement was negotiated with the members of three trade unions: the AMWU, the CEPU and the AWU. Those three trade unions worked together with an enlightened management of ASC to come up with an agreement that set out the terms and conditions of employment for all the organisations tendering for the air warfare destroyer project—a collective union agreement that will provide companies tendering for this project with certainty about the employment conditions that will apply. It meant that those companies could work out exactly what kind of staffing requirements they would need. It is a collective union agreement that includes this provision:
The parties commit themselves to achieve a competitive advantage based on the utilisation of high skills, effective utilisation of technology and effective teamwork and flexibility.
It is a collective union agreement that says the union will cooperate to:
... ensure the ASC is internationally competitive.
All this from three trade unions who are also participants in the building industry. The very same building industry that has been the subject of a tirade of abuse from the government over the last few days. The very same building industry unions who have been attacked by the government over the last few days.
Those of us who do not live in an imaginary industrial world that the government has invented to justify its extreme ideological assault on working people know that unions, like the three unions quoted, and enlightened employers are reaching collective agreements every day that are all about making new and innovative industries competitive, modern and flexible. But the government would not know that because it is completely out of touch with the real world of working Australians and their unions. It is out of touch and hell-bent on imposing its extreme ideological agenda and arrogantly using the Senate majority to ram through its legislation.
I would like to congratulate the members of all the unions at the ASC on their efforts to assist the ASC win the air warfare destroyer project for South Australia. I look forward very much to seeing a future Labor Prime Minister, Kim Beazley, launch the first destroyer in the not too distant future. However, to get that destroyer built, we are going to need South Australians with the skills to be able to build it. At the moment, because of this government’s neglect of training, there is shortfall of some 270,000 people with the skills necessary to take forward Australia’s manufacturing industry. Fortunately, the unions in South Australia and the employers are working together to address that skills gap, and I am confident that the skills will be provided to enable it— (Time expired)

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2005-09-07,"—I also rise to take to note of the document. The document tabled states that there are over 1,000 ASC highly skilled and experienced employees and subcontractors, predominately located in South Australia and Western Australia. On 31 May this year, it was announced that the Osborne Maritime Precinct in South Australia was the chosen site for consolidation of the $6 billion air warfare destroyer contract. Not only will it be the site for the production of many of the air warfare destroyer modules, but South Australia will also undertake final assembly of the ships, as well as contribute towards the sophisticated systems integration, IT and electronics functions required by the project.
The South Australian Labor government has been prepared to make a major investment in skills and infrastructure at the site, amounting to $140 million. It will provide for South Australia up to 3,000 additional direct and indirect jobs, a major boost to the state’s economy over the next decade or more and the potential for new technologies and spin-offs to other parts of South Australian industry. The state’s $140 million investment includes a massive shift lift, transfer system, wharf and associated dredging; more than 30 hectares for subcontractors to set up operations on site and establish strong and efficient supply chains; a new on-site maritime skills centre that will train the work force to support the destroyer contract; $8 million to be spent on various work force and skilled migration programs; and a centre for excellence in defence industry systems capability—a partnership between the South Australian government, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation and the University of South Australia that will build strengths and capabilities in systems engineering and software systems research.
The ASC’s statement of corporate intent 2005-08 has as its vision:
To be Australia’s leading designer and builders of sophisticated naval vessels.
Surely this vision is only achievable if shipbuilding projects are carried out in Australia by Australian workers. Pre election, the Howard government told the Australian people that the air warfare destroyers and the amphibious ships would be built in Australia. The Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, gave an election promise on 5 October 2004 when he said: ‘The two amphibious ships, the largest ever operated by the Royal Australian Navy, will be built in Australia.’ Now the government says that it is only a preference for the amphibious ships to be built in Australia.
In a press release dated 11 August this year, the Howard government stated:
A Request for Tender will be released to the Australian shipbuilding industry in the second quarter of 2006.
Senator Hill said the ship builder would be determined once a thorough financial and technical comparison was made between Australian bids and overseas build options
“The Government’s preference is to see the ships built in Australia, however Australian industry will need to demonstrate it can deliver the project at a competitive price,” Senator Hill said.
This sounds like a government which is prepared to give up on jobs for Australian workers: skilled trade jobs, IT jobs and advanced manufacturing jobs—jobs that bring in real money, pay the mortgage, put the food on the table and pay the bills; jobs for Australian workers with real benefits for Australian workers and their families. We need to take advantage of every opportunity to secure the future of Australia’s shipbuilding industry. Any move by the Howard government to construct the Navy’s two amphibious ships offshore would be unacceptable and contradict the government’s election promise.
Senator Hill said the two shipbuilding projects—not one but both projects—would give enormous opportunities for growth in terms of naval shipbuilding capabilities across a range of trades and specialities. This will only occur if the amphibious ships are built in Australia by Australian workers. The government needs to commit to investing in Australian workers, in their knowledge and skills. It needs to honour its election promise and ensure the $2 billion amphibious ships project is contracted to the Australian shipbuilding industry.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>ASC Pty Ltd</title>,DOCUMENTS,21,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2005-09-07,"—Following on my from my two colleagues from South Australia, I can understand their pleasure at the construction of the air warfare destroyers being awarded to the ASC in South Australia. The ASC have a proven track record with the construction of the Collins class submarines, which are now recognised as being in a class all of their own. That has been demonstrated in various exercises that they have participated in over a long period of time. However, I think my colleagues have rightly drawn attention to the important issue of the replacements for HMAS Manoora and HMAS Kanimbla. That is going to be important for the defence shipbuilding industry in Australia.

Senator McGauran interjecting—

—I hear from Senator McGauran across the chamber, who seems all of a sudden to have become the new Minister for Defence. I do not know if Minister Hill is aware of that at this stage, but it is interesting to hear Senator McGauran intervene. As has been pointed out by my colleague Senator Wortley, Senator Hill made the point that at this stage the government have gone from saying that the ships will be built in Australia to it being a preference that the ships be built in Australia. Whilst one might understand the position the minister is coming from, it would be interesting to hear—if he gets time in this debate—whether Senator McGauran shares the same views as the minister or whether the minister is lagging behind Senator McGauran. I do not think the latter is likely to be the case.
However, what is really at risk here is the importance of a skilled work force in Australia able to support the building of a platform essential for our defence purposes. It is one thing to look at the designs that might be picked up from overseas, but it is another thing to ensure that those defence platforms are constructed in Australia using Australian labour and having as high an Australian content as one can possibly have to ensure that we are in command of our own future. There is nothing worse than trying to buy an off-the-shelf product and then finding that one’s nation is stranded, particularly in the important area of defence.
One would hope that, after nine long years in government, this government would have learnt to not just go down the path of a preference for Australian shipbuilding but to go down the path of insisting that Australian companies have equal opportunity to participate in the building of these two replacement ships that are going to be considered at in 2006. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2005-09-07,"—It is a great pleasure for me to speak in the adjournment debate tonight. I want to talk about a farcical situation in Victoria with the state government and their so-called fast trains. The Bracks Labor government continue to fail people in regional Victoria through continued disruptions to the state’s rail network. In a 1999 election promise, Steve Bracks and the Victorian ALP committed themselves to improving the Victorian regional rail network by providing Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo and Traralgon in the Latrobe Valley with fast rail links to Melbourne. Indeed, some would say they were elected on the basis of those promises to regional communities.
The state-wide estimated cost of the project was presented to Victorians as $80 million. It now exceeds $750 million and the farce of that will become clearer when I explain to the Senate just how much improved—or not improved—the rail links are. Certainly, the times have not improved. To date we have not seen one fast train run. Rather, we have seen cost blow-outs, construction timetable blow-outs and estimated travel time blow-outs. In particular, the Bendigo fast rail link was scheduled for completion in October 2004, nearly 12 months ago. That is a very interesting date, considering that the rail construction and improvement works are still being carried out on the Bendigo line. Currently, not only is there no fast train servicing Bendigo but, since 17 January this year, there have been no trains at all. Remember, this project was due to be completed in October 2004.
The people of Bendigo were told that, as part of the rail improvement construction, they would need to go without trains for 29 weeks. The people of Kyneton were told 12 weeks. These interruptions were meant to be in exchange for the far superior services to be provided by the promised sleek fast rail trains. These promises have since fallen apart. A document recently obtained by the Victorian Liberal opposition states that the promised periods of so-called minimal disruption would be extended to 11 months for Bendigo and nine months for Kyneton. So we have gone from 29 weeks to nearly 12 months and from 12 weeks to nine months—no rail services and another broken Bracks Labor promise. The new date for resumed services to Kyneton is 16 October. Bendigo will have to wait until 17 December before services are scheduled to be restored.
In case honourable senators think I have been a bit churlish talking about this at the end of the 12-month process, I advise honourable senators that, once the fast rail services commence, the promised 82-minute travel time between Bendigo and Melbourne will occur only once in the morning to Melbourne and once in the evening to Bendigo. For $750 million—nearly $200 million for Bendigo—you get two services: one down and one back. Should you miss these trains, supplementary services are expected to take 112.5 minutes. So much for the fast train. Senator McGauran is quite rightly shaking his head in utter disbelief. This is barely 2½ minutes off the standard V-Line travel times experienced before the fast rail project—I use the term ‘fast rail’ loosely—was undertaken. It is ‘snail rail’, not ‘fast rail’.
The original costing for the single express train in the morning and evening peak hours and the 2½ minute saving in travel time for all other commutes was $80 million, but then it was revised to $182.8 million—for the Bendigo project alone. That figure has increased again, to $208 million. So it is 2½ times the original cost and it still has the potential to continue growing the longer the project drags on. Services to Bendigo are further hamstrung by the Bracks government’s short cuts in attempting to provide the fabled fast rail.
The dual tracks between Sunbury and the township of Kyneton have the interesting honour of having only one of these parallel tracks upgraded for the fast rail trains in order to safely achieve their 160 kilometre per hour maximum speed. Between Kyneton and the regional centre of Bendigo, the once dual tracks have been torn out and replaced by a single fast rail track. Apart from three passing loops, the longest of which is 9.5 kilometres at Taradale, this rail line has been stripped back, bottlenecking a vital central Victorian rail link.
The fast rail project failure is quickly taking on the tag ‘farce rail’. Commuters are sick of the continued disruption. People living in Victoria’s regional centres are tired of waiting. Victorian taxpayers do not want to continue feeding this project with more and more funds without seeing the espoused benefits. The people of Victoria want the services they were promised—not this joke which the Bracks government is attempting to palm off as the first-class regional rail system promised to Victorians by the Victorian ALP in 1999. If this were their only broken promise, you might say that, in six or seven years, it is not too bad, but I intend to bring to the Senate’s attention a litany of broken promises by the Bracks Labor government.
On an entirely different matter—and this is not directed to Senator Coonan or Senator Moore—I received a letter the other day co-signed by our parliamentary colleagues in the other place, the Hon. Jim Lloyd and Mr Wayne Swan MP. They are behind a program of the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia called Be a Man. The letter states:
As many men die from prostate cancer as women die from breast cancer. Each year approximately 2600 men die from prostate cancer in Australia. These facts were news to many Australians when, in January this year, we launched the Be A Man campaign with some well known celebrities …
This is a very personal letter from these two gentlemen, who have suffered from prostrate cancer. As some honourable senators will know, I have also suffered from cancer, although not the same form as they had. The letter says:
Both of us were in our 40’s when we were diagnosed with prostate cancer. Neither of us knew the risks from family history despite one of our fathers dying from this disease.
The letter is addressed to all senators and members, and it finishes:
We would like your support in bringing this serious disease to the attention of Parliament. We have enclosed copies of Prostate News from PCFA and Beyond 50 the Australian Pensioners Insurance magazine which profiles this important campaign.
While I am not going to be talking about particular commercial enterprises during my time in this chamber, I think it is fair to give appropriate credit to the Australian Pensioners Insurance Agency, which has sponsored a $2 million advertising campaign. Given that our colleagues in the other place have referred to their contribution, I feel safe in doing so.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Victoria: Fast Trains</title>,ADJOURNMENT,22,1,speech
