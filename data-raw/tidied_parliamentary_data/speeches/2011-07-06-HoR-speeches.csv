Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga—Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (09:02):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


This bill contains a range of measures relating to income support and veterans' affairs payments, and disability advocacy services. It includes two budget 2011-12 measures, and one budget 2009-10 measure.




Disability support pension—impairment t
ables



The disability support pension is an essential element of Australia's safety net but it is vital that it supports the people who need it—those Australians who, through disab­ility, are unable to work to fully support themselves.


It is essential that the level of someone's impairment is assessed using the most up-to-date medical information.


The current impairment tables used in disability support pension assessments were last comprehensively reviewed in 1993 and are no longer consistent with contemporary medical and rehabilitation practices.


Over the years this has led to anomalies and inconsistencies which have distorted the assessment process.


For example, when hearing impairment is assessed, a person with a hearing aid is not required to wear it but someone who is having their sight impairment assessed must wear their glasses.


In the 2009-10 budget the government committed to updating the impairment tables. This is an important element of the government's reforms to the disability support pension to make it simpler, fairer and sustainable for those who need it.


An advisory committee of medical, allied health and rehabilitation experts, disability advocates, mental health advocates and relevant government agencies was estab­lished in 2010 to provide advice on updating the impairment tables. Following a rigorous process, the advisory committee has prov­ided a final report and draft revised tables to the government. 


The bill removes the current outdated impairment tables from 1 January 2012, and enables new impairment tables to be introduced through a legislative instrument. 


The draft legislative instrument that contains the revised tables, based on the advisory committee's report, will be released shortly for public comment. 


Putting the impairment tables in a legis­lative instrument allows them to be updated regularly in response to developments in medical or rehabilitation practice.


These revised tables have been developed following extensive consultation, and ongo­ing consultation will occur as they are implemented. 




Disability advocacy services



The bill also introduces a stronger quality assurance system for disability advocacy services to make sure that people with disabilities receive the best possible advocacy support.


The current quality assurance system has not changed since 1997, and the need for improved quality assurance for disability advocacy services has been highlighted in a number of reviews.


The bill introduces mechanisms indep­endent from government to assess the compliance of disability advocacy services against disability advocacy standards.


Development of a robust, quality assured disability advocacy sector will help meet the objectives of the National Disability Strategy, and will also help meet Australia's obligations under that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 


The third-party certification quality assurance system this bill introduces has been successfully in place for disability employment services since 2002. It involves people with disability at all levels in the system, including as members of audit teams.


The new quality assurance system has been successfully trialled and independently evaluated in consultation with the disability advocacy services sector. The evaluation recommended formal implementation.




Changes to income support payments



This bill also makes a number of changes to the social security law, and veterans' affairs legislation, in relation to bereavement allowance and special benefit, and the income and assets tests. The bill gives effect to a budget 2011-12 measure to enable parenting payment recipients to access bereavement allowance following the death of a partner. Historically, there was no financial advantage in transferring between these payment types. However, the introduction of the government's Secure and Sustainable Pension Reform package in September 2009 saw a substantial increase to the rate of some pensions, including bereavement allowance. Allowing a parent­ing payment recipient to transfer to bereavement allowance for a 14-week period, on the death of their partner, will provide additional financial assistance during a difficult time.


The bill also gives effect to another budget 2011-12 measure, to more closely align the rules for accessing special benefit for provisional partner visa holders with the rules for other newly arrived migrants.


From 1 January 2012, a class of visa holders determined by legislative instrument will be required to wait two years to be eligible for special benefit. This rule will not apply if the visa holder is able to demonstrate that there has been a substantial change in their circumstances after their arrival in Australia and they are in hardship.


Under current policy, provisional partner visa holders are able to access special benefit from when they are granted the visa and are in Australia if they can demonstrate they are suffering from 'financial hardship'. 


This is not consistent with other newly arrived migrants subject to the newly arrived residence waiting period, who need to demonstrate both 'financial hardship' and 'change in circumstance outside of their control' in order to access special benefit. 


Under these changes from 1 January 2012, provisional partner visa holders will need to demonstrate they have experienced a 'substantial change of circumstances beyond their control' in addition to financial hardship in order to access special benefit. 


These changes reflect the community's expectation that new migrants to Australia should be able to support themselves, or be supported by their families and partners unless they are impacted by circumstances outside of their control.


The new arrangements continue, however, to ensure adequate protection for vulnerable migrants on provisional partner visas, for example where there is domestic violence, death of a partner or an injury or accident after their arrival in Australia. 


The bill also makes changes to the social security law and veterans' entitlements legislation to enhance the integrity of certain asset-test exempt income streams. These amendments strengthen the existing rules that require lifetime and life expectancy income streams to provide an annual actuarial certificate, in order to gain the benefit of concessional treatment under the social security law. 


Currently, in order for holders of lifetime and life expectancy income streams to benefit from concessional treatment under the social security assets test and the Veterans' Entitlements Act, it is required that an actuary certifies that there is a high probability that the provider of the income stream will be able to pay the income stream for its full term. 


Currently, some social security customers, after submitting an actuarial certificate that fails to meet the high probability test, later seek to replace this initial certificate with a more favourable certificate that meets the high probability test, a number of times within a financial year. 


This bill clarifies that customers can only give the secretary (or the Repatriation Commission) one actuarial certificate for each financial year to show that the fund has sufficient resources to pay an income stream for its term. 


In the event that a person submits more than one certificate for a particular financial year, only the first certificate given will have effect, not any of the subsequent certificates. 


The amendments in this bill also address inconsistencies in the treatment of these income streams that have arisen over time. 



Finally, the bill also makes amendments to the social security law to clarify that payments made by an employer to an employee in lieu of notice of the termination of his or her employment are 'redundancy payments' for the purposes of social security law. This ensures that, in calculating income maintenance periods under the act, people who receive these payments are treated the same as people who receive other types of redundancy payments.


I commend the bill to the House.

Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (11:10):  The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Bill and cognate bills were the subject of an inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resour­ces, Fisheries and Forestry, which gave the House and the public an opportunity to scrutinise these important changes to the offshore regulations. I congratulate the Minister for Resources and Energy and the Selection Committee. I see that the Standing Committee on Procedure has put out a small report on the amount of legislation that is now going through that committee and being referred to our House committees. I think that is a good process and it certainly improves our legislation, and I congratulate the minister for doing that. 


The main purpose of the bills is to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and associated acts to implement reforms associated with the establishment of a national offshore regulator in Commonwealth waters. The bills address the regulatory framework for petroleum and greenhouse gas storage activities and do not impinge on the activities themselves. The four main objectives of the reforms in the bills are, firstly, to provide an integrated approach to the regulation of safety, structural integrity and environmental management. I think that point itself is an important one, bringing together the need for regulation of human safety and the safety of what we do offshore, the structural integrity of the wells themselves and of the work out there and environmental management. It is important that we deal with those issues. We can deal with these issues and have proper and good environmental management around the work we do. The processes we get into of constantly trying to stop or lock things up and not use some of our  resources I think are very foolish and we need to think of things in a broader way. If we have environmental management done in a proper manner, independently, we can do this in a very modern way. We need to think much broader than we have in the past. I also think it gives us an opportunity of providing within this industry and within the regulating industry some very skilled people. 


The second point is to ensure that this regulation is independent and appropriately skilled and resourced, as I said, to separate the resource development function from regulation and retain resource development within government; and to reduce the regulatory inconsistency and duplication that is inherent in the existing regulatory regime. 


The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Bill 2011, the national regulator bill, will amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006. It will establish two regulatory bodies to administer and regulate petroleum and greenhouse gas storage operations in Commonwealth waters in the Australian offshore area. The new bodies will replace the designated authorities—the state and Northern Territory ministers who, through their departments, have performed functions and exercised powers conferred directly on them by the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and its predecessor act, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. The purpose of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Registration Fees) Amendment Bill 2011 is to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Registration Fees) Act 2006 to reference the new National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator, NOPTA, which will be established through the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Act 2011. The purpose of the Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Amendment Bill 2011 is to amend the Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Act 2006 to reference NOPTA, and the purpose of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Regulatory Levies Legislation Amendment (2011 Measures No.2) Bill 2011 is to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Act 2003 to impose new cost-recovery levies on holders of offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage titles. The levies will recover the costs of NOPTA in undertaking its regulatory functions in relation to titles administration and the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, NOPSEMA, in undertaking its regulatory functions in relation to environmental management.


The purpose of the Offshore Resources Legislation Amendment (Personal Property Securities) Bill 2011 is to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and the Offshore Minerals Act 1994 to exclude application of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009. The Productivity Commission delivered its 'Review of regulatory burden on the upstream petroleum (oil and gas) sector' in April 2009 and identified significant unnecessary regulatory burdens on the sector. Its principal recommendation to reduce those burdens was the establishment of a national offshore regulator.


The reason these bills came about can be traced back to April 2007, to the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association's strategic leaders report, Platform for prosperity. This report identified more efficient national petroleum regulation as a policy priority. The APPEA called for the Productivity Commission to carry out a review of the onshore and offshore regulatory framework in order to assist implementation of a more efficient and nationally consistent petroleum regulatory regime.


In 2008 the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, identified the upstream petroleum sector as one area where overlapping and inconsistent regulation threatens to impede economic activity and agreed that the Productivity Commission should undertake a review, which occurred, and the report of the review of regulatory burden on the upstream petroleum (oil and gas) sector was released in April 2009. This identified significant unnecessary regulatory burdens on the sector. Its principal recommendation to reduce those burdens was the establishment of a national offshore regulator. The Productivity Commission also identified significant potential national income gains, in the order of billions of dollars each year, from the implementation of its recommended reforms.


The Commonwealth government sought to develop an all-of-government response to the Productivity Commission report through the Ministerial Council on Mineral and Petroleum Resources, the MCMPR, and established a working group of officials involving all jurisdictions to develop the responses. By the end of 2009, the MCMPR had agreed 25 responses to the Productivity Commission recommendations but deferred its consideration of the recommendations for a national offshore regulator pending the outcomes of the Montara Commission of Inquiry


The Montara incident in 2009 highlighted problems arising from regulatory gaps between regulation of safety separate from regulation of integrity, environment and day-to-day operations. The Commonwealth's draft response included the reform model that is now in the current amendment bills. Stakeholders were provided three months to comment on the draft response. On 18 February 2011, the MCMPR met to consider the Commonwealth's proposed establishment of a national offshore regulator and set up a working group from all jurisdictions, and the bills were developed from their findings.


The starting point for these bills is the essential reforms identified by the Productivity Commission report and the report of the Montara Commission of Inquiry. The House standing committee agrees with the government that failing to address the findings of these reports is not an option. We also believe that these bills do fulfil the objectives laid down by those reports. The bills are actually reforming regulatory processes, tidying up the present arrangement between regulatory bodies for the new era we are now in for the regulation of offshore petroleum. They are making the regulatory environment more efficient and effective and are moving towards world's best practice.


An essential part of this is cooperation between the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory in the transition to the national regulator. The committee is heartened by the evidence of cooperation between Western Australia and the Com­monwealth in the formulation of a memorandum of understanding to guide government and industry along the new regulatory path. The success of that process is essential to the future of the industry. Both governments have a responsibility to make it work, to make it operate. There are great opportunities for our nation in having this regulator in place.


These bills endorse the formation of NOPTA and NOPSEMA to replace the current regulatory regime. We endorse the retention of the joint authorities but with NOPTA as the principal source of technical advice. We fully endorse the independence of NOPSEMA and do not believe that its activities should be compromised by mandatory consultation with outside bodies. The independence of the regulator of safety, structural integrity and environmental management should be ensured. 


I thank the Minister for Resources and Energy, the member for Batman, Martin Ferguson, for his assistance in bringing these issues to the attention of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forest­ry. As I have said, it is heartening to see that more and more legislation is coming before House committees for consideration. I am sure that we end up with much better bills as a result of that consideration. I commend the bills to the House.

Mr MARTIN FERGUSON
 (Batman—Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (11:23):  Obviously I will make some closing comments on each of the offshore petroleum bills before the House and then I will deal with each of them in terms of potential amendments.


The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage and Amendment (National Regulator) Bill 2011 amends the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act to ensure Australia's offshore regulatory regime is robust by reducing unnecessary burden on industry without compromising safety, the environment or resource manage­ment. The bill expands the functions of the Australian National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority, which becomes the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority. This bill also significantly streamlines the administration of offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage titles by establishing the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator.


These amendments go beyond just delivering the Australian government's response to the Productivity Commission's recommendation for the establishment of a national offshore petroleum regulator for Commonwealth waters. Integrating the views gathered from extensive stakeholder consultation over the last 15 months and recognising the outcomes of the Montara Commission of Inquiry report, the Australian government is delivering on its commitment to restoring the Australian community's confidence in the regulation of the offshore petroleum industry. These amendments will help ensure that our regulatory regime and operating standards are the best and safest in the world. These reforms will replace the current inefficient system of seven desig­nated authorities with a national integrated regulatory system, ensuring consistency, efficiency and transparency in Common­wealth waters. Retaining the joint authorities for the Commonwealth minister and the relevant state and territory ministers guarantees that each jurisdiction continues to have a role in decision making on key petroleum titles in Commonwealth waters that could be adjacent to a state or the Northern Territory. 


The offshore oil and gas industry is vital to sustaining our country's economic prosperity and security. These reforms streamline Australia's regulatory system, bolstering the nation's position as a world leader in offshore oil and gas regulation. The reforms in this bill, together with other complementary bills, will help deliver on the Australian government's commitment to ens­uring the Australian community's confidence in the regulation of offshore petroleum and reinforce our competitive advantage as a preferred location for investment.


I thank all members for their constructive contribution to what is a complex debate. I will deal with a range of issues raised by members and turn first to the contribution of the member for Groom, the former minister for resources, who had responsibility for this very complex industry. During the course of his contribution he expressed disappointment that the government was proceeding with the bill in the absence of a concluded agreement with the Western Australian government concerning collocation of federal and Western Australian offshore petroleum regulators. In reply, I can simply say the Commonwealth has negotiated in good faith with the state of Western Australia on this proposal. 


On behalf of the Commonwealth I have signed a memorandum of understanding detailing the proposed arrangements, which I stand by, agreed by officials from within the Western Australian Department of Mines and Petroleum, my department and the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Auth­ority. I give my commitment to continue to discuss the matter with the Western Australian minister in the hope that he comes to recognise that the legislative regime for the offshore industry proposed by these bills not only is in the best interests of Australia as a whole but is very much in the interests of Western Australia. 


It is the government's very firm belief that by locating the headquarters and most operations of NOPSEMA and NOPTA in Perth we are reinforcing the importance of Perth in the world's oil and gas industry. It is also the government's ambition that, because these two regulators will be well resourced and so be able to attract quality staff in what is a high-paying industry, they will be recognised as among the best regulators for this industry in the world, further reinforcing Western Australia's importance in this global industry. In many ways this industry represents a wonderful career opportunity for young Australians. 


I must say that negotiation cannot be open ended, and it is critical, given the experience of Montara, that the Commonwealth ensures that it is able to properly regulate oil exploration and production for those waters over which it has exclusive jurisdiction as the Commonwealth. The changes we are proposing are not a question of states' rights being denied but rather of the Common­wealth finally accepting its proper responsibilities in relation to waters over which it has exclusive jurisdiction. Delegat­ing those responsibilities to third parties is no longer a tenable position for the Common­wealth of Australia.


The member for Swan made reference to the Western Australian government not collecting North West Shelf revenues. The House of Representatives Standing Comm­ittee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry, chaired by the member for Lyons, recommended that this function be retained by the state of Western Australia. The Commonwealth accepts the committee's recommendation and I will be moving appropriate amendments to reflect that. The members for Forrest and Swan both incorrectly stated that under these bills the Commonwealth will not have to notify the state of the award of title in Commonwealth waters offshore of Western Australia. In fact the bill does not change current arrange­ments in this regard. As is presently the case, titles will be awarded by the joint authority of which the state minister is a member. The Western Australian minister will be aware of titles in Commonwealth waters offshore of Western Australia because he or she will participate in their granting. This point illustrates the extent to which I have gone to accommodate Western Australian concerns, and not just in relation to this issue, without compromising the essential aim of improving our national offshore regulatory regime.


The honourable member for Forrest was quite right in asserting that this legislation would have the greatest impact on Western Australia, but she was incorrect to imply that this would be a negative impact. I suggest it will be quite the opposite, and not just for the reasons I have already outlined. It is Western Australia that will benefit the most from the increased community confidence that will flow from the improved regulation of Australia's offshore oil and gas industry that this bill will bring about. It goes to our notion of the social licence to operate in a very important economic area: the further development of our petroleum industry.


Without these reforms it will be difficult to see how this industry will achieve its full potential with full public confidence. It is this legislation that secures the industry's long-term future by ensuring that the community's high expectation of environm­ental and other standards are properly met. It is about ensuring that we meet them in a way in which Australians, wherever they live, can have full confidence, and that is why industry supports these reforms. It sees them as essential to its commercial future and regards them as essential for its social licence to operate in Australian waters.


It is this essential point that Western Australians seem to keep missing: all Australians, not just those who live in the West, have the same interest in ensuring that there are no more Montaras and that this industry is regulated in accordance with the world's best practice. That objective is shared by all members of this House, and appropriately so, and I thank them for their support for that objective.


In conclusion, I take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the members of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry for their report on this legislation. I advise the House that it is the government's intention to accept the committee's recommendations. I also take this opportunity to thank members of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which recommended improvements to the bill that the government will also adopt. I repeat my thanks to honourable members for their contributions to this debate and I commend the bills the House.

   The amendments made by this Schedule apply to directions given after the commencement of this item.


In doing so, I indicate that the government's amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Bill 2011 respond to a concern raised by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The standing committee noted that a provision in the national regulator bill provides the ability for the responsible Commonwealth minister to incorporate into directional material a standard as in force or existing from time to time. The standing committee noted that this ability raises the prospect of changes being made to the law in the absence of parliamentary scrutiny and can create uncertainty in the law, as those obliged to obey the law may have inadequate access to its terms. The proposed amendments remove this concern and do not adversely impact on the integrity of the other reforms in the package of bills to establish a national offshore petroleum regulator. I commend amendments (1) to (3), as circulated, to the House.

The second point is to ensure that this regulation is independent and appropriately skilled and resourced, as I said, to separate the resource development function from regulation and retain resource development within government; and to reduce the regulatory inconsistency and duplication that is inherent in the existing regulatory regime. 


The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Bill 2011, the national regulator bill, will amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006. It will establish two regulatory bodies to administer and regulate petroleum and greenhouse gas storage operations in Commonwealth waters in the Australian offshore area. The new bodies will replace the designated authorities—the state and Northern Territory ministers who, through their departments, have performed functions and exercised powers conferred directly on them by the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and its predecessor act, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. The purpose of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Registration Fees) Amendment Bill 2011 is to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Registration Fees) Act 2006 to reference the new National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator, NOPTA, which will be established through the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Act 2011. The purpose of the Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Amendment Bill 2011 is to amend the Offshore Petroleum (Royalty) Act 2006 to reference NOPTA, and the purpose of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Regulatory Levies Legislation Amendment (2011 Measures No.2) Bill 2011 is to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Act 2003 to impose new cost-recovery levies on holders of offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage titles. The levies will recover the costs of NOPTA in undertaking its regulatory functions in relation to titles administration and the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, NOPSEMA, in undertaking its regulatory functions in relation to environmental management.


The purpose of the Offshore Resources Legislation Amendment (Personal Property Securities) Bill 2011 is to amend the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and the Offshore Minerals Act 1994 to exclude application of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009. The Productivity Commission delivered its 'Review of regulatory burden on the upstream petroleum (oil and gas) sector' in April 2009 and identified significant unnecessary regulatory burdens on the sector. Its principal recommendation to reduce those burdens was the establishment of a national offshore regulator.


The reason these bills came about can be traced back to April 2007, to the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association's strategic leaders report, Platform for prosperity. This report identified more efficient national petroleum regulation as a policy priority. The APPEA called for the Productivity Commission to carry out a review of the onshore and offshore regulatory framework in order to assist implementation of a more efficient and nationally consistent petroleum regulatory regime.


In 2008 the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, identified the upstream petroleum sector as one area where overlapping and inconsistent regulation threatens to impede economic activity and agreed that the Productivity Commission should undertake a review, which occurred, and the report of the review of regulatory burden on the upstream petroleum (oil and gas) sector was released in April 2009. This identified significant unnecessary regulatory burdens on the sector. Its principal recommendation to reduce those burdens was the establishment of a national offshore regulator. The Productivity Commission also identified significant potential national income gains, in the order of billions of dollars each year, from the implementation of its recommended reforms.


The Commonwealth government sought to develop an all-of-government response to the Productivity Commission report through the Ministerial Council on Mineral and Petroleum Resources, the MCMPR, and established a working group of officials involving all jurisdictions to develop the responses. By the end of 2009, the MCMPR had agreed 25 responses to the Productivity Commission recommendations but deferred its consideration of the recommendations for a national offshore regulator pending the outcomes of the Montara Commission of Inquiry


The Montara incident in 2009 highlighted problems arising from regulatory gaps between regulation of safety separate from regulation of integrity, environment and day-to-day operations. The Commonwealth's draft response included the reform model that is now in the current amendment bills. Stakeholders were provided three months to comment on the draft response. On 18 February 2011, the MCMPR met to consider the Commonwealth's proposed establishment of a national offshore regulator and set up a working group from all jurisdictions, and the bills were developed from their findings.


The starting point for these bills is the essential reforms identified by the Productivity Commission report and the report of the Montara Commission of Inquiry. The House standing committee agrees with the government that failing to address the findings of these reports is not an option. We also believe that these bills do fulfil the objectives laid down by those reports. The bills are actually reforming regulatory processes, tidying up the present arrangement between regulatory bodies for the new era we are now in for the regulation of offshore petroleum. They are making the regulatory environment more efficient and effective and are moving towards world's best practice.


An essential part of this is cooperation between the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory in the transition to the national regulator. The committee is heartened by the evidence of cooperation between Western Australia and the Com­monwealth in the formulation of a memorandum of understanding to guide government and industry along the new regulatory path. The success of that process is essential to the future of the industry. Both governments have a responsibility to make it work, to make it operate. There are great opportunities for our nation in having this regulator in place.


These bills endorse the formation of NOPTA and NOPSEMA to replace the current regulatory regime. We endorse the retention of the joint authorities but with NOPTA as the principal source of technical advice. We fully endorse the independence of NOPSEMA and do not believe that its activities should be compromised by mandatory consultation with outside bodies. The independence of the regulator of safety, structural integrity and environmental management should be ensured. 


I thank the Minister for Resources and Energy, the member for Batman, Martin Ferguson, for his assistance in bringing these issues to the attention of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forest­ry. As I have said, it is heartening to see that more and more legislation is coming before House committees for consideration. I am sure that we end up with much better bills as a result of that consideration. I commend the bills to the House.

Mr MARTIN FERGUSON
 (Batman—Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (11:23):  Obviously I will make some closing comments on each of the offshore petroleum bills before the House and then I will deal with each of them in terms of potential amendments.


The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage and Amendment (National Regulator) Bill 2011 amends the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act to ensure Australia's offshore regulatory regime is robust by reducing unnecessary burden on industry without compromising safety, the environment or resource manage­ment. The bill expands the functions of the Australian National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority, which becomes the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority. This bill also significantly streamlines the administration of offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage titles by establishing the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator.


These amendments go beyond just delivering the Australian government's response to the Productivity Commission's recommendation for the establishment of a national offshore petroleum regulator for Commonwealth waters. Integrating the views gathered from extensive stakeholder consultation over the last 15 months and recognising the outcomes of the Montara Commission of Inquiry report, the Australian government is delivering on its commitment to restoring the Australian community's confidence in the regulation of the offshore petroleum industry. These amendments will help ensure that our regulatory regime and operating standards are the best and safest in the world. These reforms will replace the current inefficient system of seven desig­nated authorities with a national integrated regulatory system, ensuring consistency, efficiency and transparency in Common­wealth waters. Retaining the joint authorities for the Commonwealth minister and the relevant state and territory ministers guarantees that each jurisdiction continues to have a role in decision making on key petroleum titles in Commonwealth waters that could be adjacent to a state or the Northern Territory. 


The offshore oil and gas industry is vital to sustaining our country's economic prosperity and security. These reforms streamline Australia's regulatory system, bolstering the nation's position as a world leader in offshore oil and gas regulation. The reforms in this bill, together with other complementary bills, will help deliver on the Australian government's commitment to ens­uring the Australian community's confidence in the regulation of offshore petroleum and reinforce our competitive advantage as a preferred location for investment.


I thank all members for their constructive contribution to what is a complex debate. I will deal with a range of issues raised by members and turn first to the contribution of the member for Groom, the former minister for resources, who had responsibility for this very complex industry. During the course of his contribution he expressed disappointment that the government was proceeding with the bill in the absence of a concluded agreement with the Western Australian government concerning collocation of federal and Western Australian offshore petroleum regulators. In reply, I can simply say the Commonwealth has negotiated in good faith with the state of Western Australia on this proposal. 


On behalf of the Commonwealth I have signed a memorandum of understanding detailing the proposed arrangements, which I stand by, agreed by officials from within the Western Australian Department of Mines and Petroleum, my department and the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Auth­ority. I give my commitment to continue to discuss the matter with the Western Australian minister in the hope that he comes to recognise that the legislative regime for the offshore industry proposed by these bills not only is in the best interests of Australia as a whole but is very much in the interests of Western Australia. 


It is the government's very firm belief that by locating the headquarters and most operations of NOPSEMA and NOPTA in Perth we are reinforcing the importance of Perth in the world's oil and gas industry. It is also the government's ambition that, because these two regulators will be well resourced and so be able to attract quality staff in what is a high-paying industry, they will be recognised as among the best regulators for this industry in the world, further reinforcing Western Australia's importance in this global industry. In many ways this industry represents a wonderful career opportunity for young Australians. 


I must say that negotiation cannot be open ended, and it is critical, given the experience of Montara, that the Commonwealth ensures that it is able to properly regulate oil exploration and production for those waters over which it has exclusive jurisdiction as the Commonwealth. The changes we are proposing are not a question of states' rights being denied but rather of the Common­wealth finally accepting its proper responsibilities in relation to waters over which it has exclusive jurisdiction. Delegat­ing those responsibilities to third parties is no longer a tenable position for the Common­wealth of Australia.


The member for Swan made reference to the Western Australian government not collecting North West Shelf revenues. The House of Representatives Standing Comm­ittee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry, chaired by the member for Lyons, recommended that this function be retained by the state of Western Australia. The Commonwealth accepts the committee's recommendation and I will be moving appropriate amendments to reflect that. The members for Forrest and Swan both incorrectly stated that under these bills the Commonwealth will not have to notify the state of the award of title in Commonwealth waters offshore of Western Australia. In fact the bill does not change current arrange­ments in this regard. As is presently the case, titles will be awarded by the joint authority of which the state minister is a member. The Western Australian minister will be aware of titles in Commonwealth waters offshore of Western Australia because he or she will participate in their granting. This point illustrates the extent to which I have gone to accommodate Western Australian concerns, and not just in relation to this issue, without compromising the essential aim of improving our national offshore regulatory regime.


The honourable member for Forrest was quite right in asserting that this legislation would have the greatest impact on Western Australia, but she was incorrect to imply that this would be a negative impact. I suggest it will be quite the opposite, and not just for the reasons I have already outlined. It is Western Australia that will benefit the most from the increased community confidence that will flow from the improved regulation of Australia's offshore oil and gas industry that this bill will bring about. It goes to our notion of the social licence to operate in a very important economic area: the further development of our petroleum industry.


Without these reforms it will be difficult to see how this industry will achieve its full potential with full public confidence. It is this legislation that secures the industry's long-term future by ensuring that the community's high expectation of environm­ental and other standards are properly met. It is about ensuring that we meet them in a way in which Australians, wherever they live, can have full confidence, and that is why industry supports these reforms. It sees them as essential to its commercial future and regards them as essential for its social licence to operate in Australian waters.


It is this essential point that Western Australians seem to keep missing: all Australians, not just those who live in the West, have the same interest in ensuring that there are no more Montaras and that this industry is regulated in accordance with the world's best practice. That objective is shared by all members of this House, and appropriately so, and I thank them for their support for that objective.


In conclusion, I take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the members of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry for their report on this legislation. I advise the House that it is the government's intention to accept the committee's recommendations. I also take this opportunity to thank members of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, which recommended improvements to the bill that the government will also adopt. I repeat my thanks to honourable members for their contributions to this debate and I commend the bills the House.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (13:45): I would like to congratulate the organisers of the Mudgeeraba Agricultural Show, includ­ing the president, Helen Rippa, and show secretary, Kylie Holzinger, along with the committee and all the volunteers, for the work that they have done to make the 83rd Annual Mudgeeraba Agricultural Show such a great success.


Mudgeeraba is a beautiful part of the Gold Coast within my electorate of McPherson. The Mudgeeraba Show started as a small fete and flower show, and it was first run 79 years ago to raise money for improvements to the Memorial Hall. In 1973 there was a need to form a show society and register the event as an agricultural show. More than 10 years later, in 1985, a permanent pavilion at the showgrounds was provided by the Albert Shire Council and leased to the show society.


From its humble beginnings, the Mudgeeraba Show has now grown into a two-day weekend event, labelled as the 'little Ekka' with more than 15,000 Gold Coasters turning up on the first day this year, giving a welcome boost the local economy. The event hosts horse events, handicrafts, horticultural exhibits, cooking and preserves, a pet parade, wood chopping, ring events and a showgirl pageant, to name but a few. The show would not be a success without the force of the community supporting it. The volunteers and the public ensure the event continues. I look forward to attending it next year and I encourage everyone to join me.

  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The last two-thirds of that alleged question from the Leader of the Opposition was nothing like a question. It was just a rant from the Leader of the Opposition.



Honourable members interjecting—




The SPEAKER:
  Order! I declare a general warning and I am very serious about it. The first question from the Leader of the Opposition was met with great noise from my right and, equally, the response from the Prime Minister was met with great noise from my left. I have a sense that members in this chamber are really ignoring how we are perceived from outside. I do not need people's assistance about naming people; you are now all under a warning. I will simply respond to the Leader of the House's point of order by saying, yes, there is a limit to my tolerance about argument in questions but there was such uproar that, whilst I had a feeling where the question was going, I did not hear it. But I say to the Leader of the Opposition that there is a limit even to the licence that is given to leaders of parties.

  My supplementary question to the Prime Minister is: while she is wearing out her shoe leather next week will she apologise to the Australian people for saying, six days before the last election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'?

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:02):  I certainly will be out speaking to Australians next week about the facts about carbon pricing, and I trust the Leader of the Opposition is out apologising to people for the false claims he has made.



Opposition members interjecting—




Ms GILLARD:
  He can start by apologising to everybody that he told about a 6.5c a litre increase in the price of petrol—wholly untrue and something that the Leader of the Opposition has been around the country trying to raise fear about. As I am around the country talking to Australian workers and Australian families about the facts on carbon pricing, I hope the Leader of the Opposition is out telling them the facts about his 'subsidy for polluters' plan and, most particularly, the entry on page 14 that records his plan to penalise businesses, to put penalties on them. I hope he is out and about telling Australian workers whether it is their business that he is going to put a penalty on. I hope he is out and about telling Australian families about the cost impacts which will flow through to them because of those penalties and I hope he tells those families that he is not proposing to give them any assistance at all, that what he wants to do is take $720 off them and give it to big polluters. I hope he is out and about with those facts. 


I will be out and about talking to people about the truth about carbon pricing; about the science and the need to act; about the imposition of a price on the biggest polluters in this country, on big businesses; about the way that will enable them to innovate and cut carbon pollution; about the jobs that our clean energy future will promise this country; about the tax cuts and increases in pensions and payments for Australian families; about the measures to protect Australian jobs and the measures to tackle climate change. I will certainly be very proud to be out and about talking about those facts.

I will be out and about talking about the challenge that climate change poses to the future of our nation. I accept the science. I will be out and about talking to Australians about the most efficient way of tackling carbon pollution. I accept the expert advice of economists. I will be talking to them—




Mr Abbott:
  Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on direct relevance. What about that word 'sorry', Prime Minister?

  The Leader of the Opposition knows that was not a point of order. He knows that there was a general warning.



Mr Symon interjecting—




The SPEAKER:
  He was a saved species already, member for Deakin, but I think that somebody might tell you what a general warning means. I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition that he is very lucky.

The SPEAKER:
  The Prime Minister will resume her seat. I am not running a commentary, but read the second part of the question and then come back to me at some stage and tell me why this response is not relevant or even directly relevant to that part. I am indicating to the Leader of the Opposition that the line has well and truly been met. The Prime Minister has the call and she will be heard in silence.




Ms GILLARD:
  I understand that Australian families have legitimate concerns about job security. There is nothing more important to people than having the benefits of work. Consequently, I will be explaining to them how the carbon pricing package will protect Australian jobs today and ensure that our nation is prosperous and has the benefits of a clean-energy future.


I will of course be speaking to Australians about any issue they want to raise with me. I suspect that they will want to raise issues with me about what was said during the election campaign, and I will be happy to answer their questions. I will be happy to explain to them that the carbon tax is temporary and that the emissions trading scheme is permanent. I will be happy to explain to them that I always wanted to achieve an emissions trading scheme for this nation, and we will. I will be happy to explain to them that we have got there via a different route than the one I foresaw at the election campaign, but we will seize that clean-energy future.


I will be explaining to them that the Leader of the Opposition was a member of the Howard cabinet that authorised an emissions trading scheme. I will be explaining to them that the Leader of the Opposition has been in favour of an emissions trading scheme and in favour of a carbon tax. I will be explaining to them that he is now opposed to a carbon tax and he is now opposed to an emissions trading scheme. I will be explaining to them that that is not leadership. Leadership is about saying to the country that we have to chart the best course for the future. Leadership is about saying to the country that there are difficult things we need to do in order to do the right thing by our environment and by our economy for the future.


I will be saying to the country that, as a nation, as a people we are up to doing this together. The time to do it is now. Our economy is strong, and while our economy is strong is the right time to be addressing a major reform. Nothing hard gets easier because you leave it in the too-hard basket, so I will be explaining to them that, as Prime Minister, I intend to lead this nation through this difficult reform. It will strengthen us for the future and we will get it done.

 (Swan) (14:19):  My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the statement by the Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency that, 'The introduction of a carbon price in Australia will not reduce global temperatures over the next five, 10 or 50 years.'

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2011-07-06,"



Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:19):  I thank the member for his quest­ion. I think it is very important that there is a shared and respectful understanding of the science of climate change. Where that shared and respectful understanding of the science of climate change leads us is that we live in a world where, as a result of human activity and the way we live today—the industr­ialised high-energy way we live today—we generate more carbon pollution than at any other time in human history. What that means is that there is a level of damage already done which we cannot unthink or undo. There is a level of damage that lies in front of us and we can make a difference to that—that is, we can act to cut carbon pollution. Rather than saying, as a nation, that we are prepared to just allow whatever the future gives us in terms of levels of carbon pollution with all of the danger that that would create for our nation, we can act to reduce those levels of carbon pollution. I believe in doing that. I believe as a nation which is amongst the 20 biggest polluters in our world, we should be acting to cut carbon pollution.


I am a little bit surprised about this question because I would have to say that, unless there has been a big change in opposition policy, I thought members of the opposition said that they supported cutting carbon pollution too. Maybe I am wrong about that. I know, of course, that climate change scepticism has swept through the Liberal Party and claimed the Leader of the Opposition, so now maybe they reject the need to do anything about carbon pollution and simply deny its existence.




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The Prime Minister will resume her seat. The member for Swan on a point of order.




Mr Irons:
  Mr Speaker, my question was about the cost of living in introducing a carbon tax, and relevance.




The SPEAKER:
  The member for Swan would also acknowledge that there are other elements to the question as well. The Prime Minister is responding.




Ms GILLARD:
  There may have been a change in the opposition because I note that yesterday the Leader of the Opposition in this place referred to so-called carbon pollution, so maybe climate change sceptic­ism is now ruling entirely. They reject the science out of hand and they reject the existence of carbon pollution out of hand. But we, on this side of the parliament, accept the science. We believe we should act to reduce carbon pollution. We accept the economic advice that the best way to do that is by pricing carbon. Then, of course, because we want as a Labor government to look after those in our community who need the most assistance, we will ensure that the money polluters pay funds tax cuts and payment increases for nine out of 10 households.


The member in his point of order said that he was concerned about cost of living. He needs to make a comparison between tax cuts and payment increases for nine out of 10 households versus the plan of the Leader of the Opposition to charge households an extra $720 per year in tax, something that would impact on people's cost of living.




Mr Hunt:
  That is simply untrue. 




The SPEAKER:
  Order!I simply say to the member for Flinders I have two options in dealing with him. He will leave the chamber for one hour under 94(a), the lesser of the two evils.




The member for Flinders then left the chamber
.





Ms GILLARD:
  On the question of cost of living, the member who asked the question may want to refer to the policy of his own political party, particularly page 14—that is the plan to put penalties on businesses, businesses in his electorate. I do not know how many businesses in his electorate would get which size penalty. He may have to ask the Leader of the Opposition about that and how many of them it would drive out of business. I cannot help him with that; it is the plan of the Leader of the Opposition. But, of course, the penalty put on businesses would flow through presumably to the prices that they charge and into cost of living pressures. He may ask the Leader of the Opposition to come clean about that as well because the Leader of the Opposition wants to make a charge of $720 per family. He has this plan for penalties, rising cost-of-living pressures and he is planning no assistance. In fact he is planning to take back the tax cuts and pension increases that this government will provide.




Mr Irons:
  Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table a letter from the Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency which states, 'The introduction of a carbon price in Australia will not reduce global temperatures.'

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (15:30):  by leave—The events of 1914 to 1918 constitute one of our nation's finest hours. In those dark and demanding days, our people were able to achieve great things, able to meet the test of history with courage and resolve as the Australian people always do. And though everyone who fought in the Great War is now gone, their deeds will never be forgotten. As honourable members will be aware, we are preparing for the centenary of Anzac. The Commission on the Commemoration of the Anzac Centenary presented its report to the government on 28 March this year. The commission included two distinguished former prime ministers, Bob Hawke and Malcolm Fraser, a fine example of bipartisan cooperation and goodwill. Now the time has come to turn their blueprint into detailed programs and activities that will commemorate, in a worthy way, this important centenary, the most important national anniversary since the centenary of Federation and the Bicentenary.


To lead the way, I am pleased to inform the House that the government will create a new Anzac centenary advisory board which will work closely with Minister Snowdon to develop a commemorative program covering the period 2014 to 2018. Naturally, the focus of all of this will be the events of Gallipoli but it will also ensure that the whole scope of World War I is appropriately honoured from beginning to end, including efforts here on the home front. The board will also oversee the commemoration of various other significant military anniversaries that fall during the period 2014 to 2018 including the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, in 2015, and the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, in 2016. Board and committee members will be announced in coming months but, of course, the role of chair of the Anzac Centenary Advisory Board is a crucial one because it will set the tone and direction for the whole period of commemoration. I am therefore delighted to be able to advise the House that it will be filled by a very distinguished Australian, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston. Angus Houston handed over command of the Australian Defence Force on Sunday night and he will bring to this new role his wisdom, his love of history, his deep sense of dignity and his integrity. I thank Air Chief Marshal Houston for agreeing to continue his journey of public service in another capacity. I am sure the full parliament knows that he will do an outstanding job.

Charles Bean said it very well, and we should remember them and Angus Houston will help us to do that.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2011-07-06,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (15:36):  Within just a few days the government will be announcing a great big new tax on all Australians. The government themselves say that this is the biggest economic change in history and yet they are waiting until after the rising of the parliament to make this so-called important announcement. They would not answer any questions during this week on the nature of this great big new tax. They wait until everybody has left Canberra so that their announcement cannot be subject to the scrutiny that parliament should be providing. This is no small tax. This will be the biggest carbon tax in the world. It will add to the cost of everything we do every day of our lives. It will make our businesses in this country less competitive. It will cost jobs. Yet the government do not think it is important enough for this to be debated and considered in the federal parliament. This tax will have an enormous impact on all Australians, but its impact in regional areas will be particularly severe because there are higher costs already in regional commun­ities. This tax will add to every single one of them. On top of that, most of the jobs that will be lost in the first round of this tax are in regional communities. So this will have a devastating impact on our nation but, in particular, it will have a devastating effect on people who live outside the capital cities.


This is a carbon tax that the Prime Minister said we would never have under a government she leads.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  She's not leading the government.




Mr TRUSS:
  The lady who will come out and announce this new tax is the same one who told the Australian people repeatedly before the last election that there would be no such tax. That was an untruth. A few days ago she said she did not mean to mislead. That was another untruth. She waited until she was in the Lodge and she had the keys before she told the truth to the Australian people.


Now she asks us to believe that she did not really mean to mislead. If she did not mean to mislead why did she not correct the newspaper headlines in the days that were available before the election? Why did she not ring up the television news services and say: 'You got it wrong. I did not say that at all'? What she said before the election was 'there will be no carbon tax'. There was no lack of intention to mislead. Let us make that absolutely clear.


That is not the end of the untruths that the government has told us already about this tax. For instance, it repeatedly says that only a thousand big polluters will pay. Everyone knows that is untrue. If you want any greater expert to make that observation, just ask Professor Garnaut or read his last climate review. This is the man who the government paid for several years to give it advice on this question—their trusted confidant—and he said, 'Australian households will ultimately bear the full cost'. Of course, that is the real truth. What the government told us about there being only a thousand payers is an untruth.



An opposition member:  22 million Australians.




Mr TRUSS:
  Ordinary families will cop the carbon tax in the neck.



An opposition member:  They will cop the lot.




Mr TRUSS:
  They will pay the lot. Their electricity bills at a carbon tax rate of $25 a tonne will go up by around $500; gas will go up by 10 per cent; there will be increases in fuel costs; groceries will be up by at least five per cent—everything will be slugged. New South Wales consumers are likely to wear a thousand-dollar-a-year extra costs. The South Australian Council of Social Service said a few days ago that it expected the cost of living in South Australia to rise by $1,200 and a significant proportion of that would be the carbon tax.


That is only the start. The Greens have made it absolutely clear that they want a carbon tax of at least $100 a tonne so that people will change their behaviour. It would close the coal fired power stations. They want a much more severe tax than whatever number is announced on Sunday. That is not a scare tactic. This tax is supposed to hurt. It is designed to hurt so much that people will stop doing the things that they normally do. They will leave their car at home rather than visit their sick mother on the other side of town. They will walk to school or walk to work, or sell their house and buy a new one near their job so that they will keep their vehicle at home. They will switch off their heater on a cold Canberra morning, or they will not turn on their cooling system on a hot summer's day. This is a tax that is designed to hurt. It is designed to hurt so much that people will change their very behaviour.


The Prime Minister has said that we have got to do this because we are being left behind by the rest of the world. That is another untruth. The Productivity Commis­sion report commissioned by the government made it absolutely clear that Australia's efforts in this regard are about average, similar to what other countries are doing. Another untruth that the government keeps telling us is that—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  Order! I am reluctant to interrupt the Leader of the Nationals but I do want to draw to his attention the provisions of standing order 90. To accuse the Prime Minister of an untruth is skating very close to a personal reflection.




Mr TRUSS:
  What I am saying is that the statements made by the Prime Minister and indeed by others are incorrect. They are wrong. For instance, her statement that this tax will start small is incorrect. It is untrue. The reality is that this will be the biggest carbon tax anywhere in the world. Evidence given to the Senate Select Committee on Scrutiny of New Taxes on 9 June stated the proposed Australian carbon tax would raise more money in its first three months than the European scheme raised since it began 5½ years ago.


It is only going to take us three months with Labor's proposed carbon tax to raise the same amount of money as Europe has raised since their scheme started, and it is supposed to be the example of the nation that is tough on carbon emissions. The Australian emis­sions trading scheme will raise more revenue in its first month than the US scheme has raised in the two years that it has been operating. It will take only one month to raise more money than the North American scheme has raised since it began.


We are also told, incorrectly, that Australia is the biggest emitter in the world. China is only going to take about seven or eight months to increase its emissions by the amount that we have promised to reduce ours by 2015. That assumes that China actually meets its commitment to only increase its emissions by 496 per cent. The reality is that the government's statements about this are completely inaccurate.


It is also not true to say that we are the biggest per capita emitter of carbon in the world. It is quite clear that because we are a major energy producing country we have higher emissions than some other places, but if you want to look around at who are the biggest per capita emitters in the world you cannot go past Qatar, which has double our emissions, or countries like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, even Luxem­bourg. They all emit significantly more than Australia. The government is misleading Australian consumers if it makes this claim that we have to do this because we will be left behind by the rest of the world. Here is another really sad untruth inflicted upon the people of Australia. This is really sad and perhaps the sorriest of the misleading statements being made by the government: that we have to have a carbon tax to boost jobs. That is simply untrue. It is ridiculous to suggest that a tax like this is going to make extra jobs. Access Economics predicts the number of job losses at 126,000—




Mr Burke:
  Mr Deputy Speaker Slipper, I rise on a point of order. I tried to give the Leader of the Nationals free rein but when he is surrounded by people who are interjecting out of their seats constantly—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The minister will resume his seat. The minister does make a valid point. Honourable memb­ers ought not to interject from outside their seats, and that includes the honourable member for Dawson. The Leader of the Nationals.




Mr TRUSS:
  ACIL Tasman has said that 16 coal mines will close costing 10,000 jobs. But the Greens, who are driving this agenda, want every mine closed—every single mine closed. That will cost hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs. In addition to that we have the extra costs that are going to be imposed on every business in this country, meaning they will be less competitive. There will be sectors right across the country that will have to bear bigger costs—agriculture for instance—even if Labor exempts agriculture at the first point. Professor Garnaut has made it clear that he wants agriculture in within two or three years. Australian farmers will be the only ones in the world to pay a carbon tax on the production of food for our nation.


In addition to that, of course, there is the processing of food. It seems that Australian dairy processors are to be the only dairy processors in the world to be paying a carbon tax. How does that enable them to compete with New Zealanders and others on world markets? When we look at the cost of transport and the cost to farmers of fertilisers and inputs, they are going to be less competitive and that, of course, means more lost jobs in regional areas. If you need any further advice about where the government's policy is heading, just take the words of Senator Hanson-Young whose advice to everybody was to close down the OneSteel plant at Whyalla—it will only cost 4,000 jobs—'and we will replace them by building windmills'. Let us have windmills all over the place because we will not have any other jobs.


Another statement that the Prime Minister made, which she has simply failed to honour, is the promise to compensate people for these extra costs. The government have already said that only half of the money raised will be used as compensation. But no-one can compensate people for the loss of their job, for the closure of whole industries and therefore, potentially, whole towns. There will be no compensation for those people. In fact, if you are not being paid anything because you have not got a job, no compensation will make up for the higher prices they have to pay.


Let me make another point, which I think is very important, the Prime Minister made another promise before the election. She promised that she would build community consensus before doing anything at all. Maybe she has not broken that promise. There is community consensus and the Australian people have made it absolutely clear that they have made up their mind and they do not want a carbon tax. The latest poll suggests over three-quarters of Australians do not want the tax. There is a community consensus and the government should listen. Call off Sunday. Do not have this big announcement. They have not achieved the consensus or, if they have, the consensus is there should be no tax at all.


Is it any wonder that ordinary Australians feel shut out and betrayed by what this government have said. They have not been consulted in the process. This has all been put together by some so-called multiparty committee, which is in fact an alliance between the Greens and the ALP with a couple of Independents as cheerleaders. The reality is that the Australian people have not been given the opportunity to have their say. The government did not tell the truth with the Australian people before the election. Now they are having a tax imposed on them that they had made absolutely clear they did not want, and they are not being consulted or given a chance to have any say.


What is going to be the benefit of this tax? The parliament secretary let the cat out of the bag when he said in a letter that this tax will make no difference even in 50 years' time. Professor Flannery, another one of the Labor Party's favoured sons in this particular area, went further. He said that if the whole of the world stopped emitting immediately it would not make any difference to the temperature for a thousand years. Yet this government believe that for Australia, which produces 1.4 per cent of global emissions, a tax is going to change the world. That is complete nonsense.


I ask the government: on Sunday do not tell us how much you are going to tax us and how you are going to distribute that money around the place, but tell us how many polar bears you expect the tax is actually going to save. Tell us how much better off the Barrier Reef is going to be because of the $25 a tonne Labor imposed tax, or whatever the price might be, on Australian consumers. Tell us how often the Murray will fill because this tax has been imposed.


I have never seen a tax in my life that changes the climate. Sometimes it makes people get hot under the collar, but to suggest that a new tax is actually going to make our planet cooler is clearly a nonsense. If taxes made the country cooler, under a Labor government we would be frozen over from west to east. There are plenty of taxes already. The government have no mandate for a carbon tax. They have no legitimacy for government. They said they will not have a plebiscite. If you will not have a plebiscite then you must have an election to decide this issue. (Time expired)

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2011-07-06,"



Mr CREAN
 (Hotham—Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (15:51):  If I have ever heard a speech of so much negativity delivered with crocodile tears, that takes the cake. Let me take the crocodile tears for a start. First of all, they said they wanted to ask questions about the impact on regional development. The shadow minister who spoke, the Leader of the National Party, is shadow minister for regional development. Not only has he not asked me a question this week in parliament about regional development, he has not asked me since we have been returned. Not only that, in the Leader of the Opposition's speech in reply to the budget, there was not one mention of regional development within that speech. The regional rorts program that they presided over was an absolute disgrace and we know why. The Howard government in office was on the record as saying that it never saw a clear rationale and a constitut­ional basis for Commonwealth involvement in regional development. So do not give us this cant and hypocrisy about your concern for regional development. Look at the history.


The history of this country is that it has been Labor governments that have always been the dynamic and the momentum for regional development. The Whitlam govern­ment, the Hawke government, the Keating government, the Rudd government and now the Gillard government are the ones that have taken the initiative. When the Howard government came to office, they abolished the Department of Regional Development and they declared that they saw no clear constitutional rationale for that involvement. Not only is the Labor Party the best party to manage regional development; it is the party best equipped to manage the challenge of structural adjustment. There is no greater structural adjustment confronting this economy than the challenge of climate change. That is why we are facing up to it. 


The Liberal Party really seriously need to question its credentials. What we are propos­ing is the movement towards a market based mechanism which we use to adjust for the challenge of climate change. I would have thought that the party that prided itself in the principles of the market and free enterprise would have embraced this but, no, what do what we see from them? They have embraced, through direct action campaign, industry intervention and business welfare. They have embraced a mechanism that will impose on every individual in this country a $720 a year ticket to pay for those business welfare measures. And they have the gall to come into this place and talk about cost of living and impact on consumers—$720 from every man, woman and child in this country per year to pay the big polluters. We actually believe the reverse should be the case.


We believe that the tax should fall on the big polluters. We believe that that tax should move to a price on carbon so that the market clears it and we believe in compensating households for that cost. This is the principle of the compensation: nine out of 10 house­holds will be compensated for the impact on them. Pensioners will get a 20 per cent supplement.


Our measures are designed to get people to change their behaviour, to reduce their carbon footprint and to reduce the impact of climate change. If they follow that behav­iour, they will be get a net gain from the benefit because we are compensating them to stand still but encouraging them to make the changes. If they make the changes, they will be better off. Under the Liberals, of course, with their direct action campaign, they will be worse off—$720 a year worse off. I must say the modern Liberal Party under Tony Abbott has become an absolute disgrace. Not only is it driven by negativity; it has turned its back on all the principles on which it claimed to be formed.


The principle of the market mechanism is terribly important in this equation because, if the market is clearing, the market rewards better behaviour. Let us take the case of coal because there has been a lot of talk about this. In comparison to the coal production of other countries, if the market mechanism is established properly coal to coal there will be a benefit to our coal producers vis-a-vis the rest of the world. That is why we need a market mechanism that is internationally recognised. But if people move to gas, and the market mechanism prices the relativity, then there are benefits to the industry producing the gas. This is rejected by those who sit on the other side now but it was not rejected by them, including by the shadow minister who just spoke, when he sat in the Howard government's cabinet and they adopted the very same approach—a market mechanism. What they are advocating today is not what they sought to implement when they were in government. I ask the public to judge on that basis. They have done a complete backflip in terms of what they were arguing when they were in government compared to what they argue today.


Let me also make the point about the hypocrisy of their position. Their policy, like ours, is to make an unconditional commit­ment to a five per cent reduction in greenhouse gases. That is correct. Both parties have that bipartisan position. The real issue here is: how do you achieve that? We are proposing an initiative—the details of which will be fully released on Sunday by us—and they are proposing their direct action campaign. Not only will their direct action campaign cost the individual $720 a year; it has been ridiculed by all the experts, including Professor Garnaut, whom the Leader of the National Party was so keen to quote in his speech recently, as well as the Productivity Commission. Direct action is not an answer. It is costly, it costs consumers, it costs the public purse and the reason they run the fear campaign is because they do not want to talk about that and embrace it.


In the context of this motion that is before us, which talks about the impact on regional development, let me just make this point: the circumstances that we as an economy confront today suit the agenda for regional development. We are trying to adjust the patchwork nature of the economy and, when you think about it, the regions are the patches. If the argument is that we have to sustain the economy beyond the resources boom, which is the economy in transition, which our budget underpinned, it is essential that we get local input and local engagement from the patches and embrace that transitory nature that challenges us. So we are an economy in transition. The regions need to respond and they need to respond in a way that also factors in the impact of the climate change debate. We are better placed than any country in the world for two reasons. First of all, we are the only developed country in the world to have avoided going into recession during the global financial crisis meltdown—there are a number of reasons for that, which I do not have time to go into here—and we are the envy of the rest of the world. Every time I have attended international confere­nces, countries have come up to me and said, 'How did you do it? How did you avoid it?' The second point that is in our favour is that we engaged, because of previous policies by both governments, but initiated by the Hawke and Keating government, with Asia at a time when it was not popular to do so. We engaged with Asia, which is now the fastest growing region in the world. Not only have we avoided the recession, not only have we got this engagement with Asia, that is what is continuing to fuel our resources boom. But the resources boom will not last forever and that is why we need to position ourselves and ensure that the economy diversifies. The best way to get that diversification is to engage the regions and that is why the policy prescription that we have set down, including in the budget, is all about doing that.


Climate change is part of the transition. We are seeking to take advantage of the market mechanism we are working to estab­lish to better position ourselves to make that transition. Cleaner coal, gas and renewables are all commitments that we are making. But it is not just us arguing that; the regions themselves are embracing this. I say to the member who has already spoken in this debate and to those who follow him: when they talk about the threat to regional Australia, they should get out properly in the regions instead of spreading their fear campaign and ask the regions how they are facing up to this challenge. 


It is very interesting that, through the regional development structure we have established, just about every one of the regional development organisations in this country is embracing the challenge of climate change and looking to undertake initiatives that do develop green jobs and do give them cleaner living environments. Some examples of that are developing a renewable energy strategy in far west New South Wales, collaborating with neighbouring regions on climate change on the mid North Coast, supporting the uptake of alternative energy sources in the Northern Rivers, reskilling of existing occupations on the Central Coast, immediate development of a green economy strategy in the Murray region and environmentally sustainable housing design and construction in Ipswich and West Moreton. They are not proposals that we have suggested. These are proposals that the locals themselves have been developing.


I will mention a couple of good examples very briefly because I visited the Gascoyne region of Western Australia and Geraldton. Geraldton has committed itself to becoming a carbon neutral city. They want to source through renewables the energy base upon which the iron ore development in that area, which will become a second Pilbara, is powered. The region itself is coming to grips with it. The Leader of the National Party talked about windmills replacing things. He ought to get down to the Eyre Peninsula and see the wind power initiatives that are already down there. That region wants to turn itself into a renewable energy sourced region.


I say to the member who spoke: do not just go out and run the negative argument. We know how well negative arguments can work. We have practised them before. But in the end, truth comes to bear. In this case what we are seeing is the opportunity out there. The regions understand not just the threat those on the other side would have us believe is going to come from our initiative but they see opportunity. That is where we should be challenging regional Australia, not scaring them. We should actually be encouraging them to grasp the opportunity, take the initiative, seize the moment and diversify their economic base. All of the regions should be tasked with this initiative by us saying, 'You identify how you want your patch to work better.' The vast bulk of the regions are embracing the renewable energy strategy, the green jobs strategy and the challenge of climate change.


Members opposite should support their regions in meeting the challenge. They should support their regions in grasping the opportunity. They should stop the fear campaign. By the way, once the full details are out on Sunday, they will be looking like very hollow people indeed. The fear campaign can only work for a certain distance. The truth of the matter is that the detail out there, the compensation measures, the industry support measures, the commit­ment to actually leading on this, the understanding of our intrinsic strength, the understanding that we do need to diversify the economic base and actually prepare the regions and support them in doing it, will win through. In the end, as I said at the beginning, the only party that has ever had this commitment to regional development is Labor. Labor will again do it and we will also ensure that the structural adjustment is done in such a way that people are helped to make the adjustment, not be threatened by it.

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2011-07-06,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (16:06):  We have just heard a speech from the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, a man who claims he travels so much around Australia. He might have travelled around Australia but he has not listened to regional Australia, because regional Australia, by and large, says no to a climate tax. 


The matter of public importance before the House today is:


The social and economic impact of the carbon tax on regional Australia.


This tax will hit regional Australia harder than any other area. It will hit regional and rural Australia harder than it will hit those who live in the capital cities. We know because we go there; we come from there. We have more members in regional and rural Australia than the government and that is why we understand the arguments.


Australians have faced massive increases in the cost of living under this Labor government. Electricity has gone up by more than 50 per cent in their term, gas is up 30 per cent, the cost of water and sewerage is up 45 per cent, health costs are up 20 per cent, education costs are up 24 per cent and food is up 14 per cent. The cost of paying these bills and doing the weekly shopping has become so much higher under this Gillard government. Why does the Labor govern­ment want to make everything so much more expensive? Why do they want to make things even more expensive with a carbon tax? It is because the Prime Minister is beholden to the radical agenda of the Greens.


Quite frankly, the Greens do not give a stuff about people living in regional and rural Australia. This carbon tax is one of those poorly thought out, fringe party policies that seeks to please the few by harming the majority. It is an embarrassment for this Prime Minister and the Labor Party that not only has a carbon tax become the policy of a major political party, it has become the centrepiece of their government. As the Productivity Commission, a statutory author­ity of the Commonwealth, found recently, there is not a single other country—not one—which is planning to impose an economy wide carbon tax. There is a reason for that—it is not good policy. 


I was contacted recently by a small-business owner who employs 10 staff as the operator of a 24-room motel in the Hunter electorate. The member for Hunter's constituent wrote to me and said:


Our electricity price has been progressively increasing. As we are a motel, our guests often do not really care how much power they are consuming, as they do not pay the bill. We have increased our room tariffs, however, looking at this year's financial figures to date our operating costs have increased more than we have been able to recoup through price increases. What worries me is that particularly being in a regional area, it is difficult to keep increasing rates, as people are only prepared to pay so much. I fear the uncertainty of this proposed tax, and worry that it could spell the end of many small businesses, who will find it difficult to pass on the increases, and simply do not have the capital to invest in alternative power solutions.


Why does the member for Hunter support Labor's carbon tax when it will have such a devastating impact on his constituents?


I was contacted today by Joe Sepos from JS Transport Group in the member for Newcastle's electorate. JS Transport are a major livestock, chicken and general cargo transport operation. He said to me that he is concerned that Labor's carbon tax will push up the costs of his trucking business and that that will flow through to the everyday costs of everything on supermarket shelves, everything we buy. He believes the carbon tax will put up prices by at least five per cent because that is what he thinks it will increase the cost base of his business by. 


As I said, those costs will flow through the supply chain right to the kitchen table. What this government does not seem to understand is that the tyranny of distance means that Labor's carbon tax will hit the kitchen tables in regional Australia so much harder. Goods are transported by trucks everywhere across Australia. Everything we use and everything we consume is transported by trucks. This government's decision to put a tax on the diesel used by heavy trucks will drive up prices—and they are going to be so proud of that! 


What makes Labor's carbon tax on regional Australia even more offensive is that it will come with no environmental outcome. Between 2000 and 2008, the cost of electricity in Australia rose by 55.9 per cent. Over that same period, consumption rose by 10 per cent—from 10,194 kilowatt hours per capita to 11,217 kilowatt hours per capita. So where is the link between pushing up the price of electricity and reducing consumption? It is not there. These are statistics; these are not lies or inferences. You cannot cut back on the essentials of life and this insidious Labor tax grab will not reduce emissions one iota. It will only reduce affordability for people living in regional Australia. 


Labor members in steel electorates, coal electorates and in motor and other manuf­acturing electorates know that jobs will go under this tax, but they are too frightened to admit it. Businesses have warned them and the unions have warned them, but they are too frightened to admit it. One day, however, they are going to have to front their electorates and explain why jobs have gone. They will have to answer the questions that their electorates will ask them about the electricity price hikes, the food price hikes and the grocery price hikes. The whole point of the carbon tax—and let us be very clear about this—is to drive up prices to reduce consumption. 


In question time today, the member for Forrest asked the Treasurer about the cost impact of the carbon tax on a dairy farmer, Graham Manning, in her electorate. Do you know what? The Treasurer would not answer the question. She asked about the increased cost of electricity because electricity is a major cost for a dairy farmer—in refrig­eration and in operating their dairy facilities. The only thing I can see happening with this carbon tax, in regional Australia in particular, is jobs being driven away from our region. 


There are some people who need to come in here and explain things to this parliament. The member for Capricornia has 2,000 coalminers in her electorate to explain to, the members for Corangamite and Corio have 1,300 car workers to explain to, the member for Hunter has 2,700 coal workers to explain to, the members for Throsby and Cunning­ham have 2,000 coal workers to explain to, the member for Throsby has a further 5,300 steelworkers to explain to, the member for Wakefield has 2,700 car workers to explain to, the member for Lingiari has 850 aluminium workers to explain to and the member for Bass has 560 aluminium workers to explain to. Those 17,410 workers in regional Australia do not have a voice on the Labor side. They are taken for granted.


I want to reassure those in the gallery of one thing: the coalition and the Labor government have the same target—five per cent by 2020. The difference is that the government wants to penalise and tax and shift money around.




Mr Ian Macfarlane:
  Tax and spend.




Mr BALDWIN:
  Yes, tax and spend, whereas the coalition government want to incentivise, educate and deliver by direct action. As I said earlier, if increasing the price of electricity was going to change habits then we would not have seen a 10 per cent increase in consumption per capita while electricity prices rose by 55 per cent in that same period. It was the former Prime Minister in 2009 who said, 'Climate change is the greatest moral challenge of our time'. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker: the greatest moral challenge that we face in this nation today is the honesty and integrity of our Prime Minister, who said just days before the election: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' To address the greatest moral challenge we now face, it is very clear what should be done. This Prime Minister, if she had an ounce of integrity or honesty, would go to the polls and seek a mandate. This Prime Minister has not listened to the people, because if she had listened to the people she would have heard very clearly that they do not want a carbon tax. People in the gallery: do you want a carbon tax? Do you want to be penalised? These are the questions that need to be answered, because the Prime Minister will not get out there and talk to people like you. 




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Paterson should not misrepresent the people in the gallery. They have no opportunity to respond. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  There is no point of order. 





Mr BALDWIN:
  Here we have another member of parliament who refuses to listen to people just like the good people here in the gallery. He refuses to listen to people—like all Labor members, it is all tell and no listen. What you have to do, if you want to embark on the process, is take people on the journey with you, and they have not done that. (Time expired)

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (16:16):  It is appropriate that we have heard just now a reference from the member for Paterson to the bipartisan target of five per cent reduction in emissions below 2000 levels by 2020. The only problem is that those opposite have no plan that will enable our country to reach that target. The only thing they have put forward is a plan which will cost billions and billions of dollars of taxpayers' money. Under their plan, Australia will not reach that emissions reduction target or anything like it by 2020. If we proceed down the path that the coalition is proceeding on, it will commit Australia to purchasing international permits at a cost of billions and billions of dollars to the taxpayers of this country. 


We also just heard the member for Paterson read out a long list of electorates. He asserts that the members of those electorates should explain their position on action on climate change or action on pricing carbon to the people of their electorates. I would call on all members opposite to explain to the constituents in their electorates why they have adopted no effective policy on climate change and why they have embarked on a script—and they have all got a script; we heard it today from the Leader of the Nationals and from the member for Paterson—which is basically about instilling fear in the people of Australia and deceiving the people of Australia. Those opposite have been engaging in dumb stunts all over the country, and in no sense have they been engaging in the kind of debate that we need to be having. 


Having said that there is a bipartisan target of five per cent cuts of 2000 levels by 2020, we could then go to the fact that those opposite went to the 2007 election committed to an emissions trading scheme. The Howard government, of which the present Leader of the Opposition was part of the cabinet—he has got a bit of explaining to do—adopted an emissions trading scheme as the policy of the coalition before the 2007 election. Until four days before the second time on which the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was voted on in 2009, it was the policy of the coalition that there should be an emissions trading scheme in this country, as some of those opposite now listening to me know only too well. 


The other comment that I would make on the contributions we heard from the Leader of the Nationals and the member for Paterson in this discussion is that entirely absent from anything they have said is any reference to why we are engaging in this policy and why we have adopted as a bipartisan target a cut in Australia's emissions. Of course, the reason is that we on this side of the House care about the future of our children. We care about the future of our children's children. We care about the future of the planet. We know the best target that we can now get to is the stabilisation of world temperatures at around two degrees by 2050 and, to do so, we have to immediately start cutting global emissions, which includes cutting Australia's emissions. 


This is said to be a matter of public importance that raises consequences for rural and regional Australia. Of course it is the case that rural and regional Australia will be hit at least as hard, if not harder, as any other part of Australia by climate change. In particular, farming activities and other agricultural activities across our country are going to be hit by dangerous climate change. People in rural and regional Australia understand that only too well, because in many rural areas of Australia they are already experiencing the effects of dangerous climate change. That is why our government is embarking on a carbon price mechanism for Australia, the details of which are going to be announced this Sunday by the Prime Minister. 


You would not think that the details were going to be announced if you listened to either of the contributions we heard today from the Leader of the Nationals or the member for Paterson. They were doing what the coalition has been doing for at least the past four months, which is going around and making stuff up—in other words, just invent­ing details about our carbon price scheme before any announcement of its detail. This is part of their scare campaign and misleading of the Australian people. Indeed, it would include attacking anyone who does not agree with what the Leader of the Opposition or members of the coalition might say. We have had month after month of this scare campaign by the opposition and month after month of them making stuff up. The recent attack that the Leader of the Opposition made on economists was someth­ing to behold. It is hard to believe that any responsible national leader in our country could have made the kinds of comments that the Leader of the Opposition made last Friday about economists. But you can perhaps understand why the Leader of the Opposition made the comments if you take a single example. A group of exceptionally eminent economists wrote an open letter on 2 June this year explaining their view about putting a price on carbon pollution. I will read one of their key conclusions and then explain who they are. They said:


We are all of the view that the introduction of an emissions trading scheme is a necessary and desirable structural reform of the Australian economy, designed to change relative prices in a way that provides an effective incentive to consumers and producers to shift over time to more low carbon energy efficient patterns of consumption and production.


It is incredibly clear. They also said:


… a price on carbon pollution, preferably an emissions trading scheme, is the best way to reduce carbon emissions over time …


The signatories to this letter, who have all signed in an individual capacity, included Paul Brennan, the head of economics at Citigroup Global Markets; Chris Caton, chief economist at the BT Financial Group; Besa Deda, chief economist at St George; Saul Eslake from the Grattan Institute and former chief economist at the ANZ Bank; Bill Evans, the chief economist at Westpac; Joshua Gans, Professor of Management at Melbourne Business School; Richard Gibbs, the global head of economics at Macquarie Bank; Stephen Grenville at the Lowy Institute for International Policy; Stephen Halmarick, Chairman, Australian Business Economists; John Hewson, known eminent economist and of course former leader of the Liberal Party; Raja Junankar, professorial visiting fellow at the School of Economics and Finance at the University of New South Wales; Geoff Weir, Director of Financial Sector Services; and Glenn Withers, the chief executive of Universities Australia. They are all eminent economists.


What was the response of the Leader of the Opposition not only to what those economists had to say but to what a whole range of other economists have had to say and, indeed, what Australian business leaders have had to say for months now? This is what the Leader of the Opposition said on 1 July: 'It may well be that most Australian economists think that a carbon tax is the way to go. Maybe that is a comment on the quality of our economists rather than on the merits of the argument.' What a cheap shot! What a disgraceful thing to say! But it is typical of the Leader of the Opposition, who, whenever anybody does not agree with him or the coalition's supposed policies, thinks that the appropriate response is simply to attack them personally.


There was an extraordinary statement made today by the Leader of the Opposition, who at a doorstop criticised the government for going to talk to the Australian people, which he described as—and this is pretty rich coming from the Leader of the Opposi­tion—'carefully choreographing photo opp­ortunities'. Think for a moment about who said that, Mr Deputy Speaker. That was the present Leader of the Opposition. What hypocrisy! The Leader of the Opposition never does anything other than carefully choreograph photo opportunities. All we have had for the last four months, since the Prime Minister's announcement of the broad framework of the scheme, is such carefully choreographed photo opportunities. He refuses to be interviewed, refuses to do anything other than hand out slogans.


I would have thought that today, in this debate raised by the Leader of the Nationals, we might have heard something about the government's Carbon Farming Initiative, which provides opportunities for revenue and jobs in rural and regional Australia, arising from people in the land sector, farmers across Australia, participating in reducing Australia's emissions and, in doing so, to earn income. It is supported by the National Farmers Federation, but of course the National Party in this place and their colleagues in the Liberal Party have decided to oppose this opportunity for farmers across Australia to participate in reducing Aust­ralia's emissions and, for that matter, to earn revenue for themselves. We have had months of them talking down the Australian economy, talking down our skills. We are a clever, creative nation, and it is about time those opposite recognised that and assisted us in designing an appropriate carbon price for Australia. (Time expired)

Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (16:26):  You have heard it from the honourable member for Isaacs and there has been a lot of discussion on this issue, none of which the Australian people are much interested in hearing politicians talk about.


Today I want to talk to people like the member for Hunter and the member for Robertson, who are in the chamber. If I could have the indulgence of those in the gallery and the truck drivers on the lonely roads across Australia, whom I know listen to our addresses, today I am going to talk not to you but to those on the other side of the House.


I want to talk about history and I will start with the history now. As the member for Hunter knows, I am the only person in this House who has been defeated twice in elections held on tax. When Paul Keating stood at the dispatch box and I was sitting in the seat right in front of where I am now, he leaned across and said, 'Son, you're gone.' I was. It was not because I had not worked hard as a member, not because I was not highly talented—




Mr Ian Macfarlane:
  No.




Mr BROADBENT:
  No. It was because we had a tax debate and the member for Hotham—and I know he is watching right now—propagated and managed the mother of all scare campaigns ever to be launched in this country against a good taxation change for the benefit of the community, called the GST. It was the mother of all scare campaigns, run by the member for Hotham. By the way, a member who just left the chamber, Alan Griffin, now the member for Bruce, came in on that campaign, which I was thrown out on, in 1993. He is still here. He remembers what happened.


He also saw the amazing scare campaign of 1998. What was it on? It was on tax. What was the tax? A GST. How many seats did the government of the day lose during the tax debate? Nineteen seats. I am saying to the backbench of the Labor Party right now: there is a huge issue. The leaders in your party got you into this mess. Have a look at the percentages by which most of your leadership, except for your Treasurer, hold their seats and ask whether they will be here after the next election. The answer is: yes, they will be here. Will you be here? No, you will not be here. Not just on the current trends—I am talking about when you are arguing to us about a major scare campaign on a tax, having been in that place where you are today, holding your seat, wondering whether you are going to make it, wondering whether you are going to have a wage into the future. It has been hard to get there; it is hard to hold. I am talking to every member of your backbench in this government now, and those that have been around for a while know exactly what I am talking about here. You have one way out of this.




Ms O'Neill:
  You can serve the national interest.




Mr BROADBENT:
  You can talk about serving the national interest, you can talk about doing the right thing for the environment, but now I talk about the reality and the truth. The truth is that, in relation to this tax, the Productivity Commission, commissioned by the government, asked to return their findings early because they had not much to discover. What they did discover was that there is no country in the whole world that is going to introduce a tax like this—not one country in the whole world: read the Productivity Commission report. It was not a positive report for the tax. It did not put Australia in a good light. It did not say that we should be leading the world. It did not say that we should be putting our workers at disadvantage; we should not be trading green jobs overseas. The member for Hunter knows exactly what I am talking about. There will be green jobs, all right. Do you know where they will be? They will be in China, India and Indonesia. They will not be here for our workers. Is that understood? There will be green jobs. Perhaps the truck drivers across the nation now are hearing this: you will not be carting the stuff that you are carting today, because it will be carted around in China, where the pollution will be greater than in this country.


What I am putting to you is that there is a very strong argument against this tax, whatever the politics of it are. But I will come back and say to those members of parliament who are sitting in this place today, who have a desire for the betterment of the nation, who are concerned about their kids, who are concerned about their future, whose husbands would like to have a job, whose wives would like to have a job, whose kids want a job, whose partners want a job, that we have a nation led by a leader that says, 'I am prepared to trade off those jobs and those opportunities in this country and trade them into another country,' for heaven's sake. I thought the first responsibility of a Prime Minister of this nation was for the health and wellbeing of its people, its economy and its defence.




Ms O'Neill:
  Now and into the future.




Mr BROADBENT:
  Now and into the future. Thank you, member for Robertson. That is not what is being shown by this Prime Minister.


You know what you have to do. You know that you are completely shackled to this Prime Minister through this carbon tax, about which she has already deceived the Australian people for base political reasons in the middle of an election campaign by saying: 'I am not going to have this tax. Do not worry anybody; we are not going to have a tax.' That is what she was really saying. She was told to by her minders to say, 'We can't have a tax.'




Mrs Mirabella:
  She lied.




Mr BROADBENT:
  She lied, in that instance. She made a statement to the Australian people in the middle of an election campaign when they were about to vote. She said: 'Have confidence in me. It is all right. I won't put a new tax on you.' Who would be a young person these days, as compared to the generations that have gone before us, when they have the property taxes, when they have the GST, which our parents did not have, and when they have all the other taxes, which the Treasurer, coming into the room, knows all about? It is hard to get ahead these days because of those taxes.


I say to the Labor government of the day, because of my experience in 1993 of being thrown out and my experience in 1998 of being thrown out: it is fine if you have got a big margin, but if you have not got a big margin, you are likely to lose your seat in a taxation election campaign, and that is what is about to happen to many of you in the Labor Party at the next election. It may happen to you anyway—we work hard to get rid of you. But this will go all the way up to the member for Hunter. If you are under that, you are gone; if you have special interests in your electorate, you are gone. If you come from Geelong or the Illawarra or La Trobe Valley and you are a Labor representative, you are gone. What I learned was, no matter how many times I reassured my community that we could compensate them for the GST, the Labor Party sent out one more scare campaign with Alan Griffin's name on it and I was dead again. It was simply a scare campaign.


You have a carbuncle, and that carbuncle is recognisable to you and every other Aust­ralian. I am not criticising the office of Prime Minister. I am saying your party has a carbuncle and that carbuncle is Julia Gillard, who is locked into that tax. What you need to do is rip that carbuncle out of your party and get rid of it.



An opposition member:  Like a boil, it needs to be lanced.




Mr BROADBENT:
  I do not need words put into my mouth; it is hard enough getting this out as it is. It is a carbuncle that you have to remove. If you do not remove it, the Australian people are going to remove it for you, along with many of you.


Take it from my experience: it is not a good feeling to go down once, it is not a good feeling to go down twice, it is not a good feeling to go down three times and it is not a good feeling to lose four times, two of them on tax. Just remember that. It is taxation: you will have to know every detail of it. I have lived it; I have worked it. It is very, very hard and it is near impossible to win. I challenge you that you will not be able to win this argument. The member for McEwen has just come in. Mate, I have been there once or twice in this place and the rest of the people do not think much of you when you come back. Coming back is hard.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2011-07-06,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter—Chief Government Whip) (14:36):  It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Paterson, and I will return to him a little later. I am almost disappointed to be following the member for McMillan—I like him, he is a good bloke, generally speaking he makes a sensible contribution to public policy debate and he takes a pragmatic approach—but after his contribution I must attack him on this occasion. The first thing I would say to him is that it is not about you, mate. It is not about me, either, and it is not about the member for McEwen—it is about the national interest. While the member for McMillan takes some comfort in the fact that his losses were never his fault, what we need to be doing in this place is putting the national interest ahead of our own interests. That is exactly what the government is doing with the introduction of this very important public policy reform.


I start by reminding people of what this debate is and what it is not. What it is not is a debate about the science of climate change. The Leader of the Opposition and members on the other side generally have accepted that we must tackle climate change and that human beings make a contribution to the warming of the planet. That is why the Leader of the Opposition and all those who sit opposite have their own policy. Indeed, as the member for Paterson reminded us, they have the same targets on carbon reduction as the government. This is really only a debate about the relative policies of the major parties—what we intend to do and what they intend to do in response to this pressing environmental challenge.


On this side, of course, we are prop­osing—and the details will be announced on Sunday—an emissions trading scheme; a charge on the big polluters who on a daily basis emit their greenhouse gases into the atmosphere free of charge. Have a think about that in economic terms. This represents a big economic distortion. Small businesses who generate waste have to take their waste to the dump—they pay. Large chemical businesses have an expensive process for disposing of their waste, and they pay. You and I, Mr Deputy Speaker, when we do our additional gardening at home, for example, go to the garbage dump—we compost as much as we can, of course—and we pay to dump our waste.


When you have these inconsistencies you have economic distortions, and those distort­ions affect investment decisions. People ask me why we are charging the polluters and compensating them, the people, as consum­ers. Unfortunately businesses, where they can, will pass some of those additional and new business costs onto consumers, and we will protect those consumers. We are not so much seeking to change the behaviour of consumers, considerable merit though that may have; we are trying to change the habits, first, of investors who with a level playing field after the introduction of an ETS will be more likely to invest in renewable tech­nologies, and, second, we are trying to change the behaviour of the polluters themselves, giving them the incentive to invest in new technology, in innovation, to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions. We are using a market mechanism to get there. Many of those who spoke on the other side have referred to the Productivity Commission's report, and I thank them because what that report showed more clearly than anything else was that the most efficient and the cheapest way to address greenhouse gas emissions is with a market-based mechanism, which is exactly what the Prime Minister will be announcing on Sunday.


By contrast, the Leader of the Opposition and all those who sit behind him, including the member for Paterson and the member for McMillan, want to tax people more—they want tax increases in this country to the tune of tens of billions of dollars—and transfer that wealth to the big polluters. They are going to tax people more, hand that money to the polluters and say, 'We are going to help you introduce those new technologies; we will help you get your emissions down.' There are no guarantees; no contracts—they will hand all that money over to the big polluters in the hope they will do the right thing and invest in technologies and reduce their carbon emissions. Let there be no mistake: this is not a debate about the science of climate change; it is not a debate about whether we should do something about climate change—it is only a debate about how we address climate change in this country.


Let me deal with some of the other myths, given that there is such a fondness on the other side for the Productivity Commission's report—something that shocks me. The first myth is that no-one else is acting. The Productivity Commission looked at a number of countries—the UK, the US, Germany, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand. What do those opposite think the Productivity Commission was looking at? What do they think the Productivity Commission would have been studying in those countries if those countries had not taken action on climate change? Of course they have taken action, and they are taking very substantial action. Australia is being left behind. We can get a good illustration of how we are being left behind by reflecting on the fact that the former Prime Minister, John Howard, went to the 2007 election, four years ago, promising to introduce an emissions trading scheme. Here we are, still debating it mid-2011, notwithstanding the fact that, at the time, most members on the other side—including I think the Leader of the Opposition but certainly the former Leader of the Opposition and the former former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Nelson—supported Mr Howard's policy.


The second myth is that this is going to put downward pressure on employment, that jobs are going to be lost in industries like coalmining. That is absolute rubbish. Even the coal industry's own modelling did not show a loss of jobs in the coalmining industry, as some people have suggested. It did suggest—I am not saying I agree with it, because modelling is modelling as we all know—that there would be potentially a growth in jobs if this system were introduced. So let us not have these misrepresentations. I am certainly not concerned about job losses in coalmining in my electorate. I can assure you, thanks to heavy demand in Asia for our resources, that jobs in coalmining in my electorate will continue to grow—and the investment pipeline is already in place. The third myth is that the sky will fall. The sky did not fall in New Zealand, the sky did not fall in California and the sky has not fallen anywhere where carbon abatement has become a serious government policy. The member for Paterson predictably spent a little bit of time zeroing in on my electorate and Hunter region more generally. It just goes to show how totally out of touch he is with community sentiment in the Hunter Valley, where the overwhelming majority of people are now concerned about the environment and the cumulative impacts of industries like coalmining. We have huge land use conflicts. People are saying in increasing numbers that they want to ensure that the coalmining industry—as important as it has been to us but which will maybe last for 30 years—does not impact on sustainable industries such as agriculture, thoroughbred breeding and viticulture. These are industries that have supported us and provided us with an income for many decades and will hopefully sustain us into the next century and beyond.


By applying the true costs of doing business on these businesses we will get a real measure of the negative externalities on local communities and I think that will become an important part of the equation. People working in coalmines in my elect­orate are not fearful that the ETS is going to cost them their job. They have not been fooled by the scare campaign of the opposition, as much as I hate to disappoint the member for McMillan. They want bal­ance and through the minerals resource rent tax they want to get their fair share of the product that comes out of the ground locally. They want to ensure that the environment is protected and that the true cost of the coalmines is reflected in government policy, and that those sustainable industries are not destroyed by the coalmining industry. There is a balance there.


Following the announcement on Sunday, this policy will dominate the media and public debate in the coming months. I hope and pray that the debate is dominated by the facts of this policy, but I feel very pessimistic, given the contributions from those opposite today.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER

Hon. BC Scott

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2011-07-06,"



Mr SWAN

 (Lilley—Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer) (16:47): by leave—It was less than three years ago that the world was witnessing an unprecedented meltdown in the global financial system. Not long after, the global economy plunged into the depths of recession—the worst the world had endured in 75 years. Throughout this period, I have from time to time provided an update on events to the parliament. In light of events in Europe in the past week and broader challenges facing parts of the global economy, it is appropriate that I do this again before members rise for the winter break.


Recovering from such a widespread and severe financial crisis was always going to be hard. It was never going to be speedy; it was never going to be seamless. The IMF made this point back in April 2009, in its World economic outlook, when it said:


Recessions associated with financial crises have been more severe and longer lasting than recessions associated with other shocks. Recoveries from such recessions have been typically slower, associated with weak domestic demand and tight credit conditions.


So it should come as no surprise that many economies are still coming to terms with the considerable legacies of the crisis. It is important to remember that Australia is in a far stronger position than most advanced economies. This is because we heeded these very warnings from the International Monetary Fund and the broader international community that it would be harder for economies to recover from a recession that was induced by a financial crisis. It is exactly why we acted to avert a recession at home.


It is because of the action that we took at the heart of global financial crisis, and the hard work of the Australian people, that we now have a strong outlook, strong job creation and a strong fiscal position. And despite the fact that we have been hit hard by natural disasters, we continue to have one of the most enviable economic scorecards of the developed world. We are not immune from global uncertainty—and this is clearly reflected in some of the patchy economic conditions we are experiencing at home. But it does not change the fact that we face a dramatically different set of challenges to many of our peers. As I have said before, our challenges are far better challenges to have.




International uncertainty



For some time now, I have characterised the global recovery as uneven and subject to risk. In recent weeks these risks have become more pronounced and the global recovery has weakened. We have seen a hit to the Japanese economy from the earth­quake, tsunami and nuclear disaster as well as disruption to international supply chains. In the United States, a depressed labour market, unprecedented weakness in the housing market and high oil prices are still holding back recovery.


Most significantly, we have seen debt problems confronting a number of European economies—especially Greece. The uncert­ainty surrounding the situation in Europe has weighed on markets and generated signific­ant volatility in these past few weeks. The Greek parliament approved last week a further package of austerity measures which will allow for the provision of the next tranche of its existing EU and IMF assistance package.


I welcome Greek and European efforts to avert what would have been an immediate default. But we should not underestimate the challenges ahead for Greece and Europe more generally. It must deal with a huge debt overhang, and a projected fiscal consolid­ation of around 12 per cent of GDP over the next five years. This comes on top of the unprecedented consolidation already imp­lemented, worth eight per cent of GDP.


Greece, Portugal and Ireland are by themselves relatively small parts of the global economy, so the direct impact of their issues is limited. However, given their status as euro area members, the potential for contagion is significant, particularly in the event of a disorderly default. With banks in Europe and the US holding significant amounts of European government debt, such contagion could generate renewed financial market turmoil globally.


These challenges were underlined just last night when Moody’s cut Portugal’s credit rating by four notches to below investment grade. Moody’s pointed to a growing risk that Portugal would also need further financial support and that it may be unable to meet its deficit reduction targets.


The role of European authorities and EU member states in confronting the challenges facing Greece, Portugal and Ireland is crucial, and it is essential that they take decisive action. These issues also go to the heart of the work I am doing with my G20 colleagues to bring about strong, sustainable and balanced global growth.


Even beyond these immediate challenges, Europe’s high government debt, persistently high unemployment and structural rigidities, suggest it is unlikely to contribute substant­ially to global growth for some considerable time.


It is not just Europe that faces continued sluggish growth and challenges in addressing fiscal sustainability. The United States and Japan are faced with balancing the need to avoid undermining their economic recoveries in the short term, while setting in place credible medium-term plans to address high and rising public debt. As the IMF warned last week, the failure by the United States to move quickly to increase its borrowing authority could result in a severe shock to global financial markets.




Asian 
c
entury



Despite the fragile global outlook, we can take confidence in the fact that the outlook for our own region remains bright.


If the events in Europe did trigger a more serious disruption in global financial markets or significantly stalled the global recovery, this would have implications for us and our neighbours. But from where we sit now, we are well placed to benefit from strong conditions on our doorstep, which are expected to continue for some time.


Unlike many advanced economies in the West, emerging Asia recovered relatively quickly from the GFC, and is now growing strongly. This strong growth in Asia is helping to accelerate the transformation that was already underway in the global economy before the crisis hit.


Twenty years ago China and India together accounted for less than one-tenth of world production. Today that share has doubled and by the end of this decade it is expected to be over a quarter of world production.


We can see the first manifestation of the Asian century on Australia in the mining boom. But there will be just as pronounced an impact on the rest of our economy in future as the growth in Asia’s middle class drives demand for the rest of our goods and services.


This means that enormous opportunities are unfolding on our doorstep. It also means that we need to ensure the Australian econ­omy has the productive capacity and the right long-term settings in place to allow us to grab this opportunity and not let go.


The opportunities of the Asian century are not just on offer to us because of our positioning in the global economy. The fact is, we are only in a position to capitalise on these opportunities because of our strong economic foundations.


If we had not weathered the global financial crisis as we did, if we had instead followed the rest of the world into recession, then we would be in a very different position today. While many of our peers are still struggling to make up for lost ground, Australia’s GDP is now significantly ahead of what it was at the start of the crisis.


This has meant we have avoided the high rates of unemployment that now plague many advanced economies. While our unemployment rate stands at just 4.9 per cent, economies like the US and euro area are grappling with unemployment rates in excess of nine per cent.


We have also emerged from the global recession with lower government debt and lower deficits than any of the major advanced economies. Net government debt is expected to peak at 7.2 per cent of GDP in 2011-12 and decline thereafter. Even at its peak, Australia’s net debt will be less than one tenth of the average of the major advanced economies.


But despite our impressive scorecard, we know that the GFC is still having a lingering impact on some parts of the economy, as is the continued uncertainty in the global economy. Consumers are still more cautious than they have been in the period before the crisis—spending less and saving a bit more. This is not surprising given the subdued recovery in household wealth since the global financial crisis and the uncertainty surrounding the global outlook. Credit conditions also remain tight.


On top of this, we have taken a huge hit from last summer’s natural disasters, and although we have made significant progress in recovery, there is still a long way to go.


The higher dollar—a sign of our relative economic strength—is also a burden for many of our industries, such as manuf­acturing and tourism.


But despite these soft spots, we need to remember that our fundamentals are strong, and we are well positioned to benefit from robust growth in the most dynamic corner of the global economy. And the historic shift in the global gravity from East to West is taking our terms of trade to record heights, and is driving an unprecedented pipeline of business investment—with ABARES estim­ating a pipeline of $430 billion in resources alone.


So Australia is located in the right part of the world at the right time—the prospects for our region remain much stronger as the weight of global activity continues to shift in our favour.


Australian banks have also strengthened their regulatory capital and maintained sound provisioning levels. Local banks now depend less on wholesale funding from abroad than during the global financial crisis because they are attracting more local deposits. Their foreign currency denominated funding rem­ains fully hedged into Australian dollars.


All of these factors mean that Australian banks are in a good position to meet future challenges. But it is important that we build on our existing regulatory framework to ensure that we maintain a world-class, efficient and safe financial sector.


The government is committed to implem­enting the Basel III reforms to ensure banks have sufficient liquidity to withstand stress in global funding markets and appropriate capital levels as a buffer against unexpected losses. The government is also taking action through its competitive and sustainable banking system reforms to help consumers get a better deal, while also securing the long-term safety and sustainability of our financial system. This government is clearly focused on the challenges facing the global economy and what this means for us.


That is why we are investing in our economic capacity to make sure it can withstand any future shocks and maximise the opportunities that will flow to us in the Asian century. This means serious economic reforms like putting in place a price on carbon to drive investment in the clean-energy technologies of the future. It means continuing our record of serious tax reform, where we are introducing a broad range of reforms, like the minerals resource rent tax and a cut to the company tax rate.


It also means announcing in the budget a record skills and training package that converts the prosperity of the mining boom into more and better jobs—for both the min­ing and non-mining sectors of our economy. And it does mean increasing our skilled migration program to ensure it is supplem­enting our labour needs of the future.


Despite the challenges facing the global economy, the government’s reform agenda and our solid foundations will ensure the Australian economy remains the envy of the developed world. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for North Sydney to speak for 13 minutes.


Leave granted.




Mr SWAN:
  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Hockey speaking in reply to my statement for a period not exceeding 13 minutes.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (17:01):  It is curious that the Treasurer feels the need to make a ministerial statement on the economy just four days before the release of the details on the carbon tax—and yet, from what I heard, the carbon tax rates only one mention in the ministerial statement. Surely, of all the issues that the Treasurer could discuss, the detail on the carbon tax would be of the most immediate interest to the House and the Australian people. What the Treas­urer has done is to outline some of the risks as to the international outlook. In particular, he has noted concerns over sovereign debt in Europe and the challenge of addressing fiscal sustainability in Europe, Japan and the USA. The coalition shares these concerns.


But I am somewhat perplexed that the Treasurer does not draw out the lessons of the international experience for Australia. The Treasurer does not seem to realise that it is the continued uncertainty and risks in the international environment which make it critically important that Australia gets its fiscal house in order. The Treasurer does not seem to realise that federal government debt itself represents a risk, and that the debt should be paid down as soon as possible, not at some uncertain date at the decade's end. The Treasurer does not seem to realise that maintaining a stable and certain policy envir­onment for investors is critically important to preserving confidence and investment, part­icularly at a time when sovereign risk is high in the list of concerns for the international community about Australia.


The Treasurer makes brief mention of economic conditions in Australia, noting some patchiness and also that consumers remain cautious. Well, I think he is tiptoeing around the true state of our economy. This country should be going at full speed ahead, with the terms of trade at 140-year highs delivering an unprecedented boost to nat­ional income. But we now find that consumers and businesses are increasingly uncertain and lack confidence. Recent economic indicators show that the Australian economy is going throng a soft patch. Let me run through the evidence. Consumer confidence was down 2.6 per cent in June, to the lowest level since June 2009. Retail spending was down 0.6 per cent in May. In trend terms, Australian turnover for retail in May was only 2.4 per cent higher than in May 2010, which is a very weak increase in the space of a year. Investment in dwellings is collapsing. Dwelling construction approv­als were down 7.9 per cent in May and in trend terms have fallen for seven consecutive months. House prices are down, with industry data showing capital city values falling in the five months to May. Demand for credit is weak, with household borrowing for housing rising at the slowest pace in a generation. And this household caution has led to consumers cocooning, with the house­hold savings ratio rising to 11.5 per cent in the March quarter to around the highs of the financial crisis a few years ago. So it is no surprise this is reflecting in a softening in business conditions, with the ACCI reporting business conditions in the June quarter down to levels not seen since its survey began in 1998, 13 years ago.


The Treasurer should be focusing on these statistics and he should be looking for causes and coming up with solutions. Perhaps he wants us to believe that this loss of confidence is linked to concerns on the international front. I note Australia has been through bouts of international uncertainty before. Australia sailed through the Asian crisis of 1998, in spite of concerns in some quarters that our close ties with Asia would lead to severe repercussions for our economy, and I well recall the Australian dollar falling to near-record lows at that time. Australia was relatively unaffected by the near-recession in the developed world in 2001 in the face of significant headwinds. And we were arguably the developed country least affected by the North Atlantic financial crisis of 2007 and 2008.


What the Treasurer will not admit is that it is his own actions and the policies of this government which have caused such a severe loss of consumer and business confidence. There are many, many elements to this. Taxation policy is just one. The govern­ment's approach to taxation reform is to milk the economy for all it can get. The government has introduced, increased or foreshadowed 19 taxes since it came to power just over three years ago. From 1 July this year—just five days ago—workers are now paying the flood levy. That is an extra half of one per cent in increased personal income taxes for people with an income between $50,000 and $100,000, so up to $250 a year, and one per cent for incomes above that. Households now have a little less spending power than they had a week ago. That is unlikely to make them more confident about the future, especially whilst they are facing massive increases in elect­ricity prices, water prices and transport prices. The government's behaviour in refusing to release the details of the carbon tax while parliament is sitting, to allow proper scrutiny, is not helping confidence. Australians have many legitimate questions about this tax. The coalition has been asking these questions for months and, especially, this week. But the government just refuses to answer. This refusal to answer has left many thousands of households and businesses in limbo. Will the carbon tax apply to diesel for the trucks and other vehicles run by small businesses? The government announced an initiative in relation to petrol but then it did not want to explain who it would apply to and who it did not apply to.


Then there is the compensation issue. The government has announced part of the compensation equation but it will not tell anyone about the rest of the equation. What will be the price per tonne of carbon? We have had members of the committee responsible for shaping the carbon tax speculating about a price of up to $100 a tonne. In some cases it is settling on $40 a tonne, yet this just creates further uncertainty. How quickly will this tax rise? Again, an unknown issue that has not been addressed yet.


It is not as though the government does not already have the information. We know from the information that has been selective­ly leaked to the media that the carbon committee has thrashed out the details. Although, we do know that not all the members of cabinet have seen the details of the carbon tax. The entry of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the chamber is very timely because I understand he will not see the details of the carbon tax until Friday or Saturday. It is the case that the Independents and the Greens know more about the carbon tax package than those government members who are members of cabinet, and who are meant to approve it. It shows how totally dysfunctional the decision making is in this government.


All we are getting from the arrogant government is delaying tactics. The Treasu­rer says further detail will be there on Sunday. The Leader of the House screams into the microphone, 'Wait five more sleeps for an answer.' These are not things that inspire confidence in the government. These are not statements that encourage consumers to go out there and buy a new TV or upgrade their car, or to go and buy that house. These are not the things that inspire confidence amongst the enterprises of Australia.


It is no surprise that households and businesses are hoarding funds for a rainy day. That is a natural response when the economic future becomes uncertain. Aust­ralians have understandably lost confidence in the quality of the economic management of this government. Australia has never before had a government that is so cavalier with taxpayers' money, spending billions of dollars to install pink batts and millions more to inspect them and remove them. School halls and other school buildings were built well above the normal price that should be paid in the private sector. Computers in schools are another cracker; GP superclinics, which have been overpromised and under­delivered; stimulus cheques for $900 being sent to dead people and overseas—the list goes on and on. The budget remains in a mediocre state: four budgets and four deficits, including the largest peacetime deficits on record.


The Treasurer wants credit for a surplus. He has not delivered a surplus. I suspect he never will deliver a surplus.



Ms O'Neill interjecting—




Mr HOCKEY:
  I understand the new member is interjecting. I would warn her to get her facts right. Australians shake their heads in disbelief when the government claims to be a responsible economic manager even while it is running huge budget deficits at a time when we are experiencing the best terms of trade in 140 years. Australians shake their heads in disbelief when the government continues to compete for funds in the capital markets and puts upward pressure on interest rates at a time when households and businesses are already struggling with the impact of seven recent increases in less than two years.


Australians have lost trust in this government. We have a Prime Minister who says one thing before an election and then does the opposite after the election. This government is failing in its long term planning to provide the future underpinnings for the economy. Sir Rod Eddington, Chairman of Infrastructure Australia, bel­ieves Australia's infrastructure networks are barely adequate for current needs and are beginning to impose significant long-term costs. He believes there has been a collective failure by governments to give the issue of infrastructure planning and financing the priority it needs.


One of the unfortunate consequences of Labor's mismanagement of the economy is a stalling of productivity. I well remember the now Minister for Foreign Affairs being on this side of the chamber talking about prod­uctivity, and being asked about productivity. The GDP per hour worked in the March quarter this year was lower than the last full quarter of the coalition government. Productivity has actually fallen after 3½ years of Labor. By comparison, over the life of the coalition GDP per hour worked rose by over 25 per cent.


Of course, the Treasurer will not tell you this. It is not something he wants to focus on. He does not want to talk about productivity; or smaller government, or economic effic­iency, or real tax reform or the things that lay down strong foundations for the future of the Australian economy.


A recent private sector report to both domestic and international investors says it all:


The key issue is that Australian economic and taxation policy remains unpredictable, with foreign investors displeased with the continual surprise movement of the regulatory goal posts in Australia.


What Australia needs right now is a government that is consistent, capable and able to deliver on what it promises. It needs a government which keeps one eye on the international environment but which streng­thens and inoculates the Australian economy against almost any eventuality. We need a government that will restore the trust and confidence of Australians and restore Austr­alia as an attractive place to do business. What this country now needs is a coalition government.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2011-07-06,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Minister for Social Inclusion and Minister for Human Services) (17:55):  I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2011 contains a number of amendments to protect the integrity of Australia's social security system. 


Australia is a society that looks to provide a safety net for those that are most in need. Social security payments provide that safety net to many thousands of Australians.


While the great majority of social security recipients claim payments to which they are rightfully entitled, successive Australian governments have recognised that some people will attempt to receive payments to which they are not entitled. It is necessary, therefore, that there are robust measures in place to ensure the integrity of the social security system.


The bill amends the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, the administ­ration act, to address issues that have been identified, dating back to the commencement of the administration act in 2000, as a result of the recent case of Poniatowska versus the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.


For many years the CDPP has prosecuted cases involving social security fraud under various sections of the Criminal Code, particularly section 135.2, 'Obtaining a finan­cial advantage'. These offence provisions involve, for the physical element of the offence, proving that the defendant engaged in conduct, where the relevant conduct is an omission—namely, failing to inform the department of an event or change of circumstances that might affect the person's social security payment or qualification for a concession card.


Section 4.1 of the Criminal Code provides that engaging in conduct includes an omission to perform an act. Section 4.3 provides that an omission to perform an act can only be a physical element of an offence if (a) the law creating the offence makes it so; or (b) the law creating the offence impliedly provides that the offence is committed by an omission to perform an act that by law there is a duty to perform.


In the recent case of Poniatowska, a majority of the full court of the Supreme Court of South Australia held that 'section 135.2 does not define any duty or obligation relevant to an offence committed by way of omission'. It further noted that the CDPP had not relied on any notice issued to the defendant to establish a duty to inform the department of an event or change of circumstances, and that the administration act did 'not create a separate ""stand alone"" obligation'. On this basis, the court set aside the convictions which had been recorded against the defendant.


The Commonwealth has appealed the Poniatowska decision to the High Court, which has reserved its decision. The current position is that a large number of past convictions are at risk of being overturned on appeal on the basis of the decision in Poniatowska. 


Since the decision, the CDPP has adjourned or discontinued a large number of matters of this kind before the courts. The CDPP is also not commencing new procee­dings of this kind, pending the determination of the appeal before the High Court.


Since the 2000-01 financial year, the CDPP has prosecuted approximately 36,500 defendants for social security fraud. Without a detailed analysis of each case, it is not possible to state definitively how many matters of social security fraud have been committed via omission since the introduc­tion of the Criminal Code. However, the government's best estimate is that as many as 40 per cent of this number, or around 15,000 convictions, may now be open to question as a consequence of the decision in Poniat­owska. To ensure the past convictions cannot be called into question, this bill amends the administration act to insert a stand-alone obligation for a person to inform the department of events or changes of circum­stances that might affect the payment of a social security payment to the person or the person's qualification for a concession card.


This provision will operate both prospec­tively and retrospectively to 20 March 2000, the date that the administration act comm­enced.


Successive Australian governments have not lightly pursued retrospective legislation. However, in this case there are exceptional circumstances justifying retrospectivity, namely that it would not be appropriate for a significant number of prosecutions condu­cted from 2000 for social security fraud to be overturned on the basis of previously unidentified legal technicalities.


One of the criticisms that can be directed at retrospective legislation in relation to criminal offences is that people will be unaware that their conduct is an offence. In this case, however, the convicted persons would all have been aware that they should have informed the department of the specified events and changes of circumst­ances listed in the notices given to them by Centrelink in relation to their social security payment or concession card. The effect of the retrospective application of this provision is to confirm convictions already made.


As members would be aware, Centrelink has more than seven million customers. Its operations depend on the use of computer programs to generate decisions based on the requirements of the social security legis­lation.


Considerations in light of the Poniatowska decision have also raised some doubt that there is sufficient evidence to prove that, with respect to the period from 12 June 2001 to the present, decisions made by Centrelink under the social security law by the operation of computer programs have satisfied all legislative requirements.


To ensure that these decisions are not open to question, the bill provides that the requirements of subsection 6A(1) of the administration act are taken to have been complied with in relation to decisions made under the social security law by the operation of a computer program for the period 12 June 2001 to the date of royal assent.


Finally, the bill makes technical amend­ments to the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (Child Care and Other Measures) Act 2011 and to the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Rebate) Act 2011 to correct drafting oversights.


I conclude by noting that the bill has been designed such that there will be no practical impact on the ordinary course of Centrelink's business, or on a person's obligations to rep­ort changes in their circumstances to Centrelink.


Every person who receives a social security payment or a concession card is currently sent notices by Centrelink. These notices require that the person inform the department of events or changes of circum­stances which might affect the person's social security payment or qualification for a concession card. This will not change as a result of this bill.


The bill is necessary to protect the integrity of the social security system. It has been brought forward by the government, based on advice from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the Solicitor-General, to address technical issues that have been brought to light by recent litigation. It does so without disturbing the existing protections that the law guarantees for Centrelink clients.


Leave granted for second reading debate to continue immediately.

"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2011-07-06,"



Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (18:03):  Australia has a generous social welfare system. When people find themselves in necessitous circumstances whether by way of unemployment or disability, or some other affliction in their lives, then the commitment of the Australian people shared across the aisle of politics is that we provide them with welfare. That has been done for many decades in Australia and, by any internat­ional standards, the provision of that welfare in this country is most generous.


That welfare, of course, does not come out of nowhere. It comes from the taxes which are contributed by other Australians to ensuring the common good of all people in this country. I say that because there is a concomitant responsibility or duty on the part of people who are in receipt of welfare, and part of that duty is to be truthful and frank about their financial circumstances. If, for example, a person's financial circum­stances change and they are in receipt of more income than they were at the time that they received their welfare or they become the owner of some asset, they have the responsibility to inform the social security authorities through Centrelink of those changed circumstances so that a reassess­ment of their situation can be made consistent with providing welfare to them and consistent with the broader objective of meeting the common good of all Australians.


That is why the social security legislation contains provisions that require a person whose circumstances have changed finan­cially to notify the department or notify Centrelink about those changes. This is something which is commonly understood and known throughout the Australian population. Indeed, if a person was unaware of that and they are in receipt of welfare, they are regularly reminded of that comm­itment, that obligation, in letters that they receive in regard to their particular payment from the government.


This bill arises because of a difficulty, which has come to light, in relation to people who have defrauded the Commonwealth. Defrauding the Commonwealth might sound like the defrauding of some remote institution, but the reality is that defrauding the Commonwealth is defrauding all Austra­lians, because all Australians who are taxpayers make contributions to the funds which enable these payments of welfare to be made.


It was assumed, as the minister has pointed out, for quite a number of years after the implementation of the Criminal Code in this area that a prosecution brought pursuant to the Criminal Code met all the legal requirements. However, in a case in the South Australian jurisdiction that ultimately ended up in the full court of the Supreme Court of South Australia—the case of Poniatowska—it was decided in a majority decision that one of the elements was missing, namely, that the legislation did not define a duty by way of an omission, and therefore, on technical grounds, what were thought to be proper and appropriate and lawful prosecutions that had been brought over a number of years are in danger of being overturned. Indeed, if that was the last say on that case in those particular circumstances, the prosecution would have been overturned. The minister said that this is a matter currently before the High Court and we are waiting for the High Court to pass judgment.


It could be argued that the parliament should wait for the High Court to hand down its judgment. That is a principle which I think in most cases we would subscribe to, because until the High Court does hand down that judgment there is still some uncertainty or some final determination to be made by the judicial officers of this land. However, the danger in this case is that, if we do wait, there are potentially thousands of cases that could be overturned, and not only overturned by people seeking to quash those convictions but potentially compen­sation claims made against the Common­wealth.


The principle of retrospectivity, which has been mentioned in this debate, is an important one. Nobody in a legislative mode approaches retrospectivity lightly. As a general proposition, we do not wish to say that something which was regarded as lawful in the past is now unlawful and to go back to those past events. It is one thing to do it prospectively but it is another thing entirely to do it retrospectively. So it is appropriate that concerns about retrospectivity be raised in relation to this case. However, there is a difference here. We are not creating an offence anew. People have been charged with offences and they have been convicted of welfare fraud. Nobody will be affected or captured by this legislation who had not already been caught and penalised before. In fact, if the legislation does not pass and the High Court upholds the majority finding in the South Australian Supreme Court, the prospect is that many people who had been convicted of offences before may be able to seek to have those convictions quashed and be paid compensation.


I say this is different because it is quite clear on the face of the social security legislation that there is that obligation to inform Centrelink, the social security authorities, of a change of circumstances. Whilst one may argue about the technic­alities of the law, this is a case where we ought to go back to what the law is based on. The law is based on a moral or ethical principle which I was seeking to describe at the outset. Yes, we are generous in terms of welfare, but a person in receipt of welfare has to be honest and frank about their particular financial circumstances.


It would not be justice for society generally and the community, and it certainly would not be justice for the taxpayers whose taxes contribute to welfare payments, if a situation were to arise where, because of the technical interaction between the Criminal Code and the social security legislation, for what had been regarded properly as welfare fraud offences were overturned. Whatever one argues about the legal technicalities of this case—being a lawyer myself, one can always find a legal argument to advance, and I am not convinced that this is retrospectivity as we normally understand it—even if one does not agree with me, I think there is in this case a broader moral or ethical principle that this parliament should seek to uphold. It is for that reason we on this side of the chamber will not be opposing this legislation that the government has brought forward.


I will refer to some cases, because we are talking in many instances not about some mere trifle where somebody had overlooked the fact that they had mown the lawns a couple of times for neighbours and been paid $20, $30 or $50 for that but about very substantial fraud against the taxpayer, against the Commonwealth, in many cases. Let me just give the chamber some examples. These are drawn from the annual reports of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. One is that over a period of more than 10 years a person failed to notify Centrelink that they had worked and earned income while in receipt of Centrelink benefits. As a result, the person obtained social security payments to which they were not entitled of over $100,000. The person was charged pursuant to the Criminal Code, convicted and sentenced to imprisonment.


Another case was that of a person with power of attorney over a parent's financial affairs who failed to inform Centrelink of the parent's death and continued to receive the parent's fortnightly payments for around 10 years. The person defrauded the Common­wealth of over $80,000. Again, there was a prosecution, a conviction and a sentence of imprisonment.


The third case is one where, over two separate periods totalling eight years, a person claimed parenting payment (single) while living with a partner. The person neglected to inform Centrelink when the couple had reconciled and, in relation to a separate period, falsely claimed that the couple had separated. The person received over $80,000 in social security payments to which they were not entitled. In this case they were charged under the Criminal Code, convicted and released on condition that they be of good behaviour for a specified period.


I will give the House one more example. Over almost seven years, a person received over $70,000 in social security payments to which they were not entitled through failing to inform Centrelink of their earnings from full-time employment. The fraud was discovered as a result of a data-matching exercise between Centrelink and the Aust­ralian Taxation Office. Again, this person was prosecuted, convicted and sentenced to a period of imprisonment. I do not believe that any reasonable Australian would regard a circumstance where, because of what is largely a legal technicality, people who had been convicted in those circumstances would have the possibility opened up to them to quash those convictions and, more than that, possibly even claim compensation from the Commonwealth. To use a colloquial expres­sion, it fails the front pub test. It fails the common-sense test of ordinary Australians. That common-sense test is based on this notion that, yes, we are generous, but there is a concomitant duty or responsibility to those who are generous in relation to these payments. It is on the basis of that principle that we will not be opposing this legislation.

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (18:15):  I will speak very briefly on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2011. I do think this is a very important bill that should be passed by the House and I am pleased that there is support on both sides of the chamber. I am very proud to be an Australian because in Australia we do provide a safety net for those in need. This is something that is ingrained in our psyche as Australians. When people are doing it tough, they do get assistance. I think there is broad support in our community for those who need help to actually get that help. So I am proud that we have a safety net and a social security system in this country.


This bill reinforces that the social security system has integrity. The vast majority of Australians that go into their local Centrelink in times of trouble and times of need are very upfront and honest and deserve the support that they get, but there are instances, as the previous speaker pointed out, where this is not abided by. A very small minority go in and are not upfront and honest, despite knowing that they should be. This does unfortunately call into question the integrity of all those people receiving these social security payments. It is unfair that the actions of the few cast aspersions on the many who do that right thing. I believe these amendments are very important for the integrity of this system.


As the previous speakers have outlined, this bill arose as a result of a court case in South Australia. I believe the intentions of the Commonwealth and the requirements placed on social security recipients have been clear, but based on this technicality that clarity is being called into question. As a result, in many instances where fraud has been proven in a court of law people may get off those charges. That is a concern. It is also a concern that new charges of defrauding the Commonwealth are not necessarily proceed­ing as quickly as they could have because of the lack of clarity at the moment. It is important that we bring forward and pass this legislation, despite the fact that this matter is still going through the High Court. It is the duty of the parliament and the Common­wealth, being responsible for the social security system, to bring this legislation forward. So I am pleased that it has the support of the House.


I want to use this opportunity to talk about the hardworking people at Centrelink. The many people around the country administ­ering our social security system do a great job on the front line. In my electorate there is a great amount of work being done at the Noarlunga Centrelink office. It is sometimes a tough job. At times there are distressed people, upset people and people in real difficulty, but I believe that Centrelink staff right around this country do a great job. I would like to talk about Noarlunga in particular because I know the staff there do not just sit back and wait for people to come to them; they play a real outreach role in the community. In fact, I attended a special fair day for those suffering from mental illness where all the services got together to talk to the local community. Centrelink was there with the staff and the manager. The manager of a large Centrelink office was there on the front line talking to people, letting them know what they can access and what is available. We know that those who are most vulnerable often do not know what they can access. They can access different payments and services, and sometimes they do not know. Our Centrelink staff have been out there doing that.


There have been many other opportunities where Centrelink staff from Noarlunga have done outreach work. Whether it be youth or Indigenous people, they go into those comm­unities to talk to those people in need who may benefit from a number of services and payments. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Centrelink staff, specifically at Noarlunga but also right around the country, who work in this area. They also need to have confidence that, when they assess someone and they are getting information, they can be confident to act on that information. This legislation ensures that there is that mutual responsib­ility for people to acknowledge when their income changes—and as the previous speaker said, it can be by quite a lot. People know that their income changes. While it might be only a few people, it is important that this legislation is supported. We have an obligation to support it and pass it through the House now because the Australian people, while very generous in their nature and willing to help people in need, do not want to be defrauded. This legislation is really important to ensure that we can have confidence in the integrity of our social security system, that we continue to support those people in need and that those people who defraud the Commonwealth face the consequences of doing so. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (18:21):  The opposition support the government on this occasion, even though we appreciate that there is a significant element of retrospec­tivity in what is being introduced. We feel that it does not contravene any fundamental principles of fairness to do so and, on those grounds, we do support the bill. We also want to note that Australia has a long tradition, as previous speakers have noted, of a strong welfare safety net—but also a community expectation that the money has to come from somewhere. Therefore, we are one of the few countries that so effectively, and in such a targeted way, means-test our welfare payments. 


Many people do not realise that many of the social welfare economies of the rest of the OECD do not means-test in the way we do. In fact, they are far less progressive in that way. They allow people to take an age welfare payment commensurate with their earnings through their career, something that does not happen in Australia. We never want to forget that many hard-working Australians end up being means-tested out of further state support. Regardless of your view about that, we need to remember there is a significant working middle class that do not get the aged-care support that in identical circumstances in other countries they might well have. 


Over the last two decades, we have seen a shift in thinking from the belief that welfare is a fundamental right to the belief that it is, after all, a privilege—that it is first of all collected from other Australians and then paid as part of the privilege of being an Australian. We therefore have laws and expect everyone, from east coast to west coast and whatever their background, to adhere to those. You have to play by the rules. I think the Australian sense of fairness comes out no more strongly than in the idea that one should never abuse payments that one receives through our welfare system.


There are many dimensions to combating welfare fraud and I think every state wants to strike a balance between having strict eligibility tests that are easy enough to understand and that everyone can appreciate and feel are fair and having a robust prosecution policy for those who willingly and knowingly contravene the rules. The fact that there have been over 30,000 prosec­utions is, I think, a fair indication of the latter. Ordinary Australians out there would understand that being a dole cheat or a welfare cheat is not something that is acceptable any more, not something that you can laugh about or pat your mate on the back about. That change has come about, quite significantly, over the last two decades through the policies of successive adminis­trations. 


One does not want to have such an invasive and aggressive policy that it deters people from applying for Centrelink support or an approach that it is overly intrusive or punitive. There still needs to be an element of self-reporting and that needs to be encouraged, not dissuaded. What is very important about this amendment is, as the shadow minister has suggested, that there will be no new prosecutions as a result of this change. It just ensures that none of the old prosecutions are brought back for review through, potentially, the new light of a High Court decision.


In all of this, you are constantly weighing up the prima facie case of whether there is a need to overturn versus the public interest. I think most people here, together with most Australians, would admit that it is in the public interest to support the prosecutions which have occurred over the last two decades. The great risk of not standing up to it is that fraud then becomes more prevalent and Australians around the country lose their confidence that this is a welfare system that properly targets those who need it most. 


Social security recipients, certainly those in my electorate, understand the rules and will stand by them. But we feel that, if this legislation is not supported, a whole lot of new cases could potentially be opened. The last thing we want is those prosecutions being called into question. While there is not really any understanding of how many of those are potentially coming before the courts, it may only be a matter of days or weeks before that does occur. Were this bill not passed promptly and expeditiously, we could potentially be exposing Centrelink and the Commonwealth to an enormous burden in having to defend cases which, given how much time has passed and the level of detail in the records we hold, would be very difficult cases to defend. 


These sorts of changes are, I think, completely in line with what the average person would have thought were held in the first place. Although it now looks like you can basically drive a bus through a loophole, at the time it was extremely difficult for those Centrelink drafters of Commonwealth law to understand that what they were drafting could run contrary to an element of the Criminal Code. That is a very important reason for the changes. We also note that the Commonwealth has ceased prosecuting a whole range of cases that, most of us would argue, should be prosecuted and not delayed. That is another very good reason to continue the great work that Australia has done in avoiding Centrelink fraud—to ensure that that is not derailed. 


Finally, there are some changes which make it very clear that people currently making a claim for social security or access to a concession card, people currently receiving social security or who hold those concession privileges and people not currently receiving social security payments or holding a concession card but who have at one time been paid social security or received such concessions will also be subject to these new rules. I think it is completely reasonable that we should support these changes and I think it is very important that Centrelink fraud is never considered a legitimate activity in this country. That is the important reason both sides should be supporting these changes.

Close examination of the Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011 is essential and incredibly important. The government's own explanatory memorandum concedes that the bill contains new concepts and key features that have no equivalent in the current law. By Labor's tactical man­oeuvrings, the government's bill has been spared the kind of close assessment and analytical rigour a change of economic regulation of this kind warrants. The government has truncated the work of the appointed Standing Committee on Econ­omics, disrespecting those who made considered submissions and dishonouring this parliament. 


Despite being denied any opportunity to properly consider the government's bill or submissions on it, government members recommended that the bill pass unaltered. This was either a sense of a parliamentary committee made of up of clairvoyants able to foresee what they might have thought had they bothered to examine the evidence or a compliant committee where government members simply do what their government masters direct them to do. Thankfully, though, good sense has prevailed. Just as the Treasurer left his Labor colleagues on Standing Committee on Economics hanging with his own amendment to the bill, we had some constructive discussions regarding the consideration in detail amendments to the bill that have been circulated in my name. 


The amendments that the coalition brought forward showed an interest in and a responsiveness to the serious concerns raised by stakeholders, expert competition lawyers, leading academics and practitioners. I am pleased to say that I think we found a meeting of minds with the government on a number of those amendments. I understand the government will be bringing forward its own version of those amendments, which will address a number of the concerns that we have raised. Those concerns include the need for an ordinary course of business exception for conduct that may be captured by the per se prohibition, a number of specific provisions relating to nominating the process where other markets may be captured by this law and also some specific amendments relating to the financial services sector.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (18:33):  I rise to speak in support of the Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011. This is one of a number of bills that have come before the House recently to moderate the behaviour of Australia's banks—fine institutions that they are. However, one of the roles of government is to regulate and moderate our banks. This legislation says something about the Gillard government's commitment to ensure a better deal for Australian consumers and small businesses. Unfortunately, it might also reflect a general reluctance on the part of banks to always act in a competitive, consumer-friendly manner, without the gentle, moderating, guiding hand of the Gillard Labor government. 


Where the market fails, responsible government must apply the law to ensure strength in our banking sector and a fair go for all Australian consumers. The banks have done very well for themselves from Australian consumers and businesses. There is no doubt about that. Consequently, they have a responsibility to act in the interests of their customers. This is their social licence. Our big four have reported first half-yearly profits of $11.9 billion. The Commonwealth Bank posted a profit of $3.3 billion to December 2010; NAB, $2.67 billion; Westpac, a cool $3.16 billion; and ANZ's six-month profit was up a massive 38 per cent to $2.66 billion. Nice work if you can get it. 


I will describe the landscape in which these profits were delivered. This inform­ation is from the statistics and mapping section of the Parliamentary Library. I caution those opposite that I cannot guarantee that some of this information was not prepared by economists. I am pretty sure some of it would have been prepared by economists but I do not have their names to name them. Here are some of the key points. Looking at interest rates, we see the average home loan standard variable interest rate has remained steady for the past seven months at 7.8 per cent. Bankruptcies and business investments are always a good guide to what is actually going on in the money-making section of the community. In the March quarter 2011, total bankruptcies decreased by 17.4 per cent when compared to the same period last year. It is a bit constrained, a bit tight out there, but some of these key indicators suggest that the economy is holding firm. However, we obviously we need to do as much as we can to support it. This bill before the House will drive greater competition in the banking sector by empowering the ACCC to act against banks who signal their prices to competitors to undermine competition. I also note that the ANZ job ads were up and that unemployment was steady at 4.9 per cent. 


The ACCC has reported evidence of anti-competitive price signalling by the banks. We are not talking about collusion but behaviour where the banks communicate their pricing intentions to competitors. We have seen the announcements on the TV quite regularly. This is usually done via press release and media rounds. We are not talking about backroom boys type of behaviour, but nevertheless it has aspects of collusion because the banks indicate their pricing intentions to their competitors. For example, they may signal in advance what their response will be to a change in interest rates by the Reserve Bank. That is followed by what is almost a nod and a wink, with the understanding 'if you raise your mortgage rates we'll raise ours too'. Our banks, reliable as they are, have been able to get away with this behaviour because it is done with no formal price agreement and, like a three card trick, it is always done right before our eyes—as I said, through the media. Unfortunately, the losers from this behaviour are Australian consumers, who because of reduced competition face higher interest rates.


Under current laws there is nothing to stop banks behaving in this way—and I stress again that it is not illegal or unlawful; it is just the resulting squeeze on consumers that is wrong—and that is why the Gillard Labor government has acted. The bill before the House amends the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to prohibit, firstly, the private disclosure of pricing information between competitors outright, which is called the per se prohibition, and, secondly, the disclosure of pricing or other information if made for the purpose of substantially lessening competition. Initially this will apply only to the banking sector, but it could be extended to other areas of the economy after further review.


The per se prohibition bans private communications between banks about their prices. This amendment targets disclosures that are clearly anticompetitive and damag­ing to consumers. For example, if one bank gets on the phone to another bank to tell them privately about a planned mortgage interest rate rise, the ACCC can take action. As I said, this bill also empowers the ACCC to prosecute a bank for communicating its pricing intentions to substantially lessen competition. This means a bank cannot inform its competitors that it will follow them if they raise mortgage rates.


These tough new laws are accompanied by strong civil penalties of up to $10 million, 10 per cent of a business's annual turnover or three times the benefit of the conduct—whichever is the higher. These are very, very strong civil penalties, but we are talking about banks; we are not talking about the local bowls club. These are significant institutions with significant resources. The prohibitions are, however, subject to specific exclusions to ensure pro-competitive behav­iour is not restricted. These exemptions allow banks to comply fully with their disclosure and legal obligations.


There will also be occasions when banks need legitimately to discuss pricing with their competitors. This bill ensures that these business activities can continue through the joint venture exception, which captures act­ual and proposed joint ventures. Banks will also be able to obtain immunity from the prohibition from the ACCC.


It is important that we close this loophole in competition law. It brings Australian law into line with those of the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union. These laws strike the right balance by enabling banks to get on with their legitimate business while providing the necessary protections for consumers by eliminating anticompetitive price signalling. I commend the bill to the House.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2011-07-06,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (18:40):  I am pleased to speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011. On this side of the House we believe that this is a deeply flawed bill. We do not disagree that there is an issue which needs to be add­ressed, which is why the coalition brought forward our own bill, the Competition and Consumer (Price Signalling) Amendment Bill 2010. But we believe that the approach taken in the bill that the government has put before the House raises some very serious issues.


The stated purpose of the bill is to give powers to the ACCC to deal with the issue of price signalling, and it does this in both a public and a private context. In the private context it creates a so-called per se prohib­ition on the private disclosure of pricing information to competitors. 'Per se' means that the disclosure does not need to be for the purpose of substantially lessening compet­ition, nor does it need to have that effect. In both the private and the public contexts, the bill contains a general disclosure prohibition of the disclosure of pricing information. That is also, we will argue, a prohibition that raises significant policy issues.


The stated approach in this bill is to strike a balance. The explanatory note from Treasury states:


… it is recognised that any proposal to address anti-competitive price signalling and other information disclosures will need to carefully balance the potential anti-competitive impacts of particular information disclosures, with the benign and pro-competitive effects of other information disclosures.


On this side of the House we argue that this bill does not strike the right balance, and that argument is supported in the arguments made by many parties that made submissions in relation to this bill, including the Business Council of Australia and the Law Council of Australia. Unfortunately, the question of whether the balance has been properly struck is not the one which appears to be principally motivating the government in its approach to this piece of legislation. This legislation ultimately is being driven by political considerations and the desire of the Treasu­rer to be seen to be doing something. The result, unfortunately, is a piecemeal measure with, in its current form, many unintended consequences.


It is true, as has been noted, that some amendments are proposed, and to some extent that advances the position. But there remain many fundamentally troubling aspec­ts of this piece of legislation, and the basis upon which the legislation has been developed is also extremely troubling. The consultation process that was employed in arriving at the introduction of this bill was seriously flawed. A draft exposure bill, for example, was provided for comment on 12 December last year, with comments due by 14 January. It really is very far from good practice in consultation with industry to require very detailed consideration of wide-ranging reforms to be provided in the middle of the Christmas holiday period.


Let me make a number of specific points in the brief time available to me. The first point is that one of the central provisions of this bill, the so-called per se prohibition, is bad policy. I secondly want to argue that a measure which is specific to one sector—in this case, the banking sector—is also bad policy. I thirdly want to argue that to give the Treasurer the capacity to extend, by regulation, the measures contained in this bill to other sectors without needing to come back to the parliament is also bad policy. I fourthly want to highlight the poor policy consequences of the inconsistency between the regime set out in this bill and the well-established continuous disclosure rules which apply to listed companies, including of course the major banks which are listed.


Let me turn firstly, therefore, to the question of the per se prohibition to remind the House what this means. It means that if the specified conduct is found to have occurred then it becomes irrelevant as to whether there was any anticompetitive purpose in carrying out that conduct. Indeed it is also irrelevant whether there was any anticompetitive effect. In other words, if the conduct occurs then it matters not whether there was any intention, any purpose, to lessen competition. Nor does it matter whether there was actually the effect of lessening competition. There is simply a blanket prohibition on private disclosure of the relevant pricing information.


The arguments that can be made that circumstances in which one bank or executives of one bank meet privately with another to discuss pricing information and the arguments that can be made about the anticompetitive consequences of that are clearly forceful. But if you say, 'We do not really care whether the conduct actually has an anticompetitive effect. We do not really care whether there was an intention, a purpose, of reducing competition in meeting to have these private discussions,' then you are missing the whole point of what policy ought to do in the case of seeking to maintain and strengthen competition. Policy ought to focus on conduct which has an effect of reducing competition; policy also ought to focus on conduct which is intended to reduce competition—that is to say, which has the purpose of reducing competition—even if, for reasons that are beyond the capacity of those who have joined together to have the conversation, it does not result ultimately in the anticompetitive effect. But there is another even more fundamental point, which is this: there are often circumstances in which private disclosures can be procom­petitive, and there are certainly an extensive range of situations in which private disclosures can be necessary and desirable in the carrying on of business and are not harmful to competition. When you look at the provisions in the bill before the House, you will see that the scope of what is caught by this provision is very wide. It includes historic, aggregated and non-confidential data.


The submission from the Australian Bankers Association lists a range of situa­tions in which the bill will create great difficulties. They cite syndicated lending, which of necessity involves more than one bank. Typically in a syndicate there are many banks. They talk about loan switching, where a customer switches a loan from one bank to another, or a situation where two or more lenders are dealing with a financially distressed business—perhaps a business which has received loans from a syndicate and some time later it transpires that the business is in financial distress and the banks need to engage in consultations to work out how they are to deal with this business. The approach which the government has taken to this problem is to set out a specific range of exemptions in which the per se prohibition will not apply. But that is poor policy. It would be much more sensible not to start with a per se prohibition in the first place. It would be much more likely to produce a rational policy outcome.


Let me turn to the next point I want to make, which is that policy which is specific to one sector is bad policy. It is a very curious approach indeed to competition policy to say that certain conduct, if carried out by bankers, is anticompetitive; but, if carried out by airline executives or pharmac­eutical industry executives or telecomm­unications sector executives or agricultural industry executives, is not anticompetitive. Under the provisions contained in this bill conduct in one industry will attract potentially criminal penalties, whereas cond­uct of exactly the same kind carried out by executives in different industries, carried out by companies in different industries, will not attract a penalty. It is impossible to see the policy rationale for such inconsistent treat­ment. The Swanson, Hilmer and Dawson reviews all found that competition law prohibitions as a general principal ought to apply across the board.


Let me quote from the submission by the Law Council:


Any prohibition on price signalling should apply universally and not just to selected business sectors. Selective application of the proposed prohibitions and undermines the general application of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 across all industries on an equal basis.


It is interesting that the Australian Compet­ition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, also noted its scepticism of the approach of industry-specific competition prohibitions. The ACCC had the following to say:


… we would hope signalling laws would be of a general application rather than focusing on a particular sector, because we do not see that there is a reason for signalling out one sector as opposed to another.


Even Choice, the consumer advocacy group—they do very important work but are not known to be a friend of the big end of town—had this to say:


It is Choice's submission that legislation should be, to the extent possible, uniform in its approach to all industries across Australia.


So from first principles and in the submiss­ion of a wide range of parties the approach in this bill of establishing specific restrictions on price-signalling behaviour which apply only to the banking sector is extremely poor policy.


While it is poor policy to restrict this approach to one sector, another aspect of the bill which raises equally serious concerns is the fact that as a legal matter the bill emp­owers the Treasurer to extend this regulation to other sectors. This grants excessive disc­retion to the executive government. The perception, based upon what has been stated publicly by this government in seeking to justify the measures in this bill, is that this is a bill directed towards the banking sector. It is true that in its initial application it will apply only to the banking sector, but it also provides for other sectors to be specified by regulation and so the prohibitions in the bill will apply to them.


It is very hard to understand the policy rationale here. The preferred approach, as I have indicated, would be to have a legal regime in this area which applied uniformly. But if you are going to, as this government appears to be doing, introduce measures directed to one sector, it is then very hard to understand why you retain the flexibility, why you retain the discretion, to extend this to other sectors without coming back to the parliament. The imposition of the prohib­itions contained in this bill is a substantial policy matter and it is one which ought to be considered by the parliament rather than imposed by regulation.


The fourth point I wish to make in the brief time available to me is that there is a tension between the provisions contained in this bill and the obligations imposed upon the major banks which are listed to meet their continuous disclosure obligations under the ASX listing rules. It is one of the many aspects of this bill which does not appear to have been very well thought through, no doubt because the bill has been rushed through largely to achieve a set of political objectives.


This is a poor piece of legislation which is based upon bad policy, selective policy, and driven largely by political motives. We on this side of the House certainly think that very substantial amendment is needed before it can be supported.

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2011-07-06,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (14:38):  I rise to speak in support of the Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill (No. 1). This bill once again demonstrates the government's commitment to competition and consumer law reform and to ensuring that ordinary Australians experience the benefits of a strong economy. Those opposite attempt to decry the word 'competition' as a Labor word. I assert that in a genuinely competitive economy consumers benefit because of lower prices and the economy benefits as a whole because of the need for business to be more efficient. A truly competitive economy is a Labor ideal that benefits working families. It benefits working families bec­ause a competitive economy can provide goods and services that are of a lower cost and better quality. Whilst those opposite may argue that they are the party of small business and competition, it is the Labor Party and Labor governments that have successively and truly achieved central reform in this area.


The main issue addressed in this bill is the competition between banks and other financial institutions in home loan interest rates. The ideal of competition is that it lowers the ability of a business in a market where competition is ideal to increase or control prices. We have, sadly, been confronted with the issue that when the Reserve Bank increases its cash rate target the banks and other financial institutions increase their home loan interest rates beyond the Reserve Bank increase. This has occurred because banks are able to signal, before a potential increase in the cash rate targets, an intention to increase the home loan rate to a level beyond the cash rate. This lowers the fears of competitors that they might lose customers if they act in the same manner. The result of this signalling is a breakdown in the competitive forces in the provision of home loans and it negatively affects hardworking families for whom loan repayments can make up a really significant part of the family budget.


This bill will help address these issues by prohibiting banks from privately disclosing information on pricing policies to a competitor. Such disclosures are unfair and uncompetitive and result in home loan interest rates which are not reflective of the competitive ideal. This bill will prohibit outright a bank from disclosing privately to a competitor information regarding the market to which the price information relates. Additionally, this bill gives the ACCC vital powers to prosecute banks who communicate price intentions and other strategic informa­tion to a competitor for the purpose of substantially lessening competition.


I understand that regulation of the financial industry needs to be appropriate and cannot stifle the role of financial institutions in what is a healthy free market economy, but the regulations proposed in the bill are appropriate and needed because the banks need to be responsible when they are making their pricing decisions. The Aust­ralian banking sector remained stable during the global financial crisis. This was due to both good economic management by the Australian government and long-term good management of the banks. Despite this history of good management, the banks should not have the ability to engage in anticompetitive practices to the detriment of consumers. Indeed, our economy is greatly influenced by consumers who live in mortgage belt areas. The Central Coast and the seat of Robertson, which I am proud to represent in the parliament, display the typical characteristics of a mortgage belt area. The Central Coast is an outer suburban region which has had a fast-growing population over the last 30 years. The Gosford City local government area exper­ienced the 19th largest population growth in New South Wales.

I am pretty sure some of it would have been prepared by economists but I do not have their names to name them. Here are some of the key points. Looking at interest rates, we see the average home loan standard variable interest rate has remained steady for the past seven months at 7.8 per cent. Bankruptcies and business investments are always a good guide to what is actually going on in the money-making section of the community. In the March quarter 2011, total bankruptcies decreased by 17.4 per cent when compared to the same period last year. It is a bit constrained, a bit tight out there, but some of these key indicators suggest that the economy is holding firm. However, we obviously we need to do as much as we can to support it. This bill before the House will drive greater competition in the banking sector by empowering the ACCC to act against banks who signal their prices to competitors to undermine competition. I also note that the ANZ job ads were up and that unemployment was steady at 4.9 per cent. 


The ACCC has reported evidence of anti-competitive price signalling by the banks. We are not talking about collusion but behaviour where the banks communicate their pricing intentions to competitors. We have seen the announcements on the TV quite regularly. This is usually done via press release and media rounds. We are not talking about backroom boys type of behaviour, but nevertheless it has aspects of collusion because the banks indicate their pricing intentions to their competitors. For example, they may signal in advance what their response will be to a change in interest rates by the Reserve Bank. That is followed by what is almost a nod and a wink, with the understanding 'if you raise your mortgage rates we'll raise ours too'. Our banks, reliable as they are, have been able to get away with this behaviour because it is done with no formal price agreement and, like a three card trick, it is always done right before our eyes—as I said, through the media. Unfortunately, the losers from this behaviour are Australian consumers, who because of reduced competition face higher interest rates.


Under current laws there is nothing to stop banks behaving in this way—and I stress again that it is not illegal or unlawful; it is just the resulting squeeze on consumers that is wrong—and that is why the Gillard Labor government has acted. The bill before the House amends the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to prohibit, firstly, the private disclosure of pricing information between competitors outright, which is called the per se prohibition, and, secondly, the disclosure of pricing or other information if made for the purpose of substantially lessening competition. Initially this will apply only to the banking sector, but it could be extended to other areas of the economy after further review.


The per se prohibition bans private communications between banks about their prices. This amendment targets disclosures that are clearly anticompetitive and damag­ing to consumers. For example, if one bank gets on the phone to another bank to tell them privately about a planned mortgage interest rate rise, the ACCC can take action. As I said, this bill also empowers the ACCC to prosecute a bank for communicating its pricing intentions to substantially lessen competition. This means a bank cannot inform its competitors that it will follow them if they raise mortgage rates.


These tough new laws are accompanied by strong civil penalties of up to $10 million, 10 per cent of a business's annual turnover or three times the benefit of the conduct—whichever is the higher. These are very, very strong civil penalties, but we are talking about banks; we are not talking about the local bowls club. These are significant institutions with significant resources. The prohibitions are, however, subject to specific exclusions to ensure pro-competitive behav­iour is not restricted. These exemptions allow banks to comply fully with their disclosure and legal obligations.


There will also be occasions when banks need legitimately to discuss pricing with their competitors. This bill ensures that these business activities can continue through the joint venture exception, which captures act­ual and proposed joint ventures. Banks will also be able to obtain immunity from the prohibition from the ACCC.


It is important that we close this loophole in competition law. It brings Australian law into line with those of the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union. These laws strike the right balance by enabling banks to get on with their legitimate business while providing the necessary protections for consumers by eliminating anticompetitive price signalling. I commend the bill to the House.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2011-07-06,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (18:40):  I am pleased to speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2011. On this side of the House we believe that this is a deeply flawed bill. We do not disagree that there is an issue which needs to be add­ressed, which is why the coalition brought forward our own bill, the Competition and Consumer (Price Signalling) Amendment Bill 2010. But we believe that the approach taken in the bill that the government has put before the House raises some very serious issues.


The stated purpose of the bill is to give powers to the ACCC to deal with the issue of price signalling, and it does this in both a public and a private context. In the private context it creates a so-called per se prohib­ition on the private disclosure of pricing information to competitors. 'Per se' means that the disclosure does not need to be for the purpose of substantially lessening compet­ition, nor does it need to have that effect. In both the private and the public contexts, the bill contains a general disclosure prohibition of the disclosure of pricing information. That is also, we will argue, a prohibition that raises significant policy issues.


The stated approach in this bill is to strike a balance. The explanatory note from Treasury states:


… it is recognised that any proposal to address anti-competitive price signalling and other information disclosures will need to carefully balance the potential anti-competitive impacts of particular information disclosures, with the benign and pro-competitive effects of other information disclosures.


On this side of the House we argue that this bill does not strike the right balance, and that argument is supported in the arguments made by many parties that made submissions in relation to this bill, including the Business Council of Australia and the Law Council of Australia. Unfortunately, the question of whether the balance has been properly struck is not the one which appears to be principally motivating the government in its approach to this piece of legislation. This legislation ultimately is being driven by political considerations and the desire of the Treasu­rer to be seen to be doing something. The result, unfortunately, is a piecemeal measure with, in its current form, many unintended consequences.


It is true, as has been noted, that some amendments are proposed, and to some extent that advances the position. But there remain many fundamentally troubling aspec­ts of this piece of legislation, and the basis upon which the legislation has been developed is also extremely troubling. The consultation process that was employed in arriving at the introduction of this bill was seriously flawed. A draft exposure bill, for example, was provided for comment on 12 December last year, with comments due by 14 January. It really is very far from good practice in consultation with industry to require very detailed consideration of wide-ranging reforms to be provided in the middle of the Christmas holiday period.


Let me make a number of specific points in the brief time available to me. The first point is that one of the central provisions of this bill, the so-called per se prohibition, is bad policy. I secondly want to argue that a measure which is specific to one sector—in this case, the banking sector—is also bad policy. I thirdly want to argue that to give the Treasurer the capacity to extend, by regulation, the measures contained in this bill to other sectors without needing to come back to the parliament is also bad policy. I fourthly want to highlight the poor policy consequences of the inconsistency between the regime set out in this bill and the well-established continuous disclosure rules which apply to listed companies, including of course the major banks which are listed.


Let me turn firstly, therefore, to the question of the per se prohibition to remind the House what this means. It means that if the specified conduct is found to have occurred then it becomes irrelevant as to whether there was any anticompetitive purpose in carrying out that conduct. Indeed it is also irrelevant whether there was any anticompetitive effect. In other words, if the conduct occurs then it matters not whether there was any intention, any purpose, to lessen competition. Nor does it matter whether there was actually the effect of lessening competition. There is simply a blanket prohibition on private disclosure of the relevant pricing information.


The arguments that can be made that circumstances in which one bank or executives of one bank meet privately with another to discuss pricing information and the arguments that can be made about the anticompetitive consequences of that are clearly forceful. But if you say, 'We do not really care whether the conduct actually has an anticompetitive effect. We do not really care whether there was an intention, a purpose, of reducing competition in meeting to have these private discussions,' then you are missing the whole point of what policy ought to do in the case of seeking to maintain and strengthen competition. Policy ought to focus on conduct which has an effect of reducing competition; policy also ought to focus on conduct which is intended to reduce competition—that is to say, which has the purpose of reducing competition—even if, for reasons that are beyond the capacity of those who have joined together to have the conversation, it does not result ultimately in the anticompetitive effect. But there is another even more fundamental point, which is this: there are often circumstances in which private disclosures can be procom­petitive, and there are certainly an extensive range of situations in which private disclosures can be necessary and desirable in the carrying on of business and are not harmful to competition. When you look at the provisions in the bill before the House, you will see that the scope of what is caught by this provision is very wide. It includes historic, aggregated and non-confidential data.


The submission from the Australian Bankers Association lists a range of situa­tions in which the bill will create great difficulties. They cite syndicated lending, which of necessity involves more than one bank. Typically in a syndicate there are many banks. They talk about loan switching, where a customer switches a loan from one bank to another, or a situation where two or more lenders are dealing with a financially distressed business—perhaps a business which has received loans from a syndicate and some time later it transpires that the business is in financial distress and the banks need to engage in consultations to work out how they are to deal with this business. The approach which the government has taken to this problem is to set out a specific range of exemptions in which the per se prohibition will not apply. But that is poor policy. It would be much more sensible not to start with a per se prohibition in the first place. It would be much more likely to produce a rational policy outcome.


Let me turn to the next point I want to make, which is that policy which is specific to one sector is bad policy. It is a very curious approach indeed to competition policy to say that certain conduct, if carried out by bankers, is anticompetitive; but, if carried out by airline executives or pharmac­eutical industry executives or telecomm­unications sector executives or agricultural industry executives, is not anticompetitive. Under the provisions contained in this bill conduct in one industry will attract potentially criminal penalties, whereas cond­uct of exactly the same kind carried out by executives in different industries, carried out by companies in different industries, will not attract a penalty. It is impossible to see the policy rationale for such inconsistent treat­ment. The Swanson, Hilmer and Dawson reviews all found that competition law prohibitions as a general principal ought to apply across the board.


Let me quote from the submission by the Law Council:


Any prohibition on price signalling should apply universally and not just to selected business sectors. Selective application of the proposed prohibitions and undermines the general application of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 across all industries on an equal basis.


It is interesting that the Australian Compet­ition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, also noted its scepticism of the approach of industry-specific competition prohibitions. The ACCC had the following to say:


… we would hope signalling laws would be of a general application rather than focusing on a particular sector, because we do not see that there is a reason for signalling out one sector as opposed to another.


Even Choice, the consumer advocacy group—they do very important work but are not known to be a friend of the big end of town—had this to say:


It is Choice's submission that legislation should be, to the extent possible, uniform in its approach to all industries across Australia.


So from first principles and in the submiss­ion of a wide range of parties the approach in this bill of establishing specific restrictions on price-signalling behaviour which apply only to the banking sector is extremely poor policy.


While it is poor policy to restrict this approach to one sector, another aspect of the bill which raises equally serious concerns is the fact that as a legal matter the bill emp­owers the Treasurer to extend this regulation to other sectors. This grants excessive disc­retion to the executive government. The perception, based upon what has been stated publicly by this government in seeking to justify the measures in this bill, is that this is a bill directed towards the banking sector. It is true that in its initial application it will apply only to the banking sector, but it also provides for other sectors to be specified by regulation and so the prohibitions in the bill will apply to them.


It is very hard to understand the policy rationale here. The preferred approach, as I have indicated, would be to have a legal regime in this area which applied uniformly. But if you are going to, as this government appears to be doing, introduce measures directed to one sector, it is then very hard to understand why you retain the flexibility, why you retain the discretion, to extend this to other sectors without coming back to the parliament. The imposition of the prohib­itions contained in this bill is a substantial policy matter and it is one which ought to be considered by the parliament rather than imposed by regulation.


The fourth point I wish to make in the brief time available to me is that there is a tension between the provisions contained in this bill and the obligations imposed upon the major banks which are listed to meet their continuous disclosure obligations under the ASX listing rules. It is one of the many aspects of this bill which does not appear to have been very well thought through, no doubt because the bill has been rushed through largely to achieve a set of political objectives.


This is a poor piece of legislation which is based upon bad policy, selective policy, and driven largely by political motives. We on this side of the House certainly think that very substantial amendment is needed before it can be supported.

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2011-07-06,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (14:38):  I rise to speak in support of the Competition and Consumer Amendment Bill (No. 1). This bill once again demonstrates the government's commitment to competition and consumer law reform and to ensuring that ordinary Australians experience the benefits of a strong economy. Those opposite attempt to decry the word 'competition' as a Labor word. I assert that in a genuinely competitive economy consumers benefit because of lower prices and the economy benefits as a whole because of the need for business to be more efficient. A truly competitive economy is a Labor ideal that benefits working families. It benefits working families bec­ause a competitive economy can provide goods and services that are of a lower cost and better quality. Whilst those opposite may argue that they are the party of small business and competition, it is the Labor Party and Labor governments that have successively and truly achieved central reform in this area.


The main issue addressed in this bill is the competition between banks and other financial institutions in home loan interest rates. The ideal of competition is that it lowers the ability of a business in a market where competition is ideal to increase or control prices. We have, sadly, been confronted with the issue that when the Reserve Bank increases its cash rate target the banks and other financial institutions increase their home loan interest rates beyond the Reserve Bank increase. This has occurred because banks are able to signal, before a potential increase in the cash rate targets, an intention to increase the home loan rate to a level beyond the cash rate. This lowers the fears of competitors that they might lose customers if they act in the same manner. The result of this signalling is a breakdown in the competitive forces in the provision of home loans and it negatively affects hardworking families for whom loan repayments can make up a really significant part of the family budget.


This bill will help address these issues by prohibiting banks from privately disclosing information on pricing policies to a competitor. Such disclosures are unfair and uncompetitive and result in home loan interest rates which are not reflective of the competitive ideal. This bill will prohibit outright a bank from disclosing privately to a competitor information regarding the market to which the price information relates. Additionally, this bill gives the ACCC vital powers to prosecute banks who communicate price intentions and other strategic informa­tion to a competitor for the purpose of substantially lessening competition.


I understand that regulation of the financial industry needs to be appropriate and cannot stifle the role of financial institutions in what is a healthy free market economy, but the regulations proposed in the bill are appropriate and needed because the banks need to be responsible when they are making their pricing decisions. The Aust­ralian banking sector remained stable during the global financial crisis. This was due to both good economic management by the Australian government and long-term good management of the banks. Despite this history of good management, the banks should not have the ability to engage in anticompetitive practices to the detriment of consumers. Indeed, our economy is greatly influenced by consumers who live in mortgage belt areas. The Central Coast and the seat of Robertson, which I am proud to represent in the parliament, display the typical characteristics of a mortgage belt area. The Central Coast is an outer suburban region which has had a fast-growing population over the last 30 years. The Gosford City local government area exper­ienced the 19th largest population growth in New South Wales.

Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (19:00):  I rise this evening to speak on behalf of my constituents and the people of Australia in regard to the future direction of this country's foreign aid program. At a time of economic uncertainty, many Australian taxpayers understandably expect results and value for money. Australians are generous and have a long tradition of domestic and international giving.


Today I attended the presentation of the government's Independent review of aid effectiveness. I welcome the report and place on record my thanks for the dedicated work undertaken by the panel to produce this report. The 39 recommendations made by this report seek to do exactly what we in the coalition have always sought—that is, to increase transparency, scrutiny and effective­ness. In addition to the government's aid program we are fortunate, through the generosity of the people of this country, to have increased corporate social respon­sibility, volunteerism and cause related projects by NGOs which all give rise to substantial international giving.


The community's expectation is that their personal donations, corporate philanthropy, NGO fundraising and foreign aid money are spent on improving people's lives and we need to ensure that these goals are achieved. We also need to ensure that the effectiveness of our aid is maintained by increased scrutiny and transparency. The coalition not only believe in the delivery of a tougher, more accountable aid program but also have always believed that there should be greater emphasis on a cooperative approach, partic­ularly through working with other governments and other aid organisations, as well as with Australia's corporate sector.


Given the size and significance of our foreign aid program, the coalition will appoint a minister for international develop­ment assistance to work with the foreign affairs minister to oversee our aid budget and to have responsibility for AusAID and the delivery of aid. To maximise the benefits and assistance that we can provide, the coalition have always believed that Australia's corporate aid programs need to be well coordinated to mesh with our global focus and our country-specific programs. In addition to AusAID spending, greater coord­ination and tracking of international aid donations and philanthropy should be identified and coordinated.


The coalition's approach to international development assistance is to place a greater focus on harnessing the efforts of all contributors investing in the future of our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region. Internationally, Australia is recognised for its leading role in the region, particularly in PNG and near Pacific nations. Australia's aid is even more important given that two-thirds of the world's poor—some 800 million people—live in the Asia-Pacific region, yet receive less than one-third of global aid.


Our objective should be to support, encourage and work with our neighbours to invest in health and education, create employment, increase trade and investment, and pursue inclusive growth that benefits their populations. We believe a greater focus on basic education, particularly for girls, is the most effective form of long-term educational investment. Current rates of females being educated remain much lower than that of males, and addressing this is the first step in our commitment to the development of women leaders in our region. Improved educational opportunities for girls will also translate into improved economic and health outcomes.


It was a coalition government that established the Office of Development Effec­tiveness, which was designed to oversee the activities of our aid program. It is really disappointing to note that the last annual review published by the ODE was for the year 2009. Therefore, I wholeheartedly welcome recommendation 30, which would enhance the oversight undertaken by the ODE. I also support a whole-of-government approach to strengthening planning, mon­itoring and reporting. The establishment of the Development Effectiveness Steering Committee to achieve this is also very welcome.


Our focus should be on the Asia-Pacific region, but there is no question that we should continue to assist other areas of the world where the need arises. We recognise that foreign aid spending in other parts of the world is essential. We support the recommendations, and the major focus of the foreign aid budget should primarily be within our region and continue to grow there. The coalition welcome the report and its recommendations, particularly those that support our view, encourage greater transp­arency and describe steps and performance indicators that should be implemented to provide a further safeguard for Australia's aid program.

Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (09:30):  The late Bishop John Wilson, bishop, pastor, friend and father: I  want to recognise what he did when I asked him to write a preamble for a petition with regard to the Lord's Prayer, which we say every morning here in this parliament. His preamble draws the attention of the House to its practice. This is what he wrote about saying the Lord's Prayer at the beginning of each sitting of our parliamentary houses:


We therefore ask the House to take consideration of the following:


We the undersigned as citizens of Australia ask that the use of the LORD’S PRAYER BE RETAINED by Parliament as integral to good government and Australia’s national heritage.


The prayer acknowledges our shared and common humanity under a caring God, in a context of humility and respect;


It asks God to fulfil his just purposes for the earth;


It seeks from God the provision of our daily needs and requires by implication generosity on our part;


It confesses our need to be forgiven and to forgive; 


It recognises the lure of corruption and our entanglement with evil, from which we need to be delivered;


Finally, it places our lives and actions in an eternal perspective.


Even for those who do not pray to God, the recitation of these words at the beginning of the Parliamentary day allows a few moments for quiet reflection on our shared humanity, our daily dependence on the good things of the earth, our need to forgive and be forgiven, the temptations of office, and the broader perspective against which our efforts must be judged.


Such a time is not wasted.


This was very important at the time because I believed that there was a threat in this parliament, and I believe there could be a threat today, to the recognition and moment of the Lord's Prayer. There are those who would like it removed from this House or both houses. That is not something we agree with and it is why many thousands of people signed this petition during the last parliament to cement this act of faith and quietness and, as John Wilson said, for those who do not pray, this time of reflection. It is something we can give back to the nation and ourselves, and I hope and pray that this parliament, the House and the Senate, will continue with the practice of using the Lord's Prayer every day that we come together to meet.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",Ind.,2011-07-06,"



Mr SLIPPER
 (Fisher—Deputy Speaker) (10:00):  It is always reassuring when those of us in this parliament are able to look at legislation and realise that we are at one in seeking to achieve better outcomes for all sections of the Australian community, including Indigenous Australians. While there has been some criticism by the opposition of elements of the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill, all members believe it is absolutely vital that Indigenous Australians be given the same educational opportunities as other Australians and when we do see areas of disadvantage we as a parliament have a responsibility to provide the resources, to give a helping hand, to Indigenous Australians to make sure that they are able to achieve in the same way as other Australians are. To fail to do so would not be equitable; it would not be an appropriate action by a First World country in 2011.


The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011 is supported by both sides of the House. It relates to programs which were instituted by the former Howard government—the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program, which aims to help young Indigenous people move away from home to gain the skills they need to get a job in their community or elsewhere, and the Sporting Chance Program, which is an Australian government initiative which started operating in schools in 2007. Its aim is to encourage positive educational outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students.


These are good initiatives; they are initiatives that have worked. There is broad acceptance in the community that they are desirable and that they should continue. However, the situation is that, while this bill enables these programs to have additional funding and to continue, it regrettably does not give permanence to them. The government says that the programs are under review, and I suspect that most people would agree that this is a government by review. There are excessive reviews by this government. By all means review those matters which need to be reviewed but, when there is bipartisan agreement on the very successful nature of the programs mentioned in the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill, why investigate something that everyone agrees is going well?


It is regrettable that the one-year extension of funding for the second year in a row does not give certainty, does not give confidence, to Indigenous Australians, although it does give a measure of reassurance that at least for the time being these important programs will continue to be funded. I suspect that, while a review is underway, ultimately the government will support the ongoing nature of these programs, but since there seems to be a community consensus and certainly a consensus in the parliament, and the results are clear on the board, about these programs they ought not continue to be 'reviewed'; they ought to be the subject of a statement by the minister saying these are good programs, these are programs which will be funded indefinitely into the future. Frankly, as a nation we do not have a lot to be proud of in the area of Indigenous affairs. As I was saying yesterday, we sought to throw money at the problem; we tried to salve the nation's collective conscience by throwing money at the problem without focusing on necessary outcomes.


Like other honourable members I was enormously proud when the member for Hasluck was elected. He is the first member of the House of Representatives to identify as Indigenous. I was really impressed when the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs crossed the chamber and congratulated the member for Hasluck, who is a role model for all Indigenous Australians. The member for Hasluck—and I do not really like to talk about someone else's philosophy—sees education as being the way forward and the way to address disadvantage. When one sees the success that the member for Hasluck has been in his life, starting from a position of relative disadvantage, it is very clear that education is extraordinarily important.


That is why the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011, which continues funding, at least for the time being, for these programs, is a very important bill. It is a bill that I commend and support, but I ask the government to cease reviewing these programs and give them a tick of permanence. They deserve it, they have got outcomes and they are achieving what they seek to achieve. The result is that young Indigenous Australians have a better chance of taking their place as people who are able to be successful Australians in every sphere of endeavour. So this is a good bill and these are good programs with which good outcomes are being achieved. I think, though, that the community and the parliament need reassurance from the government that these programs are going to be permanently funded and permanently supported, because they are doing such a wonderful job for those Australians who for too long have been disadvantaged. I commend the bill to the House.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2011-07-06,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (10:07):  Highly respected Aboriginal woman Yvonne Butler said:


Education is the greatest single weapon to overcome disadvantage and the impact of this denial of education affects me and other Indigenous people to this day. Education is the base upon which society relies, passing on our knowledge and teachings from one generation to the next.


Why should one group in society miss out on the wonders of education just because this government cannot commit to a decision of extending its financial aid?


The purpose of the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011 is to amend funding under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to include an additional calendar year, 2013, so that the facilities providing educational assistance can make a long-term commitment to bettering future generations of our Aboriginal population. The bill provides for the appropriation of $133.5 million for non-Abstudy payments over 2013. This funding amount also includes adjustments to appropriations made as a result of previous decisions of government, including in relation to the new federal financial arrangements framework. In accordance with the government's policy, the legislated figure will be adjusted for price movements. The bill also provides $25.5 million for Abstudy away-from-base payments. The total appropriation for both components is $159 million in 2013. The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 provides a legislative basis and appropriate funding for a variety of Aboriginal education programs for the tertiary sector.


Sporting Chance and the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program are two initiatives of the previous coalition government that have been continued by the current Labor/Greens/Independents government. Both programs have achieved considerable success in retaining students in school as well as increasing their participation and success rates. However, this Labor government has not committed to long-term funding for these two initiatives. Instead, it has simply provided a 12-month extension in the past two budgets. The extension has been described as being necessary to allow for the completion and release of the Review of Funding for Schooling report, which is due some time in 2011. But by the government's own admission the review is focused on the mainstream. There may—only 'may'—be some implications for the design and operation of programs run by the IETA Act.


The Australian government, along with all state and territory governments, endorses and promotes the 21 common and agreed national goals of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy. Labor is paralysed by endless reviews. It has described this year as the year of delivery and decision. I say it is the year of more debt and more delay. At least the Prime Minister got the Ds right. A one-year extension of funding for the second year in a row by the Gillard Labor government limits the funding and therefore holds hostage future planning for more successful programs and long-term funding prospects. It seems this uncommitted government is trying to drive a wedge in good programs which re-engage Aboriginal students with learning and bettering their future.


The original initiative was a great initiative, introduced by the coalition government in 2000. The act allowed the minister to make an agreement with education providers, or other persons or bodies, authorising payments during the 2001 to 2009 calendar years. There is enormous frustration that this Gillard-Rudd government is simply without ideas. We have had 4½ years of Labor rolling off figures about Aboriginal disadvantage; however, even when the solution is handed to it from the previous coalition government, it still does not seem fit to implement it. It may want to set a 'closing the gap' figure for 2020, long after this government is gone and hopefully some of its mess is cleaned up; however, it will be unable to account for its lack of action. That will lie in the hands of future generations.


Following from this, if there is not proper funding for the education of Aborigines then we may not see a future generation. This government is quite happy to apologise for the actions of others generations ago, but it seems it is unable to face up to its own inaction and apologise for it. There are many opportunities for Aboriginal youth to do better and to involve themselves in the community, and with help from government a re-engagement with learning can be instilled into these children. But, if this government will not commit to ensuring long-term education funding, how can the children commit to their own education? This government is not really showing a good example. Given opportunity, Aboriginal children are just as capable as any other children of succeeding in our community.


In the Riverina there are just so many sporting opportunities, and we should be doing everything we can to involve Indigenous youths in one of their passions: sport. It is a passion that they are so very good at. Too often Aboriginal youths are overrepresented among those displaying antisocial behaviour. That seems to occur across Australia and it certainly occurs in the Riverina. It is because in some cases they do not get the proper parental direction, or because they have nothing meaningful to do with their lives because there is not the opportunity that should be encouraged more and more by government, or because, in some instances, they just do not know how to be involved in the wider community.


There are avenues other than sport, and one that comes to mind is participation in the Australian Defence Force Cadets. Those young Aboriginal men and women who do join cadet units have the time of their lives. I encourage Indigenous youth to participate. We have seen over many, many years—over decades—how Aboriginal men and women have engaged in our defence forces and been remarkable participants in keeping our nation safe so that today we may live in peace and in a democracy. In Wagga Wagga we have an Army cadet unit, and cadets of all races and ethnicities have risen to the highest ranks of this service. It is a mark of just what can be achieved. I never fail to be impressed with the young men and women in the cadet forces. They are future leaders of our country, and by continuing the funding at great length we can and will encourage Aboriginal Australians.


There is no denying the commitment both sides of the chamber have to Indigenous programs. The Gillard-Rudd Labor government has made a lot of promises under its Closing the Gap initiative; however, we and they, the Aboriginal population, need more than just words. Aboriginal Australians are counting on the Prime Minister to deliver real action and real results in education, housing, health care and, of course, sporting opportunities. Unfortunately this government has proven too many times to be nothing but talk.


The bill today provides more funding for a successful coalition government program. This is highly commendable and I thank the government for supporting the coalition initiative that has been developed over so many years. The previous coalition government was committed to Indigenous programs and in the 2007-08 budget $4 billion was put aside for Aboriginal programs and services. There was a 67 per cent real increase on the amount that had been spent by the Keating Labor government in 1995-96. The coalition government was particularly committed to Indigenous education through initiatives such as the Clontarf Foundation. From 1998 to 2005, the participation of Aboriginal students in year 12 increased from 32 per cent to 40 per cent. Participation in year 11 increased from 52 per cent to 62 per cent. But we can always do better and we must do better. Education is one of the many ways to the future for Aboriginal Australians.


These are just some of the outcomes of some of the projects carried out by the previous coalition government. The Labor-Green-Independents government has professed the same commitment but we have yet to see any real positive action. There is a long way to go in Indigenous education. On such an important issue, the government needs to do more than just expand coalition initiatives. However, it seems that this government just wants to take the easy option and that is costing Aboriginal students the right to a better life.


In recent times, this has been evident with the suspension of the live cattle trade in the north. The largest population per capita of Aboriginal Australians is in Northern Queensland, the Northern Territory and Northern Western Australia, the predominant areas for live export. Many Aboriginal men and women have worked long and hard to gain experience in managing all aspects of the live cattle trade industry. Jobs have not just been lost in droving the herds onto boats. There are also bookkeepers, jackaroos and jillaroos, farm managers and drovers. And many of those workers are Aboriginal people, who through the benefits provided by the coalition government, have re-engaged with the need for better education and worked their way into good jobs—only to have them suspended in another misled decision by this government. And what is the government's solution to this suspension? They have banned the live cattle trade. They have sent all of these Aboriginal workers to Centrelink for compensation—the very place that many like to avoid.


More programs such as the Aboriginal Environmental Education Centre in Brungle in New South Wales in the Riverina in my electorate need to be operated. This is an area in my electorate where education on Aboriginal tradition is threaded into the curriculum. Brungle Public School, which is close to Gundagai and Tumut, has developed programs and the grounds to provide a better understanding of Aboriginal culture. I commend them for the work that they are doing. Students will experience traditional greetings and meet Aboriginal elders in the dreaming room. They will also learn traditional skills, history, Dreamtime legends, implement making and the Wiradjuri language. They will learn about scar trees, bush tucker and plant and animal usage. Aboriginal activist and lawyer Noel Pearson once said that there is no self-esteem and self-worth without capability and there is no road to capability without education.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2011-07-06,"



Dr STONE
 (Murray) (10:17):  I too rise to speak to the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011, which amends the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 by extending the existing funding arrangements, including indexation, for the 2013 calendar year. The bill extends funding totalling $133.5 million for non-Abstudy payments, including a number of Indigenous school programs. It will align the payment period under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act with other funding for school education legislation and agreements. We are supporting this bill because these were originally coalition initiatives.


What concerns us, though, as the previous speaker said, is that this is a recognition that we are not doing well enough in terms of outcomes for Indigenous students. Today there has been a lot of media focus on the fact that Australian children do well comparatively internationally in terms of life chances, with the exception in particular of Indigenous children. There is a growing gap, in fact, between the life chances and outcomes for Indigenous children—including both remote and metropolitan Indigenous children—compared to those for non-Indigenous young people in the Australian society. Quite obviously, that cannot be tolerated in a country like ours.


I have to say that I am very disappointed that, while this government has paid a lot of lip-service to our intervention program, which we introduced just before they were elected nearly five years ago, and to closing the gap as a policy package and an ideal, we are not seeing any major indicators of improvement. For example, with Indigenous adolescent incarceration, the rates of incarceration both for young men and women—teenage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders—are increasing at a dramatic rate. The recidivism rates are increasing dramatically. These are wasted lives—lost lives—with young people spending much of their lives behind barbed wire. On the health of young Indigenous Australians: while morbidity rates are declining, we still have diseases you would expect to more commonly find in Third World countries. The levels of deafness and eyesight damage are just intolerable. In mainstream Australian society, a condition like otitis media, for example, is absolutely preventable or able to be cured in a way that does not leave permanent damage. But it too often leads to deafness in Aboriginal children before they reach their second birthday. There are implications of loss of hearing in terms of education, lifelong opportunities and even being able to participate in your home community. All of your chances are fewer if you have deafness and there is very little opportunity to get aids or even to learn signing to deal with it. This just should not be the case in Australia.


Then there is the business of car injury. Transport related injury is a leading cause of death and serious disability among both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, but it is often overlooked that Indigenous infants, children and adults are all much more likely to have a fatal transport related injury than their non-Indigenous peers. Compared to people in non-Indigenous Australia, Indigenous people who die from this sort of injury have more often been a vehicle passenger or a pedestrian. The risk factors are environment related, vehicle related and behaviour related and are different to those for the rest of the population.


Indigenous people have generally not experienced the reduction in road fatalities that the rest of the Australian population have experienced through effective road safety interventions like wearing seat belts or reducing road speed. Indigenous people are two to three times as likely as non-Indigenous Australians to have a transport related fatal injury and 30 per cent more likely to have a transport related serious injury. Seventy-five per cent of these injuries or deaths are in regional and remote areas. But even in urban locations Indigenous people have a two to three times higher rate of transport related fatal injuries. In some areas, the death rate may be 17 times greater than it is for the general population. This death rate occurs for all ages, including infants and children less than four years old, and there is a peak among 18- to 25-year-olds. The rate of 18 to 25-year-olds having accidents is a serious problem for non-Indigenous Australians too, but in the Indigenous community we have these young children and babies being killed as well. There are more likely to be single vehicle rollovers, and Indigenous people are 10 times more likely than non-Indigenous people to die as a pedestrian—35 per cent versus 13 per cent of all transport related fatalities respectively.


This seems an extraordinary set of data. Why are Australian Indigenous people more likely than non-Indigenous Australians to die in cars—as drivers or passengers—or as pedestrians? The answers are not very hard to find. The conditions of outback roads are very bad. Often there is less maintenance available for vehicles. Often these vehicles are poorly maintained, damaged and unroadworthy. Most cars in remote communities develop mechanical problems within six months and last less than 2½ years.


We need to look very closely at this whole business of deaths in vehicle related accidents. With this bill targeting Indigenous education assistance, we are talking about more students having opportunities to be mobile, to move away to other places and to be involved in sports related programs. Some of those programs are very excellent indeed but, unless we also go to the nub of the problems associated with young people being killed in car accidents, we are not paying attention to the whole problem, with its complexities and its cultural differences.


One of the clear problems for Indigenous young Australians in remote communities is that they do not tend to speak English. They cannot get drivers licences. The nonsensical requirements now applying in most states and territories stipulating how many hours of pre-licence driving you do with a mentor or a parent in the vehicle just cannot apply in outback Australia. In Queensland you are supposed to have some 100 hours of pre-licence driving experience, but some islands in the Torres Strait, for example, might only have a couple of kilometres, if you are lucky, of main road. So how can a young Indigenous person from a Torres Strait island abide by the law and get their drivers licence lawfully with proper experience of driving during the day and night and in all sorts of conditions? They simply cannot. So they are set up to fail in terms of their own safety behind the wheel and also in terms of being law-abiding when it comes to being stopped by police and asked for their drivers licence. These young Indigenous people do not learn English because they are not at school long enough, because their attendance is poor or because the teaching of English at their school is inadequate. There is no special provision for that situation when it comes to these young people being given special driver education. Perhaps there should be a special drivers licence for people from remote areas. That would acknowledge the special problems associated with pre-licence driving experience by providing them with assistance from someone who has a licence.


We often ignore the impacts of the remote geography of our country. I have been quoting these statistics from Monash University and the Foundation for Surgery, which have been doing a lot of work researching injuries and health outcomes of young Australians, particularly Indigenous young Australians. They have come up with some suggestions on what to do to prevent Indigenous mortalities from road trauma. They suggest that there should be more school based education and post-licence education. They say there should be educational and social marketing—in other words, fear messages—in relation to these problems on the road.


The trouble is that it is not just post-licence education; we are talking about pre-licence education. The Foundation for Surgery, Monash University and also the National Trauma Research Institute say we have dealt with these problems for non-Indigenous populations through street lighting, red-light cameras, the promotion of seatbelt use, random breath tests, mass media campaigns on safe driving and speed limit enforcement through speed detection devices. Clearly none of those measures makes much sense for Indigenous populations when we are talking about dirt roads out the back of Uluru or Halls Creek or Kununurra in Western Australia, so we need different approaches.


The coalition supports any measures that will assist Indigenous Australians to have a better life and to have the same opportunities as other Australians. Extending the funding for these programs is important but, I am sad to say, this is just a very small measure in terms of the huge task that confronts us. We have a lot of evidence that we are not doing any better in terms of how our Indigenous young Australians are experiencing life in our great country. I began by saying they are more likely to be locked up, homeless, have mental health problems, have alcohol and drug dependency problems, be assaulted and experience violence. They are more likely to be killed or seriously injured as a result of road trauma. The carers of those road trauma victims are more likely to have their own lives disadvantaged by the fact that they are caring for someone who is physically or brain injured—those with brain injuries may be damaged for life—and they are trying to deal with those things in a remote community.


Along with my coalition colleagues I support this bill, but we have to look much harder at the situation in Australia for Indigenous people. We cannot go on having Indigenous Australians being out of sight and out of mind because of where they live. We need an integrated approach to what we do with the states and territories and non-government agencies. We need to collect a lot more data and monitor the outcomes of a program if it appears to be successful, because too often we do not properly monitor outcomes. The program has short-term funding. The staff who are working with that program become disenchanted when they are on a six-month or 12-month program lifecycle. And, if it succeeds, then maybe in five or 20 years time there will be another program echoing almost exactly the parameters of the first—reinventing the wheel. Meanwhile, Indigenous communities become despairing of a churn of people coming to assist them. They have no sense that there is any continuity of care or understanding of their issues and problems. And we go on having children in Australia who are more likely to be blind through, for example, the instance of cataract conditions; more likely to be deaf; more likely to have brain damage due to foetal alcohol syndrome; more likely to be incarcerated and more likely to suffer death and injury through road trauma—all in all, in every way not able to fully enjoy the opportunities of this great country of ours.

"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2011-07-06,"




Mr HAASE
 (Durack) (10:30):  I rise today to address the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011. This proposed legislation amends the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000, the IETA Act, by extending the existing funding arrangements, including indexation arrangements, for the 2013 calendar year.


The Sporting Chance Program and Indigenous Youth Mobility Program, IYMP, are Howard government initiatives. Both programs have achieved success in retaining students in school as well as increasing their participation and success rates. The Sporting Chance Program was originally announced in the 2006-07 budget, with the objective of using sport and recreation as a tool to not only increase the level of educational participation of Indigenous students but also improve their final learning outcome. The Indigenous Youth Mobility Program allows Indigenous youth aged between 16 and 24 to relocate from remote communities to gain qualifications to increase their chance of getting a good job. Indigenous youth from cities and regional towns are also eligible for the program if they relocate to another IYMP host location to gain qualifications or to take up an apprenticeship.


I fully support this bill as I have seen firsthand what the Sporting Chance Program is achieving in Durack. Since opening its first academy for 25 boys on the campus of the Clontarf Aboriginal College in Perth, Western Australia, in 2000, the foundation has grown rapidly and has been consistently successful. They now cater for over 2,500 boys in 45 schools across Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Victoria.


Using the passion that Aboriginal boys have for football allows Clontarf to attract the boys to school. But it is not just a sporting program; rather, the Clontarf Foundation exists to improve the education, discipline, self-esteem, life skills and employment prospects of young Aboriginal men and, by doing so, equip them to participate more meaningfully in society.


The Clontarf Foundation has nine academies in Durack, with 658 students in total. The achievements of the Clontarf Foundation are remarkable. With school attendance rates of 80 per cent, year-to-year retention of not less than 90 per cent and 75 per cent of graduates gaining full-time employment within one year of leaving school, something is right. Wouldn't it be great if, rather than needing to use the passion for football to educate our Indigenous people, we could instigate a passion for education at an early age. Indigenous teenage males have a life expectancy of 17 years less than non-Indigenous teenage males and are 28 times more likely to be imprisoned. They have a truancy rate of about 45 per cent and are more likely to leave school prematurely, some as young as nine.


I, along with the rest of Australia, would like to, in the not too distant future, view these statistics simply as a relic of the history of Indigenous education. I want the Indigenous people of Australia to be able to stand proud and say, 'That was what it used to be like,' when they get up on the podium of success and reflect on how much they have achieved.


The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan 2010-14, released in early June this year, tells us:


Attending school and engaging with learning is fundamentally important in helping young Australians to acquire the skills they need for life. Successful learning cannot be built on irregular attendance. There is evidence to suggest that the more regularly students attend school the greater their success in learning.


Whacko; this is mind-boggling stuff—a 49-page report, at a huge cost, to tell us what we already know: if you do not go to school you cannot hope to learn! Amazing! Whoever would have thought that would be the case! The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan 2010-14 is without doubt well intentioned; however, I do wonder, given this Labor government's love of rhetoric and lack of discipline in following through, whether any of the report's goals will ever be achieved.


In fact, we have seen several cases of where even the reporting of this government's many and varied inquiries, committees and commissions cannot be achieved due to the lack of data. Recently the Council of Australian Governments Reform Council confessed on behalf of the Gillard government that they do not know if people with disabilities are getting improved services under the National Disability Agreement. The COAG Reform Council's 2009-10 performance report into the National Disability Agreement said:


In this second year report, the council finds that out-of-date data for some indicators, the lack of any data for a number of further indicators, and the absence of agreed measures for others, make it difficult to determine whether progress has been made toward meeting COAG’s overall objective.


This is consistent with the National Affordable Housing Agreement performance report 2009-10, where the COAG Reform Council could not provide a progress report on four partnerships that make up the agreement—again, due to lack of data. Page 39 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan 2010-14 states:


Data improvements may also lead to the development of more refined measures and reporting of performance against the closing the gaps targets. For example, there is currently no agreed trajectory associated with the target to ensure Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in remote communities have the opportunity to access to an early learning program in the year before school. The COAG Reform Council has recommended that data development in this area be given high priority. However, as an indication of work in this area, Figure 1 presents an Australian Government estimate based on Commonwealth funding for Universal Access to early childhood education. Once this data is refined to report on children from remote areas, reporting to Ministers will also be updated.


There we go—an admission of the inability to reach targets due to the lack of data, before the pursuit even begins.


The recent COAG Reform Council data released recently—data which I am sure the Labor government would prefer had not been released—proves that the great Closing the Gap idea is not working. In fact, the gap has widened between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students in year 9. The report, based on the NAPLAN data, shows that less than two-thirds of Indigenous year 9 students can read at the national average standard. This, so early on in the plan to halve the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students before 2018, is very troubling news. In what appears to be a distortion of the NAPLAN data, some believe assessments are actually being skewed to what is being taught rather than what children know.


The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan 2010-14 report is full of outcomes, targets, performance indicators, national collaborative action, systemic level action and local level action. But I note the report has not once mentioned the two words that are needed when dealing with Indigenous education: tough love. Instead, we have a report tarted up with socially and academically acceptable words so as not to offend anyone. Well, I think it is time that we offended people. I think it is time we set it straight and stopped pussyfooting around. For far too long Indigenous communities have existed rather than thrived, due to welfare handouts. We cannot educate the young before educating the educator.


In mainstream society, school attendance and education are accepted as the norm. That is not the case in Indigenous communities. The necessity of sending children to school needs to be embraced by the entire Indigenous population. An entrenched welfare philosophy exists within our Indigenous communities. Our passive love has not worked and will not ever work. We need more rigour. We need to impose welfare recipient restrictions in line with school attendance. We need to make full welfare payments dependent upon full school attendance.


The biggest issue in Indigenous education is, without doubt, attendance. It is all very well to spruik enrolment figures, but these figures are generally much higher than the true attendance rate and skew the picture completely. Exceptional headmasters and teachers and strong parental involvement can break the pattern, but school attendance in Aboriginal communities generally is far below that of the rest of the community. There is a culture of non-attendance because of funerals, extended absence for numerous reasons, overcrowding, housing, revolting abuse, sleep deprivation, lack of motivation through lack of purpose, lack of role models, no appreciation of need and no parental insistence.


The longer we keep handing out welfare with no expectation in return, the longer we will have a society within a society. First and foremost, we are all Australians; we are not Indigenous or non-Indigenous. We must stop the inequality of expectation between black and white. We need to change our mindset. We need to expect the same of all children, regardless of their colour or cultural background. By lowering our expectations for one sector of society, we do not allow them choices in life that other sectors take for granted—choices such as education, employment, success and, above all, hope. We can keep throwing money at communities with no real expectation of anyone improving their lives—it has worked for decades. Sure, we all feel better—out of sight, out of mind. We have done our bit, given money, eased our conscience, got to sleep nights and moved on—moved on until a hungry young reporter or a seasoned photographer pricks our conscience with a story about the trouble in our Indigenous communities.


Let us be honest with ourselves: it is just not working. Because the do-gooders of this country have brought a race to its knees, it is time to show tough love in order to restore dignity to our Indigenous people. All people need to have an education. As was pointed out in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan 2010-2014, there is evidence to suggest that the more regularly students attend school, the greater their success in learning.


The actions and initiatives of this Labor government are not working in any area, but especially not in Indigenous matters. Prior to the 2007 federal election, Labor promised it would contribute funds towards the construction and operation of three new boarding colleges for Indigenous secondary school students in years 8 to 12 in the Northern Territory. In 2008-09 the federal budget provided $28.9 million over four years towards this project—$18.8 million was to be spent in 2008-09 and $5.1 million, $2.5 million and $2.5 million over the following three financial years to 2011-12—with the Indigenous Land Corporation to contribute a further $15 million towards construction costs. So far, construction has begun on one site, and that has progressed to formwork only. Nearly three years after the specific commitment made by Mr Rudd, only one of the promised 38 Indigenous children and family centres will have been opened by 30 June this year. The Indigenous children and family centres, part of the Indigenous early childhood development national partnership, are designed to provide quality early childhood services to Aboriginal children and their families.


I am a member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, which recently tabled Doing time—time for doing, the report of its inquiry into the high level of involvement of Indigenous juveniles and young adults in the criminal justice system. The inquiry showed that not only are Indigenous youth 28 times more likely to be incarcerated than non-Indigenous youth, but if you are an Indigenous woman you are 35 times more likely to be hospitalised by partner abuse than a non-Indigenous woman. Those figures are atrocious, yet the Greens have the audacity to demonstrate their ignorance by introducing to parliament bills condemning the intervention on the basis of human rights. Basic human rights, proclaimed and agreed upon, say that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms without distinction of any kind—such as those of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. These rights recognise that a child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment—in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding. A child should be fully prepared to live an individual life in society. To deny children an education is to deny them basic human rights. So long as we continue to accept a culture that says, 'We will pay welfare with no expectation of something in return'—that is, the right of children to be educated—we are denying those children their natural human rights.

"Garrett, Peter, MP",ALP,2011-07-06,"



Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:45):  I am going to provide some summing-up comments on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011, noting the contributions that have been made by members in this debate and reflecting that we do have support in the House for the amendments that have been identified in this bill.


The bill's primary purpose is to extend existing funding arrangements under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000, including indexation for the 2013 calendar year. Through the act, the Australian government funds a range of programs to support the attendance, engagement and learning of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. I will take the opportunity to provide a few examples of the kinds of programs that are funded under this act and draw the attention of members opposite in particular to those programs. 


On literacy and numeracy, funds from the act are expanding the use of personalised learning plans for Indigenous students—learning plans which look at where each student is up to and which help teachers tailor their class work to ensure gaps are filled and every student is making progress. I consider as Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth that personalised learning plans are an essential component of the education provision for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. I will be looking to work very closely with state jurisdictions as we continue to roll out this program. 


On attendance, the act funds the Sporting Chance Program—which members will be aware of—engaging mainly Aboriginal boys who are passionate about sport, but taking that passion and using it to drive attendance and a connection with schools. I had the opportunity last week ,when we had a community cabinet in Darwin, to visit Casuarina Senior College, which is funded under this program and currently in its third year of that program. The school now has its largest ever cohort of Aboriginal boys undertaking year 12. That is a significant achievement and something that Casuarina Senior College and its students can be very proud of. It represents a quantum increase in the number of boys getting to year 12 and, once in year 12, having the opportunity to go on to further education, or to skills and vocation. 


On community support for schooling, the act also fund projects that strengthen links between schools and parents, community members and, especially, elders. One good example is the Connecting Country initiative in New South Wales where new teachers in high Aboriginal enrolment schools are given an induction into the local community prior to taking up their position. This helps new teachers understand community needs and expectations. It builds a solid and productive working relationship with community leaders, which can be very useful in resolving attendance and a range of other issues that can arise from time to time. These are just a few examples of the programs that are funded under the act and which members need to be very aware of. The fact is that funding provided under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act is not the only way this government is supporting better results, better outcomes, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. Under the Smarter Schools National Partnerships, the government is providing some $2.5 billion to expand literacy and numeracy programs and to improve teacher quality, specifically in schools serving the most disadvantaged around the country. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, like all students around the country, are benefiting from this significant investment, as well as from the investments that we are making in modernising school infrastructure, in providing technology for classrooms, in a high-quality Australian curriculum, in professional standards and improved training for teachers, in meaningful vocational training opportunities that students can still access while in secondary school and, again, in the provision of trade training centres, including those in the Northern Territory.


The fact is that this government has almost doubled federal investment in Australian school education, compared with the previous coalition government. That is the salient fact as we look at the resources that are being applied to make sure that every child, regardless of where they live, gets a great education. And the fact is that this government has set ambitious targets to improve educational outcomes for Indigenous students, to lift our efforts to meet the enormity of that challenge. We know that, within the aim of closing the gap, that task is a really urgent one.


I noted some of the comments by the member for Sturt about these targets, and they were reprised by the member for Durack. In particular, the member for Sturt mentioned that the COAG Reform Council found that data to monitor our commitment regarding early childhood education was not currently available. But what the member for Sturt failed to mention—it is always important to look at what he does not say as much as what he does—was that the COAG Reform Council reported that the work to collect those datasets is well advanced and will be in place for future years. So I caution the member for Sturt, when he comes into this House, not to make misleading use of statements and commentary by institutions such as the COAG Reform Council.


The member for Sturt also failed to mention that it was the previous coalition government that left us with no adequate national mechanism to actually collect data on participation in early childhood education. The member for Sturt failed to mention that it was the previous coalition government's policies that left an unacceptable number of young Australians without access to early childhood learning. So, when we came to government, we were faced with this deficit of policy, resources and support to enable young Australians, including young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, to get the best start in life that they can. So we started the massive task of improving service delivery and data collection, coming off a very inadequate base—the inadequate base that was the legacy of the Howard years—and when we finish, every child, no matter where they live in Australia, will have access to a quality preschool program delivered by qualified early learning teachers and access to the education resources that they need to make the best of their education journey.


I recently released a detailed blueprint describing our actions to ensure this universal access to early childhood learning is achieved for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Universal Access Strategy incorporates work on issues including the supply of places, workforce capacity and community awareness. Additionally, I should make mention of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan agreed through COAG, signed off by first ministers and chief ministers, which binds both the Commonwealth and state jurisdictions to specific, on-ground, targeted actions to make sure that our efforts in Indigenous education continue unabated. Of course, as members know, all aspects of school funding are currently under review, with the new funding model for schools to be put in place from 2013.


I will make one final comment about the contributions of the previous speakers. I too agree that attendance is a key and important issue in education for Indigenous kids, and we want to especially work closely with education authorities and school systems to make sure that attendance is given the priority that it both needs and deserves—and I will have more to say about that in the coming months. To summarise, the bill provides clarity that the Indigenous education funds under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act that the Australian government uses to support Indigenous school students will continue at least up until the new system comes into place and that there will be time for proper planning and consultation regarding any changes that might arise as a result of the review.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",Ind.,2011-07-06,"



Mr SLIPPER
 (Fisher—Deputy Speaker) (10:00):  It is always reassuring when those of us in this parliament are able to look at legislation and realise that we are at one in seeking to achieve better outcomes for all sections of the Australian community, including Indigenous Australians. While there has been some criticism by the opposition of elements of the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill, all members believe it is absolutely vital that Indigenous Australians be given the same educational opportunities as other Australians and when we do see areas of disadvantage we as a parliament have a responsibility to provide the resources, to give a helping hand, to Indigenous Australians to make sure that they are able to achieve in the same way as other Australians are. To fail to do so would not be equitable; it would not be an appropriate action by a First World country in 2011.


The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011 is supported by both sides of the House. It relates to programs which were instituted by the former Howard government—the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program, which aims to help young Indigenous people move away from home to gain the skills they need to get a job in their community or elsewhere, and the Sporting Chance Program, which is an Australian government initiative which started operating in schools in 2007. Its aim is to encourage positive educational outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students.


These are good initiatives; they are initiatives that have worked. There is broad acceptance in the community that they are desirable and that they should continue. However, the situation is that, while this bill enables these programs to have additional funding and to continue, it regrettably does not give permanence to them. The government says that the programs are under review, and I suspect that most people would agree that this is a government by review. There are excessive reviews by this government. By all means review those matters which need to be reviewed but, when there is bipartisan agreement on the very successful nature of the programs mentioned in the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill, why investigate something that everyone agrees is going well?


It is regrettable that the one-year extension of funding for the second year in a row does not give certainty, does not give confidence, to Indigenous Australians, although it does give a measure of reassurance that at least for the time being these important programs will continue to be funded. I suspect that, while a review is underway, ultimately the government will support the ongoing nature of these programs, but since there seems to be a community consensus and certainly a consensus in the parliament, and the results are clear on the board, about these programs they ought not continue to be 'reviewed'; they ought to be the subject of a statement by the minister saying these are good programs, these are programs which will be funded indefinitely into the future. Frankly, as a nation we do not have a lot to be proud of in the area of Indigenous affairs. As I was saying yesterday, we sought to throw money at the problem; we tried to salve the nation's collective conscience by throwing money at the problem without focusing on necessary outcomes.


Like other honourable members I was enormously proud when the member for Hasluck was elected. He is the first member of the House of Representatives to identify as Indigenous. I was really impressed when the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs crossed the chamber and congratulated the member for Hasluck, who is a role model for all Indigenous Australians. The member for Hasluck—and I do not really like to talk about someone else's philosophy—sees education as being the way forward and the way to address disadvantage. When one sees the success that the member for Hasluck has been in his life, starting from a position of relative disadvantage, it is very clear that education is extraordinarily important.


That is why the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011, which continues funding, at least for the time being, for these programs, is a very important bill. It is a bill that I commend and support, but I ask the government to cease reviewing these programs and give them a tick of permanence. They deserve it, they have got outcomes and they are achieving what they seek to achieve. The result is that young Indigenous Australians have a better chance of taking their place as people who are able to be successful Australians in every sphere of endeavour. So this is a good bill and these are good programs with which good outcomes are being achieved. I think, though, that the community and the parliament need reassurance from the government that these programs are going to be permanently funded and permanently supported, because they are doing such a wonderful job for those Australians who for too long have been disadvantaged. I commend the bill to the House.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2011-07-06,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (10:07):  Highly respected Aboriginal woman Yvonne Butler said:


Education is the greatest single weapon to overcome disadvantage and the impact of this denial of education affects me and other Indigenous people to this day. Education is the base upon which society relies, passing on our knowledge and teachings from one generation to the next.


Why should one group in society miss out on the wonders of education just because this government cannot commit to a decision of extending its financial aid?


The purpose of the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011 is to amend funding under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to include an additional calendar year, 2013, so that the facilities providing educational assistance can make a long-term commitment to bettering future generations of our Aboriginal population. The bill provides for the appropriation of $133.5 million for non-Abstudy payments over 2013. This funding amount also includes adjustments to appropriations made as a result of previous decisions of government, including in relation to the new federal financial arrangements framework. In accordance with the government's policy, the legislated figure will be adjusted for price movements. The bill also provides $25.5 million for Abstudy away-from-base payments. The total appropriation for both components is $159 million in 2013. The Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 provides a legislative basis and appropriate funding for a variety of Aboriginal education programs for the tertiary sector.


Sporting Chance and the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program are two initiatives of the previous coalition government that have been continued by the current Labor/Greens/Independents government. Both programs have achieved considerable success in retaining students in school as well as increasing their participation and success rates. However, this Labor government has not committed to long-term funding for these two initiatives. Instead, it has simply provided a 12-month extension in the past two budgets. The extension has been described as being necessary to allow for the completion and release of the Review of Funding for Schooling report, which is due some time in 2011. But by the government's own admission the review is focused on the mainstream. There may—only 'may'—be some implications for the design and operation of programs run by the IETA Act.


The Australian government, along with all state and territory governments, endorses and promotes the 21 common and agreed national goals of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy. Labor is paralysed by endless reviews. It has described this year as the year of delivery and decision. I say it is the year of more debt and more delay. At least the Prime Minister got the Ds right. A one-year extension of funding for the second year in a row by the Gillard Labor government limits the funding and therefore holds hostage future planning for more successful programs and long-term funding prospects. It seems this uncommitted government is trying to drive a wedge in good programs which re-engage Aboriginal students with learning and bettering their future.


The original initiative was a great initiative, introduced by the coalition government in 2000. The act allowed the minister to make an agreement with education providers, or other persons or bodies, authorising payments during the 2001 to 2009 calendar years. There is enormous frustration that this Gillard-Rudd government is simply without ideas. We have had 4½ years of Labor rolling off figures about Aboriginal disadvantage; however, even when the solution is handed to it from the previous coalition government, it still does not seem fit to implement it. It may want to set a 'closing the gap' figure for 2020, long after this government is gone and hopefully some of its mess is cleaned up; however, it will be unable to account for its lack of action. That will lie in the hands of future generations.


Following from this, if there is not proper funding for the education of Aborigines then we may not see a future generation. This government is quite happy to apologise for the actions of others generations ago, but it seems it is unable to face up to its own inaction and apologise for it. There are many opportunities for Aboriginal youth to do better and to involve themselves in the community, and with help from government a re-engagement with learning can be instilled into these children. But, if this government will not commit to ensuring long-term education funding, how can the children commit to their own education? This government is not really showing a good example. Given opportunity, Aboriginal children are just as capable as any other children of succeeding in our community.


In the Riverina there are just so many sporting opportunities, and we should be doing everything we can to involve Indigenous youths in one of their passions: sport. It is a passion that they are so very good at. Too often Aboriginal youths are overrepresented among those displaying antisocial behaviour. That seems to occur across Australia and it certainly occurs in the Riverina. It is because in some cases they do not get the proper parental direction, or because they have nothing meaningful to do with their lives because there is not the opportunity that should be encouraged more and more by government, or because, in some instances, they just do not know how to be involved in the wider community.


There are avenues other than sport, and one that comes to mind is participation in the Australian Defence Force Cadets. Those young Aboriginal men and women who do join cadet units have the time of their lives. I encourage Indigenous youth to participate. We have seen over many, many years—over decades—how Aboriginal men and women have engaged in our defence forces and been remarkable participants in keeping our nation safe so that today we may live in peace and in a democracy. In Wagga Wagga we have an Army cadet unit, and cadets of all races and ethnicities have risen to the highest ranks of this service. It is a mark of just what can be achieved. I never fail to be impressed with the young men and women in the cadet forces. They are future leaders of our country, and by continuing the funding at great length we can and will encourage Aboriginal Australians.


There is no denying the commitment both sides of the chamber have to Indigenous programs. The Gillard-Rudd Labor government has made a lot of promises under its Closing the Gap initiative; however, we and they, the Aboriginal population, need more than just words. Aboriginal Australians are counting on the Prime Minister to deliver real action and real results in education, housing, health care and, of course, sporting opportunities. Unfortunately this government has proven too many times to be nothing but talk.


The bill today provides more funding for a successful coalition government program. This is highly commendable and I thank the government for supporting the coalition initiative that has been developed over so many years. The previous coalition government was committed to Indigenous programs and in the 2007-08 budget $4 billion was put aside for Aboriginal programs and services. There was a 67 per cent real increase on the amount that had been spent by the Keating Labor government in 1995-96. The coalition government was particularly committed to Indigenous education through initiatives such as the Clontarf Foundation. From 1998 to 2005, the participation of Aboriginal students in year 12 increased from 32 per cent to 40 per cent. Participation in year 11 increased from 52 per cent to 62 per cent. But we can always do better and we must do better. Education is one of the many ways to the future for Aboriginal Australians.


These are just some of the outcomes of some of the projects carried out by the previous coalition government. The Labor-Green-Independents government has professed the same commitment but we have yet to see any real positive action. There is a long way to go in Indigenous education. On such an important issue, the government needs to do more than just expand coalition initiatives. However, it seems that this government just wants to take the easy option and that is costing Aboriginal students the right to a better life.


In recent times, this has been evident with the suspension of the live cattle trade in the north. The largest population per capita of Aboriginal Australians is in Northern Queensland, the Northern Territory and Northern Western Australia, the predominant areas for live export. Many Aboriginal men and women have worked long and hard to gain experience in managing all aspects of the live cattle trade industry. Jobs have not just been lost in droving the herds onto boats. There are also bookkeepers, jackaroos and jillaroos, farm managers and drovers. And many of those workers are Aboriginal people, who through the benefits provided by the coalition government, have re-engaged with the need for better education and worked their way into good jobs—only to have them suspended in another misled decision by this government. And what is the government's solution to this suspension? They have banned the live cattle trade. They have sent all of these Aboriginal workers to Centrelink for compensation—the very place that many like to avoid.


More programs such as the Aboriginal Environmental Education Centre in Brungle in New South Wales in the Riverina in my electorate need to be operated. This is an area in my electorate where education on Aboriginal tradition is threaded into the curriculum. Brungle Public School, which is close to Gundagai and Tumut, has developed programs and the grounds to provide a better understanding of Aboriginal culture. I commend them for the work that they are doing. Students will experience traditional greetings and meet Aboriginal elders in the dreaming room. They will also learn traditional skills, history, Dreamtime legends, implement making and the Wiradjuri language. They will learn about scar trees, bush tucker and plant and animal usage. Aboriginal activist and lawyer Noel Pearson once said that there is no self-esteem and self-worth without capability and there is no road to capability without education.

"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2011-07-06,"



Dr STONE
 (Murray) (10:17):  I too rise to speak to the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011, which amends the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 by extending the existing funding arrangements, including indexation, for the 2013 calendar year. The bill extends funding totalling $133.5 million for non-Abstudy payments, including a number of Indigenous school programs. It will align the payment period under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act with other funding for school education legislation and agreements. We are supporting this bill because these were originally coalition initiatives.


What concerns us, though, as the previous speaker said, is that this is a recognition that we are not doing well enough in terms of outcomes for Indigenous students. Today there has been a lot of media focus on the fact that Australian children do well comparatively internationally in terms of life chances, with the exception in particular of Indigenous children. There is a growing gap, in fact, between the life chances and outcomes for Indigenous children—including both remote and metropolitan Indigenous children—compared to those for non-Indigenous young people in the Australian society. Quite obviously, that cannot be tolerated in a country like ours.


I have to say that I am very disappointed that, while this government has paid a lot of lip-service to our intervention program, which we introduced just before they were elected nearly five years ago, and to closing the gap as a policy package and an ideal, we are not seeing any major indicators of improvement. For example, with Indigenous adolescent incarceration, the rates of incarceration both for young men and women—teenage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders—are increasing at a dramatic rate. The recidivism rates are increasing dramatically. These are wasted lives—lost lives—with young people spending much of their lives behind barbed wire. On the health of young Indigenous Australians: while morbidity rates are declining, we still have diseases you would expect to more commonly find in Third World countries. The levels of deafness and eyesight damage are just intolerable. In mainstream Australian society, a condition like otitis media, for example, is absolutely preventable or able to be cured in a way that does not leave permanent damage. But it too often leads to deafness in Aboriginal children before they reach their second birthday. There are implications of loss of hearing in terms of education, lifelong opportunities and even being able to participate in your home community. All of your chances are fewer if you have deafness and there is very little opportunity to get aids or even to learn signing to deal with it. This just should not be the case in Australia.


Then there is the business of car injury. Transport related injury is a leading cause of death and serious disability among both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, but it is often overlooked that Indigenous infants, children and adults are all much more likely to have a fatal transport related injury than their non-Indigenous peers. Compared to people in non-Indigenous Australia, Indigenous people who die from this sort of injury have more often been a vehicle passenger or a pedestrian. The risk factors are environment related, vehicle related and behaviour related and are different to those for the rest of the population.


Indigenous people have generally not experienced the reduction in road fatalities that the rest of the Australian population have experienced through effective road safety interventions like wearing seat belts or reducing road speed. Indigenous people are two to three times as likely as non-Indigenous Australians to have a transport related fatal injury and 30 per cent more likely to have a transport related serious injury. Seventy-five per cent of these injuries or deaths are in regional and remote areas. But even in urban locations Indigenous people have a two to three times higher rate of transport related fatal injuries. In some areas, the death rate may be 17 times greater than it is for the general population. This death rate occurs for all ages, including infants and children less than four years old, and there is a peak among 18- to 25-year-olds. The rate of 18 to 25-year-olds having accidents is a serious problem for non-Indigenous Australians too, but in the Indigenous community we have these young children and babies being killed as well. There are more likely to be single vehicle rollovers, and Indigenous people are 10 times more likely than non-Indigenous people to die as a pedestrian—35 per cent versus 13 per cent of all transport related fatalities respectively.


This seems an extraordinary set of data. Why are Australian Indigenous people more likely than non-Indigenous Australians to die in cars—as drivers or passengers—or as pedestrians? The answers are not very hard to find. The conditions of outback roads are very bad. Often there is less maintenance available for vehicles. Often these vehicles are poorly maintained, damaged and unroadworthy. Most cars in remote communities develop mechanical problems within six months and last less than 2½ years.


We need to look very closely at this whole business of deaths in vehicle related accidents. With this bill targeting Indigenous education assistance, we are talking about more students having opportunities to be mobile, to move away to other places and to be involved in sports related programs. Some of those programs are very excellent indeed but, unless we also go to the nub of the problems associated with young people being killed in car accidents, we are not paying attention to the whole problem, with its complexities and its cultural differences.


One of the clear problems for Indigenous young Australians in remote communities is that they do not tend to speak English. They cannot get drivers licences. The nonsensical requirements now applying in most states and territories stipulating how many hours of pre-licence driving you do with a mentor or a parent in the vehicle just cannot apply in outback Australia. In Queensland you are supposed to have some 100 hours of pre-licence driving experience, but some islands in the Torres Strait, for example, might only have a couple of kilometres, if you are lucky, of main road. So how can a young Indigenous person from a Torres Strait island abide by the law and get their drivers licence lawfully with proper experience of driving during the day and night and in all sorts of conditions? They simply cannot. So they are set up to fail in terms of their own safety behind the wheel and also in terms of being law-abiding when it comes to being stopped by police and asked for their drivers licence. These young Indigenous people do not learn English because they are not at school long enough, because their attendance is poor or because the teaching of English at their school is inadequate. There is no special provision for that situation when it comes to these young people being given special driver education. Perhaps there should be a special drivers licence for people from remote areas. That would acknowledge the special problems associated with pre-licence driving experience by providing them with assistance from someone who has a licence.


We often ignore the impacts of the remote geography of our country. I have been quoting these statistics from Monash University and the Foundation for Surgery, which have been doing a lot of work researching injuries and health outcomes of young Australians, particularly Indigenous young Australians. They have come up with some suggestions on what to do to prevent Indigenous mortalities from road trauma. They suggest that there should be more school based education and post-licence education. They say there should be educational and social marketing—in other words, fear messages—in relation to these problems on the road.


The trouble is that it is not just post-licence education; we are talking about pre-licence education. The Foundation for Surgery, Monash University and also the National Trauma Research Institute say we have dealt with these problems for non-Indigenous populations through street lighting, red-light cameras, the promotion of seatbelt use, random breath tests, mass media campaigns on safe driving and speed limit enforcement through speed detection devices. Clearly none of those measures makes much sense for Indigenous populations when we are talking about dirt roads out the back of Uluru or Halls Creek or Kununurra in Western Australia, so we need different approaches.


The coalition supports any measures that will assist Indigenous Australians to have a better life and to have the same opportunities as other Australians. Extending the funding for these programs is important but, I am sad to say, this is just a very small measure in terms of the huge task that confronts us. We have a lot of evidence that we are not doing any better in terms of how our Indigenous young Australians are experiencing life in our great country. I began by saying they are more likely to be locked up, homeless, have mental health problems, have alcohol and drug dependency problems, be assaulted and experience violence. They are more likely to be killed or seriously injured as a result of road trauma. The carers of those road trauma victims are more likely to have their own lives disadvantaged by the fact that they are caring for someone who is physically or brain injured—those with brain injuries may be damaged for life—and they are trying to deal with those things in a remote community.


Along with my coalition colleagues I support this bill, but we have to look much harder at the situation in Australia for Indigenous people. We cannot go on having Indigenous Australians being out of sight and out of mind because of where they live. We need an integrated approach to what we do with the states and territories and non-government agencies. We need to collect a lot more data and monitor the outcomes of a program if it appears to be successful, because too often we do not properly monitor outcomes. The program has short-term funding. The staff who are working with that program become disenchanted when they are on a six-month or 12-month program lifecycle. And, if it succeeds, then maybe in five or 20 years time there will be another program echoing almost exactly the parameters of the first—reinventing the wheel. Meanwhile, Indigenous communities become despairing of a churn of people coming to assist them. They have no sense that there is any continuity of care or understanding of their issues and problems. And we go on having children in Australia who are more likely to be blind through, for example, the instance of cataract conditions; more likely to be deaf; more likely to have brain damage due to foetal alcohol syndrome; more likely to be incarcerated and more likely to suffer death and injury through road trauma—all in all, in every way not able to fully enjoy the opportunities of this great country of ours.

"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2011-07-06,"




Mr HAASE
 (Durack) (10:30):  I rise today to address the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011. This proposed legislation amends the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000, the IETA Act, by extending the existing funding arrangements, including indexation arrangements, for the 2013 calendar year.


The Sporting Chance Program and Indigenous Youth Mobility Program, IYMP, are Howard government initiatives. Both programs have achieved success in retaining students in school as well as increasing their participation and success rates. The Sporting Chance Program was originally announced in the 2006-07 budget, with the objective of using sport and recreation as a tool to not only increase the level of educational participation of Indigenous students but also improve their final learning outcome. The Indigenous Youth Mobility Program allows Indigenous youth aged between 16 and 24 to relocate from remote communities to gain qualifications to increase their chance of getting a good job. Indigenous youth from cities and regional towns are also eligible for the program if they relocate to another IYMP host location to gain qualifications or to take up an apprenticeship.


I fully support this bill as I have seen firsthand what the Sporting Chance Program is achieving in Durack. Since opening its first academy for 25 boys on the campus of the Clontarf Aboriginal College in Perth, Western Australia, in 2000, the foundation has grown rapidly and has been consistently successful. They now cater for over 2,500 boys in 45 schools across Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Victoria.


Using the passion that Aboriginal boys have for football allows Clontarf to attract the boys to school. But it is not just a sporting program; rather, the Clontarf Foundation exists to improve the education, discipline, self-esteem, life skills and employment prospects of young Aboriginal men and, by doing so, equip them to participate more meaningfully in society.


The Clontarf Foundation has nine academies in Durack, with 658 students in total. The achievements of the Clontarf Foundation are remarkable. With school attendance rates of 80 per cent, year-to-year retention of not less than 90 per cent and 75 per cent of graduates gaining full-time employment within one year of leaving school, something is right. Wouldn't it be great if, rather than needing to use the passion for football to educate our Indigenous people, we could instigate a passion for education at an early age. Indigenous teenage males have a life expectancy of 17 years less than non-Indigenous teenage males and are 28 times more likely to be imprisoned. They have a truancy rate of about 45 per cent and are more likely to leave school prematurely, some as young as nine.


I, along with the rest of Australia, would like to, in the not too distant future, view these statistics simply as a relic of the history of Indigenous education. I want the Indigenous people of Australia to be able to stand proud and say, 'That was what it used to be like,' when they get up on the podium of success and reflect on how much they have achieved.


The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan 2010-14, released in early June this year, tells us:


Attending school and engaging with learning is fundamentally important in helping young Australians to acquire the skills they need for life. Successful learning cannot be built on irregular attendance. There is evidence to suggest that the more regularly students attend school the greater their success in learning.


Whacko; this is mind-boggling stuff—a 49-page report, at a huge cost, to tell us what we already know: if you do not go to school you cannot hope to learn! Amazing! Whoever would have thought that would be the case! The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan 2010-14 is without doubt well intentioned; however, I do wonder, given this Labor government's love of rhetoric and lack of discipline in following through, whether any of the report's goals will ever be achieved.


In fact, we have seen several cases of where even the reporting of this government's many and varied inquiries, committees and commissions cannot be achieved due to the lack of data. Recently the Council of Australian Governments Reform Council confessed on behalf of the Gillard government that they do not know if people with disabilities are getting improved services under the National Disability Agreement. The COAG Reform Council's 2009-10 performance report into the National Disability Agreement said:


In this second year report, the council finds that out-of-date data for some indicators, the lack of any data for a number of further indicators, and the absence of agreed measures for others, make it difficult to determine whether progress has been made toward meeting COAG’s overall objective.


This is consistent with the National Affordable Housing Agreement performance report 2009-10, where the COAG Reform Council could not provide a progress report on four partnerships that make up the agreement—again, due to lack of data. Page 39 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan 2010-14 states:


Data improvements may also lead to the development of more refined measures and reporting of performance against the closing the gaps targets. For example, there is currently no agreed trajectory associated with the target to ensure Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in remote communities have the opportunity to access to an early learning program in the year before school. The COAG Reform Council has recommended that data development in this area be given high priority. However, as an indication of work in this area, Figure 1 presents an Australian Government estimate based on Commonwealth funding for Universal Access to early childhood education. Once this data is refined to report on children from remote areas, reporting to Ministers will also be updated.


There we go—an admission of the inability to reach targets due to the lack of data, before the pursuit even begins.


The recent COAG Reform Council data released recently—data which I am sure the Labor government would prefer had not been released—proves that the great Closing the Gap idea is not working. In fact, the gap has widened between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students in year 9. The report, based on the NAPLAN data, shows that less than two-thirds of Indigenous year 9 students can read at the national average standard. This, so early on in the plan to halve the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students before 2018, is very troubling news. In what appears to be a distortion of the NAPLAN data, some believe assessments are actually being skewed to what is being taught rather than what children know.


The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan 2010-14 report is full of outcomes, targets, performance indicators, national collaborative action, systemic level action and local level action. But I note the report has not once mentioned the two words that are needed when dealing with Indigenous education: tough love. Instead, we have a report tarted up with socially and academically acceptable words so as not to offend anyone. Well, I think it is time that we offended people. I think it is time we set it straight and stopped pussyfooting around. For far too long Indigenous communities have existed rather than thrived, due to welfare handouts. We cannot educate the young before educating the educator.


In mainstream society, school attendance and education are accepted as the norm. That is not the case in Indigenous communities. The necessity of sending children to school needs to be embraced by the entire Indigenous population. An entrenched welfare philosophy exists within our Indigenous communities. Our passive love has not worked and will not ever work. We need more rigour. We need to impose welfare recipient restrictions in line with school attendance. We need to make full welfare payments dependent upon full school attendance.


The biggest issue in Indigenous education is, without doubt, attendance. It is all very well to spruik enrolment figures, but these figures are generally much higher than the true attendance rate and skew the picture completely. Exceptional headmasters and teachers and strong parental involvement can break the pattern, but school attendance in Aboriginal communities generally is far below that of the rest of the community. There is a culture of non-attendance because of funerals, extended absence for numerous reasons, overcrowding, housing, revolting abuse, sleep deprivation, lack of motivation through lack of purpose, lack of role models, no appreciation of need and no parental insistence.


The longer we keep handing out welfare with no expectation in return, the longer we will have a society within a society. First and foremost, we are all Australians; we are not Indigenous or non-Indigenous. We must stop the inequality of expectation between black and white. We need to change our mindset. We need to expect the same of all children, regardless of their colour or cultural background. By lowering our expectations for one sector of society, we do not allow them choices in life that other sectors take for granted—choices such as education, employment, success and, above all, hope. We can keep throwing money at communities with no real expectation of anyone improving their lives—it has worked for decades. Sure, we all feel better—out of sight, out of mind. We have done our bit, given money, eased our conscience, got to sleep nights and moved on—moved on until a hungry young reporter or a seasoned photographer pricks our conscience with a story about the trouble in our Indigenous communities.


Let us be honest with ourselves: it is just not working. Because the do-gooders of this country have brought a race to its knees, it is time to show tough love in order to restore dignity to our Indigenous people. All people need to have an education. As was pointed out in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan 2010-2014, there is evidence to suggest that the more regularly students attend school, the greater their success in learning.


The actions and initiatives of this Labor government are not working in any area, but especially not in Indigenous matters. Prior to the 2007 federal election, Labor promised it would contribute funds towards the construction and operation of three new boarding colleges for Indigenous secondary school students in years 8 to 12 in the Northern Territory. In 2008-09 the federal budget provided $28.9 million over four years towards this project—$18.8 million was to be spent in 2008-09 and $5.1 million, $2.5 million and $2.5 million over the following three financial years to 2011-12—with the Indigenous Land Corporation to contribute a further $15 million towards construction costs. So far, construction has begun on one site, and that has progressed to formwork only. Nearly three years after the specific commitment made by Mr Rudd, only one of the promised 38 Indigenous children and family centres will have been opened by 30 June this year. The Indigenous children and family centres, part of the Indigenous early childhood development national partnership, are designed to provide quality early childhood services to Aboriginal children and their families.


I am a member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, which recently tabled Doing time—time for doing, the report of its inquiry into the high level of involvement of Indigenous juveniles and young adults in the criminal justice system. The inquiry showed that not only are Indigenous youth 28 times more likely to be incarcerated than non-Indigenous youth, but if you are an Indigenous woman you are 35 times more likely to be hospitalised by partner abuse than a non-Indigenous woman. Those figures are atrocious, yet the Greens have the audacity to demonstrate their ignorance by introducing to parliament bills condemning the intervention on the basis of human rights. Basic human rights, proclaimed and agreed upon, say that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms without distinction of any kind—such as those of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. These rights recognise that a child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment—in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding. A child should be fully prepared to live an individual life in society. To deny children an education is to deny them basic human rights. So long as we continue to accept a culture that says, 'We will pay welfare with no expectation of something in return'—that is, the right of children to be educated—we are denying those children their natural human rights.

 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (10:45):  I am going to provide some summing-up comments on the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2011, noting the contributions that have been made by members in this debate and reflecting that we do have support in the House for the amendments that have been identified in this bill.


The bill's primary purpose is to extend existing funding arrangements under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000, including indexation for the 2013 calendar year. Through the act, the Australian government funds a range of programs to support the attendance, engagement and learning of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. I will take the opportunity to provide a few examples of the kinds of programs that are funded under this act and draw the attention of members opposite in particular to those programs. 


On literacy and numeracy, funds from the act are expanding the use of personalised learning plans for Indigenous students—learning plans which look at where each student is up to and which help teachers tailor their class work to ensure gaps are filled and every student is making progress. I consider as Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth that personalised learning plans are an essential component of the education provision for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. I will be looking to work very closely with state jurisdictions as we continue to roll out this program. 


On attendance, the act funds the Sporting Chance Program—which members will be aware of—engaging mainly Aboriginal boys who are passionate about sport, but taking that passion and using it to drive attendance and a connection with schools. I had the opportunity last week ,when we had a community cabinet in Darwin, to visit Casuarina Senior College, which is funded under this program and currently in its third year of that program. The school now has its largest ever cohort of Aboriginal boys undertaking year 12. That is a significant achievement and something that Casuarina Senior College and its students can be very proud of. It represents a quantum increase in the number of boys getting to year 12 and, once in year 12, having the opportunity to go on to further education, or to skills and vocation. 


On community support for schooling, the act also fund projects that strengthen links between schools and parents, community members and, especially, elders. One good example is the Connecting Country initiative in New South Wales where new teachers in high Aboriginal enrolment schools are given an induction into the local community prior to taking up their position. This helps new teachers understand community needs and expectations. It builds a solid and productive working relationship with community leaders, which can be very useful in resolving attendance and a range of other issues that can arise from time to time. These are just a few examples of the programs that are funded under the act and which members need to be very aware of. The fact is that funding provided under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act is not the only way this government is supporting better results, better outcomes, for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. Under the Smarter Schools National Partnerships, the government is providing some $2.5 billion to expand literacy and numeracy programs and to improve teacher quality, specifically in schools serving the most disadvantaged around the country. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, like all students around the country, are benefiting from this significant investment, as well as from the investments that we are making in modernising school infrastructure, in providing technology for classrooms, in a high-quality Australian curriculum, in professional standards and improved training for teachers, in meaningful vocational training opportunities that students can still access while in secondary school and, again, in the provision of trade training centres, including those in the Northern Territory.


The fact is that this government has almost doubled federal investment in Australian school education, compared with the previous coalition government. That is the salient fact as we look at the resources that are being applied to make sure that every child, regardless of where they live, gets a great education. And the fact is that this government has set ambitious targets to improve educational outcomes for Indigenous students, to lift our efforts to meet the enormity of that challenge. We know that, within the aim of closing the gap, that task is a really urgent one.


I noted some of the comments by the member for Sturt about these targets, and they were reprised by the member for Durack. In particular, the member for Sturt mentioned that the COAG Reform Council found that data to monitor our commitment regarding early childhood education was not currently available. But what the member for Sturt failed to mention—it is always important to look at what he does not say as much as what he does—was that the COAG Reform Council reported that the work to collect those datasets is well advanced and will be in place for future years. So I caution the member for Sturt, when he comes into this House, not to make misleading use of statements and commentary by institutions such as the COAG Reform Council.


The member for Sturt also failed to mention that it was the previous coalition government that left us with no adequate national mechanism to actually collect data on participation in early childhood education. The member for Sturt failed to mention that it was the previous coalition government's policies that left an unacceptable number of young Australians without access to early childhood learning. So, when we came to government, we were faced with this deficit of policy, resources and support to enable young Australians, including young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, to get the best start in life that they can. So we started the massive task of improving service delivery and data collection, coming off a very inadequate base—the inadequate base that was the legacy of the Howard years—and when we finish, every child, no matter where they live in Australia, will have access to a quality preschool program delivered by qualified early learning teachers and access to the education resources that they need to make the best of their education journey.


I recently released a detailed blueprint describing our actions to ensure this universal access to early childhood learning is achieved for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Universal Access Strategy incorporates work on issues including the supply of places, workforce capacity and community awareness. Additionally, I should make mention of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan agreed through COAG, signed off by first ministers and chief ministers, which binds both the Commonwealth and state jurisdictions to specific, on-ground, targeted actions to make sure that our efforts in Indigenous education continue unabated. Of course, as members know, all aspects of school funding are currently under review, with the new funding model for schools to be put in place from 2013.


I will make one final comment about the contributions of the previous speakers. I too agree that attendance is a key and important issue in education for Indigenous kids, and we want to especially work closely with education authorities and school systems to make sure that attendance is given the priority that it both needs and deserves—and I will have more to say about that in the coming months. To summarise, the bill provides clarity that the Indigenous education funds under the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act that the Australian government uses to support Indigenous school students will continue at least up until the new system comes into place and that there will be time for proper planning and consultation regarding any changes that might arise as a result of the review.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (10:56):  There is no doubt that in this place there is a very strong bipartisan aspiration for a better future for Indigenous Australians. This report is a very important contribution to our understanding of the current state of play. The concerning aspect of the report that is being debated today is how we have stood still on many indicators for Aboriginal Australians and, in some instances, how far we have gone backwards.


This report is focused on young people and their contact with the criminal justice system. I think it is very revealing to refer directly to the report, where it says:


Tragically, indigenous juveniles and young adults are more likely to be incarcerated today than at any other time since the release of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody final report in 1991. 


It goes on to say:


This rise has occurred despite increased funding and the concern and efforts of community members, government officials, non-government organisations and the judiciary around Australia. 


Specifically, the detention rate for Indigenous juveniles is 397 per 100,000 people, which is 28 times higher than the rate for non-Indigenous juveniles, which is only 14 per 100,000. The report goes on to say: 


In 2007, Indigenous juveniles accounted for 59 percent of the total juvenile detention population.


This is very alarming indeed. It is very alarming to note just how significant this issue has become for young Indigenous Australians.


You can only consider this issue, however, when you look at the reasons behind it and the resultant behaviours. There is a picture that is painted by this report that these very high levels of incarceration reflect other problems—problems related to the breakdown in family relationships and the dysfunction of many family relationships, the lack of significant role models in Indigenous communities, the breakdown in social relationships within the community, health disadvantages and the terrible health statistics that belie the fact that we are a First World country. In fact, shockingly, the health statistics that are revealed indicate that we are on par with many Third World countries when we look to Indigenous health standards. There are issues of education and the fact that we have so many Indigenous Australians who are simply not attending school. There are also issues around housing, employment and economic opportunity. 


There is much that is very worthy in the contributions made in this report but the fact remains that for nearly every government department that is involved with the Closing the Gap initiative that has been brought forward by this government there is very little data collection and coordination in the programs that are being put forward. The government is very focused on spending money but it is not particularly focused on the outcomes that are being delivered. It is my view that we must monitor very carefully and closely the outcomes of all programs and analyse the results so that successful programs can be expanded and those that are not successful can be modified or, in some cases, discontinued if they prove not to be worthy.


Noel Pearson, who is a very significant Indigenous leader, has for many, many years been critical in this debate about achieving better outcomes for Indigenous Australians, not only by identifying the problems, but by thinking in a very innovative way about some of the solutions. In doing so, he has challenged the philosophical orthodoxy on which a lot of the programs and government solutions to date have been based. I want specifically to look at education and the school attendance rate for Indigenous children. We know, looking at the figures, that on average attendance is less than 60 per cent and in remote communities it reaches barely 50 per cent. These children are being left behind.


In particular, I turn to the recommendations that this report has made regarding school and community relationships. Recommendation 16—and I do not propose to read all of it—specifically focuses on the importance of flying an Aboriginal and/or a Torres Strait Islander flag alongside the Australian flag within school grounds; learning about Indigenous sites of significance in the local area; incorporating an acknowledgement of country at the start of significant events as well as school assemblies; using local Indigenous language names for school classrooms or sporting houses and teams; celebrating Mabo Day, NAIDOC Week, Reconciliation Week and Harmony Day—it goes on. But what it does not talk about specifically is increasing what are, in my view, core skills of numeracy and literacy and equipping students today with the skills they are going to need to be fully engaged in realising the economic opportunities that are available to them as members of the broader Australian community. I think that this is a significant problem. While the other recommendations I refer to may be very worthy, they are not going to make a significant difference to the educational experiences and outcomes for Indigenous Australians. I think we need to be a lot stronger. Parents need to send their children to school or face income penalties. We know already that many parents are not prosecuted when in fact they do not send their children to school.


Noel Pearson has talked about the success of a number of programs that have been developed in Cape York. He has talked in particular about educational scholarships for students to be educated, sometimes outside the community. The results with those programs and educational scholarships have been quite outstanding, and I think we need to very seriously consider whether this is something that the government should be looking very closely at.


Noel Pearson has also talked, significantly, about mutual obligation, about the culture of personal responsibility and about empowerment for the individual and for the community. I think these are the values that should be the touchstones that shape Indigenous policy now and into the future. 


It is very clear that an integrated approach to Indigenous policy is required. We need to look carefully at the way in which schools and education policy interact with broader employment and economic policy and with the health initiatives that are being put forward as well as at the support we provide to families in Indigenous communities. We all want Indigenous children and Indigenous people in this country to be equipped to participate fully in the many opportunities a country like ours has to offer.


We in the coalition have been particularly strong on these issues. While we might not always have been perfect in the response that we provided, we have made and will continue to make the hard decisions, such as the Northern Territory intervention, to tackle problems that we know exist, such as alcohol abuse and gambling. We will also continue to provide support to parents to get children to school and work with families and communities to remove hurdles that prevent school attendance. It is incumbent upon us as members in this place to break the cycle of expectation that young Indigenous people end up in detention and jail. We need to do this by attacking the problems at their core. We must do this together and as a matter of urgency.

Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (11:05):  I want to take the opportunity today to also contribute, along with the member for Higgins and others who have spoken previously, to the debate on this particularly important report, of June 2011, of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs that has been presented to the parliament Doing time—time for doing: Indigenous youth in the criminal justice system. I indicate the tremendous work that has been done by the committee and acknowledge Shane Neumann as the chair and Sharman Stone as the deputy chair of that committee. I note that the member for Durack is also a member of the committee and is here to participate in this debate.


Some reports are presented before this parliament that, I believe, are of such significance to the nation that all of us should engage with the report. I believe this is one of those reports. This particular report tells a story of our nation. It is a difficult one to hear and it confronts us with some real challenges. Sadly, they are not new challenges. The foreword of the report indicates that, in fact, it is 20 years since the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and, despite that report, over the time that has subsequently passed the incarceration rate of Indigenous Australians, including Indigenous youth, who are the subject of this report, has actually worsened. Sadly, Indigenous juveniles are 28 times more likely than non-Indigenous juveniles to be incarcerated, despite Indigenous peoples representing only 2.5 per cent of the Australian population. This is a state of affairs that I think requires the urgent attention of all governments, communities and people across this nation.


The report goes to great length and into great detail to outline the extensive social and economic disadvantage that contributes to the high levels of Indigenous contact with the criminal justice system. It is clear from the committee's investigation that there is intergenerational dysfunction in some Indigenous communities that presents a truly significant challenge of breaking that cycle of offending, recidivism and incarceration.


There is so much in this report that it would be difficult to encompass it all in a 15-minute contribution in this place. So I want to focus specifically on where we as a nation, sadly, sit in terms of these contacts and incarcerations. Secondly, I want to generally touch on some of those contributing factors and some of my own experiences in the field and then, finally, to talk about one local program in my area that I think is representative of the sorts of activities that can make a difference.


As I indicated, the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody came down in 1991. So this year, at the time of this report we are debating, we are 20 years down the track since that point in time. The committee drew together research and statistics gathered from state and national authorities. I want to indicate some of these to the House. I think they speak for themselves. Sometimes statistics can be a way of hiding the truth, as many have quoted the famous quote: 'Lies, damned lies and statistics.' However, I think in this case they actually illuminate for us very clearly the issue that we are dealing with.


The detention rate for Indigenous juveniles is 397, per 100,000. That is 28 times higher than the rate for non-Indigenous juveniles. In 2007 Indigenous juveniles accounted for 59 per cent of the total juvenile detention population, despite Indigenous people being 2.5 per cent of the total population. There is clearly a strong link between the disproportionate rate of juvenile detention and the disproportionate rate of adult imprisonment. Not surprisingly, if many of those adults being imprisoned are from Indigenous families then the flow-on impact on the children of those families sees an increase in their contact with the system and incarceration as well. At this time 25 per cent of all prisoners in Australia are Indigenous despite, as I said, being 2.5 per cent of the population.


Prison census data shows that between 2000 and 2010 the number of both Indigenous men and Indigenous women has increased markedly—Indigenous men by 55 per cent and Indigenous women by 47 per cent. When we comprehend how significant Indigenous women are to the fabric of Indigenous communities and to holding families together, from the increasing level of incarceration of those leaders in families and communities we can see why there are dysfunctional families with intergenerational problems and incarceration becoming a serious issue. Between 2000 and 2009 the imprisonment rate of Indigenous Australians increased 66 per cent. It is a really difficult statistic for us to get our heads around but, more importantly, it challenges us to say, 'This is something that we really need to seriously take on board to find strategies that work.'


Indigenous juveniles and young adults are much more likely to come into contact with police in comparison with their non-Indigenous counterparts. So the first point of contact is a place at which an important intervention can occur. In 2008 over 40 per cent of all Indigenous men in Australia reported having been formally charged with an offence by police before they reached the age of 25. That is 40 per cent of all Indigenous men.


Indigenous juveniles are overrepresented in both community and detention based supervision. Indigenous juveniles make up 53 per cent of all juveniles in detention and 39 per cent of all juveniles under community supervision. Importantly, they are younger than the average of those in the system. Twenty-two per cent of Indigenous juveniles in detention were aged 14 or younger, compared with only 14 per cent of non-Indigenous juveniles.


It should be also acknowledged—and the committee makes this important point—that the adverse contact with the criminal justice system for Indigenous people is not confined to their being offenders. It is also, sadly, the fact that they are more often than not victims of crime as well. In particular, they are more likely to be victims of violent crime than non-Indigenous people. The impact of that on communities is important to recognise.


Between 2006 and 2007 Indigenous women were 35 times more likely to be hospitalised as a result of spousal partner violence than non-Indigenous women. When we think of the impact of that on families and young people and the direct link between violence in families and engagement with the criminal justice system, we can see why there is such a problem. The committee acknowledged in its report that Indigenous victimisation rates are an important part of the problem that need to be addressed.


In 1991 the royal commission indicated in its report:


The more fundamental causes of over-representation of Aboriginal people in custody are not to be found in the criminal justice system but those factors which bring Aboriginal people into conflict with the criminal justice system in the first place ... [and] the most significant contributing factor is the disadvantaged and unequal position in which Aboriginal people find themselves in society - socially, economically and culturally.


Twenty years later that still stands the test of time.


The committee report goes into significant coverage of the particular aspects of disadvantage and overrepresentation of Indigenous juveniles among young offenders. They include the broad categories of social norms and individual family dysfunction, which I have touched on to some extent, and connection to community and culture. There are some very moving stories in the report which were told by Indigenous elders, who talk about their young generation being caught between two worlds. It is not that they are connected to one and not the other; it is not that they are connected to the traditional culture and are therefore not able to participate in modern society or that they are connected to modern society and have lost their traditional culture. Rather it is that they are lost between the two, which is the worst possible circumstance you could imagine for them.


The health implications are talked about in the report. In particular, it discusses the issues around drug and alcohol abuse. It not only discusses drug and alcohol abuse in the environments in which young people are present but also discusses abuse by young people themselves and the impact it has on bringing them into the justice system. The education issues are talked about—the challenges not only of keeping young people in general engaged but also and in particular the challenges of keeping Indigenous young people engaged, and the member for Higgins talked about some of those. The employment link is discussed—getting through education and getting a job is also an important indicator and more of a challenge for our Indigenous young people than it is for our non-Indigenous young people. Accommodation is also discussed—the challenges around providing safe and secure housing and a permanent and ongoing address and how significant that is for young people. I recommend that all members of our communities have a look at both those aspects of the report in some detail and the very important recommendations that are made in the report.


In the few minutes I have left, I will make some observations about a recommendation of the report which addresses police training and Indigenous employment. Included in recommendation 23 is a suggestion for, 'Incentives to increase the employment of Indigenous police men and women and opportunities for mentoring and police work experience for Indigenous students.' I think that would be a very worthwhile initiative. One of the saddest comments I ever heard when I worked for juvenile justice was from a young Indigenous man who was in detention. He was completing his schooling—he was 17—and was engaged in some volunteer work for local emergency services. He said that the worst thing in his life that he could imagine was being released from detention and being sent back to his family and community. He knew that that the dysfunction there was such that it would be very hard for him to resist falling back into the old ways that had got him into trouble in the first place; it would also mean that it would be unlikely that he could continue with either his education or his potential employment opportunities, which were occurring because of his engagement in volunteering activity. I thought that was this saddest thing that I had ever heard—that a young person could say to me with years of experience under his belt that he was better off in detention than he would have been in the community, and I think that that remains a challenge for us.


I want to acknowledge Project Murra in my own area of the Illawarra. This project is conducted through Warrigal Employment and began in 2008 as a partnership between the local commander of the police service in Lake Illawarra, the local TAFE and Warrigal employment. It is a particularly successful two-year program of school based traineeships with the police service which has now been extended to other emergency services and been done in conjunction with the HSC. It keeps young Indigenous people engaged in school and provides some real connections to the police and emergency services. It contributes to crime prevention because the community is connected to the police service. It also contributes to school retention and is an important employment strategy. The program has been going so well that the police service have continued with it and, indeed, it has been extended to other emergency services. The program has been supported and funded by the federal Department of Employment, Education and Workplace Relations and by New South Wales TAFEs as well as by the services. It is creating a much stronger relationship between those services and the local Indigenous community, and in the class of 2009 there were 12 students—three with the Wollongong police, three with Lake Illawarra police, two with Nowra police, three with the New South Wales ambulance service and one with the state emergency service. That is the current cohort, which is going through to completion now. Overall, it is a really good program which has multiple benefits: it is well regarded by the community, it is a great asset to the broader community and it increases the capacity for young people to be connected. I understand that one of the young people is at the police academy completing the degree, continuing their enrolment and engagement with the police service. That is a good local story, but a small one. We all need to be focused on doing far more to address the issues that have been raised in this very important report.

Mr HAASE
 (Durack) (11:20):  As a member of the committee reporting on this issue in our report entitled Doing time: a time for doing, it is a pleasure to have the opportunity to make a comment. This report was the result of almost two terms of government. We carried on with this inquiry as a new committee in this parliament. That gave us the opportunity to reflect on the wealth of knowledge that had been accumulated by the previous parliament and add to that with our own fortes and, to a degree, preconceptions. From a personal perspective, I had my first association—which is ongoing—with Indigenous Australians when I first started school. A substantial part of our rural community was Indigenous. In those years, their welfare had been dreadfully neglected. That was prior to 1967.


The conditions under which those Indigenous people lived were to say the least Third World. But there were a couple of remarkable things about that era for Indigenous people in agricultural Australia. Certainly I can speak with first hand knowledge of my Shackleton and Bruce Rock area. Firstly, all children attended school regularly. There was much less mobility of parents in those days. The second thing that is important to note is that the greatest majority of the male heads of households—and please do not pull me up for being sexist; in those days, it was the male of the household who went out to work and put bread on the table—were gainfully employed, receiving a weekly wage and providing for their families.


The shocking thing is to contrast that situation and the situation that exists as the norm today. In this place, we have been discussing sporting and other programs that are funded to encourage Indigenous male youth specifically to attend school on a regular basis. I am speaking about the Clontarf program, which is now spreading across Australia, having emerged from the Clontarf Aboriginal Hostel in Perth, Western Australia. There is no doubt that it is instructive for emerging families today that there will be a circle of experience as an Indigenous person growing up, maturing, having a family and passing on in today's Australian society. Sadly, that circle is generally welfare dependent. It involves youth with the judicial system, then corrective services, then welfare, then the judiciary and then corrective services. The statistics that have been gathered in this report, Doing time: a time for doing, clearly indicate that anything that we have done in the past has failed to address the issue of recalcitrant Indigenous youth moving through a revolving door system of welfare and incarceration.


Rational people could only conclude that anything that we have done in the past is something that we should avoid doing in the future and that we ought to use this report as a foundation of knowledge on which to build a different approach to the problem. And it is a problem. You cannot ignore the fact that Indigenous people represent 2.5 per cent of the Australian population and the statistic that, of incarcerated Australian youth, 53 per cent are Indigenous. That is a statistic that you cannot find anything but horrendous and unacceptable.


So what is the solution? We have made 40 recommendations, and I would be a liar if I were to stand here and suggest (a) that the 40 recommendations will be adopted and (b) that, should they be adopted, the problem would go away. It is irrational to suggest that. The problem has been entrenched for far too long. But there is no doubt in my mind that the major cause of the problem—that is, revolving door incarceration—is lack of education on the one hand and the present societal acceptance that education will not be absolutely necessary for Indigenous youth.


We need to change the mindset of the Australian people. Indigenous kids have every right to education, as much right as mainstream kids. There is no difference in their intellect and there ought to be no difference in their treatment, yet we excuse the lack of school attendance by Indigenous kids. We turn a blind eye. We speak to state governments about the employment of truancy officers to make sure that Aboriginal families know that their children are not attending school and that something must be done about it because the cultural expectation is that children will go to school, and state government education ministers say, 'Well, there's nothing we can do about it.'


I believe there is something we can do about it. We ought to tie welfare payments to school attendance. I further believe that to not do so, and therefore to excuse Indigenous families from the responsibility of making sure their children attend school, if you analyse it and extrapolate, is certainly a denial of the human rights of those children. It could almost be compared with genocide, because we are guilty as parliamentarians if we do not enact laws that create outcomes for Australian citizens. We are contributing to an ongoing sin, and that is the denial of Indigenous children's rights. Everyone has a right to an education in this country, but if you are Indigenous we do not insist that you attend an institution. If you are mainstream, we do. Parents who do not send their children to an educational institution are brought to account. But if you are an Indigenous parent there would appear to be very active ignorance. We do not even expect it.


I hear employees of Indigenous agencies say: 'Look, there's nothing we can do. They're just Indigenous people.' I think that is horrendous—totally unacceptable. There is no reason why we should not apply the same rigour in our requirements at law to Indigenous people as we do to mainstream society, and part of that requirement is to send kids to school. It is a parental responsibility and it is accepted generally at law that it is a parental responsibility—unless you are an Indigenous parent, it seems. Then we turn the blind eye.


We need to change that. We need to work on a policy and even, dare I say, ignore political correctness. We have already done so much damage to the Indigenous population, their expectations and their role as part of mainstream Australian society. We have already done so much damage. Well-intentioned decisions resulted in the denial of opportunity, because we denied our responsibility of insisting that Indigenous families maintain the same culture as mainstream families and accept education as the norm. I can tell my colleagues here in this place that school attendance in Indigenous remote communities is not the norm; it is far from the norm. And it is accepted by all and sundry as being okay, because, 'Well, the parents had to drive 2,000 kilometres to attend a funeral and they were going to go for a week but they stayed for three months, and that is okay because it is culturally appropriate.' I do not accept that children should be denied their human rights on the basis of our current interpretation of what is culturally correct.


There is a far greater need today for tough love: the application of rigour in Indigenous funding programs and a change in the commonly held attitude that we will fund an Indigenous program but not really expect high performance and positive outcomes, because it is an Indigenous program. It looks to me as though this is perhaps not the actual situation, but I can assure you that agency after agency will say, 'We have got a program. We have got a bucket of money and we are moving amongst Indigenous communities and we are looking for groups to take up this funding. So, would you, or you or you perhaps take this funding responsibility on and deliver for your community, because it is going to have a very positive outcome.' People are almost coerced, as Indigenous individuals, into participation in programs that have been well-meaningly funded by governments of all kind. But at the end of the day there is very little expectation, and almost no audit, that the outcomes achieved by that funding will be positive. After the expenditure of the funding somebody says, 'Well, that provided employment for a period of time and circulated taxpayer funding for a period of time and therefore it must have had a positive outcome.' Well, it is not the case. My experience clearly indicates that this effectively creates a privileged position for those who are directly involved in the particular program, but in the rest of the community it creates a degree of jealousy. Then, when everyone observes that the program has achieved no positive outcome, the rest of the community in the future is not reticent when putting their hand up for a government funded program, so that they, too, can be part of it. And because they believe there will be no requirement for rigour and no actual audit, and no-one will be criticised if there is no positive outcome.


We need tough love in our communities. We need to remove our focus on political correctness and we need to focus on the necessity of positive outcomes. If that requires us to follow the path proposed by Noel Pearson, I say 'Let's do it,' because everything we have done in the past of which Noel Pearson, amongst others, is extremely critical has been a collective failure. Look at just one area: education. The most educated, employable, capable and responsible Indigenous members of my community, the seat of Durack, are those who were educated under the mission system. We are all very quick to criticise the paternalism of the mission education system and how teaching with an iron rod is not acceptable these days, but the individuals who were educated at Mogumber, Moore River, Mount Margaret, Karalundi and numerous other missions under a rigorous system got a good education, and they attended school. There was direct connectivity between school attendance and learning, the expectation and the welfare that was provided by the mission.


Having believed that I would speak a few moments only on this, I find that there is just so much to say. In these closing seconds, let me implore my colleagues on both sides of the House: something needs to be done. The stats are all there. The knowledge has been collected. We know that what has happened in the past is not solving the problem. Fifty-three per cent of the juvenile prison population are Indigenous, although they make up just 2.5 per cent of the general population. The worst possible result of this report would be that we once again do nothing.

 (Kooyong) (11:35):  I also rise to speak today on the report tabled by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs entitled Doing time—time for doing: Indigenous youth in the criminal justice system. This topic makes my heart break. It is 20 years since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, with its nearly 340 recommendations; but today, among Aboriginal communities, incarceration levels are even higher than they were then. In the words of Mick Gooda, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner:


… we've failed miserably in the last 20 years. 


Indigenous juveniles between the ages of 10 and 17 and Indigenous young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 make up a disproportionate part of our prison population. In fact, Indigenous juveniles account for 59 per cent of the juvenile prison population. They are 28 times more likely to be imprisoned than their non-Indigenous counterparts. According to prison census data taken between 2000 and 2010, the number of Indigenous Australians in custody has gone up by 55 per cent for men and 47 per cent for women—this at a time when the Indigenous population of Australia is only 2½ per cent of the entire population. Quite clearly, this is not good enough.


This report makes clear that the level of contact between our Indigenous youth and our criminal justice system is unacceptable; it is too high and it needs dramatic and drastic action. The impact of having such a high number of Indigenous youth in our criminal justice system has implications that are far and wide: implications for the family unit, for the broader community and for levels of school attendance—which in remote communities are less than 50 per cent—and, personally, for their subsequent employment chances and for the likelihood of their escaping the negative influences of substance and narcotic abuse.


We need programs that tackle the root causes of offences by Indigenous juveniles. We need to get the kids more engaged. We need to work with families. We need to create employment opportunities. We need to end the substance and narcotic abuse. We need an integrated, intergovernmental approach.


In this report, there are over 40 recommendations—recommendations that talk about engaging and empowering Indigenous communities in the development and implementation of programs; how to better integrate and coordinate initiatives by government agencies, non-government agencies and community groups; the need to focus on early intervention; and the need to engage Indigenous leaders, particularly elders. Those 40 recommendations contain some very important suggestions, including better funding for local mentoring programs and improving recreational and sport related activities, because such programs will offer Indigenous youth a better life and a better lifestyle; more gender appropriate accommodation for Indigenous youth, particularly housing plans that ensure they are better equipped when they leave detention; better funding for programs to deal with substance and narcotic abuse; and greater focus on mental health programs. Interestingly, the report recommends hearing tests for all children starting in preschool and training of police so they are more aware that the young people they encounter may have hearing loss. It also recommends incentives for school attendance, including breakfast and lunch programs. If we can get them to school, we offer them an alternative lifestyle to one spent in the prison system. Another recommendation is for teacher development programs to enable our teachers to recognise poor health in their students and to have a greater cultural awareness. This will help them engage with students who may have poor English language skills.


We need more incentives for employers to take on Indigenous apprenticeships. Interestingly and importantly, we need to raise the profile of the Australian Defence Force and provide recruitment opportunities among Indigenous youth. Norforce is a good example for many Indigenous youth, with their communities playing a vital role in the protection of our nation. Increasing employment opportunities for Indigenous men and women in the police force is another recommendation. Then there is the recommendation to establish and fund a national Indigenous interpreter service.


The Australian Institute of Criminology needs to do a more detailed analysis of sentencing options and outcomes for Indigenous Youth. They need to look into the use of diversionary options to determine whether there are alternative sentencing options other than incarceration for Indigenous youth. Critically, we have to examine the rehabilitation process. This report suggests assigning community service case workers, providing better counselling for substance and alcohol abuse and engaging the families of those who find their way into our criminal justice system.


Noel Pearson has written about a speech that a young 15-year-old Aboriginal woman named Tania Major gave in front of John Howard in 2003. She was from the Cape York Peninsula. In this speech, she told her audience, including the then Prime Minister, that she was the only student in her primary school class who went on to be successful. She was the only girl not to have a child at the age of 15 or before. She was one of only three children in her class not to become an alcoholic. Seven of her classmates had been in prison. Four had tragically committed suicide. She went on to get an education, including a university degree, and forged a new path for herself. If we get more Indigenous youth to school, if we lift the year 12 retention rates from around the 35 per cent or 36 per cent that they are today, if we get systematic help for those Indigenous youth in our prison system then we can have more achieve as she has done. In this report, there is mention of a study conducted in New South Wales that found that 90 per cent of Indigenous juveniles in the prison system tested positive to drugs, a remarkable statistic. If we show them the way through education and if we intervene to stop this economic disadvantage then we have a chance.


In conclusion, we must do better. We need to be innovative. We need to focus, as Noel Pearson and others have talked about, on the issue of personal responsibility. But we cannot leave people behind if they cannot help themselves. If Australians want to know what the true moral challenge for our time is it is Indigenous disadvantage and particularly, as we have learned from this report, the disproportionate and tragic numbers of Indigenous youth who are incarcerated in our jails today.

Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (11:44):  I am very pleased to speak to the report Doing time—time for doing. I congratulate and place on the record today my deepest esteem for my parliamentary colleagues on the House Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs who have produced this report, particularly the chair, the member for Blair, the deputy chair, the member for Murray, and all of the other committee members.


It is quite tragic to be standing here today as a long-time member of parliament talking about the same things we were talking about 15 or more years ago. It is a tragedy that we still have to have a report that has to delve into these particular issues of Indigenous youth in the criminal justice system in Australia. It highlights the appalling overrepresentation of Indigenous youth in detention right around this great country of ours. While Indigenous Australians make up only a very small percentage of the population—about 2.5 per cent—25 per cent of prisoners are Indigenous.


Various members before me have spoken about the report, about the 110 submissions that were received and about the very important 40 recommendations that were made to government. My colleagues found during the inquiry that a disproportionately high number of Indigenous young adults are caught up in the criminal justice system. It is an absolute travesty in this day and age that we have this major challenge confronting us here in this place and in communities all around Australia. Indigenous youth are 28 times more likely to offend and be incarcerated today than at any other time since the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was released in 1991. One of my assistants in Queensland at the time worked on that particular report. The devastating stories that she would tell me haunt me to this day. It was her role to assist the commissioner in obtaining evidence. It is sad that we are here 20 years later and we still have this incredible rise in Indigenous youth in detention despite the work of numerous government agencies, hundreds of community organisations, community elders and many other active volunteers.


I had a business life before I came into this place. I taught at a university. One of my saddest regrets when I was teaching students in the business school at the Queensland University of Technology was that I never encountered one student of Indigenous nationality. I would have Chinese students and African students. I would have students from every corner of the globe, but never once did I have the privilege of teaching a student from an Indigenous background. It is really sad when we look at the dropout rates. Many of the speakers today have spoken about the horrific dropout rates and nonattendance at school. There are people who are much more knowledgeable than I about this. One of our whips here, the member for Forrest, has a large Indigenous community. Earlier on we heard from Barry Haase, the member for Durack. He has a large number of Indigenous people in his electorate. We really need to do a lot more here. Education is where it really needs to start.


Just a year or so ago I had an important project in my own business. I had a retail seafood business, and I recognised some outstanding qualities in our assistant manager, who was of Indigenous background. I decided that I would work with her to be the best assistant manager that she could possibly be. But you have to take a holistic approach. There were issues of lack of good nutrition and work standards that we addressed. I think that was probably one of my greatest failings as an employer. While we worked very, very hard to get consistent attendance at work and we worked on some of the social aspects that were affecting her life as well as the nutritional aspects and also the lack of educational opportunities that she had had earlier, I am sad to say that I failed in my quest because it was beyond me. As much as one can help in all of those areas, there are some cultural issues that are stumbling blocks, and we need to address those. They are stopping business people from achieving their best potential. One of my greatest regrets is that we could not go any further there and I sincerely wish her the very best in whatever she endeavours to do in her life. But literacy was clearly an issue with my assistant manager. Whilst literacy issues are higher in Indigenous populations, they will not allow Indigenous people to go on to further education and to be skilled in the best possible way. We need to really work on that.


The report that we are talking about today deals with contact with the criminal justice system. It presents a whole range of problems for Indigenous youth in Australia. The report highlights the sad fact that Indigenous kids are more likely to come into contact with the police and the criminal justice system than non-Indigenous kids. Once you get into that terrible cycle it is hard to break, and it is a self-fulfilling cycle. The report identified a link between the overrepresentation of Indigenous youth in the criminal justice system and social factors. We have to look at these much more seriously. We have to look at educational levels, as I mentioned just earlier. We have to look at levels of alcohol and drug use, hearing loss and all of those self-esteem issues as well. The combination of all of those things in Indigenous youth has led to the outcome of this particular report.


The report also recommended a host of activities designed to address these problems and to reduce the level of incarceration. I note particularly that there is a lack of a holistic approach. Just as I tried to take a holistic approach in my workplace, I think we need to do that. We need to have better pathways for Indigenous people out there in the community. We have to take an absolutely holistic approach if we are to address these issues. The 40 recommendations outline a very clear strategy for improving positive social norms. They look at things like improving education and addressing employment, health issues and housing. The report also outlined the need for improvement in government policy on police education and training. We need to have more Indigenous police officers. I welcome the fact that state governments have increased the number of Indigenous officers, and we in Queensland have led the way there as well.


Indigenous kids aspire to the same things as their non-Indigenous counterparts. They want a good job. They want to feel great about themselves. They want to spend money on things that they see on TV, just like other kids, and they want to spend money on themselves. They get frustrated sometimes at not being able to attain these things by legitimately being employed and sometimes, sadly, they turn to offending. They see that as the only way to address these same aspirations that we all have.


Much has been written and much has been said. Many speakers before me have highlighted this tragedy and many, many millions of dollars have been spent to tackle the problem, and yet the rate of incarceration continues to rise. There appears to be a lot of short-term funding. I am not knocking some of the programs—they are very good programs—but sometimes they do not get to fully achieve their aims because they are such short-term programs.


The report also noted that there is a lack of clear targets and outcomes in programs aimed at reducing youth in detention. I want to take this opportunity to highlight one program that has very clear goals and aims. I want to commend Project 10%, which was launched last month in my electorate of Brisbane. Unfortunately, due to parliamentary commitments in Canberra I was not able to be there, but I really follow the project with interest. While Project 10% was officially launched last month, it is the result of many years of hard work and many dedicated volunteers. Project 10% is a campaign aimed at reducing Indigenous incarceration rates by 10 per cent per year. This project recently won the community partnership awards in the Queensland reconciliation awards. I congratulate them wholeheartedly on this wonderful achievement. I want to thank everyone who is involved in that program. Project 10% was sponsored by McCullough Robertson solicitors and is a collaboration between ANTaR Queensland, Murri Watch and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women's Legal and Advocacy Service, ATSIWLAS. It is a community based project, has clear goals and is served by a group of amazing and willing volunteers. I applaud the work of Project 10%. 


I commend this report and its recommendations. It highlights that an incredible amount of work needs to be done in the areas of health, education, the intervention and housing, but it also highlights that we need to really try to reverse the terrible scenario of Indigenous incarceration in our legal system. I thank the committee for their very thorough and dedicated work on this report. I commend the report.


Debate adjourned.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2011-07-06,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (10:56):  There is no doubt that in this place there is a very strong bipartisan aspiration for a better future for Indigenous Australians. This report is a very important contribution to our understanding of the current state of play. The concerning aspect of the report that is being debated today is how we have stood still on many indicators for Aboriginal Australians and, in some instances, how far we have gone backwards.


This report is focused on young people and their contact with the criminal justice system. I think it is very revealing to refer directly to the report, where it says:


Tragically, indigenous juveniles and young adults are more likely to be incarcerated today than at any other time since the release of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody final report in 1991. 


It goes on to say:


This rise has occurred despite increased funding and the concern and efforts of community members, government officials, non-government organisations and the judiciary around Australia. 


Specifically, the detention rate for Indigenous juveniles is 397 per 100,000 people, which is 28 times higher than the rate for non-Indigenous juveniles, which is only 14 per 100,000. The report goes on to say: 


In 2007, Indigenous juveniles accounted for 59 percent of the total juvenile detention population.


This is very alarming indeed. It is very alarming to note just how significant this issue has become for young Indigenous Australians.


You can only consider this issue, however, when you look at the reasons behind it and the resultant behaviours. There is a picture that is painted by this report that these very high levels of incarceration reflect other problems—problems related to the breakdown in family relationships and the dysfunction of many family relationships, the lack of significant role models in Indigenous communities, the breakdown in social relationships within the community, health disadvantages and the terrible health statistics that belie the fact that we are a First World country. In fact, shockingly, the health statistics that are revealed indicate that we are on par with many Third World countries when we look to Indigenous health standards. There are issues of education and the fact that we have so many Indigenous Australians who are simply not attending school. There are also issues around housing, employment and economic opportunity. 


There is much that is very worthy in the contributions made in this report but the fact remains that for nearly every government department that is involved with the Closing the Gap initiative that has been brought forward by this government there is very little data collection and coordination in the programs that are being put forward. The government is very focused on spending money but it is not particularly focused on the outcomes that are being delivered. It is my view that we must monitor very carefully and closely the outcomes of all programs and analyse the results so that successful programs can be expanded and those that are not successful can be modified or, in some cases, discontinued if they prove not to be worthy.


Noel Pearson, who is a very significant Indigenous leader, has for many, many years been critical in this debate about achieving better outcomes for Indigenous Australians, not only by identifying the problems, but by thinking in a very innovative way about some of the solutions. In doing so, he has challenged the philosophical orthodoxy on which a lot of the programs and government solutions to date have been based. I want specifically to look at education and the school attendance rate for Indigenous children. We know, looking at the figures, that on average attendance is less than 60 per cent and in remote communities it reaches barely 50 per cent. These children are being left behind.


In particular, I turn to the recommendations that this report has made regarding school and community relationships. Recommendation 16—and I do not propose to read all of it—specifically focuses on the importance of flying an Aboriginal and/or a Torres Strait Islander flag alongside the Australian flag within school grounds; learning about Indigenous sites of significance in the local area; incorporating an acknowledgement of country at the start of significant events as well as school assemblies; using local Indigenous language names for school classrooms or sporting houses and teams; celebrating Mabo Day, NAIDOC Week, Reconciliation Week and Harmony Day—it goes on. But what it does not talk about specifically is increasing what are, in my view, core skills of numeracy and literacy and equipping students today with the skills they are going to need to be fully engaged in realising the economic opportunities that are available to them as members of the broader Australian community. I think that this is a significant problem. While the other recommendations I refer to may be very worthy, they are not going to make a significant difference to the educational experiences and outcomes for Indigenous Australians. I think we need to be a lot stronger. Parents need to send their children to school or face income penalties. We know already that many parents are not prosecuted when in fact they do not send their children to school.


Noel Pearson has talked about the success of a number of programs that have been developed in Cape York. He has talked in particular about educational scholarships for students to be educated, sometimes outside the community. The results with those programs and educational scholarships have been quite outstanding, and I think we need to very seriously consider whether this is something that the government should be looking very closely at.


Noel Pearson has also talked, significantly, about mutual obligation, about the culture of personal responsibility and about empowerment for the individual and for the community. I think these are the values that should be the touchstones that shape Indigenous policy now and into the future. 


It is very clear that an integrated approach to Indigenous policy is required. We need to look carefully at the way in which schools and education policy interact with broader employment and economic policy and with the health initiatives that are being put forward as well as at the support we provide to families in Indigenous communities. We all want Indigenous children and Indigenous people in this country to be equipped to participate fully in the many opportunities a country like ours has to offer.


We in the coalition have been particularly strong on these issues. While we might not always have been perfect in the response that we provided, we have made and will continue to make the hard decisions, such as the Northern Territory intervention, to tackle problems that we know exist, such as alcohol abuse and gambling. We will also continue to provide support to parents to get children to school and work with families and communities to remove hurdles that prevent school attendance. It is incumbent upon us as members in this place to break the cycle of expectation that young Indigenous people end up in detention and jail. We need to do this by attacking the problems at their core. We must do this together and as a matter of urgency.

Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham) (11:05):  I want to take the opportunity today to also contribute, along with the member for Higgins and others who have spoken previously, to the debate on this particularly important report, of June 2011, of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs that has been presented to the parliament Doing time—time for doing: Indigenous youth in the criminal justice system. I indicate the tremendous work that has been done by the committee and acknowledge Shane Neumann as the chair and Sharman Stone as the deputy chair of that committee. I note that the member for Durack is also a member of the committee and is here to participate in this debate.


Some reports are presented before this parliament that, I believe, are of such significance to the nation that all of us should engage with the report. I believe this is one of those reports. This particular report tells a story of our nation. It is a difficult one to hear and it confronts us with some real challenges. Sadly, they are not new challenges. The foreword of the report indicates that, in fact, it is 20 years since the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and, despite that report, over the time that has subsequently passed the incarceration rate of Indigenous Australians, including Indigenous youth, who are the subject of this report, has actually worsened. Sadly, Indigenous juveniles are 28 times more likely than non-Indigenous juveniles to be incarcerated, despite Indigenous peoples representing only 2.5 per cent of the Australian population. This is a state of affairs that I think requires the urgent attention of all governments, communities and people across this nation.


The report goes to great length and into great detail to outline the extensive social and economic disadvantage that contributes to the high levels of Indigenous contact with the criminal justice system. It is clear from the committee's investigation that there is intergenerational dysfunction in some Indigenous communities that presents a truly significant challenge of breaking that cycle of offending, recidivism and incarceration.


There is so much in this report that it would be difficult to encompass it all in a 15-minute contribution in this place. So I want to focus specifically on where we as a nation, sadly, sit in terms of these contacts and incarcerations. Secondly, I want to generally touch on some of those contributing factors and some of my own experiences in the field and then, finally, to talk about one local program in my area that I think is representative of the sorts of activities that can make a difference.


As I indicated, the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody came down in 1991. So this year, at the time of this report we are debating, we are 20 years down the track since that point in time. The committee drew together research and statistics gathered from state and national authorities. I want to indicate some of these to the House. I think they speak for themselves. Sometimes statistics can be a way of hiding the truth, as many have quoted the famous quote: 'Lies, damned lies and statistics.' However, I think in this case they actually illuminate for us very clearly the issue that we are dealing with.


The detention rate for Indigenous juveniles is 397, per 100,000. That is 28 times higher than the rate for non-Indigenous juveniles. In 2007 Indigenous juveniles accounted for 59 per cent of the total juvenile detention population, despite Indigenous people being 2.5 per cent of the total population. There is clearly a strong link between the disproportionate rate of juvenile detention and the disproportionate rate of adult imprisonment. Not surprisingly, if many of those adults being imprisoned are from Indigenous families then the flow-on impact on the children of those families sees an increase in their contact with the system and incarceration as well. At this time 25 per cent of all prisoners in Australia are Indigenous despite, as I said, being 2.5 per cent of the population.


Prison census data shows that between 2000 and 2010 the number of both Indigenous men and Indigenous women has increased markedly—Indigenous men by 55 per cent and Indigenous women by 47 per cent. When we comprehend how significant Indigenous women are to the fabric of Indigenous communities and to holding families together, from the increasing level of incarceration of those leaders in families and communities we can see why there are dysfunctional families with intergenerational problems and incarceration becoming a serious issue. Between 2000 and 2009 the imprisonment rate of Indigenous Australians increased 66 per cent. It is a really difficult statistic for us to get our heads around but, more importantly, it challenges us to say, 'This is something that we really need to seriously take on board to find strategies that work.'


Indigenous juveniles and young adults are much more likely to come into contact with police in comparison with their non-Indigenous counterparts. So the first point of contact is a place at which an important intervention can occur. In 2008 over 40 per cent of all Indigenous men in Australia reported having been formally charged with an offence by police before they reached the age of 25. That is 40 per cent of all Indigenous men.


Indigenous juveniles are overrepresented in both community and detention based supervision. Indigenous juveniles make up 53 per cent of all juveniles in detention and 39 per cent of all juveniles under community supervision. Importantly, they are younger than the average of those in the system. Twenty-two per cent of Indigenous juveniles in detention were aged 14 or younger, compared with only 14 per cent of non-Indigenous juveniles.


It should be also acknowledged—and the committee makes this important point—that the adverse contact with the criminal justice system for Indigenous people is not confined to their being offenders. It is also, sadly, the fact that they are more often than not victims of crime as well. In particular, they are more likely to be victims of violent crime than non-Indigenous people. The impact of that on communities is important to recognise.


Between 2006 and 2007 Indigenous women were 35 times more likely to be hospitalised as a result of spousal partner violence than non-Indigenous women. When we think of the impact of that on families and young people and the direct link between violence in families and engagement with the criminal justice system, we can see why there is such a problem. The committee acknowledged in its report that Indigenous victimisation rates are an important part of the problem that need to be addressed.


In 1991 the royal commission indicated in its report:


The more fundamental causes of over-representation of Aboriginal people in custody are not to be found in the criminal justice system but those factors which bring Aboriginal people into conflict with the criminal justice system in the first place ... [and] the most significant contributing factor is the disadvantaged and unequal position in which Aboriginal people find themselves in society - socially, economically and culturally.


Twenty years later that still stands the test of time.


The committee report goes into significant coverage of the particular aspects of disadvantage and overrepresentation of Indigenous juveniles among young offenders. They include the broad categories of social norms and individual family dysfunction, which I have touched on to some extent, and connection to community and culture. There are some very moving stories in the report which were told by Indigenous elders, who talk about their young generation being caught between two worlds. It is not that they are connected to one and not the other; it is not that they are connected to the traditional culture and are therefore not able to participate in modern society or that they are connected to modern society and have lost their traditional culture. Rather it is that they are lost between the two, which is the worst possible circumstance you could imagine for them.


The health implications are talked about in the report. In particular, it discusses the issues around drug and alcohol abuse. It not only discusses drug and alcohol abuse in the environments in which young people are present but also discusses abuse by young people themselves and the impact it has on bringing them into the justice system. The education issues are talked about—the challenges not only of keeping young people in general engaged but also and in particular the challenges of keeping Indigenous young people engaged, and the member for Higgins talked about some of those. The employment link is discussed—getting through education and getting a job is also an important indicator and more of a challenge for our Indigenous young people than it is for our non-Indigenous young people. Accommodation is also discussed—the challenges around providing safe and secure housing and a permanent and ongoing address and how significant that is for young people. I recommend that all members of our communities have a look at both those aspects of the report in some detail and the very important recommendations that are made in the report.


In the few minutes I have left, I will make some observations about a recommendation of the report which addresses police training and Indigenous employment. Included in recommendation 23 is a suggestion for, 'Incentives to increase the employment of Indigenous police men and women and opportunities for mentoring and police work experience for Indigenous students.' I think that would be a very worthwhile initiative. One of the saddest comments I ever heard when I worked for juvenile justice was from a young Indigenous man who was in detention. He was completing his schooling—he was 17—and was engaged in some volunteer work for local emergency services. He said that the worst thing in his life that he could imagine was being released from detention and being sent back to his family and community. He knew that that the dysfunction there was such that it would be very hard for him to resist falling back into the old ways that had got him into trouble in the first place; it would also mean that it would be unlikely that he could continue with either his education or his potential employment opportunities, which were occurring because of his engagement in volunteering activity. I thought that was this saddest thing that I had ever heard—that a young person could say to me with years of experience under his belt that he was better off in detention than he would have been in the community, and I think that that remains a challenge for us.


I want to acknowledge Project Murra in my own area of the Illawarra. This project is conducted through Warrigal Employment and began in 2008 as a partnership between the local commander of the police service in Lake Illawarra, the local TAFE and Warrigal employment. It is a particularly successful two-year program of school based traineeships with the police service which has now been extended to other emergency services and been done in conjunction with the HSC. It keeps young Indigenous people engaged in school and provides some real connections to the police and emergency services. It contributes to crime prevention because the community is connected to the police service. It also contributes to school retention and is an important employment strategy. The program has been going so well that the police service have continued with it and, indeed, it has been extended to other emergency services. The program has been supported and funded by the federal Department of Employment, Education and Workplace Relations and by New South Wales TAFEs as well as by the services. It is creating a much stronger relationship between those services and the local Indigenous community, and in the class of 2009 there were 12 students—three with the Wollongong police, three with Lake Illawarra police, two with Nowra police, three with the New South Wales ambulance service and one with the state emergency service. That is the current cohort, which is going through to completion now. Overall, it is a really good program which has multiple benefits: it is well regarded by the community, it is a great asset to the broader community and it increases the capacity for young people to be connected. I understand that one of the young people is at the police academy completing the degree, continuing their enrolment and engagement with the police service. That is a good local story, but a small one. We all need to be focused on doing far more to address the issues that have been raised in this very important report.

"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2011-07-06,"



Mr HAASE
 (Durack) (11:20):  As a member of the committee reporting on this issue in our report entitled Doing time: a time for doing, it is a pleasure to have the opportunity to make a comment. This report was the result of almost two terms of government. We carried on with this inquiry as a new committee in this parliament. That gave us the opportunity to reflect on the wealth of knowledge that had been accumulated by the previous parliament and add to that with our own fortes and, to a degree, preconceptions. From a personal perspective, I had my first association—which is ongoing—with Indigenous Australians when I first started school. A substantial part of our rural community was Indigenous. In those years, their welfare had been dreadfully neglected. That was prior to 1967.


The conditions under which those Indigenous people lived were to say the least Third World. But there were a couple of remarkable things about that era for Indigenous people in agricultural Australia. Certainly I can speak with first hand knowledge of my Shackleton and Bruce Rock area. Firstly, all children attended school regularly. There was much less mobility of parents in those days. The second thing that is important to note is that the greatest majority of the male heads of households—and please do not pull me up for being sexist; in those days, it was the male of the household who went out to work and put bread on the table—were gainfully employed, receiving a weekly wage and providing for their families.


The shocking thing is to contrast that situation and the situation that exists as the norm today. In this place, we have been discussing sporting and other programs that are funded to encourage Indigenous male youth specifically to attend school on a regular basis. I am speaking about the Clontarf program, which is now spreading across Australia, having emerged from the Clontarf Aboriginal Hostel in Perth, Western Australia. There is no doubt that it is instructive for emerging families today that there will be a circle of experience as an Indigenous person growing up, maturing, having a family and passing on in today's Australian society. Sadly, that circle is generally welfare dependent. It involves youth with the judicial system, then corrective services, then welfare, then the judiciary and then corrective services. The statistics that have been gathered in this report, Doing time: a time for doing, clearly indicate that anything that we have done in the past has failed to address the issue of recalcitrant Indigenous youth moving through a revolving door system of welfare and incarceration.


Rational people could only conclude that anything that we have done in the past is something that we should avoid doing in the future and that we ought to use this report as a foundation of knowledge on which to build a different approach to the problem. And it is a problem. You cannot ignore the fact that Indigenous people represent 2.5 per cent of the Australian population and the statistic that, of incarcerated Australian youth, 53 per cent are Indigenous. That is a statistic that you cannot find anything but horrendous and unacceptable.


So what is the solution? We have made 40 recommendations, and I would be a liar if I were to stand here and suggest (a) that the 40 recommendations will be adopted and (b) that, should they be adopted, the problem would go away. It is irrational to suggest that. The problem has been entrenched for far too long. But there is no doubt in my mind that the major cause of the problem—that is, revolving door incarceration—is lack of education on the one hand and the present societal acceptance that education will not be absolutely necessary for Indigenous youth.


We need to change the mindset of the Australian people. Indigenous kids have every right to education, as much right as mainstream kids. There is no difference in their intellect and there ought to be no difference in their treatment, yet we excuse the lack of school attendance by Indigenous kids. We turn a blind eye. We speak to state governments about the employment of truancy officers to make sure that Aboriginal families know that their children are not attending school and that something must be done about it because the cultural expectation is that children will go to school, and state government education ministers say, 'Well, there's nothing we can do about it.'


I believe there is something we can do about it. We ought to tie welfare payments to school attendance. I further believe that to not do so, and therefore to excuse Indigenous families from the responsibility of making sure their children attend school, if you analyse it and extrapolate, is certainly a denial of the human rights of those children. It could almost be compared with genocide, because we are guilty as parliamentarians if we do not enact laws that create outcomes for Australian citizens. We are contributing to an ongoing sin, and that is the denial of Indigenous children's rights. Everyone has a right to an education in this country, but if you are Indigenous we do not insist that you attend an institution. If you are mainstream, we do. Parents who do not send their children to an educational institution are brought to account. But if you are an Indigenous parent there would appear to be very active ignorance. We do not even expect it.


I hear employees of Indigenous agencies say: 'Look, there's nothing we can do. They're just Indigenous people.' I think that is horrendous—totally unacceptable. There is no reason why we should not apply the same rigour in our requirements at law to Indigenous people as we do to mainstream society, and part of that requirement is to send kids to school. It is a parental responsibility and it is accepted generally at law that it is a parental responsibility—unless you are an Indigenous parent, it seems. Then we turn the blind eye.


We need to change that. We need to work on a policy and even, dare I say, ignore political correctness. We have already done so much damage to the Indigenous population, their expectations and their role as part of mainstream Australian society. We have already done so much damage. Well-intentioned decisions resulted in the denial of opportunity, because we denied our responsibility of insisting that Indigenous families maintain the same culture as mainstream families and accept education as the norm. I can tell my colleagues here in this place that school attendance in Indigenous remote communities is not the norm; it is far from the norm. And it is accepted by all and sundry as being okay, because, 'Well, the parents had to drive 2,000 kilometres to attend a funeral and they were going to go for a week but they stayed for three months, and that is okay because it is culturally appropriate.' I do not accept that children should be denied their human rights on the basis of our current interpretation of what is culturally correct.


There is a far greater need today for tough love: the application of rigour in Indigenous funding programs and a change in the commonly held attitude that we will fund an Indigenous program but not really expect high performance and positive outcomes, because it is an Indigenous program. It looks to me as though this is perhaps not the actual situation, but I can assure you that agency after agency will say, 'We have got a program. We have got a bucket of money and we are moving amongst Indigenous communities and we are looking for groups to take up this funding. So, would you, or you or you perhaps take this funding responsibility on and deliver for your community, because it is going to have a very positive outcome.' People are almost coerced, as Indigenous individuals, into participation in programs that have been well-meaningly funded by governments of all kind. But at the end of the day there is very little expectation, and almost no audit, that the outcomes achieved by that funding will be positive. After the expenditure of the funding somebody says, 'Well, that provided employment for a period of time and circulated taxpayer funding for a period of time and therefore it must have had a positive outcome.' Well, it is not the case. My experience clearly indicates that this effectively creates a privileged position for those who are directly involved in the particular program, but in the rest of the community it creates a degree of jealousy. Then, when everyone observes that the program has achieved no positive outcome, the rest of the community in the future is not reticent when putting their hand up for a government funded program, so that they, too, can be part of it. And because they believe there will be no requirement for rigour and no actual audit, and no-one will be criticised if there is no positive outcome.


We need tough love in our communities. We need to remove our focus on political correctness and we need to focus on the necessity of positive outcomes. If that requires us to follow the path proposed by Noel Pearson, I say 'Let's do it,' because everything we have done in the past of which Noel Pearson, amongst others, is extremely critical has been a collective failure. Look at just one area: education. The most educated, employable, capable and responsible Indigenous members of my community, the seat of Durack, are those who were educated under the mission system. We are all very quick to criticise the paternalism of the mission education system and how teaching with an iron rod is not acceptable these days, but the individuals who were educated at Mogumber, Moore River, Mount Margaret, Karalundi and numerous other missions under a rigorous system got a good education, and they attended school. There was direct connectivity between school attendance and learning, the expectation and the welfare that was provided by the mission.


Having believed that I would speak a few moments only on this, I find that there is just so much to say. In these closing seconds, let me implore my colleagues on both sides of the House: something needs to be done. The stats are all there. The knowledge has been collected. We know that what has happened in the past is not solving the problem. Fifty-three per cent of the juvenile prison population are Indigenous, although they make up just 2.5 per cent of the general population. The worst possible result of this report would be that we once again do nothing.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (11:35):  I also rise to speak today on the report tabled by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs entitled Doing time—time for doing: Indigenous youth in the criminal justice system. This topic makes my heart break. It is 20 years since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, with its nearly 340 recommendations; but today, among Aboriginal communities, incarceration levels are even higher than they were then. In the words of Mick Gooda, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner:


… we've failed miserably in the last 20 years. 


Indigenous juveniles between the ages of 10 and 17 and Indigenous young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 make up a disproportionate part of our prison population. In fact, Indigenous juveniles account for 59 per cent of the juvenile prison population. They are 28 times more likely to be imprisoned than their non-Indigenous counterparts. According to prison census data taken between 2000 and 2010, the number of Indigenous Australians in custody has gone up by 55 per cent for men and 47 per cent for women—this at a time when the Indigenous population of Australia is only 2½ per cent of the entire population. Quite clearly, this is not good enough.


This report makes clear that the level of contact between our Indigenous youth and our criminal justice system is unacceptable; it is too high and it needs dramatic and drastic action. The impact of having such a high number of Indigenous youth in our criminal justice system has implications that are far and wide: implications for the family unit, for the broader community and for levels of school attendance—which in remote communities are less than 50 per cent—and, personally, for their subsequent employment chances and for the likelihood of their escaping the negative influences of substance and narcotic abuse.


We need programs that tackle the root causes of offences by Indigenous juveniles. We need to get the kids more engaged. We need to work with families. We need to create employment opportunities. We need to end the substance and narcotic abuse. We need an integrated, intergovernmental approach.


In this report, there are over 40 recommendations—recommendations that talk about engaging and empowering Indigenous communities in the development and implementation of programs; how to better integrate and coordinate initiatives by government agencies, non-government agencies and community groups; the need to focus on early intervention; and the need to engage Indigenous leaders, particularly elders. Those 40 recommendations contain some very important suggestions, including better funding for local mentoring programs and improving recreational and sport related activities, because such programs will offer Indigenous youth a better life and a better lifestyle; more gender appropriate accommodation for Indigenous youth, particularly housing plans that ensure they are better equipped when they leave detention; better funding for programs to deal with substance and narcotic abuse; and greater focus on mental health programs. Interestingly, the report recommends hearing tests for all children starting in preschool and training of police so they are more aware that the young people they encounter may have hearing loss. It also recommends incentives for school attendance, including breakfast and lunch programs. If we can get them to school, we offer them an alternative lifestyle to one spent in the prison system. Another recommendation is for teacher development programs to enable our teachers to recognise poor health in their students and to have a greater cultural awareness. This will help them engage with students who may have poor English language skills.


We need more incentives for employers to take on Indigenous apprenticeships. Interestingly and importantly, we need to raise the profile of the Australian Defence Force and provide recruitment opportunities among Indigenous youth. Norforce is a good example for many Indigenous youth, with their communities playing a vital role in the protection of our nation. Increasing employment opportunities for Indigenous men and women in the police force is another recommendation. Then there is the recommendation to establish and fund a national Indigenous interpreter service.


The Australian Institute of Criminology needs to do a more detailed analysis of sentencing options and outcomes for Indigenous Youth. They need to look into the use of diversionary options to determine whether there are alternative sentencing options other than incarceration for Indigenous youth. Critically, we have to examine the rehabilitation process. This report suggests assigning community service case workers, providing better counselling for substance and alcohol abuse and engaging the families of those who find their way into our criminal justice system.


Noel Pearson has written about a speech that a young 15-year-old Aboriginal woman named Tania Major gave in front of John Howard in 2003. She was from the Cape York Peninsula. In this speech, she told her audience, including the then Prime Minister, that she was the only student in her primary school class who went on to be successful. She was the only girl not to have a child at the age of 15 or before. She was one of only three children in her class not to become an alcoholic. Seven of her classmates had been in prison. Four had tragically committed suicide. She went on to get an education, including a university degree, and forged a new path for herself. If we get more Indigenous youth to school, if we lift the year 12 retention rates from around the 35 per cent or 36 per cent that they are today, if we get systematic help for those Indigenous youth in our prison system then we can have more achieve as she has done. In this report, there is mention of a study conducted in New South Wales that found that 90 per cent of Indigenous juveniles in the prison system tested positive to drugs, a remarkable statistic. If we show them the way through education and if we intervene to stop this economic disadvantage then we have a chance.


In conclusion, we must do better. We need to be innovative. We need to focus, as Noel Pearson and others have talked about, on the issue of personal responsibility. But we cannot leave people behind if they cannot help themselves. If Australians want to know what the true moral challenge for our time is it is Indigenous disadvantage and particularly, as we have learned from this report, the disproportionate and tragic numbers of Indigenous youth who are incarcerated in our jails today.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2011-07-06,"



Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (11:44):  I am very pleased to speak to the report Doing time—time for doing. I congratulate and place on the record today my deepest esteem for my parliamentary colleagues on the House Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs who have produced this report, particularly the chair, the member for Blair, the deputy chair, the member for Murray, and all of the other committee members.


It is quite tragic to be standing here today as a long-time member of parliament talking about the same things we were talking about 15 or more years ago. It is a tragedy that we still have to have a report that has to delve into these particular issues of Indigenous youth in the criminal justice system in Australia. It highlights the appalling overrepresentation of Indigenous youth in detention right around this great country of ours. While Indigenous Australians make up only a very small percentage of the population—about 2.5 per cent—25 per cent of prisoners are Indigenous.


Various members before me have spoken about the report, about the 110 submissions that were received and about the very important 40 recommendations that were made to government. My colleagues found during the inquiry that a disproportionately high number of Indigenous young adults are caught up in the criminal justice system. It is an absolute travesty in this day and age that we have this major challenge confronting us here in this place and in communities all around Australia. Indigenous youth are 28 times more likely to offend and be incarcerated today than at any other time since the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was released in 1991. One of my assistants in Queensland at the time worked on that particular report. The devastating stories that she would tell me haunt me to this day. It was her role to assist the commissioner in obtaining evidence. It is sad that we are here 20 years later and we still have this incredible rise in Indigenous youth in detention despite the work of numerous government agencies, hundreds of community organisations, community elders and many other active volunteers.


I had a business life before I came into this place. I taught at a university. One of my saddest regrets when I was teaching students in the business school at the Queensland University of Technology was that I never encountered one student of Indigenous nationality. I would have Chinese students and African students. I would have students from every corner of the globe, but never once did I have the privilege of teaching a student from an Indigenous background. It is really sad when we look at the dropout rates. Many of the speakers today have spoken about the horrific dropout rates and nonattendance at school. There are people who are much more knowledgeable than I about this. One of our whips here, the member for Forrest, has a large Indigenous community. Earlier on we heard from Barry Haase, the member for Durack. He has a large number of Indigenous people in his electorate. We really need to do a lot more here. Education is where it really needs to start.


Just a year or so ago I had an important project in my own business. I had a retail seafood business, and I recognised some outstanding qualities in our assistant manager, who was of Indigenous background. I decided that I would work with her to be the best assistant manager that she could possibly be. But you have to take a holistic approach. There were issues of lack of good nutrition and work standards that we addressed. I think that was probably one of my greatest failings as an employer. While we worked very, very hard to get consistent attendance at work and we worked on some of the social aspects that were affecting her life as well as the nutritional aspects and also the lack of educational opportunities that she had had earlier, I am sad to say that I failed in my quest because it was beyond me. As much as one can help in all of those areas, there are some cultural issues that are stumbling blocks, and we need to address those. They are stopping business people from achieving their best potential. One of my greatest regrets is that we could not go any further there and I sincerely wish her the very best in whatever she endeavours to do in her life. But literacy was clearly an issue with my assistant manager. Whilst literacy issues are higher in Indigenous populations, they will not allow Indigenous people to go on to further education and to be skilled in the best possible way. We need to really work on that.


The report that we are talking about today deals with contact with the criminal justice system. It presents a whole range of problems for Indigenous youth in Australia. The report highlights the sad fact that Indigenous kids are more likely to come into contact with the police and the criminal justice system than non-Indigenous kids. Once you get into that terrible cycle it is hard to break, and it is a self-fulfilling cycle. The report identified a link between the overrepresentation of Indigenous youth in the criminal justice system and social factors. We have to look at these much more seriously. We have to look at educational levels, as I mentioned just earlier. We have to look at levels of alcohol and drug use, hearing loss and all of those self-esteem issues as well. The combination of all of those things in Indigenous youth has led to the outcome of this particular report.


The report also recommended a host of activities designed to address these problems and to reduce the level of incarceration. I note particularly that there is a lack of a holistic approach. Just as I tried to take a holistic approach in my workplace, I think we need to do that. We need to have better pathways for Indigenous people out there in the community. We have to take an absolutely holistic approach if we are to address these issues. The 40 recommendations outline a very clear strategy for improving positive social norms. They look at things like improving education and addressing employment, health issues and housing. The report also outlined the need for improvement in government policy on police education and training. We need to have more Indigenous police officers. I welcome the fact that state governments have increased the number of Indigenous officers, and we in Queensland have led the way there as well.


Indigenous kids aspire to the same things as their non-Indigenous counterparts. They want a good job. They want to feel great about themselves. They want to spend money on things that they see on TV, just like other kids, and they want to spend money on themselves. They get frustrated sometimes at not being able to attain these things by legitimately being employed and sometimes, sadly, they turn to offending. They see that as the only way to address these same aspirations that we all have.


Much has been written and much has been said. Many speakers before me have highlighted this tragedy and many, many millions of dollars have been spent to tackle the problem, and yet the rate of incarceration continues to rise. There appears to be a lot of short-term funding. I am not knocking some of the programs—they are very good programs—but sometimes they do not get to fully achieve their aims because they are such short-term programs.


The report also noted that there is a lack of clear targets and outcomes in programs aimed at reducing youth in detention. I want to take this opportunity to highlight one program that has very clear goals and aims. I want to commend Project 10%, which was launched last month in my electorate of Brisbane. Unfortunately, due to parliamentary commitments in Canberra I was not able to be there, but I really follow the project with interest. While Project 10% was officially launched last month, it is the result of many years of hard work and many dedicated volunteers. Project 10% is a campaign aimed at reducing Indigenous incarceration rates by 10 per cent per year. This project recently won the community partnership awards in the Queensland reconciliation awards. I congratulate them wholeheartedly on this wonderful achievement. I want to thank everyone who is involved in that program. Project 10% was sponsored by McCullough Robertson solicitors and is a collaboration between ANTaR Queensland, Murri Watch and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women's Legal and Advocacy Service, ATSIWLAS. It is a community based project, has clear goals and is served by a group of amazing and willing volunteers. I applaud the work of Project 10%. 


I commend this report and its recommendations. It highlights that an incredible amount of work needs to be done in the areas of health, education, the intervention and housing, but it also highlights that we need to really try to reverse the terrible scenario of Indigenous incarceration in our legal system. I thank the committee for their very thorough and dedicated work on this report. I commend the report.
