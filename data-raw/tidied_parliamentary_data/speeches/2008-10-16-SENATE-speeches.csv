"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-10-16,"—We will not oppose that, but I do note with very great concern that not only will the cut-off not apply to this enormous legislation but there will be no Senate committee of inquiry, and I expect that the government will be justifying that process. Given the circumstances, we are not going to oppose the motion, but it does put enormous pressure on the Senate to handle very complicated legislation with an enormous impact on the nation. I want to register the concern that the Greens have that there is no consultation with the public, with business, with the sectors that are particularly involved in this process, and that, we submit, is not good parliamentary procedure. The government has a very serious responsibility here for any untoward effects coming out of this legislation because we are not going through the normal prudent process of a proper Senate inquiry into legislation of this magnitude.
—I table a statement of reasons justifying the need for these bills to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard. I note Senator Brown’s comments and thank him for his concurrence.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—

Purpose of the Bills

To introduce measures to protect depositors and policyholders in the event of a failure of a financial institution by making provision for a Financial Claims Scheme applying to general insurers and authorised deposit-taking institutions, and broader crisis management arrangements to enhance the options available and facilitate the management of financial institution failures.
The Bills implement recommendations of the HIH Royal Commission (2003), the Council of Financial Regulators (2005), the International Monetary Fund (2006) and the Financial Stability Forum (2008).

Reasons for Urgency

The Australian financial system is strong, well-capitalised and well-regulated, as indicated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.
In light of ongoing market turbulence and announcements made by other countries in recent days it is necessary to give confidence that Australian deposits are safe and to ensure that all available arrangements are in place for financial system regulators to deal with any distress that may occur in the financial system.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-10-16,"—I present the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs entitled Building trust: supporting families through disability trusts, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
It is with great pleasure that I present this report to the Senate. I am actually very pleased to be the one who is presenting the report to the Senate, because it was the Greens that referred this issue to the community affairs committee for inquiry—with very strong support from the coalition and the government, I will add.
The issue of special disability trusts is a very important one for the community, and for the disability community in particular. As we all know, the previous government moved to change the Social Security Act to enable the establishment of special disability trusts. Unfortunately, what has happened is that some fundamental problems have been built into the legislation that have prevented members of the community taking up disability trusts. While there have been a lot of inquiries to FaHCSIA about how to establish trusts, at the time of starting the inquiry only about 26 such trusts had been established. Some of the key things that have been blocking the establishment of these trusts have been, for example, the quite strict eligibility requirement, which has meant that a lot of people have been unable to set up trusts. As I understand it, those people with children who have intellectual disabilities in particular have had quite a bit of trouble setting up trusts. It is important to reiterate why these trusts are important: these trusts are so that parents can set up a financial mechanism to ensure that their children are looked after into the future after the parents have passed on.
Some of the things that have been preventing these trusts being set up are the eligibility criteria and the very strict limits on what the trusts can be spent on—for example, they are only to be spent on issues that relate specifically to someone’s disability. How can you separate someone’s general wellbeing and care from their disability?
Other issues relate to capital gains. The rules that operate for these trusts, for example, are quite different from the rules that operate for anybody else who is trying to buy their own home. For example, one of the key areas is to enable somebody to own a home under this trust. If a person with a disability whose home is owned through a trust needs to move and sells their home, they have to pay capital gains tax on it. However, if you or I want to move and are selling our homes, we do not have to pay capital gains. Those are just some of the examples of the problems with the trusts.
I am very pleased to say that the report makes a series of 14 recommendations. The last but by no means least important recommendation—or most important, for that matter—is that we change the name of ‘special disability trusts’, because people felt that calling them special disability trusts actually stigmatises the trusts. So we think we need to look at renaming them, to something like ‘disability support trusts’, for example, so it is clear what these trusts are about.
Some of the key recommendations of the report are: changing the eligibility criteria for these trusts and increasing the asset limit. At the moment the asset limit on the trusts is half a million dollars. That is not considered adequate in this day and age—I should point out that this is another unanimous report of the community affairs committee; we strive very strongly for unanimous reports in the community affairs committee—so we are recommending that the limit on the trusts be set at $1 million. We are also advocating that people do not have to pay capital gains tax on their homes in the trust. There are a set of key recommendations around that.
We are also recommending that what the trust can be spent on is broadened. We recommend:
… that the allowable uses of special disability trusts be expanded to include all day-to-day living expenses that are met to maximise the beneficiary’s health, wellbeing, recreation and independence.
This is a very important recommendation. As I touched on before, one of the problems that people have been raising about the trusts is the very limited nature of what you can spend the trust money on. We are saying that it needs to be for the whole of the person’s wellbeing—for their recreation, so that people can actually go on a holiday like able-bodied people can. Imagine if you could not go on a holiday—if you could not afford to go on a holiday. A person who is the beneficiary of a trust cannot use their money to go on a holiday. How ridiculous is that? So we are recommending that they be able to use the trust on recreation and—very, very importantly—independence. It is very important for a person to be able to use this money to enable their independence.
We also recommend:
… that unexpended income from a special disability trust be able to be contributed, on a pre-tax basis, to a superannuation fund for the trust beneficiary.
We think that is very important. There are also other issues. Would you believe that a person buying their first home with this trust cannot get the First Home Owner Grant, even though it is their first home? Yes, I see Senator Cormann looking at me, but a person trying to buy their first home through this trust cannot get the First Home Owner Grant. The committee think that is an issue of concern as well, so we are recommending that that also be changed.
There are other issues. If the trust earns a little bit of money and it is not expended that year, it has to pay the highest marginal tax rate. Again, we do not think that is fair, considering what we are trying to do here. It seems to me that, when setting up the trusts, we lost sight a little of the fact that this is to enable somebody to have a decent life and be supported in living with their disability. So we think that we need to relook at that to make sure that the trusts are really delivering for the purposes for which they were set up in the first place.
Just before I finish, I would like to very quickly acknowledge ex-Senator Kay Patterson, who established these trusts. She was the minister responsible at the time when we first started discussing setting up these trusts, and she put a great deal of effort into this. She presented very, very valuable evidence to the committee and is very, very keen to see the legislation amended to deliver what was intended in the first place. She was very clear that many of the things that she suggested were what the government at the time was trying to achieve. I would really like to acknowledge her contribution to the debate and her contribution to making these trusts work.
I strongly commend this report to the Senate and to the government. I beg the government, please, to take these recommendations on board now. I know they have the disability expenditure team and review looking at this issue, but we have looked at it. We know what we need to do. Please, government, take on board these amendments and recommendations now. Let us get this fixed so that this facility is actually delivering outcomes for people with disabilities and their parents and carers.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,15,1,speech
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2008-10-16,"—I rise to support wholeheartedly the comments of the Deputy Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, Senator Siewert, on the report Building trust: supporting families through disability trusts. It certainly was through her efforts that this inquiry happened at the rate that it did, and it was desperately needed. I would also like to thank everyone else on the committee for the work that was done and particularly the witnesses, who went to a lot of effort to be involved and to give us their thoughts in a very organised way. I am always particularly grateful when people with disabilities or the parents of people with disabilities can take the time from lives that are often very, very time poor to assist the Senate community affairs committee with its inquiries.
I feel that I was in a somewhat unique position with regard to this legislation. I was a member of the ministerial advisory council established by the then minister, Senator Kay Patterson, to guide how these special disability trusts would be established and the input around them. As Senator Siewert said, it would make a fascinating test case, I think, to look at what can happen to intentions between when they leave the minister’s desk and when they arrive as legislation somewhere else.
The ministerial advisory council was composed of people like me, parents of people with disabilities, experts in the field of trust law and public servants, so we had a broad coverage. We were very, very keen to make these trusts as workable and as easy to use as possible. Unfortunately, what we ended up with was very bound around, very constrained legislation that did not fulfil what were considered to be reasonable eligibility requirements, nor did it fulfil what were considered to be reasonable uses to make of the money. As Senator Siewert has pointed out, it was almost impossible for what we ended up with to be of any use, particularly to people with intellectual disabilities. All the allowable uses of the trust money, in the main, ended up being for care and accommodation. Certainly, if you needed specialised equipment or specialised medical services, you could probably use the trust moneys for those, but, if you were not sick but had a disability, there was very little you could do with the funds from the trust. In fact, we heard evidence during the inquiry of situations where the trust had bought a house, a home, for someone but then there was a quibble as to whether the trust funds could be used to purchase the refrigerator for that house because, of course, everyone needs a refrigerator—it is not relying on your disability to need a refrigerator. But where do those funds come from if they cannot come from the trust? We had something that was neither fish nor fowl.
The way this trust legislation ended up working was that it tended to simply reinforce the somewhat paternalistic attitude that governments over years and years have had towards people with disabilities. This was also bound around to ensure that people behaved themselves and that there was no room in there for anyone to behave in an independent fashion. I am always somewhat bemused by the fact that we can give people the dole without being too concerned that they are going to misspend it. We cannot do the same for people with disabilities. We hedge all their funds around because the first assumption—not the last assumption but the first assumption—that is often made is that those who care for people with disabilities will exploit and abuse them. I agree that people with disabilities are vulnerable and they do need protection, but the attitude that is often implied towards people with disabilities and their carers is that they are all out pretty much full time to rort the system. As I think most of us know that is absolutely not true, and we need to proceed with this matter urgently.
Senator Siewert pointed out that our very first witness was the former minister, Senator Kay Patterson, who pointed out that what had transpired here had certainly not been what she had had in mind in the first place. These trusts would, if our recommendations were accepted, allow people to have up to a million dollars indexed in the trust plus a primary place of residence. Senator Patterson was the one who pointed out the complete and total inequity which under our current laws says that if you do not have the intellectual capacity to own a home in your own right you are penalised for that by having to pay capital gains tax and other duties that no-one else has to pay on their own principal place of residence. This is not reasonable or fair, and we are recommending that that be one of the most urgent changes made.
When the trust laws were first put out, I travelled around sometimes with Senator Patterson telling people about what the possibilities of this trust were and you found that lots of parents and carers of people with disabilities, lots of people with disabilities themselves, were blown away at the prospect that they might have to find the limit you can have in the trust—which I think is $532,000 at the moment. People were saying, ‘There is no way known that I will ever have $532,000.’ No, it is ‘up to’ $532,000 and we took evidence that $200,000 would be a starting point for a trust. But then you run into the problem of how to save up that amount of $532,000—or we hope it will be a million. You cannot put it in the trust because unexpended income is taxed at the very punitive 46½ per cent rate, so you cannot save it in the trust. If you save it outside the trust you create the situation where you will come to fail the income and asset tests applying to people with disabilities. So again we would set it up as a catch-22 that did not assist people with disabilities.
These changes to the special disability trusts are very positive if we can have the principle accepted that, irrespective of your ability to own your principal place of residence in your own name, it should not be subject to capital gains tax. If we accept the principle that people who receive the disability support pension meet those criteria and are eligible to take on the trusts, we will vastly improve the situation, as we will if we accept that this money can be used by the trustees to build a good life, irrespective of what that means. I am not quite sure why we are always not quite so concerned about people with disabilities having good lives rather than okay, average, bread and butter, never anything more lives. There seems to be almost a punitive attitude in some areas towards people with disabilities enjoying the sorts of things that everyone else has a right to enjoy. The way these trusts need to function is to see them almost like a form of superannuation for people with disabilities. We do not object to superannuants having the capacity to have a bit more than people just on the pension. I do not see why we cannot apply it to this situation and I would support Senator Siewert in pointing out that getting this legislation through and changing these trusts so they are taken up by families is urgent.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,15,1,speech
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2008-10-16,"—In rising to speak to this report on disability trusts by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs I would like to reflect on the effectiveness of how the committee actually operates. I am not a full member of it; I am a participating member. In my experience, it is a true model of how cooperation can actually make great outputs and a meaningful difference to people’s lives. The members of the committee take their responsibilities very seriously and they work very hard at working together to get the very best possible outcome. One of the issues that the committee deals with is disabilities. They have done so in this report in talking about special disability trusts and working to get an outcome that could potentially make an enormous difference to the lives of the tens of thousands of Australians who do it tough and for the carers who look after them and who are concerned for the future of those with disabilities. We have to recognise that in dealing with disabilities we have to do things better. Governments should continually strive to deliver better services and make available greater options to those who are living with disabilities and their carers.
Special disability trusts will have a continuing and growing importance in how we manage the affairs, the flexibility and the options of those who are affected by them or who could benefit from them. They were a great idea—introduced by Senator Patterson—whose time will come. The initial legislation that was introduced does need to be changed to reflect an enhanced or more beneficial outcome, and that is really what this report does.
The committee have worked very effectively. Their approach to this matter was outstanding. All the witnesses and committee members are passionate about making a difference in the lives of those with a disability and ensuring that we can provide the best possible services for them. The recommendations, as has been canvassed at length by Senator Boyce and Senator Siewert, deal with such important issues as accommodation. We have gone to great lengths in the coalition government, but also I acknowledge it is the Rudd government’s intention, to make sure Australians can still own their own home and stay in their own home when they can. The committee want that option to be available for those with a disability. We need to make sure that they benefit from the same sorts of tax benefits or benefits that other Australians do, and particularly where there may be an inequity such as where their assets are controlled through a trust structure like a special disability trust.
The other important thing is that the committee have recommended that compliance be reduced for these trusts. We have based this on the assumption that people do the right thing most often. They want an effective outcome. We should not be looking for the needle in every haystack; we should be assuming that people are going to do the right thing. Through a not onerous but rigorous compliance regime, we can ascertain where any malfeasance occurs. I commend the committee on this report. I think they have done an outstanding job, and I urge the government to enact these recommendations. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

There seems to be almost a punitive attitude in some areas towards people with disabilities enjoying the sorts of things that everyone else has a right to enjoy. The way these trusts need to function is to see them almost like a form of superannuation for people with disabilities. We do not object to superannuants having the capacity to have a bit more than people just on the pension. I do not see why we cannot apply it to this situation and I would support Senator Siewert in pointing out that getting this legislation through and changing these trusts so they are taken up by families is urgent.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2008-10-16,"—In rising to speak to this report on disability trusts by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs I would like to reflect on the effectiveness of how the committee actually operates. I am not a full member of it; I am a participating member. In my experience, it is a true model of how cooperation can actually make great outputs and a meaningful difference to people’s lives. The members of the committee take their responsibilities very seriously and they work very hard at working together to get the very best possible outcome. One of the issues that the committee deals with is disabilities. They have done so in this report in talking about special disability trusts and working to get an outcome that could potentially make an enormous difference to the lives of the tens of thousands of Australians who do it tough and for the carers who look after them and who are concerned for the future of those with disabilities. We have to recognise that in dealing with disabilities we have to do things better. Governments should continually strive to deliver better services and make available greater options to those who are living with disabilities and their carers.
Special disability trusts will have a continuing and growing importance in how we manage the affairs, the flexibility and the options of those who are affected by them or who could benefit from them. They were a great idea—introduced by Senator Patterson—whose time will come. The initial legislation that was introduced does need to be changed to reflect an enhanced or more beneficial outcome, and that is really what this report does.
The committee have worked very effectively. Their approach to this matter was outstanding. All the witnesses and committee members are passionate about making a difference in the lives of those with a disability and ensuring that we can provide the best possible services for them. The recommendations, as has been canvassed at length by Senator Boyce and Senator Siewert, deal with such important issues as accommodation. We have gone to great lengths in the coalition government, but also I acknowledge it is the Rudd government’s intention, to make sure Australians can still own their own home and stay in their own home when they can. The committee want that option to be available for those with a disability. We need to make sure that they benefit from the same sorts of tax benefits or benefits that other Australians do, and particularly where there may be an inequity such as where their assets are controlled through a trust structure like a special disability trust.
The other important thing is that the committee have recommended that compliance be reduced for these trusts. We have based this on the assumption that people do the right thing most often. They want an effective outcome. We should not be looking for the needle in every haystack; we should be assuming that people are going to do the right thing. Through a not onerous but rigorous compliance regime, we can ascertain where any malfeasance occurs. I commend the committee on this report. I think they have done an outstanding job, and I urge the government to enact these recommendations. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-10-16,"—These bills, the Financial System Legislation Amendment (Financial Claims Scheme and Other Measures) Bill 2008, the Financial Claims Scheme (ADIs) Levy Bill 2008 and the Financial Claims Scheme (General Insurers) Levy Bill 2008, have been brought before us in order to establish a financial claims scheme to provide an unlimited, explicit guarantee for bank deposits. It is probably fair to say that most people in Australia had a reasonably based assumption that there was already in place at least an implicit guarantee that their bank deposits, particularly with the major banks, were guaranteed. But these bills contain significant mechanisms to both maintain and build confidence in Australia’s financial system. Australia does have a depositor protection scheme in place whereby authorised deposit-taking institutions must have in place assets held in Australia equal to or more than the deposit liabilities that they have. Depositors in this country also have first claim to the assets of an authorised deposit-taking institution. But in these uncertain times greater assurance is required, particularly to assure depositors with institutions other than the big four banks that their deposits are safe, because authorised deposit-taking institutions also include building societies, credit unions and so on.
I think it is fair to say that Australia is in a far better position than many other countries to withstand the shocks from the financial crisis. We have heard that assurance given repeatedly over the past days and weeks. Our financial system is safer than many and we are therefore better prepared than most other countries to withstand the financial crisis. I have to say, however, that that does not result just from luck. In fact, the soundness of Australia’s financial system reflects some 10 to 12 years of responsible economic management and the application of targeted and carefully calibrated financial principles by the previous Howard government.
Australia’s financial institutions have served the economy well and continue to do so. The Reserve Bank is keeping an eye on inflation and providing systemic stability to underpin our entire financial system. Senators will recall that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, which was set up in 1998 by the Howard government as a result of the Wallis inquiry recommendations, provides careful prudential supervision that perhaps is not present in some overseas systems. The supervision is of a systemically important kind. It supervises institutions such as authorised deposit-taking institutions and life and general insurance companies. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission is providing oversight of corporate law. It has been called on recently to make some judgement calls in relation to the issue of short selling during the month of September. And the Australian Treasury oversees policy development and forecasting at both macro and micro level. So these institutions interact and coordinate to ensure that our economy does have strong prudential regulation and supervision, and their roles are complemented by the competition regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
These institutions were, as in the case of APRA, created or, as in the case of others, had their mandate strengthened by the coalition when in government, and I think we can be confident that the measures contained in these bills will be competently administered by the appropriate one of these institutions, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. In the highly unlikely event that an Australian institution collapses, these bills will provide depositors with the security that their funds will be available to them in a short period of time. The guarantee will apply for three years to all deposits in authorised deposit-taking institutions. The scheme will also provide compensation to eligible policyholders of general insurance in the event of a failure by a general insurer. Finally, the bills strengthen APRA’s ability to manage a distressed authorised deposit-taking institution, general insurer or life insurer should that be required. In addition, the two related bills provide for the imposition of a levy on authorised deposit-taking institutions and on general insurers in the event of the activation of the Financial Claims Scheme in relation to the failure of an ADI or general insurer.
However, there are some risks with these bills that need to be addressed by the government, in our view. While we do support the bills—and I stress that—we also recognise that there are risks in providing such a guarantee to depositors. As with all areas of government, the bills require careful analysis and will require prudent management once they are passed. While the bills before us have been under consideration, it would seem, for some months, the idea of a financial claims scheme has now considerably changed in scope from the original capped scheme which proposed a limited explicit guarantee of $20,000. That was about timely access to at least some funds in the event of a failure to meet deposit liabilities rather than ensuring that the entire deposit was covered and available in a short period of time.
I believe that the government should be upfront and should acknowledge in the debate here today that the speed with which these greatly changed bills have been brought forward does mean that analysis available to the government for decision making has been hurried—to put it at its mildest. The opposition has had even less information, I am sorry to say, and less time to consider that information than the government, so there are a number of unanswered questions. Lest it be said that the opposition is quibbling about this package, I want to make it perfectly clear that it is our job, and I think the taxpayers of Australia would expect nothing less than us at least flagging some of the concerns that we have had in looking very quickly at these bills.
There has, as I understand it, been a limited briefing from representatives of Treasury and the government, but there are a number of issues which need to be watched very closely, and critical information is still required. The public and those financial institutions that are affected by these bills, both those that are included and, more particularly, those that are excluded from its coverage, are largely in a position of simply having to trust the government on this one. That is never a comfortable position to be in, and there are some unanswered questions about those institutions not guaranteed. The answer to it, no doubt, is that, not being regulated by APRA, it is very difficult to supervise and some of the institutions not covered are in fact very small, but there are some legitimate concerns that will need to be addressed by the government in relation to those not guaranteed, including cash management trusts, property and share trusts and mortgage trusts, just to mention a few.
In the House of Representatives there has been a debate about the significance and importance of having the government level with or come clean with the Australian people and provide publicly and through the parliament a full statement of the information and analysis that the government has received on the important decisions that it has been taking over the past couple of days. The $10.4 billion package announced on Tuesday, which I want to bring up, has been designed to act as a fiscal stimulus for the Australian economy, but there has not been very much information surrounding the announcement of that package. There was a press release and a statement by the Prime Minister and no doubt other public statements, but none of the serious accompanying material that you would expect—no Treasury papers or advice and no revised forecasts. In the circumstances, we think that all the usual advice, data and information that you would expect to see supporting the announcement of a $10.4 billion spend should be forthcoming and made available forthwith.
I also want to raise the major issues relating to protection of the taxpayer. We want some information about what is going to happen with guarantees offered to banks in respect of wholesale term funding, which are enormous sums of money borrowed from international markets and may result in losses by banks being transferred to the account of the taxpayer. Our main motivation here in raising these issues is the protection of the taxpayer. In the House of Representatives and the Senate information has been sought about that. We have asked questions about whether there will be additional prudential supervision requirements and what the conditions will be of providing a guarantee of this kind. The Prime Minister could have provided the parliament with a substantive answer or simply said that they are still working on the detail, which we would have appreciated. But we got a very indignant response, and that has been reflected here in the Senate with responses to questions about the package and the bills that we are looking at today.
The wholesale term guarantee must be structured in such a way that there is an exit plan, because, as John Stewart, the Group Chief Executive of the National Australia Bank, apparently said only a few days ago, the real challenge would not be getting banks to apply for these guarantees and to pay the fee—and of course termination of the fee is a critical issue—but getting them off it. Mr Stewart described it, perhaps a little bit inelegantly, as getting them off the government teat, but his point is valid and well taken. It is a major issue because we do not want to get into a situation in which unsustainable practices by banks are in effect supported and continued by virtue of a Commonwealth government guarantee.
It is of course an answer—and this answer has been given—that APRA will keep an eye on it, but the flaw with that is that APRA, as the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and the Treasurer know very well, is not constituted to act as an investment adviser for the Commonwealth of Australia. When the Commonwealth gives a guarantee of this kind, it is actually on the hook. It is taking on board very substantial contingent liabilities. It can charge a fee and it should charge a fee and the fee should be a recognisably commercial fee. But nonetheless it is in this instance proposing to take on a considerable risk. This is something, in the opposition’s view, that will need additional, heightened and very careful supervision.
Just going back to the package that was announced a couple of days ago: when you look at the magnitude of this, it is going to halve the budget surplus. Unfortunately, we feel concerned that the information that underpins this package is simply absent. When questions have been asked that must, on any view, be legitimate—such as questions about the revised economic forecasts and the information that the government must have had in order to announce a package of the magnitude of $10.4 billion—we have received, I think, a disproportionate reaction of confected outrage that we should be so impudent as actually to want to know what is fundamentally critical and important information.
I would say to the government and to Senator Sherry, who is going to respond in short order, that one of the reasons why we think it is legitimate to ask these questions is that we have wanted to take a very responsible position in relation to these bills in terms of taking the government on trust, but there are concerns in the minds of the public. Senator Sherry was on this side of the chamber not long ago, and he would no doubt remember and be well aware of the fact that members of the public contact senators to voice their concerns. We wish to be in a position where we can allay concerns in the minds of the public. I would have thought that that would be an aim that is consistently held by the government as well as us. These are responsible inquiries and ones that we intend to pursue in the interests of our constituents, the taxpayers of Australia.
These three financial bills of course are no exception in terms of our wanting to know the underlying information. They have not been subject to the normal scrutiny. There is no regulatory impact statement. We have called on the government to prepare a clear statement of the costs, benefits and risks of this policy to government, to the financial sector, to businesses and to the public. In such a statement, we are of the view that it is essential that the government recognises that this scheme will change the way in which institutions behave. It will create new incentives and disincentives to authorised deposit-taking institutions and insurers and their customers, and they will act in ways different to the way in which they have acted in the past. So analysis and effective supervision by government will certainly require it to be alive to the increased risks from the moral hazard involved in these arrangements, and it must ensure that they are minimised.
The government has set an expiry date of three years for this scheme to operate without a cap—that is, with an unlimited, explicit guarantee for deposits. To have an expiry date of three years for the scheme to operate without a cap, there really must be—and we urge this once again in respect of both of these large packages—a credible and workable exit strategy. If Senator Sherry is able to tell us what that is, we will of course be listening intently. It should be devised now, and then reviewed at appropriate intervals between now and the expiry date. We cannot see that there is currently an exit strategy and we think that is a glaring deficiency.
I had a look at the Treasurer’s second reading speech, and I think another important aspect about it—as I said when I addressed some earlier remarks to the wholesale term funding guarantee—is that, although he talked about an interaction, at this stage there is virtually no information about that, about whether it needs legislation. I also call on the government to make such information available.
We understand the need for a concerted effort to ensure Australia withstands the impact of the financial crisis, but the coalition, like the Australian public, should not be left in the dark wondering what the information is, what advice the government has had and what has been the real catalyst—given the forecasts and the International Monetary Fund’s recent report—to take this action. We have said we will support these bills, but we insist that in the interests of transparency the public receive better information.
We have cautioned the government in respect of some of the concerns that we have been able to identify in the short time that we have had to consider these bills. We think that there are still many matters that need consideration and more information. As I said a little earlier, it is important to take the Australian public with the government on this, so I call on the government to level with us and level with the taxpayer, to give us the detail and information we need so that we can be assured that this level of regulation, this extraordinary intervention, the content and scope of these bills, will achieve the desired effect. The government should give us whatever information it has at its disposal that it has not yet shared with the rest of us.
Finally, I want to say that we will not be supporting the second reading amendment that Senator Bob Brown will move. In the time remaining, I will briefly state a couple of reasons. There is no doubt that a lot of executive salaries have been way over the top, especially in the United States, but no-one is suggesting that our banks have been mismanaged or that excessive salaries have contributed to financial problems in Australia. I think it is important, ultimately, to remember that salaries are set by boards of directors and shareholders of companies. Institutional shareholders such as superannuation funds could no doubt be a bit more vigilant in their scrutiny of executive remuneration, but the responsibility lies with shareholders. There has to be some end to what interventions are going to be run in respect of financial institutions. I think talking about wars against greed, and other vague comments might make for great headlines, but it is not going to really do anything to ensure that our financial institutions operate in a better way.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SYSTEM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FINANCIAL CLAIMS SCHEME AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-10-16,"—Let me express at the outset the greatest disquiet about the process that is taking place here. These bills, the Financial System Legislation Amendment (Financial Claims Scheme and Other Measures) Bill 2008, the Financial Claims Scheme (ADIs) Levy Bill 2008 and the Financial Claims Scheme (General Insurers) Levy Bill 2008, are to guarantee deposits in banks, other financial institutions and insurance companies and to transfer that responsibility across to the taxpayers of Australia. Whatever other arguments we might put forward about the better management of such institutions in Australia compared to the United States, the legislation comes out of a real concern by the government that one or other of these institutions might fail, leaving depositors out of pocket and leading to a run on other institutions, with the inevitable consequences that flow from a situation not unlike that which we are seeing in the United States, where overnight yet another bank was mooted to be on the verge of failure. This whole process comes from the neo-liberal and conservative view which has prevailed not just in recent decades but right through the last century that small government is good government, that government should get out of the way and that financial institutions and big business in general should be able to run the market because the market knows best. I have heard that expressed in second reading speeches in this place just in the last month or so. This is the view that in a democratic system the interests of the majority of the people are best served by allowing those who are wealthiest to effectively run the financial system. It has been demonstrated yet again how wrong that is.
I accept Senator Coonan’s observation that regulation is better in this country than it is in other countries, and that includes some of the regulation brought in during the Howard government years. But the fact is that with this legislation before the parliament today we are seeing that it is not enough to guarantee that there will not be a bank, insurance company, or credit union failure in this country in a situation where the American system has gone belly up. All the assurances going right back through history that the market knows best are again being found to be patently wrong. We are now seeing the fix up, the ambulance, arrive in the form of this legislation before us and similar legislation in other countries around the world, simply because the culture of greed has threatened the wellbeing of millions of people and their deposits, not only in this country but right around the world.
It is quite extraordinary how successive parliaments, under great pressure I might add from sections of the media and vested interests, will not respond to the greater need of the public over those vested interests, which lobby so patently in this place and in parliaments elsewhere around the world. For those who missed it, I would point to John Kenneth Galbraith’s great book The Culture of Contentment, which is one of the many books of this great economist’s output over the last century—he recently died, bless him. I read this book in 1992, and it nails the failures of the democratic system to deal with greed, which has the inevitable outcome he was predicting and which we are now seeing unfold around the world. I would just take one quote from page 5 of this book, where John Kenneth Galbraith is referring to testimony before congress in the 1930s. He says:
Testifying before a Senate committee, the American Banker J.P. Morgan—
note the name—
warned, ‘If you destroy the leisure class, you destroy civilisation.’ Asked later by reporters to identify the leisure class, he said, ‘All those who can afford to hire a maid.’ For Morgan the threat from Washington was no casual concern: ‘The family of J. P. Morgan used to warn visitors against mentioning Roosevelt’s name in [his] august presence—
that is, Morgan’s august presence—
lest fury raise his blood pressure to the danger point.’
And we all know about Roosevelt’s New Deal to deal with the depression that was caused by people like Morgan back in the 1929-30 crash. Galbraith goes on to say:
It is now generally accepted that the Roosevelt revolution saved the traditional capitalist economic system in the United States and the well-being of those whom capitalism most favoured. By adaptation the anger and alienation were diminished, and economic life became more stable and secure. This would not have happened had those who, on the full maturity of time, were saved and most rewarded had their way. If in the election of 1932 they had been fully aware of what was to come, there might well have been no salvation. The energy, money, public concern and propaganda that would have been released in that year by a full knowledge of the impending changes could well have assured a Roosevelt defeat.
Galbraith is saying that whether you have the Democrats or the Republicans in power—read the Labor Party or the coalition in Australia—the democratic system is so nobbled by the big end of town and the culture of contentment that if it is accepted that rich people have a special wisdom to run the economic system then that will lead repeatedly to a failure of the financial system in the way that we are witnessing yet again in what many analysts are describing as the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression itself.
I was born in 1944 and I was very alert to the world in the 1950s. I remember very clearly the swaggies on the road around Australia in the early 1950s as a result of the Great Depression and then the war coming afterwards. We never want to see the country back in those circumstances. But here we are looking at the real possibility of massively increasing unemployment in this country, failure of small businesses and, as this legislation so obviously puts it, the potential failure of major financial institutions, unless government guarantees are given to them in 2008.
I want to comment about a couple of matters in the limited time we have here. I note at the outset that there are three speakers on this bill. Here are three of the most important pieces of financial regulatory legislation that we will ever see before this place in our tenure in this parliament. Here is one of the great financial crises that needs to be analysed and for which we need to understand the causes, to go to them and have them explained to the parliament and to remedy the failures of those who have caused it, and we have got only three speakers on this legislation. This legislation went through the lower house yesterday in one day, and there will be no Senate inquiry. There will be no going out to seek the opinions of economists, let alone people whose deposits are inherently—because the legislation makes it clear—potentially at risk, and that is all Australians in one way or another. And there will be no going out and getting the opinions of people who have already lost money—ask the superannuants—because of the financial crisis caused by the greed, self-invested contentment and the nobbling of democracy by those self-empowered in Wall Street who, by extension, have tens of thousands of lobbyists in Washington with prodigious lobbying power.
We have had the inanities from the Reaganites, from President Reagan, then Prime Minister Thatcher—much admired by former Prime Minister Howard—who wanted to put a brake on democracy, in the interests of people generally, in regulating the excesses of the rich. Instead of that, we have got a truncated debate here today and we are going to be giving a guarantee to the banks, but we are not going to have the government’s analysis of why there needs to be a $10.4 billion package added to this guarantee and an analysis of the root cause of the problem, because the big end of town will not want too much of an expose on that.
I have been looking though today’s Financial Review and to give it its credit, it has done quite a lot on exposing the obscene rake-off by executives who should know better and should have a greater social conscience in this country. Let me state this from the outset: whether or not you say they are important jobs that need good pay—and I am not going to quibble with that—I ask anybody in this chamber to explain how, in an age where the Prime Minister is on 300 and something thousand dollars a year and works very hard as the chief executive of this country, these bankers and other CEOs who are on multiples—and I am talking about 10 or 20 or 30 times the Prime Minister’s pay—justify the rake-off that they are getting. These screen jockeys have been so willing to up their own take-home pay to levels that simply cannot be justified.
We have Babcock & Brown’s chief, Phil Green, with remuneration of $22.1 million and a share price fall of 94.5 per cent. NAB’s John Stewart’s remuneration is $8.8 million and the share price has fallen 37.2 per cent. And when I say ‘share price fall’, we are looking at people losing 20 per cent—some say six, some say 10 and some say 20 per cent—of their superannuation or their investments from which they are making ends meet. These people are being hurt. Every time you look at a fall, there are people suffering economic hardship in our community in much greater numbers than the executives I am talking about. ANZ’s Mike Smith receives remuneration of $12 million and the share price has fallen 33.7 per cent as of yesterday. Macquarie’s Nicholas Moore’s remuneration is $19.2 million. How could you justify anybody in Australia talking $19.2 million out of the public pool, because that is what it is—this is everybody’s money and that is $19.2 million going to somebody whose institution has had a share price fall of 54.3 per cent? And so it goes on: CBA’s head gets $8.7 million; St George’s Paul Fegan gets $3.5 million; Westpac’s Gail Kelly gets $8.7 million.
I therefore put it to the Senate—and I am sorry to hear it being dismissed already by the coalition—that this is a very belated time, but the proper time, for some sort of curb to be put on these excesses. The Greens have spoken about it and I have spoken about it in this place repeatedly over the years, but it seems like you are actually attacking the institution of Australia by talking about curbing these obscene payouts. And now it is shown as being nothing of the sort. In a ‘fair go’ Australia, it is something that goes right against the fabric of this country and its sense of a fair go. These people cannot justify this executive rake-off no matter which way you look at it. You cannot justify it against any decent parameter that might be brought forward.
Prime Minister Rudd has now said that he is going to get APRA to do something. He has cut funding to APRA in his general slash of the Public Service because that is what the big end of town thought would be a good thing in the run to the last election. He is going to ask APRA now to come up with some sort of formula to regulate these CEO obscene payments, but not more than that. What he intends to do is then ask the international community to adopt whatever APRA comes up with and, if they do, then Australia will. This is a rerun of the Howard idea that, yes, we will respond to climate change but we will not do it until Baluchistan or, rather, Kazakhstan does. We will wait till everybody else does it.
So I can see here the Prime Minister has got a very neat mechanism for saying, ‘I am going to deal with these CEO payouts, but not now.’ Sure, we will shore up the banks, and you know what that does. It gives a guarantee to these banks which will enable the chief executives to ensure that they get a payout greater than if that guarantee did not exist. So it is actually going to feed into them being able to claim a bigger salary than they would otherwise get and they do not have to, any longer, provide the guarantee. Ipso facto, it means that they are not quite so constrained in the decisions they will make in the coming three years. So we provide the guarantee and they will be able to use that to argue to get a bigger salary than they otherwise would have gotten. No doubt the salaries are going down but they are going to remain totally out of whack with the value of a CEO as against another citizen. I am not ashamed to say that that means other citizens who are making bricks, who are policing our security, who are teaching in our schools and who are nursing in our hospitals. Why should these people be on less than 100th the take-home pay of the CEO? Justify that if you can; I cannot.
It is time that this obscenity was hauled in by a Prime Minister acting now. He can act to guarantee the banks; let him act on these CEO wages. That is why, on behalf of the Greens, I have an amendment here to cap these wages at $5 million or at 10 times the base wage of the Prime Minister, whichever is the lesser—I can tell you it is the second that is the lesser—as at least a defined measure here and now. If the bank, the insurance company or the financial institution is going to get this public guarantee—that means taxpayer backed-up guarantee—then let them quid pro quo take at least some rein in on the extraordinary wealth that they are unfairly draining out of the Australian financial system, and that means out of the pockets of fellow Australians in 2008.
We also read Geoff Winestock’s piece in today’s Financial Review that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has had to delay the updating of some of its rules for banks because of the extra workload in the financial crisis. Now listen to this:
The delay comes amid questions over why APRA’s expenditure fell and its staff ceiling was lowered in the federal budget in May.
David Rush, APRA’s general manager policy development, said in a speech in Sydney last month that APRA had identified the need for new “liquidity management requirements” for banks this year.
Months ago they identified the problem coming down the line but they could not do anything about it because their funds had been cut. By who? By Prime Minister Rudd, who sacked 3,000 public servants when he came in. They were not the top ones, mind you—the Howard public servants are still advising him—but out went other public servants. You cannot have a prudential authority dealing with the problems of this country if you have cut its funding by one, two, three or four per cent. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Lindsay Tanner, says if APRA required further resources they would of course receive them. The message to Mr Tanner is: they do require it. The Prime Minister wants them to look at executive salaries, for example. That will go on the backburner, I can tell you, unless they are given the wherewithal, and that applies to other authorities which are there in the interests of the average Australian in containing some of the excesses of the corporate sector.

",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SYSTEM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FINANCIAL CLAIMS SCHEME AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-10-16,"—I rise briefly to support the comments made by Senator Coonan and to state that the National Party also has a concern about the non-quantifiable depth of this contingent liability on the Australian public purse. We do not know nor has Treasury provided any figures on exactly where this liability ends. I think it is extremely important that Australia does know where this liability ends because of the ramifications that it could have on everything from our surplus to exactly what our future planning and future budgetary requirements are. We feel that Treasury has either been completely and utterly remiss in what they presented to the Australian public by way of the parliament for its perusal or they have not presented anything, and many of the decisions that are coming out now have been made on the back of an envelope.
What we do also have a concern with and what we think should be strongly considered is not so much that there should be a cap on where executive salaries go but that the executives should be fully aware that if they are buying a product that is underwritten by the Australian taxpayer then they should be very considerate about exactly what their own personal drawings on those institutions amount to. There are so many issues that one should consider and, without prescribing any measure, they should have a look at where our nation’s CPI is going and where their salaries are going and, if there is a great divergence between the two amounts, how they justify that to the Australian people, considering it is the Australian people now that are underwriting their institution.
It is not obligatory that they buy these products that underwrite the banks; it is their option to buy them. It is a free choice they make to buy these products and to underwrite them. But when they do, because we have no firm idea of exactly where the liability ends, they should be very considerate about how they act. We in the National Party hope that this process is expedited as quickly as possible. We are fully in support of making sure that we keep a structure in the Australian economy that fulfils a purpose of providing security to the Australian people.
We have huge questions every day not about whether there should be a package but about the competency that has gone into the construction of this package and the extent, form and substance of this package, because we cannot get the details of the extent, the form or the substance beyond what seem to be arbitrary ideas presented with arbitrary numbers. It is a package that uses up over half of our nation’s surplus, yet we cannot get fully informed disclosure from Treasury about exactly where this comes from.
There will be requirements on our nation in the very near future such as unemployment and other infrastructure. At that point in time we are going to need the money again and we cannot spend the money twice. There is no asset being put in place which will allow for further selling to redeem money used for other purposes if the extenuating circumstances of a recession are brought upon us. We will have to just live with the memory of exactly where the current package went. In supporting our banking structure, we realise it is absolutely essential that we have a liquid financial situation, a competent credit situation and that the Australian people are not put at a disadvantage by factors around the world that have forced this onto us.
I will close with two issues. First, sooner or later we are going to need a competent and detailed analysis of exactly where the underwriting of this contingent liability leaves the Australian books. Second, we call on the executives of the major banks to bear in mind that, on the purchase of this guarantee product, they are benefactors of the public underwriting of that process and they should have a close examination of exactly where their salaries go as compared to where the CPI goes.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SYSTEM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FINANCIAL CLAIMS SCHEME AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-10-16,"—Family First supports the Financial System Legislation Amendment (Financial Claims Scheme and Other Measures) Bill 2008, the Financial Claims Scheme (ADIs) Levy Bill 2008 and the Financial Claims Scheme (General Insurers) Levy Bill 2008 that guarantee bank deposits and insurance coverage for ordinary Australians. These are important measures to give the Australian public confidence in the banking and insurance industries in these difficult financial times. Family First is concerned that there is no time to properly scrutinise these bills but, given the urgency of the issue, Family First is to make a special exception to the expectation that such important bills should go to a Senate committee before being considered.
Family First is disappointed that these bills do not address the important issue of executive salaries. In the United States, for example, the rescue package passed by the congress included restrictions on executive salaries. I understand there is some difference between this package and the US but it is important that we should also be including restrictions on executive salaries. Executive salaries need to be competitive but they also need to be reasonable. This is an opportunity for the government to tell fat cat executives with outrageous salary packages that it is time to get off the gravy train, that the train will terminate here and to mind the gap.
At a bare minimum, we should be looking at the salaries of chief executives and considering things like ensuring bonus payments cannot exceed the company profit result for the year. If profits are up by one per cent bonus payments should not exceed that one per cent. Also salary packages should not exceed the company’s capital increase for the year. So, if the capital increase was one per cent for the year, bonus payments should not be above that one per cent. In addition, early termination payments must not exceed company profit results for the year or should not exceed the capital increase for the year. These are termination payments when a company has failed and when it is quite clearly trying to get rid of an executive. Another measure when corporations fail is that maybe we should be thinking about whether bonus payments in excess of, say, five per cent of the base salary for the preceding two years are repaid. A lot of times, when a company fails, it knows two years beforehand.
Executive salary packages for CEOs should be transparent and be reported in a standard way on company websites with changes updated within seven days. They should not just be reported at the end of the year and buried in some sort of report but be reported within seven days of the change. Also, looking at CEOs, they should not have stock option plans unless the employees receive a share of the firm’s profit as well. Family First will be pursuing and pressuring the government to stop extravagant executive salaries. Fat cats, you are on notice—the gravy train has stopped.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SYSTEM LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FINANCIAL CLAIMS SCHEME AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2008-10-16,"—I would like to thank the senators who have contributed to this debate on the Financial System Legislation Amendment (Financial Claims Scheme and Other Measures) Bill 2008 and related bills and for their acknowledgement that, due to the extraordinary times, the debate on this legislation—which is an extraordinary package of measures—has been constrained. Due to the urgency of this matter, the time frame for passage of this legislation and the extraordinary nature of the measures, there has been an understood approach that the debate and the normal Senate processes that would have been considered appropriate—for example, referral to a Senate committee—have been constrained to less time than would normally be given to much of the other legislation that we have to consider.
I think it is important to briefly summarise why we are at this point—and it is not just the Australian parliament but also a number of other legislatures around the world that are at this point. Much has been made, rightly, of what is known as the US subprime crisis. I think it is important to look briefly at why this occurred. Whilst I think that most Australians are familiar with the term ‘US subprime crisis’ and the fact that the financial crisis in the US system is spreading to other countries, with the potential for significant if not catastrophic consequences for some other countries, I do not think that the fundamental cause is particularly well understood. The fundamental cause of the crisis in the United States was the unfettered, unregulated, unsupervised distribution of mortgages to people who, on any reasonable assessment, could not afford to continue those mortgage payments. That was the fundamental cause. Between five and six million Americans were not so much mis-sold—that is a pretty conservative description—but conned into purchasing mortgages that they could not afford or, under any reasonable circumstances, could not continue to pay once they moved off the introductory or what is known as the ‘honeymoon’ rate. In the United States, you had sales forces doorknocking and telephone canvassing millions of American households, saying and doing anything to effect the sale of a mortgage product. There was no supervision and no regulation of these practices at all in the United States. That was the root cause of the problem that has now infected the US financial system and the financial systems of many other countries.
These mortgages were bundled together and securitised as ‘assets’ into various financial instruments with varying values—hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in value—to underwrite these mortgages that could not be repaid. Financial institutions participated to varying degrees in this process and then onsold these assets and passed them on to other financial institutions. They appear as assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions, and some were passed through to banks in Europe.
One of the other great failings of this process was that of the credit ratings. Agencies classified these assets with a triple A rating. That means that the chances of an asset that was worth, say, a hundred billion dollars decreasing in value were next to zero. It would be very unlikely to be reduced in value and, if it did drop, it would be slight. What happened? These assets have collapsed in value. Whilst it is very difficult at any point in time to assess the real value, they have collapsed. Some of them are worth zero. Some of them have gone from being worth $100 billion down to $1 billion. They have collapsed in value because the rating agencies fundamentally failed to assess the totality of the risk in these products. What is the consequence? The financial institutions that held these assets have been lending out against the value of the assets which have collapsed. They have been lending out to small businesses and to retail customers in a variety of other forms—not just as mortgages but as business loans, for underwriting credit cards et cetera. So you had these fundamental flaws in the US financial system, and this has been the cause of the problem. In turn, I think it is now 25 banks that have either collapsed, have been nationalised or have been forced into merger in the US, in the UK and in some other European countries.
The process of the collapse of these financial institutions has created worry, fear and uncertainty, because the financial markets take a view—along with consumers—that if one bank collapses and then another one collapses and then another one collapses—and there have been 25 in the last six months—when will it stop? Other financial institutions that are safe and prudent get worried that, if they lend money or enter into financial transactions with another financial institution, what if it collapses? Effectively, the oil that ensures the smooth running of the economy is being removed from the system. If you remove the oil from a car, you know what happens to the car—the whole thing seizes up.
These are very, very unusual times. We have global financial market turmoil of historic proportions. I cannot recall turmoil in our financial system of anywhere near the level we have now over the last 20 years, and I think some of the commentators who have referred back to the Great Depression are correct in their observation. We have not seen the extent of this turmoil other than what occurred in the Great Depression. The Great Depression was not caused by the collapse of stock markets; it was caused by the collapse in confidence in financial institutions and their inability to lend because of the collapse in confidence. That is what caused the Great Depression. I have to say that, having been born in the 1950s, I never witnessed or went through the Great Depression, but my father did. He would tell me some of the consequences of the Great Depression. I suppose that people of my generation or younger would never have believed it possible that those events could possibly occur again.
One of the fundamental reasons we are dealing with legislation like this is that we have learnt some lessons from the Great Depression. We have learnt that, in extraordinary times, it is necessary for governments to intervene quite directly in the markets and financial sector in a variety of ways to prevent the circumstances of the Great Depression ever occurring again. It was the failure of governments, particularly in the US, when the Great Depression arrived, to intervene quickly and effectively, to minimise the collapse that occurred. Senator Brown referred to Roosevelt. The great difficulty that Roosevelt presented was that he was elected President after the crash, after the depression started. He was not in a position, because he was not the President, to actively intervene to minimise the causes of the Great Depression. Roosevelt, as effective a President as he was—he was a great President—was acting after the event, catching up with a whole series of measures over the decade of the New Deal, to reinvigorate the American economy and the world economy with a whole raft of measures after the collapse occurred. So governments have learnt that, at least to the extent that you can, you intervene in a timely fashion, effectively, quickly and with extraordinary measures in extraordinary times. This measure represents such an approach.
The turmoil we have seen in global financial markets has the potential to undermine confidence in Australia’s robust financial system. Our financial system is strong. If you compare our banks, our credit unions, our building societies and our insurance companies with those oversees, particularly in the US and the UK and in some European countries, our system is strong. We have had no failures of financial institutions during this period of turmoil in Australia. We have not had any failures because our regulator, APRA, have maintained strong, vigilant oversight, regular reporting, prudential oversight, regulation and control of those financial institutions that they oversight.
The current difficulties in assessing funding in global credit markets are not a reflection of investor concerns relating to Australian institutions, but they are more a general lack of investor confidence in the global financial system. Confidence is fragile. A decline in confidence or mass panic is pretty frightening to behold when it occurs, and we have seen some of these elements in other countries in the last year. When confidence is fragile and we have the failure of a number of large international institutions, that in turn is not just reflected in those institutions in the ways I have described, but it leads to a significant effect on global equity share markets and it is also reflected in elevated spreads in international and domestic funding markets. These are the factors that have led to the unprecedented actions being taken by central banks and governments in a variety of ways around the world.
As I have said, Australia’s financial institutions remain profitable and well capitalised. They do not have the significant exposures to troubled US and European financial institutions or to troubled mortgage related assets. There have been some comments about executives and their pay, but at least executives and senior management in Australia exercised the good judgement and sound sense to largely avoid—with a little at the edges in a couple of cases, but really at the edges—the sorts of exposures that we have seen in US and European financial institutions. This was recently confirmed by the IMF in its Article IV report and by the RBA in its Financial stability review. Nonetheless, Australia is not immune from these very disturbing and worrying developments in international financial markets. Given the broad reliance on financial institutions in undertaking day-to-day economic activity, the ramifications of financial institutions’ distress and current international events are significant. Although confidence in the Australian banking system remains sound, it is prudent to put in arrangements to maintain this confidence and to align Australia’s response with international developments.
One of the great difficulties in this set of circumstances is that we know that our financial institutions are sound and well regulated here. But in other countries, when they adopt responses as a consequence of their local environment and, for example, offer guarantees to financial institutions, it does have an impact here in Australia, despite the soundness of our financial institutions, if we do not offer a guarantee in some particular form. The government, in conjunction with Australian regulators, have been taking steps to strengthen the resilience of Australia’s financial sector in the face of current challenges. So we have a strong system which we are making stronger, and this is one of the measures to do that.
The government has adopted other measures. For example, in my area we are transferring the regulation and supervision of all financial products—we are talking here about bank cards, credit cards, business loans, investments, payday lending—which are currently regulated by the states and territories into one national financial regulatory system. The complex web of financial regulations in the US was another key reason behind the current circumstances they face.
The Financial System Legislation Amendment (Financial Claims Scheme and Other Measures) Bill 2008 introduces unprecedented action to deal with developments in global markets and to ensure stability for Australia’s financial system. The bill will improve and strengthen Australia’s crisis management arrangements and gives effect to the Prime Minister’s announcement last Sunday that the government will guarantee the deposits in Australian banks, building societies, credit unions and locally incorporated foreign subsidiaries for a period of three years. The bill also introduces the Financial Claims Scheme. In addition to the FCS, the bill introduces a number of other measures that will enhance and strengthen Australia’s regulatory framework.
There are some issues of detail. I accept that Senator Coonan and others have raised some matters. But we have an independent regulator, APRA, which together with Treasury is well capable of handling the issues of detailed implementation that have been raised.
I do want to say something about APRA funding. APRA funding has not been cut. Some people should check the facts. The government excluded APRA from the efficiency dividend and did not cut their funding. A decision taken on 18 April, which was disclosed at the Senate May estimates—and I do not criticise senators for not all fronting up to APRA at estimates—was such that their funding was not cut. The efficiency dividend was not even applied.
With respect to the consumer regulator, ASIC, I have just announced a package of additional funding of approximately $70 million over four years. And, no doubt, if APRA believe that they need additional funds as a consequence of additional responsibilities, both directly given to them or alternatively because of additional workload, they will make a request for funding and we will consider that in supplementary budget estimates.
I will go to the other two points quickly. Even though we are dealing with this legislation quickly and expeditiously—and, as I said, I thank the Senate for that—the overall consideration of these policy issues does actually go back a long time. In fact, it goes back as far as the HIH royal commission in April 2003. The APRA submission to the HIH royal commission said with respect to insurance companies:
We believe it is appropriate that the existing arrangements for the protection of policy holders be reviewed and consideration be given to the establishment of a formal compensation mechanism. This is ultimately a matter of government policy.
A study of financial systems guarantees led by Professor Davies in March 2004 provided a recommendation to government. So the concept of guarantee in aspects of a financial system goes back five years.
We could spend a great deal of time on this, but my other comment is with regard to the amendment to be moved by the Greens. I point out that what we saw in the United States was excessive salaries and bonuses that were often—not always, but often—paid as a result of failure. We have not had failure of Australian financial institutions. With some of the so-called bonus share arrangements in the United States we saw appalling behaviour by executives who knew the institution was going to go under, sold off their shares and the poor old employees who held shares—often in their pension fund, which Australian law does not allow, fortunately—were left holding their shares that had crashed in price, either directly or through their pension funds. The executives got out before the company collapsed, because they had insider knowledge. Australian law does not allow that sort of behaviour, fortunately. But the Prime Minister has advocated fundamental reform in this area. (Time expired)

Leave granted.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-10-16,"—by leave—I, and also on behalf of Senator Xenophon, move Greens amendments (1) to (6) on sheet 5625:
(1)    Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (line 15), omit “$75,000”, substitute “$70,000”.
(2)    Schedule 1, item 4, page 4 (line 21), omit “$150,000”, substitute “$140,000”.
(3)    Schedule 1, item 4, page 4 (line 21), omit “$153,000”, substitute “$143,000”.
(4)    Schedule 1, item 7, page 5 (line 7), omit “$75,000”, substitute “$70,000”.
(5)    Schedule 1, item 8, page 6 (line 14), omit “$150,000”, substitute “$140,000”.
(6)    Schedule 1, item 8, page 6 (line 14), omit “$153,000”, substitute “$143,000”.
These amendments change the threshold limit to $70,000 for singles and to $140,000 for couples. In moving these amendments, I think it should be understood that the Greens and Senator Xenophon have entered into a dialogue and an understanding that we want to see changes made. The Greens never believed that the $50,000 threshold was an adequate threshold and we believe that a move to $70,000 as a single threshold is a step in the right direction. Having said that, we are extremely pleased that we are going to be using AWOTE or tying the threshold to an earnings indexation. We are also, of course, extremely pleased that the government accepted our original amendments to ensure that the threshold was indexed and that the AWOTE indexation method will be used in order to index the threshold.
This will deliver benefits to a quarter of a million Australians at a very important time in Australia when families and singles need help, and it will also ensure that this threshold is now keeping pace, finally, with indexation from when this measure was first introduced in 1997. Having said that, we also seek assurance from the government that, as the government has stated previously, there will be no negative impact on the public hospital system and that they will look at any negative impact on the public hospital system. My next amendment deals with the review mechanism that will facilitate that.
We understand and we hope that the government accepts these new threshold levels. We all believe that we have moved substantially in order to achieve an outcome that we can all live with. I said to somebody last night that the Greens are used to consensus decision-making processes and are pleased that we have been able to reach a level of consensus. It would be fair to say that nobody is entirely happy with the outcome in terms of my stated position, which has been that the Greens do not support the rebate in the first place and we do not support a surcharge. But this is a significant step in the right direction.
We are very pleased that the government has agreed to indexation and has agreed to the AWOTE indexation mechanism, and that will have very clear regard for any impacts on the hospital system. We have been working very hard to ensure that there are no negative impacts on the public hospital system. We believe that, in the long term, this will result in a stronger public health system in Australia. That is at the bottom of where the Greens are coming from. We are strong believers in a strong public health system, and we believe this is a step in achieving that strong public health system.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE THRESHOLDS) BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2008-10-16,"—Bad public policy does not become good public policy just because you water it down. This measure was bad public policy when it was introduced on budget night. It was exposed as bad public policy during the Senate estimates process and it was exposed as bad public policy during the Senate inquiry. This after the government was telling us that we were economic vandals for insisting on some proper scrutiny of a measure that was going to push up the price of health insurance premiums, including, and in particular, for older Australians. They said it was going to put additional pressure on public hospitals, it was going to see up to a million Australians leave private health insurance and it was going to take billions of dollars out of the hospital system.
We were accused by the government of economic vandalism for insisting on some scrutiny. Of course, the Senate estimates process and the Senate inquiry exposed all of those fundamental flaws. What we have seen over the last couple of months is nothing but a farce. We have seen a government that has been focused on political horse-trading rather than on what is good public policy. We have seen a government that has absolutely not been focused on what is in the best interests of our health system but has been trying to come up with a grubby deal somewhere in a dark back room to see whether they can save some face after they were exposed for not having thought through the implications of what it is that they are proposing.
The government had not done its homework. They came up with a measure to double the Medicare levy surcharge for singles and to increase it by $50,000 for couples and families. When we asked them what the impact was going to be on public hospitals and what the impact was going to be on older Australians who save their money every year to be able to afford their private health insurance premiums, they were not able to answer. They had not even asked Treasury or the Department of Health and Ageing to do any assessment, any modelling or any sort of costing whatsoever on what the impact on those Australians would be.
This measure, if it is successful today, will force health insurance premiums up for 10 million Australians, including one million Australians who earn less than $50,000 per year. These are one million Australians earning less than $50,000 per year who every year make the sacrifice and do the right thing by our health system by taking additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs by taking out private health insurance. Will they get a tax cut, Minister? Will those people earning less than $50,000 per year who continue to take out private health insurance get a tax cut? The answer is no. So here we are: we were talking about providing a tax cut for some people over here who are not prepared to take out health insurance but we are not prepared to give a tax cut to the one million Australians earning less than $50,000 per year who continue to do the right thing and who continue to take out private health insurance.
I received an email this morning from Mrs Judie Kearney-Wilkins. I will read this email because it really sums up what the fundamental problem is with this legislation.
Please seriously consider your vote on this. I am a disability pensioner who has NO choice but to have private health insurance as my primary medical condition cannot receive treatment in the public health system (Qld). Along with my husband who receives the Carer’s Pension, we are raising twin 4 year old boys. The possibility that these changes could lead to people dropping their insurance & premiums becoming even more expensive is VERY troubling. I find it offensive that people earning $50,000 cannot afford the levy if they do not have insurance. What about the MANY pensioners paying it with incomes much less than that! Our COMBINED income is $22,000.
This is from Mrs Judie Kearney-Wilkins from a town called Zillmere, which happens to be in the electorate of Lilley, and this lady is a constituent of the Treasurer, Wayne Swan. The Treasurer would be well advised to listen very carefully to the concerns of his constituents in Lilley. The crux of the matter is that this policy measure will force premiums up for people like Judie Kearney-Wilkins. The day people cannot afford to pay their premiums anymore because this measure has forced them up by another five to 10 per cent is the day those people will have to join long public hospital queues.
The reality is that the government have been flying blind on this. Very clearly, if the government had looked at the very eloquent statements made by then Senator Graham Richardson in 1993, when he made a terrible assessment of the impact of 10 years of Labor health policy by putting his finger on what these sorts of measures would do to our health system, they would have understood the impact that these sorts of measures would have on Australians on low and fixed incomes. They would have understood what this sort of measure does to our public health system and they would have understood that this is not the right direction to go in.
Watering down bad public policy does not make it good public policy. Any policy that will force more people into the public system and that will see more than half a million people leave private health insurance is bad public policy. Any policy that will see up to $3 billion in hospital funding walk out the door because the government is quite happy to see more than half a million people leave private health insurance is bad public policy. I have been saying all week that it is time that somebody reminded the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, that she actually is the minister for health. She is not the Assistant Treasurer. Again yesterday, health minister Nicola Roxon said that delivering this tax cut was especially important given the need to stimulate the economy.
We provided tax cuts that did not have a negative impact on the health system. Year in and year out the Howard-Costello government provided tax cuts and I will tell you the impact that had over the 11 years we were in government. A person earning $50,000 per annum on 1 July 1997 had a take-home pay of $35,898 per annum. As a result of our tax cuts they now have $5,102 per annum more in take-home pay. That is a $5,102 tax cut to people earning $50,000 per annum. For someone on $75,000 per annum the take-home pay as a result of tax cuts has increased from $49,148 to $58,500. That is a tax cut of $9,352 per annum. These are the sorts of tax cuts that the government should be pursuing. We are all in favour of lower taxes but not when it means having disastrous consequences for our health system. These are disastrous consequences that the government was too lazy to even properly assess. They were either too lazy or they did not want to know the answer. It is bleedingly obvious that if you put in a policy that is going to see more than half a million people leave private health insurance it is going to put pressure on premiums and it is going to put additional pressure on public hospitals.
Yesterday on ABC radio the minister for health did not even know what she was talking about. She was trying to tell the Australian people that about 400,000 people would leave private health insurance. The reality is that if she had looked at her own cheat sheet that had been circulated to the media she would have known that it was actually 583,000 people that were going to leave. I have not seen any information circulated on what the impact of this particular amendment is going to be. How many people is it going to affect? Five hundred and fifty thousand? Five hundred and thirty thousand? I hope that the government is at least going to tell us that. What is going to be the fiscal impact of this measure? How much money is the government going to be expected to save as a result of not having to pay the private health insurance rebates to those people that they expect will leave. That is the sort of information we need so that we can assess how much money this government is happy to see walk out of our health system as a result of chasing more than half a million people out of the private health system.
Over the last four months we have witnessed an absolute disgrace. Instead of focusing on good public policy, instead of focusing on how, as a government and as a parliament, we can ensure that Australians can have timely and affordable access to quality hospital care, instead of focusing on how we can encourage more people to take additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs by taking up private health insurance, we have seen a procession of deals and counterdeals. The government are not focused on how we can improve our health system but are focused on spin and on political rhetoric. They are focusing on an ideologically driven war on the private health system. Just call it what it is. Stop talking about tax break rhetoric. This is not about a tax break. If you wanted to provide a tax break you could find many other ways of providing it. This is about undermining the balance in our health system.
This is about going back to what Labor did between 1983 and 1996. Those who cannot learn from history are forced to repeat it. This is exactly what is happening. When the then Senator Graham Richardson, in 1993, put out his discussion paper, he was stunned. He said that in 1983, when Labor made those changes and introduced Medicare, they thought that some people would leave private health insurance. We are hearing exactly the same language now—’Some people will leave.’ Never mind that it became 485,000 people or that it became 644,000 people. ‘Oops. We did not remember that there were children involved.’ Never mind that industry experts estimated that it was going to be up to one million people or that you have not even gone out of your way to properly assess the impact of this.
Professor Deeble is hardly an apologist for private health funds. He is hardly somebody that can be said to have a vested interest on behalf of health funds. He said that the government should have done proper modelling to assess the impact on public hospitals. It is a no-brainer. If you take $2.9 billion out of the health system—because that is the amount of contributions that will go out the door as soon as those people leave private health insurance—of course you have to assess how that will flow through to the public health system. Of course you have to come up with a way of compensating the states and territories for the impact of this, and of course you should have worked with the states and territories to ensure that the impact of a measure like this is properly assessed and properly managed.
This government, when in opposition, pursued this mantra: ‘We’re going to end the blame game.’ ‘The buck stops with me,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘We’re going to be in this new era of cooperative federalism on health.’ This measure shows that that was a complete fraud. Not for one minute did the Prime Minister think that. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, are setting up the states for failure with this measure. They have flagged: ‘If the states can’t get their act together in sorting out those waiting lists, we’re going to come in and take it over.’ You are setting up the states for failure. How can the states address the serious issue of excessive waiting times, excessive public waiting lists, if you take $2.9 billion out of the health system without providing any proper compensation? And do not talk to me about this $600 million package. I explained yesterday in this chamber why that was a fraud. Do not talk to me about the infrastructure fund, because putting funding into infrastructure, as good as it is, will never, ever fund one additional treatment service. That is the reality.
Over the last couple of months we have seen a government which is not interested in good, sound public health policy. We have seen a government that has reverted back to type. We have seen a government that always hated private health. In the lead-up to the election, Labor was trying to keep the issue quiet, trying to make people believe: ‘Yes, we’ve stopped our war against private health. We’re no longer the Labor Party of the 1980s. We’re no longer the old Labor. We’ve moved on from our ideological battles of the past. We’re no longer the caucus-ACTU working party’—which essentially shot then Senator Graham Richardson down in flames when he wanted to introduce a Medicare levy surcharge because he could see that this was what was needed to restore the balance in the health system.
Essentially, you have committed this big fraud on the Australian people. You never told them before the election that this is what you were going to do. You introduced this measure in the budget. It was exposed as being fundamentally flawed during Senate estimates and during a Senate inquiry. None of the changes that have come before this chamber make enough of a positive difference for this to actually work. We will not support the amendments moved by Senator Xenophon and the Greens. We absolutely deplore the way the government has handled this. It is irresponsible. It will put significant pressure on the most vulnerable in our community—the one million Australians who will continue to take out private health insurance and who earn less than $50,000, the one million Australians who are doing the right thing by our health system by putting additional resources into our health system to the tune of $2.9 billion.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-10-16,"—It is not too late for Senators Fielding and Xenophon and the Greens to strike a blow for the health system in Queensland. I know none of them come from Queensland but I beg of you: understand the situation in Queensland. I want to enter this debate again today to highlight the situation in Townsville. A front-page story in the daily Townsville Bulletin revealed that the Queensland government has a secret plan for what is needed for the hospital in Townsville: a $700 million extension to the public hospital. But the Premier of Queensland, Anna Bligh, went to Townsville last weekend and, with great fanfare, announced that she would be commissioning extensions to the tune of $100 million. That is $600 million less than what is currently needed in Townsville. If this amendment goes through, that situation will be further exacerbated.
Could I just indicate the statistics for the Townsville Hospital. This hospital serves a major provincial city of some 200,000 people. It is a five-year-old hospital. It was built to replace an existing hospital and it has fewer beds than the previous hospital. The corridors of the hospital are now as full as the wards. Patients are actually in beds in the corridors. They are now closing down some administrative rooms in the Townsville Hospital to put beds in. It has been revealed that currently at the Townsville Hospital the total number of overnight beds, day surgery beds, chairs and trolleys is 516. That is what we currently have at this major provincial hospital.
Before the last election Anna Bligh promised 586 beds. So they are 70 beds short of what was promised just a year or so ago by way of an election commitment. But the third statistic is that Townsville Hospital actually requires 918 beds. Currently we have 516 beds. We were promised 586, but we need 918 beds in Townsville Hospital alone. I say to Senators Xenophon and Fielding, imagine what this amendment will do to the Townsville Hospital alone. Forget about the hospitals in Mackay, Cairns, Mount Isa and Brisbane—and I am sure that all the hospitals in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales are in the same boat. I can speak from experience of the critical situation in Townsville Hospital, yet this amendment will exacerbate the problems with what is already a crucial and critical hospital system. I see Senator Heffernan is here. Will you be talking about hospitals in New South Wales?

Senator Heffernan interjecting—

—Every day in the papers there is a report of a crisis in hospitals in New South Wales. I am sure someone will mention them; I will not go into it. I plead with the Greens: it is not too late to try to help the people of Townsville and North Queensland with this one hospital. I could go into every hospital up my way and tell you that they are already overcrowded. There are critical bed shortages and they are getting worse. But if you put these amendments in, things just have to get worse again. I can understand why the Labor Party would do this. They cannot manage money. They have to increase taxes, which is the hallmark of Labor governments. I understand that. They are very bad money managers. We only have to look at the last 10 months to see how pathetic they are at managing money and managing the economy. But I cannot understand why the two Independents and the Greens would want to make the public hospital system in my state of Queensland and my city of Townsville so much worse than it currently is. I plead with the Greens: please do not do this. Reject the amendments so that the already critical situation in places like the Townsville Hospital will not get worse.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE THRESHOLDS) BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2008-10-16,"—Senator Macdonald has raised a matter on behalf of Queensland. I want to raise a matter which will also affect New South Wales hospitals. It goes to the very heart of the actuarial assumptions behind the levy and behind the fees charged by private healthcare organisations. It is the commercialisation and monopolisation of cancer susceptibility genes like BRCA1 and BRCA2. As the government knows—and it does not know what to do about it—the ASX announced on 11 July that Genetic Technologies Ltd had made a commercial decision to enforce the rights granted to it under an exclusive licence from Myriad Genetics in America. What this means is that all laboratories testing for breast cancer in Australia—and prostate cancer will follow because there is a patent out there on the gene technology—are going to be centralised and monopolised. I wonder what effect that is going to have on the actuarial assumptions behind this levy? Senator Conroy is scratching his head because the government does not know the answer to this either.
Genetic Technologies Ltd said in 2003 that they would give this patent to the Australian people. They are now going to enforce the patent on the Peter MacCallum institute in Melbourne and, to avoid litigation, they want all the Peter MacCallum institute’s testing done through their laboratory. A spokesman for the Auckland District Health Board—and I would like the government to explain this in view of the actuarial assumptions behind the levies—said:
The Australian government had told the MacCallum clinic—
that is, in Melbourne—
to continue testing and had promised it would be indemnified for any dispute over the intellectual property rights of this gene technology.
I will not take up the time of the committee much further. My question is: has consideration been given to the long-term implications of giving non-protein, as well as protein, gene patents to private companies around the planet? In Canada it has doubled the price of testing. In America, Myriad have gone into ultimate wide screening at a huge impost on the cost of health care. In the specific case of BRCA1 and BRCA2, the cost of the tests will affect every woman in Australia who has breast cancer. I think it is a disgrace. The government ought to have the guts to say, ‘We’re not going to tolerate this,’ and do something about it, given that Genetic Technologies Ltd said in 2003 they would give it to the people of Australia and New Zealand and are now, in a monopoly situation, going to charge them. It is a disgrace.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE THRESHOLDS) BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2008-10-16,"—I have just a couple of questions of the minister about the impact of this amendment. What is going to be the fiscal impact, in terms of the expected savings, of not having to pay the private health insurance rebate to people whom the government expects will leave private health insurance? What is going to be the impact, in terms of revenue, of not collecting the Medicare levy surcharge from those who no longer will be caught by it? What is going to be the impact on private health insurance premiums, moving forward? What is your expectation of future additional increases to private health insurance as a result of this measure?

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-10-16,"—I rise to indicate that the coalition supports the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002. Like so many of the tax bills that have come before the Senate this year, the origins of the content of this bill lie in the hard work undertaken by the Howard government when we reformed the Australian tax system. This bill seeks to update and improve the tax agreement that Australia entered into with South Africa in 1999. South Africa is, of course, Australia’s largest trading partner in Africa. With Australia exporting $2.5 billion worth of goods and services to South Africa last year, it is important that Australia maintains the current tax agreement with South Africa. We remain committed to encouraging investment and opportunities for Australian businesses in overseas markets. The existing treaty contains a most favoured nation obligation in the form of a non-discrimination article. When Australia entered into a tax treaty with the UK in 2003 it triggered the most favoured nation obligation in the South African treaty and it meant that there was a need for amendments to ensure that taxpayers of one country who also operated in another did not experience tax discrimination.
Specifically, this bill amends the International Tax Agreement Act 1953 to include amendments—agreed to on 31 March this year—to Australia’s tax treaty with South Africa for avoiding double taxation and prevention of tax evasion. It will lower the withholding rates on interest and royalties while aligning them more closely with OECD practice. It implements a five per cent withholding tax rate for all non-portfolio intercorporate dividends. It will replace the current zero rate for non-portfolio intercorporate dividends paid out of profits that have borne full company tax. It will also provide a 15 per cent withholding tax rate for all other dividends. These rates are consistent with the OECD model tax convention.
As a result of these changes, Australian non-portfolio investment in South Africa will generally benefit from reduced total South African tax on corporate profits. The bill continues to limit source country tax on interest to 10 per cent. Tax will not be charged in the source country on any interest derived by the government of the other country from the investment of official reserve assets or a financial institution domiciled in the other country. Similarly, the bill reduces the general limit for royalties from 10 to five per cent. Additionally the bill expands the list of taxes covered by the treaty. It brings capital gains tax treatment into alignment with the OECD model. It introduces some integrity measures that allow for exchange of information by tax authorities to secure and protect tax revenue, and it provides for reciprocal assistance in the collection of tax revenue. The measures in this bill, as I said, were the direct results of actions taken by the former coalition government to improve taxation rules and to better cooperate with the South African government in relation to international tax affairs. It makes improvements to the tax treatment of Australian investors. It is a positive move that will support Australian exporters. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2008-10-16,"—I thank Senator Coonan for her contribution, on behalf of the opposition, to this important piece of legislation and I thank the opposition for their support of the bill. This bill gives the force of law to a new tax protocol with South Africa which will modernise and enhance the bilateral tax treaty arrangements between Australia and South Africa. South Africa is, of course, Australia’s largest and most dynamic market in Africa. South African investment dominates investment from the African continent into Australia.
The protocol updates the taxation arrangements between Australia and South Africa to enhance Australia’s relationship with South Africa by reducing barriers to bilateral trade and investment in the lowering of withholding tax rates on interests and royalties. The protocol also delivers on Australia’s most favoured nation obligation in the existing tax treaty to provide for rules to prevent tax discrimination. The protocol inserts a non-discrimination article which protects Australian nationals and businesses operating in South Africa, and vice versa, from discriminatory tax practices. The protocol was also prompted by proposed changes to South Africa’s own domestic law of taxation of corporate profits. The protocol amends the withholding tax rates applying to dividends, providing a five per cent rate for all non-portfolio intercorporate dividends and a 15 per cent rate for all other dividends.
These changes align with OECD norms and address South Africa’s changes to its domestic law system of taxing corporate profits. Australian non-portfolio investment in South Africa will generally benefit from reduced total South African tax on corporate profits as a result of these changes. The new protocol also includes a number of other key changes. I can report that the treaty has been considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which has recommended that binding treaty action be taken. I also commend the bill to the Senate.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2008-10-16,"—Okay. Before we were interrupted to deal with non-controversial legislation, the minister advised me that the expected saving for the government as a result of not having to pay the private health insurance rebate to people whom the government expects to leave private health insurance is $740,600,000. The expected loss of revenue is $360 million. I want to place on record what this means. The $740.6 million is only the 30 per cent rebate. This means that the government is happy to see $2.5 billion walk out of our health system, because that is exactly the amount of money that those people would otherwise have contributed to private health insurance. They will be taking that money with them.
My very specific question to the minister, which has not been answered yet, is: what increases in private health insurance premiums does the government expect as a result of this revised measure? Yesterday, on ABC radio, the Minister for Health and Ageing told listeners that increases in premiums as a result of this measure were inevitable. So, firstly, please tell me what the government’s expectation is in terms of increases in premiums. Secondly, according to the government’s own figures, $2.5 billion will walk out of the health system as a result of this measure. In light of that fact, what is the government’s intention in terms of compensating the states and territories for this impact?",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE THRESHOLDS) BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-10-16,"—In answer to your question around premiums, it is up to insurance companies to provide an attractive, affordable product. If they do that then people will continue to buy it. It is also ultimately up to the Commonwealth to approve premium rises, and the health minister has made it clear that she will not accept private health insurance funds using this measure as an excuse to whack working families with huge hikes. The government’s view is that the health funds will compete strongly with each other and will continue to drive down costs and that this will minimise premium increases.
I know you have stood up a few times recently, Senator Cormann, claiming you have been misrepresented, but I suspect you have seriously verballed the minister, so I do not accept what you have put forward.

Senator Mason interjecting—

—Senator Mason has joined us in the chamber and wants to interject and join in. He is the man who has spent his entire political life fighting international socialism, only to be merged with them.
—Very unfair, Stephen!
—Unfair but true. You have spent your entire life fighting those international socialists and agrarian socialists, only to find that you are in bed with them. Health Minister Roxon and the government have been talking to the Greens, Senator Xenophon and of course Senator Fielding, and all have been willing to take a constructive approach on this issue. We have come to an agreement which will deliver immediate tax cuts to 250,000 Australians and to more Australians in the years after that. For two people, each on an average income, this tax cut is worth $1,200 in the next year. We also know that many other Australians will benefit from having a real choice. When budgets are tight, Australians will be able to make real decisions about where they want to spend their money without having to fear being hit with a tax penalty. The new threshold for singles will be $70,000 while for families it will be $140,000. These thresholds will be indexed each year to reflect wages growth. This will ensure that they will remain relevant into the future rather than forever threatening to become the tax trap that the Liberal government’s thresholds had created.
The Liberals are the last men standing on this issue, refusing to accept that there should ever be any changes. Their approach to this issue is about as relevant as the Medicare levy surcharge thresholds they want to maintain—this at a time when we know we need a surplus and we know we need to provide relief to families. The senators from the minor parties have seen the need for economic responsibility.
—I’m an Independent.
—Sorry, Senator Xenophon—minor parties and Independent senators. I was not in any way attempting to leave you out. At a time like this it is stunning that the Liberals are rejecting this bill and voting against the surplus and against relief for working families. Minister Roxon and the government thank the Greens, Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding for their constructive approach to this issue.
I also want to make the point that our public hospitals are on a firm footing. We have already injected $1 billion this year, and they stand to benefit significantly from COAG at the end of the year. We are happy to support the amendment Senator Siewert will move for a review into the impacts of this measure on public hospitals, but we do not believe there will be any adverse impact on public hospitals as a result of this legislation that will pass through the parliament today. We would also particularly like to acknowledge the Greens’ support for using wages as the indexation factor into the future. We believe that this will lock in fairness for the future. It will make sure this surcharge will remain relevant to future incomes and will never again become the tax trap that the former Liberal government created.
We are also continuing discussions with Senator Xenophon and Senator Siewert regarding the terms of reference for a Productivity Commission inquiry into the cost of different procedures in the public and private systems. It is important to note for the record, as Senator Xenophon has done previously, that the government is already well advanced in negotiations with the states and territories to provide more transparency and accountable reporting on public hospitals. We are also in discussions with the private sector about the same performance indicators applying to private hospitals so that we will have a truly national system of reporting across public and private hospitals for the first time. The Productivity Commission will be able to draw on some of this work in its inquiry.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE THRESHOLDS) BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2008-10-16,"—Just to allay the minister’s concerns: far be it from me to verbal the Minister for Health and Ageing, even though that is something that she herself is quite up to doing when she circulates propaganda sheets which present questions asked at an inquiry as a statement of position. Let me quickly read out to you the direct quote of the answer provided by the Minister for Health and Ageing to a question by Matthew Abraham on 891 ABC yesterday morning. Mr Abraham asked a very incisive question:
And how will you stop them from putting up their rates to compensate for this, because you wouldn’t want them to go broke, would you?
Mrs Roxon said:
Well, no, that’s why I say, you’ve got to balance those things and I don’t want to pretend to the community that, you know, there isn’t an inevitability of some increases…
The reality is this—

Senator Conroy interjecting—

—A double negative makes a positive, Minister—I am sure that even you understand that. So the minister is not saying there is not an inevitability of some increases. The reality is this: Professor Deeble said there would be an additional five per cent increase, Access Economics said there would be an additional five per cent increase—under the original measure, I grant you that. But it stands to reason that if you expect that 500,000 people will leave private health insurance as a result of this measure—and the minister says that it is the young and healthy who will leave in the first instance, who will not access treatment to the same extent as the older and sicker and who will walk out with the contributions that they would otherwise have made—of course premiums will have to go up. That is basic logic. I do not think that anybody seriously suggests that premiums will not go up. Everybody accepts that premiums will go up. The minister accepts that premiums will go up as a result of this measure. The question is: by how much? And the real concern is that, during the Senate inquiry, Treasury told us that they had not actually included an assumption about future premium growth as a result of this measure in the forward estimates costing of that $960 million saving—which became $879 million and has now become $740 million.
I ask you the question again, Minister, because this is something that Health and Treasury officials have confirmed in the Senate inquiry. Just tell me if there is a change of position. Health and Treasury officials gave evidence to the inquiry that future premium increases as a result of this measure would be funded out of the contingency reserve. Could you please confirm for me that future health insurance premium increases as a result of this measure would be funded out of the contingency reserve?",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE THRESHOLDS) BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-10-16,"—Senator Cormann, on a number of occasions you have taken points of order and stood up and argued that you have been seriously verballed, and you have taken umbrage about it. So I do find it a little difficult to take you seriously when you try to fundamentally misrepresent what the minister said. If I could also defend Ms Roxon, she is getting married later this year but I do not think she will be adopting the ‘Mrs’ title. Seriously, that is a serious verballing of what she has said and a serious verballing of evidence from officials. The point is: there is always money in the contingency reserve for premium increases—not premium increases caused by this. Let me be clear. You are trying to deliberately bring together two pieces of information and mislead this chamber. You should stop misrepresenting both the minister and officials, because it does not do you well to have got yourself into a situation where you want to claim you have been misrepresented and then you start doing what you claim has been done to you.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE THRESHOLDS) BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech

Can you provide, here and now to the Senate and to the Australian people—to the one million people on incomes of less than $50,000 who have private health insurance—a guarantee on behalf of your government that health insurance premiums will not go up? Whatever you are saying, Treasury officials told the inquiry and Health officials told the inquiry that any impact in terms of future premium growth as a result of this measure will be covered out of the contingency reserve. That is black and white in the Treasury submission to the inquiry. It is black and white in the evidence that was provided. If you are now coming here and trying to play some political game and not taking those questions seriously—questions about things that have a serious impact, particularly on the vulnerable in our community who will continue to take out private health insurance—then, quite frankly, you should not be dealing with this legislation.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE THRESHOLDS) BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech

Perhaps it was Senator Williams. I am not sure. Let me repeat what I said and be absolutely clear. It is ultimately up to the Commonwealth to approve premium rises.

It could not be clearer.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE THRESHOLDS) BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2008-10-16,"—I note that the minister was not prepared to rule out health insurance premium increases as a result of this measure. He has not been prepared to rule out that premiums will go up as a result of this measure. I will just explain the very simple maths to the minister again. The minister said earlier that the Commonwealth expects to save $740.6 million by not having to pay the private health insurance rebate to those Australians the government expects to leave private health insurance. The Minister for Health and Ageing has said that these people are going to be the young and healthy, so there is nothing to worry about. But if it is the young and healthy, then this is only 30 per cent of the total funding that will walk out the door with the 500,000 people you expect to leave private health insurance. Those people will not only take the 30 per cent Commonwealth rebate away with them; they will also take their own 70 per cent contribution away with them. That is $2.5 billion walking out of that door, Minister, and you are saying it is just going to go up in the air somewhere? Are you saying to me seriously that there is not going to be an impact on public hospitals? Are you saying that there is not going to be an impact on private health insurance premiums? Where is that $2.5 billion going to come from? Do you expect a reduction in demand for hospital treatment? Surely not.
Not one single witness at the Senate inquiry said that they expected a reduction in demand for hospital treatment. Of course not; nobody does. But there is $2.5 billion walking out that door with the people you are driving out of health insurance as a result of this measure, and you have got absolutely no idea where that money is going to come from. I put it to you, Minister: it is going to be the states and the territories that are going to have to cop it on the chin. You are setting them up for failure. Pensioners and Australians earning less than $50,000 a year are going to be among 10 million Australians who will see five to 10 per cent additional increases in health insurance premiums as a result of this measure.
Let me go back to the advice provided by your very good friend and mentor, former Senator Graham Richardson. This is what he put in his discussion paper in December 1993. He came in as the new federal health minister at the end of 10 years of failed Labor health policy—Labor health policy that was based on the same ideological misguidedness as this legislation is today. His discussion paper said: ‘Declining rates of private health insurance membership have significant implications for the public system. As more people drop out of private insurance, the demands on the public system grow.’
This is a government that told Senator Siewert there would be no negative impacts. I understand where Senator Siewert is coming from, by the way. She has a particular view. She is not supportive of the policy framework that underpins private health, and she is very clear about that. At least she is honest about where she is coming from. She does not support the private health insurance rebate, she does not support Lifetime Health Cover and she does not support the Medicare levy surcharge. I can respect her position more than the position of the government. The government are trying to pretend, ‘Yes, we are committed to a mixed health system. We are committed to a strong private health sector,’ but they are doing everything to undermine it and weaken it and make sure that it falls over.
In the media today I read:
Greens health spokeswoman Rachel Siewert said the government had assured her party there would be no negative impacts on the public hospital system.
This is like saying, ‘Trust us; we are from the government; we are here to help.’ What sort of guarantees has the government actually provided to Senator Siewert to substantiate that commitment? This is just incredible. Two or three weeks ago Senator Fielding said that he was concerned about the impact of this measure on low-income families, pensioners, older Australians and people on low and fixed incomes. He said, ‘I want some compensation for them.’ But he has now just rolled over and abandoned lower income families, abandoned pensioners and essentially sidled up to the government in the name of an illusory surplus out of this measure which will not eventuate at all due to the reasons I have given.
Minister, you are quite right. Only the Liberal-National Party coalition is standing up for the 10 million people with private health insurance. Only the Liberal-National Party coalition is standing up for the one million Australians earning less than $50,000, whom you will force to cope with increased health insurance premiums or to go into the public hospital queues as soon as they can no longer afford those increased premiums that you are forcing on them. Minister, you are absolutely right: only the Liberal-National Party coalition is standing up for sound and good public health policy. Quite frankly, the more I ask you questions and the more that you are not able to answer them, the more obvious it becomes that the government still has not done its homework, is still flying blind, still does not know what the impact on public hospitals is going to be and still does not know by how much private health insurance is going to go up as a result of this measure. Quite frankly, within half an hour, this deal has been totally exposed as a complete fraud.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE THRESHOLDS) BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2008-10-16,"—I need to pull up Senator Conroy for misleading the house a bit earlier. He said that the Liberals were the last men standing on this, but the last time I checked there were a number of very capable female senators for the Liberal Party, so I think he needs to be taken to task for misleading the house in relation to that. To put this in perspective, the amendments were moved by my colleague Senator Siewert jointly with me. They relate to what I see as a healthy compromise to what the government put up. I have always been concerned about maintaining an equilibrium between the private and public systems. Senator Cormann is quite passionate in his defence of the status quo—and I respect his position—but I think it is important that we put a few things in perspective. Firstly, this is not the only measure that keeps people in the private health system. Lifetime cover, community rating and the 30 per cent rebate are all factors to be considered. The fact that there has been such a pressure on the health system is also due to the ageing population and to illnesses which are preventable. For example, we can do more to reduce our smoking rates and the level of emphysema and lung cancer.
There are things that we can do to have a healthier community and that will make a difference to our hospital waiting lists. A range of other measures need to be taken into account in the context of how our health system works. That is why I believe that this is a sensible, healthy compromise in terms of not ensuring a tipping point by having so many people leave the system and of ensuring the viability of private health insurance in keeping a downward pressure on premiums as much as possible by not having so many people exiting. But there is also the fundamental equity issue. When this surcharge was introduced in 1997 the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, made it very clear that it was intended as an incentive for higher income earners to take up private health insurance. Right now it is $8,000 below average weekly earnings. I was convinced, as a result of what was put in the chamber yesterday by Senator Siewert and from discussions with Treasury officials last night, that average weekly earnings, on the basis of all the evidence available, would be a more appropriate index in the context of this measure, because it is a threshold based on income. So, on balance, that seems to be a more sensible approach.
I want to briefly refer to the issue of a Productivity Commission inquiry, and I would like to acknowledge that the opposition was quite supportive of the motion that I had put up, which has been postponed. It seems to me that it would be much more preferable for an inquiry, pursuant to the legislation that sets up the Productivity Commission, to be coming from the Treasurer. That is how it works in the legislation. I think there are some procedural and other difficulties in it being a motion from a senator, even though that would be a second-best alternative option. I believe that, if we have this Productivity Commission inquiry, it should be broad in its terms of reference and there should be a robust inquiry that looks at, for the first time, the comparison in outcomes in the costs of the public and private systems. It should look at infection rates in the two systems and at the whole issue of fully informed financial consent in both the public and private systems, because these are things that will make a real difference to some good, long-term public policy outcomes.
I note Senator Cormann’s interest in getting a good, long-term public policy outcome on health policy in this country. I believe that the Productivity Commission inquiry into this will make a very real and positive difference that will be good for our health system in the medium to longer term. That, to me, is a very key part of what is before us today. Whilst it is not directly before us, in terms of the issue that will be voted on, it is part of the undertaking of the government, and I accept that we have some broad terms of agreement based on the motion that I have introduced. Senator Siewert is looking at the terms of reference to make sure that it is as comprehensive as possible, and that is welcome.
Notwithstanding my admonishment of him a couple of minutes ago, can Senator Conroy confirm that the Productivity Commission will also be providing advice to the government on the most appropriate indexation factor for the Medicare levy surcharge threshold, so that the concern that Senator Cormann has had in relation to this will be one of the issues that will be looked at by the Productivity Commission in making its recommendations and reporting on this very important matter? Having said that, I look forward to this matter being dealt with. I believe that this is a sensible compromise, balancing the equity issue of those who were slugged with this surcharge—given the lack of indexation for 11 years—with ensuring that there is an appropriate balance between the public and private systems.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE THRESHOLDS) BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2008-10-16,"—Yesterday Senator Xenophon asked me a few questions and I gave it my best to sincerely, openly and transparently answer them. In light of the fact that I am not getting any satisfaction from the government, and considering that the government is not prepared to provide answers to the Australian people about the impact on public hospitals and private health insurance premiums, I thought I would try my luck with Senator Xenophon. Senator Xenophon, the fact that the government expect to save $740 million from not having to pay the private health insurance rebate to people shows that they expect people to leave private health insurance. This is not us making it up; these are Treasury forecasts. Considering the $740 million is only 30 per cent of the funding that will be walking out the door, what sort of assurances have you received from the government about how they will make up that $2.5 billion shortfall in the health system? That is a question I would also like to address to Senator Siewert. She says here that she has been given assurances that there would not be a negative impact on public hospitals. What sorts of assurances has Senator Siewert received? What sort of compensation is the federal government going to offer the states and territories for the impact of this? My second question to Senator Xenophon is: what indications has the government given to you of expected future health insurance premium increases as a result of this measure? What is going to be the increase in health insurance premiums as a result of this measure that the government has told you about?",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE THRESHOLDS) BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2008-10-16,"—These questions are better asked of a minister. I can assure this chamber that I will never be a minister in any government—that is one thing I am certain of!
—Oh, you never know, Nick!
—It is not going to happen! In relation to the matters raised by Senator Cormann, the policy dilemma for me has always been: what do you do with a surcharge that was put in place for high-income earners back on 1 July 1997 that has not been indexed at all and is catching more and more people in the net? That is a key factor.
I think I have already alluded to the other issues that Senator Cormann has raised. In terms of premium increases, this clearly is a compromise measure with respect to the government’s position, which I believe went too far. It acknowledges the equity issue of those who have been caught by the surcharge—which includes people on below-average weekly earnings, for instance, which I believe is fundamentally unfair. I think the health minister has been very clear that any application for premium increases by private health insurers will be looked at forensically and they will have to make their case. I would like to think that this provides that equilibrium.
In terms of the bigger picture, can I say to Senator Cormann that having a forensic Productivity Commission examination of this for the first time in terms of the comparison between the public and private systems is something that has never been done—the data has not been available. I acknowledge what the health minister has said in relation to moving on this with COAG. It is something that no previous government has actually done and that is long overdue. I believe we will get some answers that we need to move forward with in long-term health policy in this country.
I have said before that I have private health insurance. I would not give it up for quids, even without the rebate. I have been well served by my private health cover, and I intend to keep it. But I think that, if we want some long-term answers about where we get the best benefit for taxpayer dollars in the system, the Productivity Commission inquiry is the way to go forward. The dilemma is: what do you do with the threshold for a surcharge that has been left at an artificial level over so many years and has not been addressed? I do not think we would have this problem if whoever was giving advice to then Treasurer Peter Costello 11 years ago had thought to have it indexed, either to CPI or average weekly earnings. I am sure I have not satisfied Senator Cormann, but I have given it my best shot.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE THRESHOLDS) BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2008-10-16,"—In response to Senator Cormann’s question to the Greens, I also want to seek confirmation from the government to see if my understanding is correct. Firstly, the reason why the Greens are moving the amendment in relation to the review is to be assured that there is no negative impact on the public hospital system—and, if there is, obviously the government need to address that, since they have given us an assurance that there will be no negative impact on the public hospital system. I understand from the government’s response to me previously in discussions on this, and in this chamber in discussions on the previous bill, that the government will be supporting the review and that, if the review does identify any negative impacts, they can be dealt with through the COAG funding agreement that they are currently negotiating with the states. There will be an ongoing relationship there. I understand that that is the process, and I would seek that clarification from the government.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE THRESHOLDS) BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2008-10-16,"—I am close to wrapping up the opposition’s contribution in this debate, I assure you. Firstly, in relation to the comments made by Senator Xenophon, I place on record that over 11½ years of the Howard-Costello government we provided between $5,100 and $9,000 per annum worth of tax cuts to Australians in the $50,000 to $75,000 income bracket. John Howard and Peter Costello did that without the disastrous consequences that will result from this very bad public policy.
A very bad public policy, I repeat, was pursued by the government under the pretence of offering tax breaks when in reality it was a very thinly veiled attack on the private health sector—a policy where the government did not even seek to assess the impact on public hospitals, where the government did not even seek to assess the impact on future health insurance premium increases and where the government only sought to assess how many people would leave in order to be able to calculate how much they would save and how much it would cost them. They were not able to tell us the true and accurate estimates of the number of people they expected to leave until two or three months into the inquiry, when they finally were able to confess: ‘Yes, we expect 644,000 people to leave.’ That became 583,000. Now it is 492,000 people.
I suggest to the government that that is still an underestimate of what will happen, because of one of the fundamentally flawed assumptions this government is making—and I invite you to check it in Hansard, Senator Conroy, because I would not want you to accuse me of verballing people yet again. Essentially, Treasury and Health officials both said that they expect this to be ‘a one-off shock to the system’. ‘A one-off shock to the system’ is what Mr David Kalisch, from the Department of Health and Ageing, said in the Senate estimates process.
The reality is that it is not going to be a one-off shock to the system. This is going to push up the price of premiums, so more people will have to leave, which will push up the premiums a bit more, so more people will have to leave, and you will have a new downward spiral. That is exactly what happened in 1983, when you started off with a drop from 63 to 50 per cent. Things accelerated. Membership started to drop by two per cent per annum. Then Senator Graham Richardson said: ‘If this keeps going the way it is, it will be three to four per cent per annum in a couple of years time. If things continue the way they are, we will end up at 25 per cent private health insurance membership by the end of the decade.’
If that is what the government want, if the government are quite happy to introduce a policy that will lead us down the path of ending up with 25 per cent of Australians being privately insured, then they should say so. They should be honest enough to say so. Do not come here and pretend that this is some sort of effort to provide a tax break, because, if it were supposed to be a tax break, you would have announced it before the election and you would have made sure that it did not discriminate against people who do take out private health insurance but that it was a tax cut for people in relevant income brackets whether they take out private health insurance or not.
I also take this opportunity to make a comment about the Greens amendment on the review. The opposition will be supporting the Greens amendment on the review, but let me just make the point that this is really like having a bus drive at 150 miles an hour against a wall and saying: ‘Let’s have a review afterwards to see whether people got hurt, instead of making the decisions before we hit the wall to apply the brakes, turn the bus around or remove the wall.’ There are a whole heap of things that you can do before you end up in a situation where you know that people are going to get hurt.
This is a bus with 20 million Australians on it, and the government is driving it right against that wall at 150 miles an hour. Do you know what? Instead of making decisions on turning that bus around, applying the brakes, making some sensible changes and making a proper assessment of the risks ahead, the government is intent on keeping on driving. Even if you slow down that bus from 150 miles an hour to 120 miles an hour, as long as you continue heading for that wall, people are going to get hurt. Yes, the review will show us afterwards that people got hurt.
Once the Australian people can see where this policy is going to lead, they will change the driver. At the next election, we will be calling on the Australian people to change the driver of the bus, because the Australian people do not want you to drive that bus against that wall; they want you to apply the brakes. They want you to turn that bus around. Quite frankly, everybody knows that, if you drive a bus at 150 miles an hour against that wall, people are going to get hurt. That is why we think that the government should have done a proper assessment—the government should have done its homework—before introducing this legislation.
We will be supporting the Greens amendment on having a review, but we note that that will be a review after the fact. That will be a review after people have already been hurt. That is not the way to devise good policy. Good policy means that you make a proper assessment of the likely implications, the likely risks and the flow-on implications of a particular measure before you implement it.
That is what is fundamentally wrong with this government. This government is driven by an ideological pursuit against private health. It tries to dress it up in its spin of: ‘This is about a tax break,’ even though this will force up health insurance premiums for 10 million people, including one million Australians earning less than $50,000 who will not get a tax break—people like Mrs Judie Kearney-Wilkins, from Treasurer Wayne Swan’s electorate of Lilley. These are people that the Treasurer should very carefully listen to. I am pretty confident that Mrs Judie Kearney-Wilkins would be very concerned about where this bus driver is taking this bus. She would be very concerned about that wall over there. While we will be supporting the amendment to have a review, we think the government should have done its homework before introducing this legislation.

 Review of operation of Act

         (1)    The Minister for Health and Ageing must cause an independent review of the operation of this Act to be undertaken as soon as possible after each anniversary of the commencement of this Act, for a period of three consecutive years.
         (2)    The review is to consider and report on the impact on public hospitals of the amendments made by this Act, including the number of episodes of care, the impact on operating costs and the impact on elective surgery waiting lists.
         (3)    The person undertaking the review must give the Minister a written report of the review, and the Minister must cause a copy of the report to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of receiving the report.
This relates to the review of the operation of the act. A new amendment has been circulated in the chamber because we slightly revised the previous amendment to ensure that it is the Minister for Health and Ageing who initiates or causes the independent review to occur. This is the review that we have been talking about of the operation of the act to ascertain any impacts of these changes on the public hospital system.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE THRESHOLDS) BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech

"Cash, Senator Michaelia",LP,2008-10-16,"—My question is to the Special Minister of State, Senator Faulkner. Does the Rudd government require the staff of its ministers and parliamentary secretaries to provide a statement of private interests to their employing ministers or parliamentary secretaries, and is the minister or parliamentary secretary required to countersign the statement? If so, was this procedure followed by Parliamentary Secretary McKew and her staff member Ms Kathleen Forrester?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Members of Parliament: Staff</title>,Questions Without Notice,22,1,question
"Faulkner, Senator John",ALP,2008-10-16,"—The answer to the first question that was asked by Senator Cash is yes. The answer to the second question that was asked by Senator Cash is yes. Now let me turn to the specifics of the particular case that Senator Cash raises. For the information of the Senate, I can confirm that a Ms Kathleen Forrester is an adviser to the Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Child Care, Ms McKew. I can confirm that Ms Forrester joined Ms McKew’s staff on 12 May this year.
Prior to her appointment, Ms Forrester had been an employee of the Allen Consulting Group, which is a private company. She resigned before taking up her ministerial staff appointment. As an employee of the Allen Consulting Group, Ms Forrester, like other employees, received shares in the company under an employee share plan. On 23 April 2008, before she commenced at Ms McKew’s office, Ms Forrester told the company she wished to divest her shares to avoid any potential conflict of interest. In fact, she wrote to the company and told them she wanted to dispose of her holding quickly because she was keen to avoid even the vaguest notion of potential conflict of interest. In turn, the company told her that it would put in train a divestment process.
I note, and I think it is important to note, that we are dealing here with shares in a private company that cannot be simply traded on the stock market. Before even commencing her position in Ms McKew’s office on 12 May, Ms Forrester declared her shareholding in the Allen Consulting Group in her statement of private interests that was provided to Ms McKew.
You also asked me, Senator Cash, whether that statement was signed. I confirm, for your information and for the information of the Senate, that that statement was signed by Ms Forrester and Ms McKew before the start of Ms Forrester’s employment on 12 May 2008.
I note that I have perhaps provided some additional information to that which Senator Cash has requested, but I thought it appropriate to do so to enable Senator Cash to understand the context of the signing of the declaration form, and also, of course—as is the hallmark of this government—in the interests of full transparency.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Members of Parliament: Staff</title>,Questions Without Notice,22,1,answer

That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
Today we saw one of the worst abuses of parliament that I have experienced in a number of years. I sent, as a matter of courtesy, Senator Sherry a question that I thought deserved a serious answer. I sent that question about 11 o’clock. The convention in this place is that if you want an answer you give the minister the courtesy of sending the question. That is a convention that has been part of this Senate for as long as I have been here. But when you do give the minister that courtesy you do not expect two minutes of vitriolic abuse on a question that has very serious implications for the fishing industry in Australia. I considered it abuse, and I will certainly be writing to the President of the Senate. I thought the President should have stepped in and reprimanded the minister, or certainly directed him to the question. If we want to abuse convention in this place, it just will not work. We do not do that, because we have a consideration for the Senate and we want it to work.
The Vietnamese Prime Minister, when in Australia, made an announcement—I do not know whether he was talking with some knowledge—that the regulations would be changed to allow prawns from Vietnam to come into Australia. I spent a great number of months with my colleague Senator Ian Campbell working to stop prawns coming in from Vietnam to South-East Queensland because white spot virus is involved. It is a very important issue because if that white spot virus gets into the wild catch of Australian prawns and crustaceans, including crayfish, then it has the potential to wipe out the whole of the wild catch. In fact, there are only two countries in the world that do not have this white spot virus: Brazil and Australia.
It is so important that we maintain that disease-free status for white spot that I thought it was worth sending the question over to the minister, but we got roundly abused for our trouble. I still do not know—and I have the transcript here—what the position is, because the minister just obfuscated the question. The position that we took was that we prevented prawns coming in from South-East Asia from countries that had white spot disease. We allowed cooked prawns to come in but prevented raw prawns from coming in because they offered a real threat to our wild catch industries.
Today, the minister could have said, ‘No, we are not going to allow prawns to come into Australia from white spot countries or from South Vietnam,’ but we did not get that answer. We got some obfuscation, and I do not know at the moment whether prawns will be allowed in or whether they will not be allowed in. We will have to wait to take this matter further in the estimates committee next week. I thought it was a terrible way to answer a question, when it was an absolutely serious question that did not have any political implications in it. It was a clear and concise question: will you prevent prawns coming in from countries that carry white spot to prevent it getting into our wild catch? A number of fishermen and a number of processors are very interested in this question. We still do not know whether Senator Sherry actually got a brief from the appropriate minister or he just tried to fly it and did not know what he was talking about. (Time expired)

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2008-10-16,"—I rise to take note of the same answer as the last speaker. Of course, this is a very important issue, and it is no surprise perhaps that it should be raised in the manner that it has been raised by the Liberal Party’s country auxiliary, also going by the name of the National Party. As has been so often the case in recent days and weeks, this is an opposition, a coalition, that is in complete denial about its past, irrespective of the fact that that past is so recent and so vivid.
The previous Howard government had an appalling record in matters pertaining to quarantine and in particular on matters pertaining to prawn imports. It was, of course, the previous government that had custody of our quarantine arrangements when the equine flu entered this country, and, as a Victorian senator, I particularly recall the damage that it wreaked upon the horseracing industry in Victoria and in particular on the Melbourne Cup carnival of that year. To have the Liberal Party’s country auxiliary seek to make this issue a high-profile one at this moment is the height of hypocrisy, but of course hypocrisy is no stranger to those on the other side, as we have seen in the debate on pensions and even in recent discussions concerning the prudential regulation of our financial sector.
The fact is that the prawn and prawn products import risk analysis was first published as a draft in 2000. My point is that, when the Rudd government came into office some eight years later, all it found in the cupboard dealing with these questions of quarantine and prawn imports was a draft import risk assessment, together with some interim measures that had been put in place some eight years previously. This hardly stands up as a model for how to proceed. In fact, in the term of the previous government there was a suspected occurrence of white spot virus in a research facility in Darwin, and interim measures were put in place around that particular outbreak. But of course those interim measures were never again revisited, never again codified, and the then government completely failed to take any serious approach to this very serious question.
In fact, with respect to prawn imports in this country, the Rudd government, having found itself inheriting such a shabby set of arrangements, such an incomplete set of arrangements, from the former government, took action, as it has been doing on so many issues and on so many fronts, by initiating a wide-ranging and independent review of Australia’s quarantine and biosecurity arrangements. I am referring to the independent review that is being led by Mr Roger Beale AO. That is a very important review, and that review is filling the cavernous hole which was policy under the previous government. This new-found zeal from Senator Boswell does not change the fact that the previous government completely failed to take this issue seriously. What has belatedly brought this issue rolling onto the deck of ‘HMAS’ Boswell is the recent comments—
—Order! Senator Feeney, I think you should refer to a senator by his proper title. I would also remind you, in the light of your earlier remarks, that Senator Boswell—if you have read the newspaper, you will realise—is a member of the Liberal National Party now.
—Quite right. Thank you, Deputy President. I can assure you that that is a term I will be using with zeal at the appropriate moment. The Vietnamese Prime Minister’s comments concerning the prawn risk are what brought these matters before Senator Boswell. Those comments by the Vietnamese Prime Minister were something to the effect that—and I do not have the exact words in front of me—the Australian government had agreed to review its quarantine and biosecurity arrangements pertaining to prawn imports.
This government has already clarified that in fact those comments by the Vietnamese Prime Minister are incorrect. Those matters have already been dealt with—and, I might say, dealt with quite thoroughly—by the minister in question time. The Australian government continues to maintain a strong regard for its quarantine and biosecurity arrangements. In contrast to the previous government, this is a government that has taken on both these issues generally and the question of prawn imports and prawn imports from Vietnam in particular very seriously. No shabby interim set of arrangements or draft reports will be going forward and managing this area for this government; this is a government that will be dealing with the matter in a proper and considered and holistic manner.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2008-10-16,"—In speaking to that matter I would like to indicate that it was good of the minister to advise the Senate that he would take on notice the first part of my question with respect to how many very young carers existed in Australia today—people like Jazzi Pybus, who cares for both her parents at the young age of 10. The minister indicated that he was not aware of the answer to the second part but would also take that on notice—that is, explaining what answers the government has as to why the young carers are not considered important enough to have their voices heard at the federally funded Young Carers Forum.
I am advised, based on reports this week, that the federal investment in the Young Carers Forum is some $280,000. The minister indicated that he would take both those matters on notice. They are very important matters. They have been in the media this week and it is surprising that the minister does not have a brief before him to respond to those queries. I think that is a matter for the government and I hope that in future times in the Senate they are fully and properly briefed on those sorts of matters, especially when they are reported publicly in the media. In this case it was in the Australian newspaper this week. The answer to my supplementary question about what financial support families relying on very young carers receive from the $10.4 billion package announced on Tuesday seemed very limited and restricted, and in terms of very young carers there was, in fact, no answer.
I alert the Senate to the concerns raised in this article in the Australian, which said that the $280,000 in federal funding was invested in this Young Carers conference. It refers to the case of Jazzi Pybus:
Jazzi’s father, Calvin Pybus, has post-traumatic stress syndrome. Her mother was recently hit by a bus and left with multiple fractures. She has a baby brother with Down syndrome. Her friend, Angel, cares for a mum with bipolar disorder.
The girls wanted to attend the conference because they were themselves young carers: they do the washing, help young siblings get ready for bed, and manage the household. They formed a support group for young carers in their neighbourhood, outside Brisbane. They connect online, and have painted a series of artworks about their lives. The girls hoped to learn from others at the conference, too.
The report continues:
The Australian understands that Jazzi is the only young person to get in touch with Carers Australia and ask to attend the talkfest.
It is fantastic that they are making those efforts. I would like to commend Jazzi Pybus and her friends for wanting to attend and make a difference to the world. I notice that Senator Cory Bernardi, the opposition disabilities, carers and voluntary sector spokesman, said:
We should be supporting our very young carers. It concerns me that they are not receiving financial support. It’s alarming. They are a hidden group. To hear that children are banding together for support as there are no services suitable to their needs is disturbing.
It is disturbing, and I agree with Senator Bernardi and with Mr Tony Abbott’s comments. It is really disappointing that the government seems not to have addressed all of the concerns of all the carers throughout the country. They often have a go at the coalition for not doing enough.
What would have happened if it had not been for our campaign  under the former leader, Dr Brendan Nelson? I remember leading and working with the Liberal Senate team in Tasmania and forcing the government to do something to support carers in Tasmania. I worked with Janice McKenna, the CEO from Carers Australia, in Tasmania and, together with other carers, we expressed the very strong view that the Rudd Labor government were not doing enough. After weeks and months they finally acted. Of course, this is exactly what has happened with this $4.8 billion package that has just recently been announced. I call on the government to disclose the assumptions, the forward estimates, the details underlying their reasons for that package. (Time expired)

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2008-10-16,"—I also rise to speak with regard to carers, in particular young carers, as raised by Senator Barnett earlier today. I do not dispute that Senator Barnett may well have been working with people recently, but the truth of the matter is that the opposition had 12 years to do something for these people and they failed to do anything. Even when they started talking about pension increases they were not going to do anything for young carers, so I am exceptionally pleased that the opposition have seen the light. As someone who has worked as a carer herself albeit in the child-care industry, for over a decade, I understand that carers in general, whether they be young carers, aged carers or child-care workers, are all undervalued by society and it is very important that we do something for them.
The Rudd Labor government is doing something for them in their Economic Security Strategy, which was announced earlier this week. As I said before, seeing the light is one thing but standing there and making derisive comments about this side and how long it might have taken us to do something when they had 12 years to do it is frankly beyond the pale. The Rudd government’s economic strategy will help encourage the economy as well and make sure it emerges in strong shape so that we can provide quality jobs and security for working families into the future.
We are delivering a down payment to pensioners, carers and people with a disability to provide them with immediate financial help in the nine-month lead-up to a comprehensive reform of the pension system. The Rudd Labor government are taking people seriously and are taking those minority groups very seriously. We are basically trying to unscramble eggs that were scrambled for the last 12 years. You cannot do that overnight. Once they are scrambled, you have to work with what is there. We will continue with this strategy and will continue to keep the Australian economy strong. In recognition of the difficult economic circumstances, we will also provide Commonwealth seniors card holders with a lump sum payment of $1,400 to singles and $2,100 to couples. So we are providing security for these people and for working families into the future, and we are providing relief right now when families need it.
We also believe in long-term planning. We are not just going issue by issue; we have a long-term strategy, a long-term plan, and it is very important for the Rudd Labor government to have this long-term plan. We are planning for the future, which is a most critical thing to do. As I said, we do not just decide overnight, see the light overnight, as those on the other side have. I did not even think they knew who the pensioners or the carers were. They have shown no support, no compassion and no humanity for 12 years to this group of people, and then they stand up and say, ‘What are you doing, when are you doing it and why haven’t you done it already?’ Well, with 12 years under your belt, I ask this question: what did you do, when did you do it, and why didn’t you do anything and take this group of people seriously?
I think next week, though I might stand corrected on that, is international carers week, and it is very important that we acknowledge the important role that carers play in the whole of the community and the whole of society. It is very unfortunate that there are young children who are put in this dilemma. I think it does rob them of a very valuable part of their life. They quite often lose their childhood. I have an ongoing interest in children and child care and issues surrounding community services, and for me it is quite sad to see. In response to that, I say that the Rudd Labor government have acknowledged that there has been this gap and we are doing something about it. We are delivering on 8 December. It is important that people realise that, although the other side stand up and proclaim that they are the new saviours of some of these less fortunate people, they had 12 years to deliver the goods— (Time expired)

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2008-10-16,"—In speaking to this matter, let me say that there were revelations yesterday relating to the fact that Ms Forrester, from the parliamentary secretary’s office, who I gather is employed as a childcare specialist, was, until 30 September, an owner of Allen Consulting Group by way of a shareholding. This apparently was divested on 30 September, but Ms Forrester had commenced working on 12 May, so it was some five months after the employment event. I note with some interest the commentary from the parliamentary secretary yesterday in relation to this matter. It is what was not said that is probably more important than what was said. The statement says:
Upon commencing her employment with Parliamentary Secretary McKew, Ms Forrester advised the then deputy secretary of the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations of her previous employment with Allen Consulting Group.
The question would be, why was the shareholding specifically excluded from that statement? Yes, Ms Forrester was an employee, but she was also a shareholder. One would have thought that if she had advised the secretary of her department she would also have advised him of her shareholding and therefore her ownership of the Allen Consulting Group. But there was no reference to it, and we are therefore quite entitled to assume that indeed she had not advised the deputy secretary of the department that she was still a shareholder.
The person is in charge of early childhood development. There was a contract for $112,173, a select procurement contract. This tender was for developing the structure of the National Early Years Workforce Strategy—contract notice CN 118028. So there was a direct source tender contract to Allen Consulting and this employee was the adviser to the parliamentary secretary for this specific part of the portfolio. It absolutely beggars belief that the adviser would not have had any discussions at all with the department in relation to a direct source contract in relation to an area which was this adviser’s specific responsibility.
This matter comes on the back of the CMAX affair. Honourable senators will remember a matter that is still under investigation from the Australian National Audit Office, investigating the office of the Prime Minister, senior staff in the Prime Minister’s office and senior staff in the Minister for Defence’s office. So we have CMAX under investigation from the ANAO, still not completed, and we have another example of the attitude of the Prime Minister and his staff in relation to matters of integrity, probity, openness and transparency. It is another clear example that, when it comes to commitments by the Prime Minister or his ministers, they are not worth the paper they are written on.
Just out of interest, on 26 June Senator Faulkner announced a new code of conduct—with some fanfare, as with all these things that have been announced, which all mean nothing at the end of the day. He trumpeted:
The code reflects this government’s commitment to integrity across government and our expectations that ministerial staff, who play such an important role working within government, will understand and meet high standards in carrying out their duties.
I appreciate the CMAX affair occurred before this code of conduct, but most certainly this matter was post that ministerial staff code of conduct. We want some very clear answers as to whether— (Time expired)

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2008-10-16,"—On behalf of Senator McGauran, I present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties No. 95, Treaties tabled on 4, 17 and 25 June and 26 August 2008. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report and to incorporate a tabling statement.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The statement read as follows—
I present Report 95 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. The reports reviews 12 treaty actions, including:
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities;
the Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement;
the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women;
an agreement with the EU on transferring air carriers’ passenger name record data to the Australian Customs Service;
agreements on Defence co-operation with France and the United Arab Emirates; and
six other treaty actions which are more technical in nature.
In each case the Committee has supported the proposed agreements and recommended that binding treaty action be taken. However, we have made additional recommendations on the Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement; the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; and the agreement on Defence co-operation with the United Arab Emirates.
The Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement will remove most barriers to Australia’s exports of goods to Chile, and provide economic integration for markets through commitments in a range of areas including trade in services, investment, government procurement, intellectual property, electronic commerce, and competition policy.
The Committee has concluded that the FTA is in Australia’s national interest and has therefore recommended that binding treaty action be taken.
However, Horticulture Australia has expressed concern about the potential impact of the FTA on their industries, including the risk of added pressure from Chile for Australia to weaken our biosecurity measures, or to expedite Chilean requests for biosecurity assessments.
The union movement has also expressed concern that short-term labour movements from Chile under Australia’s “457” visa conditions, which are currently under review, could be locked in by the FTA.
After hearing all the evidence, the Committee is satisfied that the FTA will not restrict Australia’s ability to amend its migration and labour laws as it sees fit, and will not result in Chilean requests for biosecurity assessments being given higher priority than would otherwise be the case.
However we have recommended that DFAT undertake and publish a review of the operation of the Agreement, no later than two years after its commencement, to assess the ongoing relevance of the concerns expressed.
More broadly, we have recommended that the Government, before commencing negotiations for any future trade agreement, should table in Parliament a document setting out its priorities and objectives. The document should include independent assessments of the costs and benefits. Such assessments should consider the economic regional, social, cultural, regulatory and environmental impacts which are expected to arise.
The Committee believes that such an arrangement would improve transparency in trade agreement negotiations, and address a number of concerns which were expressed by witnesses to this inquiry.
Earlier this year the Committee recommended that binding treaty action be taken on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. We undertook to produce a more detailed report outlining the scope of our inquiry into the Convention and our conclusions.
This Report contains the Committee’s additional findings in relation to the Convention. It is our view that the Convention will help protect the rights of all people with disabilities and promote respect for their inherent dignity. The Convention obliges governments to eliminate discrimination in a range of areas, including marriage, parenthood, education, health and employment. The Convention also contains provisions relating to the protection of children, ensuring individuals are recognised before law, and providing equal access to facilities and services.
The Convention reflects protections already existing under Australia’s domestic laws and has received widespread support. However, taking into account the concerns of witnesses the Committee has made some additional recommendations which we feel will aid in the implementation of the Convention.
The Committee recommends that the Government consider expanding the role of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner, to enable the Commissioner to provide Parliament with an annual report on compliance with the Convention. We also recommend that a review be carried out of the relevant provisions of the Migration Act, and the administration of migration policy, to ensure that there is no discrimination against persons with disabilities in breach of the Convention.
The Treaty on Defence Co-operation between Australia and the United Arab Emirates is designed to promote co-operation in a range of fields, including military training and education, joint military exercises, defence materiel and equipment, security and defence policy, and protection from weapons of mass destruction.
The Committee supports this agreement. However, the UAE imposes the death penalty for certain serious criminal offences, and in evidence to us it was noted that Australian service personnel could, theoretically, be subject to the death penalty if convicted of such offences during their posting.
While this risk is slight, the Committee nonetheless recommends that in any specific arrangements for the exchange of Defence personnel, the Government seek to ensure that Australian personnel are protected from corporal or capital punishment under UAE law.
This report reviews 12 proposed treaty actions in total. This has been a substantial undertaking and I thank my colleagues on the Committee for their diligence, as well as the numerous agencies and individuals who gave evidence.
I commend the report to the Senate.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-10-16,"—I foreshadow that the government will be moving amendments to this bill shortly. We will be seeking to amend the parenting presumption in the Family Law Act to allow children of same-sex relationships to be recognised as a ‘child of the relationship’ under the act.
We thank the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for its Same sex: same entitlements report. Both the legal and constitutional affairs committee and HREOC, in that report, provided insightful assistance to the committee. They also provided assistance to the government in looking at this area. It allowed us to move quickly on the Family Law Amendment (De Facto Financial Matters and Other Measures) Bill 2008, which is now in committee.
The second tranche of amendments will allow couples to opt in to the new regime where they have separated before commencement but have not resolved their property issues. The third area will address an issue raised by the Family Court, which is to allow for ‘use or occupancy’ orders that are regularly made for married couples. Finally, the Senate committee recommended that the government accept a range of largely technical amendments proposed by the family law section of the Law Council.
—Senator Ludwig, could you perhaps seek leave and move those amendments together as they are the first on the running sheet.

These amendments are largely technical and relate primarily to drafting issues, many of which were raised by the family law section of the Law Council of Australia. I thank the family law section for their input. As I said earlier in my remarks, the government appreciates the work done by both the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and the family law section of the Law Council. During my time in opposition and in government I have noted that the family law section has provided high-quality assistance to government.
Government amendments (1) and (2) provide for the commencement of the definition of ‘de facto relationship’, which recognises children of same-sex relationships, on the day the bill receives royal assent. The definition of ‘de facto relationship’ and the amendments made under new section 3A will also apply to a number of other acts, many of which are also being amended by the Same-Sex Relationship (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—Superannuation) Bill 2008 and the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—General Law Reform) Bill 2008. Commencement on royal assent will ensure that the amendments made to those other acts, once the two same-sex bills have passed and commenced, will have effective operation from the commencement.
Government amendments (3) to (6), (10), (11), (18) to (27), (30) to (32) and (47) to (52) address various drafting issues raised by the family law section of the Law Council of Australia to: (a) ensure consistency with the definitions for ‘de facto’, ‘financial cause’ and ‘financial matters’; (b) ensure consistency between provisions applying after a de facto relationship ends and the provisions applying after a marriage has ended in divorce; (c) replace the term ‘binding financial agreement’ with the phrase ‘financial agreement that is binding on the parties to the agreement’ or a similar phrase; and, finally, ensure that, where both parties have signed a separation declaration, the declaration’s time is measured from the time it is first signed by one of the parties.
Government amendments (8), (9), (29), (33), (39) and (54) also address various technical issues. It is always difficult to say this, but they were inadvertently overlooked during drafting. These amendments are largely technical, as I said, and are explained in more detail in the revised supplementary explanatory memorandum we have provided.
I commend the amendments to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-10-16,—The opposition accepts that the first group of amendments are of a technical character. They are designed to clarify certain meanings and correct certain omissions in the original draft of the bill and they are not controversial.,SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2008-10-16,"—I would like to make some remarks on the opening clauses of this bill. On the face of it, the Family Law Amendment (De Facto Financial Matters and Other Measures) Bill seeks to provide de facto couples, both opposite-sex and same-sex, with access to federal family courts on property and maintenance matters. The intent is to provide for national uniformity for all relationship breakdown matters and to confer jurisdiction on the courts with the best resources for resolving the breakdown of relationships—namely, the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Magistrates Court—exercising jurisdiction under the Family Law Act. It is important to address this for de facto couples. The coalition, while in government, supported, and indeed initiated, moves to legislate to help de facto couples in this regard.
It is of paramount importance that the unique status of marriage be preserved in all legislation that comes before the Senate. That is why de facto couples are treated as distinct from married couples, although relationships in both may result in similar circumstances being treated in a similar manner. Significantly, the title of this bill refers to de facto financial matters, which reflects the intent of the bill, as I have just outlined. However, there is also the matter of ‘other measures’ in the bill’s title. It is about the other measures that I, like many other Australians, have a concern.
Firstly, de facto couples now include same-sex couples. I acknowledge that many people do not have a problem with that. They view relationship breakdown as a generic situation that should be treated the same wherever it occurs. Their reasoning extends to children—that is, if children are involved, the same law should apply regardless of whether the couple is married, heterosexual or same-sex.
But a child is not the biological creation of a same-sex couple. That is biological fiction. So there is a problem under law of treating children being cared for by same-sex couples when there is a breakdown of that relationship, assisted reproduction techniques in surrogacy and other dimensions to the problems, because of genetic material from a non-custodial but biological mother or father. We are left with legal distortions and euphemisms in order to convince ourselves we are treating everyone equally. The government’s proposed amendment to section 60H will effectively give parental status to a lesbian partner of a woman who undergoes an artificial conception procedure. This includes artificial insemination and IV.
Item 7 of proposed new schedule 3A of the bill would introduce a new section 60HB to the Family Law Act which would give parental status to any person for whom an order has been made under prescribed surrogacy law of a state or territory. This is despite the fact that surrogacy laws amongst the states are varied and incomplete. The coalition will be moving amendments to try to improve this situation, but I am concerned that, no matter how hard we try, we are taking steps here that extend the classification of mothers and fathers to people who are not mothers and fathers. In doing so, we undermine marriage, motherhood, fatherhood and the rights of children to a mother and father as we have understood them throughout the whole of the history of humanity.
The government’s amendments in the bill’s proposed schedule 3A state that for ‘children’ should be substituted the following: ‘whether or not the child is biologically a child of the woman and of the other intended parent, for the purposes of this act the child is a child of the woman and of the other intended parent’. The government is proposing that a child can be a child of two people of the same sex—that is, a child can have two mothers. At least the government is no longer suggesting that the child be defined as a product of the relationship of the two same-sex parents—as was originally proposed. A child is not a product, and humans are not the industrial system, with inputs and outputs and people who can be equal substitutes for parents. We are a society, a society that depends fundamentally on marriage and the family for security, survival, continuity and a future. I feel that, with bills like this and the ones to follow on the equal treatment of same-sex partners, we are almost under duress to pass them, such is the pressure and media conditioning of our times.
Bernard Salt, a partner with KPMG, points out in today’s Australian the extremes of political correctness occurring in the UK. He writes:
IN politically correct Britain last month the University of Manchester changed the signage on toilet doors. Apparently transgender students complained that the terms male and female made them feel uncomfortable. As a consequence toilets in the student union building have been relabelled toilets and toilets with urinals.
He described how potential contractors with the Greater London Authority have to complete a diversity monitoring form that includes listing the sexual orientation of their workforce. The categories, according to Bernard Salt, are bisexual, gay, metrosexual and lesbian—and if you want to add another category you are welcome to. Is this the direction in which we are heading? I am afraid it is. There is more persecution of those who are unhappy with this bill than of those who are the intended beneficiaries. Who can argue with equal treatment in these enlightened days? Yet how we deceive ourselves when we create, by law, the fiction that a human baby actually has two mothers! Everyone who was born in this world has been created by a man and a woman. Now we are asked to accept, and legislate for, a new dogma: there shall be a father, a mother and ‘fothers’, let us call them, for we are creating a new class of parent. A ‘fother’ is a person who is not the mother or father in any physical or biological way—or a person who replicates that role in a heterosexual relationship—but a person in a same-sex relationship. This bill will establish a legal structure that creates a second parent of the same sex for a child while denying that child a parent of the other sex. Do such statements make me a homophobe who should be reviled and hounded by human rights and antidiscrimination activists? No doubt they do, but I assert my right to say farewell to the nostalgic days of humanity when a child had a right to a father and a mother.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-10-16,"—I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 5617 revised:
(1)    Schedule 1, item 21, page 10 (lines 20 to 25), omit subclause (5), substitute:
         (5)    For the purposes of this Act a de facto relationship can exist between 2 persons of different sexes and between 2 persons of the same sex.
The first of the opposition’s amendments is to item 21 of the bill. The purpose of the amendment is to omit from the proposed definition of ‘de facto relationship’ in the new section 4AA of the bill the words in subsection (5)—‘a de facto relationship can exist even if one of the persons is legally married to someone else or in another de facto relationship’—so that subsection (5) of the proposed section 4AA would merely provide ‘that for the purposes of the act a de facto relationship can exist between two persons of different sexes and between two persons of the same sex’.
Concern was raised by a number of witnesses before the Senate inquiry into this and related bills that the provisions of the proposed section 4AA(5)(b) would seem to countenance a polygamous situation. It may very well be, particularly having regard to the existing provisions of section 6 of the Family Law Act which are not affected by this bill, that the omission of these words will not change the law, but nor will the inclusion of these words change the law, so we are not, in this context, talking about matters of substance. But there are important issues of symbolism and the use of statutory language which have been an aspect of this debate, and for those reasons the opposition is of the view that paragraph (b) of proposed section 4AA(5) should be deleted.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-10-16,"—The government does not support the amendment. It does not support the primary premise of this amendment that the senator is relying on. The amendment concerns a matter that I took the opportunity of outlining in my summing-up speech: the bill does not provide recognition or endorsement of polygamous relationships. It is unlawful to enter into a polygamous marriage under Australian law and under the laws of the states and territories. The bill itself simply allows a court to determine, taking into account all circumstances, the just and equitable distribution of property between couples in a range of relationships. This is currently the situation under the state and territory laws. In fact, this bill simply picks up the referrals given by the states and territories which were pursued and received by the former government. Those opposite agreed to it, as we understand it, when they were in government. I find it difficult to see—as I think I said during my summing-up, it all now seems bizarre—why the opposition are now continuing on this course.
I can understand sometimes the points the opposition wish to make about it. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs raised in part a whole range of issues that the government took on board. Similarly, the family law section of the Family Law Council raised a whole range of issues, although they were more technical in nature. But it does seem difficult to see why the opposition are continuing to press for this. It does not seem to be even part of what you would sometimes refer to as a belt and braces approach, one that is sometimes adopted in this place as a matter that the opposition might want to pursue. It seems to be an issue that would be a difficult matter for the government to accept with regard to the remarks that have already been made about this. The common law is able and apt to deal with this area.
Quite frankly, we do not think the case is as the opposition have argued. Our advice is that the implication of removing the provision that allows more than one relationship is that there is a greater chance that a court could find that a de facto relationship has to be exclusive of any other relationship, whether that is a marital relationship or another de facto relationship. That seems to be the nub of the issue. The advice that we have on this matter is that you should not remove the provision that allows more than one relationship, and I guess we have to examine this as to the chance that a court would find that a de facto relationship has to be exclusive of any other relationship. In the absence of any clear statutory intervention, the courts have not taken a consistent approach to this issue. There are already some court decisions that indicate exclusivity is required. There are also some other court decisions that indicate that it is not essential. It seems that for that purpose alone, so as to give some certainty, this provision is the best position to adopt. Therefore we should act on the advice that the government and I think should be followed in this instance.
The point seems to be that if we were to follow the opposition’s position we could wait on the common law and await the courts’ decisions. If those decisions are made, and they vary in the primary courts, then you do have a position where you may find that there are different outcomes. It would not be the intention of this government to pursue those. It would then be a matter of waiting for matters to be appealed, with people incurring those expenses, to settle the law in respect of this. I understand that, in that instance, the opposition would want to rely on the common law to pursue the matter. However, in this instance, where we think we have it right and can make a clear legislative intention, that provides the basis upon which the courts may then examine the legislation and determine cases accordingly without recourse to litigation and making the parties go to the expense of finalising these matters, should they need to.
Of course, in this area things are not always litigated. Parties do not always have sufficient funds available to them to litigate, so they are left with a decision they may not wish to have. Therefore, I think it makes more sense to accept the advice that we have about the implication of removing the provision that allows more than one relationship and that there is a greater chance that a court would find that a de facto relationship has to be exclusive of any other relationship. As I said, I dealt with this matter in the summing-up and I would urge the chamber not to accept the amendment as circulated by the opposition. We think this legislation has been sufficiently examined. I know that Senator Brandis, the shadow Attorney-General, has spent a considerable amount of time on examining the provisions of this legislation, so I do not take the position that is being put forward by Senator Brandis lightly. The amendment before us is a matter that Senator Brandis would have turned his mind to in a sufficiently deep way. However, in this instance my advice is contrary to the shadow Attorney-General’s position, so I would ask him to reconsider his position and not pursue the amendment.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2008-10-16,"—The Greens also do not support the amendments circulated by Senator Brandis on behalf of the opposition. I am not exactly sure where the argument comes from that this legislation somehow encourages polygamy or even legitimises it, which seems to be what Senator Brandis is saying. A significant number of heterosexual de facto couples are still married. It is important that, if we are to redefine the meaning of de facto to include same-sex couples, we recognise the diversity of relationships from which people come. It essentially reflects the reality of people’s lives. The Greens believe that the weaker party in a relationship should be recognised by the courts, and that is where one part of a couple is considered to be currently in another relationship, de facto or married. The partner in this relationship should still be recognised as a partner of that relationship.
To suggest that the parliament would somehow be endorsing polygamy is simply ridiculous, or perhaps, as the minister said, bizarre. It is simply, as I said, a reflection of the reality of people’s lives, and so to deny court access to a partner upon the break-up of their relationship is irresponsible and unjust.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2008-10-16,"—I think the opposition’s amendments fail to pick up that this legislation is not about polygamist relationships; it is actually about protecting people who might be vulnerable in accessing their rightful entitlements. I give to you the situation of a couple who marry early in life and eventually leave each other. They have no further contact with each other but they remain legally married. If they were to enter into long-term de facto relationships with other people, there could be a situation where their previous marital status is not disclosed even to their de facto partner. They would have an understanding, being in a de facto relationship, that they would have access to a certain set of entitlements, and they would not know that those entitlements could be denied to them by virtue of the fact that their partner is legally married to someone else. So I have a great deal of concern about the opposition’s amendments in that regard.
You occasionally hear in the media, or read in the tabloids, stories about people who have multiple families and have led lives of deception. This legislation is not about morally condoning such relationships; it is about making sure that, if people are vulnerable to those kinds of relationships, they have some legal recourse to protect their interests and their children’s interests. For that reason, I oppose the amendments.
On indulgence, I would like to discuss some amendments that have not yet been moved. My remarks extend to the current section 60H of the Family Law Act. This section ensures that, where a woman gives birth to a child as a result of an artificial conception procedure, both the woman and her male partner are recognised as the child’s parents. It also ensures that, if genetic material from a third person was used to conceive the child, that third person will not be recognised as the child’s parent. The only proviso is that the woman and her partner must have consented to the procedure and that any third party who provided genetic material must have consented to the use of that material in an artificial conception procedure. The section has this effect even if there is no relevant state or territory law that provides that the woman concerned and her partner are the child’s parents. Only this section provides this independent Commonwealth recognition, without relying on state and territory law. It provides specific, explicit, independent recognition and protection under Commonwealth law to all couples who have children with the assistance of artificial conception procedures.
This section provides equal protection to married and opposite-sex de facto couples. The section will apply to opposite-sex de facto couples as if they were married. It provides all those couples and their children with the protection and reassurance that comes from knowing, with certainty, that the Commonwealth regards their parent-child relationships as legitimate. There are countless families out there right now—countless husbands, wives, mothers and fathers in de facto relationships, daughters, sons, grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins—who all rely on reassurance and protection of their legal status. They are all relying on the Commonwealth to acknowledge, without reservation, that their children belong to their family and not to any other.
The government is proposing to extend this protection to lesbian couples so that, where a woman gives birth to a child as a result of an artificial conception procedure, both the woman and her female partner will be recognised as the child’s parents. The coalition objects to the government’s amendment because the government’s approach allegedly homogenises same-sex relationships with marriage relationships and treats them identically. The coalition has circulated its own amendment and it contains two separate provisions—one provides recognition for the husbands of birth mothers who conceive as the result of an artificial conception procedure and the other provides recognition for the male or female de facto partners of birth mothers who conceive as the result of an artificial conception procedure.
The coalition’s second provision for de facto couples—but not its provision for married couples—differs from the government’s provision in two significant ways. Firstly, it refers to the de facto partner of the birth mothers as ‘the other person in the relationship’, whereas the government’s amendment refers to ‘the other intended parent’. Secondly, it specifies that the child conceived ‘is the child of’ the birth mother and ‘is deemed to be the child of the other person in the relationship’, whereas the government amendment says that the child ‘is the child of’ both the birth mother and the other intended parent.
The coalition’s desire not to treat same-sex couples like married couples stands to undermine the legitimacy of the parent-child relationships of all de facto couples, both same-sex and straight, who conceive as a result of artificial conception procedures. It wants to say to same-sex couples: ‘We can possibly manage to treat you like you are parents. We can possibly manage to accept the reality that your children and all those who deal with them work on the assumption that you are parents. But we do not actually want to call you parents because we all know that really you are not parents—you are just pretending to be parents. Therefore, we only deem you to be parents.’ In the process, the coalition are putting at risk the existing rights of the many heterosexual de facto couples who conceive through artificial conception procedures.
Australia abolished all distinctions in legal status between so-called legitimate and illegitimate children in the 1970s, and in the 1980s the states referred their powers in relation to the children of unmarried parents to the Commonwealth to ensure that all children would be treated equally for the purposes of family law specifically. Everyone in Australia had thought that the days when children were discriminated against because of their parents’ marital status—the days when, through no fault of their own, children were branded as ‘bastards’—were behind us. That was until the opposition foreshadowed this particular amendment. The children of married couples using artificial conception procedures and donor sperm will now have two parents, while the children of de facto couples in the same situation will have one parent and another person who is ‘deemed to be a parent’—whatever that is supposed to mean.
This is a pernicious and evil distinction, the legal consequences of which are dangerously uncertain. To take just one example: what does this distinction mean for tracing rules? What does it mean for siblings, grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins whose relationship to the child is through the person who is only ‘deemed’ to be a parent? In an attempt to pander, I think, to the homophobic prejudices of some of its members the coalition is undermining for many families the protection and reassurance that comes from knowing with certainty that the Commonwealth regards their parent-child relationships as legitimate. That is why we should acknowledge without reservation that those children belong to those families and not to any other.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-10-16,"—The government of course is acting responsibly by recognising that surrogacy is a reality today. Of course, the act already has laws that allow for the transfer of legal parentage from the surrogate mother to the commissioning parent. Victoria’s lower house of parliament has just recently passed the Assisted Reproductive Treatment Bill, which gives greater recognition to surrogacy arrangements in the state. Also, Mr Colin Barnett, Premier of Western Australia, has said the reintroduction of surrogacy laws is one of the first priorities for his government. The proposed government amendment introducing section 60HB recognises the reality that courts can and do transfer legal parentage as a result of a surrogacy arrangement—and it will be difficult to deny that this happens. Failure to recognise these orders would perpetuate inappropriate inconsistencies between state and federal laws and continue confusion and discriminatory treatment for families.

                    (i)    any property being distributed; or
                   (ii)    any maintenance being paid;
                       under the agreement.
(5)    This subitem is satisfied for the choice if:
              (a)    the choice is in writing and signed by both of the parties to the de facto relationship; and
              (b)    each of the parties was provided, before the choice was signed by him or her, with:
                    (i)    independent legal advice from a legal practitioner about the advantages and disadvantages, at the time that the advice was provided, to the party of making the choice; and
                   (ii)    a signed statement by the legal practitioner stating that this advice was given to the party.
(6)    For the purposes of Part VIIIAB of the new Act, a choice can be included in a Part VIIIAB financial agreement for which the parties are the spouse parties.
Setting aside a choice
(7)    A court may make an order setting aside a choice if the court is satisfied that, having regard to the circumstances in which the choice was made, it would be unjust and inequitable if the court does not set the choice aside.
(8)    A court setting aside a choice under subitem (7) may make such order or orders (including an order for the transfer of property) as it considers just and equitable to, so far as is practicable, return the rights of:
              (a)    the parties to the de facto relationship; and
              (b)    any other interested persons affected by the choice;
to their position immediately before the choice was made.
(9)    Subsections 90UM(8) and (9) of the new Act apply in relation to setting aside a choice as if:
              (a)    a reference in those subsections to subsection 90UM(1) or (6) of the new Act were a reference to subitem (7) or (8); and
              (b)    the reference in those subsections to section 90UM of the new Act were a reference to this item.
Statement of reasons: why certain amendments should be moved as requests
Section 53 of the Constitution is as follows:

Powers of the Houses in respect of legislation

53. Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate. But a proposed law shall not be taken to appropriate revenue or moneys, or to impose taxation, by reason only of its containing provisions for the imposition or appropriation of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment or appropriation of fees for licences, or fees for services under the proposed law.
The Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government.
The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people.
The Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments, with or without modifications.
Except as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws.

Amendments (7), (12), (13), (15), (16), (38) and (46)

The effect of these amendments is to increase the number of individuals in respect of whom an amount may be paid out under the standing appropriation in section 21 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 in relation to the Special Account continued in existence by section 73 of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988. They are covered by section 53 because they will increase a “proposed charge or burden on the people”.

Amendment (53)

The effect of these amendments is to increase the number of individuals in respect of whom an amount may be paid out under the standing appropriation in:
section 21 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 in relation to the Special Account continued in existence by section 73 of the Child Support (Registration and Collection) Act 1988; and
section 125 of the Health Insurance Act 1973; and
section 137 of the National Health Act 1953.
The amendments are covered by section 53 because they will increase a “proposed charge or burden on the people”.

Consequential amendments

The following amendments are consequential on amendments (7), (12), (13), (15), (16), (38) and (46):
(14), (17), (34), (35), (36), (37), (40), (41), (42), (43), (44) and (45)
Statement by the Clerk of the Senate pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000

Amendments (7), (12), (13), (15), (16), (38), (46) and (53)

The Senate has long followed the practice that it should treat as requests amendments which would result in increased expenditure under a standing appropriation, although this interpretation is not consistent with other elements of the established interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution. This has nothing to do with the introduction of bills under the first paragraph of section 53.
If it is correct that these amendments increase the number of individuals eligible for payments and benefits payable from standing appropriations, it is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate that the amendments be moved as requests.

Amendments (14), (17), (34) to (37), and (40) to (45)

These amendments are consequential on the requests. It is the practice of the Senate that amendments purely consequential on amendments framed as requests should also be framed as requests.
Government amendment (7), on a child of a de facto relationship and changes to parenting presumptions, will amend the definition of ‘child of a relationship’ for the purposes of the act. The amendment provides that a child is a child of a de facto relationship if the child is a child of both parties to the relationship. Government amendments (12) to (17) go to the geographical requirement. Government amendments (12) to (17) address issues raised by the Law Council of Australia’s family law section where de facto couples move to a referring state or territory during their relationship and separate before being ordinarily resident there for at least one-third of their de facto relationship. These amendments provide for couples in these circumstances to be able to access the regime if they are ordinarily resident in a referring state or territory when their relationship breaks down.
Government amendments (34) to (38)—and I can deal at the same time with amendments (40) to (46), which relate to opting into the new regime—implement the bipartisan recommendation 4 of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report on the bill. The amendments insert a procedure enabling de facto couples in one of those states, or in a territory, whose relationship has broken down before the new Commonwealth de facto property settlement and spouse maintenance regime commences and who have yet to finalise issues between them to opt in to the new regime by mutual agreement.
The choice made to opt in will be subject to safeguards. These include requirements that the choice be in writing and signed by each party and be made only after each party has received independent legal advice and been given a signed statement by the legal practitioner that the advice was given. The opt-in procedure should also be available for de facto couples in South Australia and Western Australia if either of those states refer power, as other states have done.
I did take the opportunity earlier in my remarks of commenting on the legal and constitutional affairs committee report, of which we have adopted recommendation 4. From the government’s perspective, it is pleasing that we can do two things: firstly, compliment the legal and constitutional affairs committee for their work in this area and for making substantive recommendations in respect of what is complex legislation and, secondly, recognise that this government has sought to act on and implement those recommendations.
With those remarks, I commend these amendments to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech

Government amendment (53) inserts a new section setting out the rules for determining when a child is a child of a person who has or had a de facto partner. The proposed amendment provides that a person is a de facto partner either when they are one of a couple registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory or they are in a de facto relationship with another person. Government amendment (53) also substitutes a new section 60H(1), which would apply where a child is born as a result of artificial conception procedures to a married couple or to current or former de facto partners who are of the same sex or different sexes. The expanded operation of the provisions would mean that a female same-sex de facto couple would be recognised as the parents of a child born where the couple consented to the artificial conception procedure relating to the birth of the child. In other words, the child would be recognised as the child of the woman giving birth and her de facto partner.
In addition, genetic material from other than the couple must be used with the relevant donor’s consent. Subsection 60H(1) now only requires the consent of the couple undergoing the procedure; it is silent as to the consent of any donors. The requirement that the donor consent is considered a necessary safeguard to ensure that genetic material is not used without the knowledge of the donor. Consent is seen as the fundamental principle in the regulation of conception procedures.
Turning to the issue of children born under surrogacy arrangements, new section 60HB is proposed to deal with children born under surrogacy arrangements regulated by state and territory laws. It provides that, where a court order has been made under a prescribed law of a state or territory relating to the parentage of a child, that court order will determine the parentage of the child. Where a surrogacy arrangement is involved, opposite-sex married or de facto couples and female or male same-sex de facto couples will be recognised as the parents of a child if there is a state or territory court order transferring parentage to them.
Dealing with the issue of children born before or after commencement, the amendments in new schedule 3A apply to children born before, on or after commencement so that the greatest possible number of children benefit from the changes. It is considered that for Family Law Act purposes all children of same-sex couples who would be recognised under the new provisions should be provided with benefits such as their same-sex parents being able to access the Family Court and having two parents recognised by the act.
The amendments in new schedule 3A commence on royal assent and apply to children born before, on or after commencement so that, as I said, the greatest possible number of children benefit from the changes. However, parentage presumptions in the Family Law Act are already applied by a number of acts relating to social security, child support and health. Some of these acts are also being amended by the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—General Law Reform) Bill 2008. It is necessary to align the application of the amendments in new schedule 3A with the commencement of the amendments to those acts by the same-sex general law reform bill. In most cases, the amendments in new schedule 3A will apply to these other acts on and after 1 July 2009. For the Health Insurance Act 1973 and the National Health Act 1953, they will apply on and after 1 January 2009. Of course, the purpose of that is to ensure the smooth implementation of the government’s wider same-sex reforms. Additionally, this will provide time for agencies to train their staff, to amend forms or procedures and to introduce new software or other technologies.
I also thank the Attorney-General, from a service delivery perspective, for providing some time for the agencies that I administer, which include Centrelink and Medicare, to look at these issues to ensure that our procedures and forms are appropriate for the legislative requirements and that our staff are trained to follow the legislative requirements. With all of these things it is helpful to be provided with sufficient lead time for that to occur. Given the complexity of some of this legislation, that will allow time to write guidelines and procedures for staff to follow. It will also allow time for individuals who may be affected by these changes to adjust. We cannot lose sight of the fact that there are individuals who will be affected by this legislation who will want to understand the implications that are contained within it, and we should allow time for them to digest the legislation and for their adjustment processes. With that, I commend the government’s request to the chamber.
I also seek to table the supplementary explanatory memoranda, which I failed to do at the commencement of the committee stage. I was just going to see whether or not the opposition have had an opportunity of looking at the supplementary explanatory memorandum.
—Yes, we’ve seen it.
—I am advised that the opposition have had the opportunity of looking at that. I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum and a revised supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments and requests for amendments to be moved to this bill. The memoranda were circulated in the chamber on 18 September and 14 October 2008.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2008-10-16,"—I would just like to acknowledge that the Greens support the government request for amendment. The issue in relation to parenting presumptions was a major concern raised during the inquiry. The concern was that 60H needed to be gender neutral in order to appropriately cover the children of lesbian couples. While the use of gender neutral language is needed, in order to capture all parents we would need to see a complete overhaul of current surrogacy legislation to ensure that there are uniform surrogacy laws across the board. The Greens are pleased that the government has adopted the committee’s recommendation and we fully support the amendment to sections 60H and 90RB.
I would just like to say again that the Greens are very pleased that the government is moving these amendments and we would like to see the legislation passed immediately. Enough is enough. It is 2008. We have been discussing the need for equality for same-sex couples for decades, and yet discrimination is continuing to occur on a daily basis. We must not delay these vital changes any longer. We need to see same-sex couples given the same decency, respect and equality in law that heterosexual couples get so that their families have the entitlement to the support, recognition and equality they deserve.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech

6  Subsection 60H(1)
Repeal the subsection, substitute:
         (1)    If:
              (a)    a child is born to a woman as a result of the carrying out of an artificial conception procedure while the woman was married to another person (her husband); and

              (c)    the child is the child of the woman, and is deemed to be the child of the other person in the relationship; and
              (d)    if a person other than the woman and the other person in the relationship provided genetic material—the child is not the child of that person.
This, the second of the opposition’s two amendments to the bill, proposes to replace section 60H(1) of the existing act with words alternative to the words proposed by the government. It does that by proposing a new section 60H(1) and a new section 60H(1A), which deal with the circumstances of children who come into the world as a result of an artificial conception procedure.
Before I go through the detail of the amendments, let me explain what the opposition’s approach to this particular aspect of the bill has been, because Senator Pratt a few moments ago made some observations in anticipation of this amendment which were utterly wide of the mark and could not for a moment be rationally countenanced by anyone. The opposition’s approach, which has by and large reflected a spirit of bipartisanship with the government on this bill, has been, in this series of reforms, to respect four principles, which do not always sit perfectly comfortably together.
The first of those principles is to acknowledge and respect the unique and privileged status of marriage among all domestic relationships and to acknowledge that a marriage can only exist between a man and a woman. As to the latter proposition, there has been no cavil from the government.
The second principle which has informed the opposition’s approach to this legislation—as I outlined when I spoke on the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—Superannuation) Bill 2008 the evening before last—is our commitment to the principle that people in homosexual relationships should be absolutely protected from discrimination or any disability arising from differential treatment on account of their sexuality. The way in which one reconciles the unique status of marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman and the need to protect homosexual people from any discrimination against them in their relationships on the ground of their sexuality has been to equate the domestic de facto relationships of opposite-sex couples with the domestic relationships of homosexual couples. And that principle, as we understand it, has informed the government thinking as well.
The third principle which the legislation reflects, and to which the opposition subscribes, is to accept the appropriateness of having all relationship breakdowns dealt with by a single court, the Family Court of Australia, or the Federal Magistrates Court in exercising its jurisdiction under the Family Law Act, according to a common set of principles.
This is legislation which had its genesis with the Howard government when the references of power under which this legislation proceeds were originally arranged. So it was in fact the idea of the previous government that de facto relationship disputes should be brought into the Family Court of Australia or the Federal Magistrates Court, where appropriate. The significant further development to the principle which has been effected by this government, with the opposition’s support, is to extend that coverage to both same-sex and opposite-sex de facto relationships.
The fourth principle that informs the opposition’s thinking is the importance of ensuring children are not less favourably treated in relationship breakdowns, regardless of the nature of the household—whether it is a married household, whether it is an opposite-sex de facto household or whether it is a same-sex household. Children, in whatever the circumstance of the relationship may be, should not be less favourably treated. It is a simple principle of justice that that cannot be countenanced or allowed to happen.
In reconciling those four principles, it seems to the opposition that there is a more appropriate way of dealing with section 60H, which we accept needs to be amended so as to deal with the situation in particular of same-sex couples who may decide to bring a child into the world through an artificial conception procedure in relation to one of the two women in such a relationship. The approach of the government has been to homogenise all of the different categories of relationships—marriages, opposite-sex, de facto and same-sex relationships—into a single category. That is of concern to us.
Senator Boswell made a contribution earlier on in which he reflected with, I think, great passion the sensitivities that many more conservative members of the community feel, in particular in relation to the issue of—to use a shorthand expression—gay parenting. I have made it as clear as can be on behalf of the opposition that we absolutely and without hesitation support the government’s attempts to remove discrimination against gay couples. I could not have been more emphatic about that than I was in the speech that I gave in this place the night before last. But, equally, in achieving and moving towards that beneficial law reform, it would be reckless of us to fail to heed the sensitivities and concerns of the very large number of Australians who for religious or ethical reasons find the notion of gay parenting quite a confronting thing to grasp and for whom it sits very uncomfortably.
The opposition therefore suggests a way through this which preserves the principle of non-discrimination in this particularly difficult area but nevertheless respects the sensitivities that were reflected, for example, by Senator Boswell in his contribution—that is, in dealing with the issue in section 60H, to make a distinction between married relationships, as we propose in our new section 60H(1), and de facto relationships, as we would propose in section 60H(1A). De facto relationships would of course incorporate both opposite-sex and same-sex relationships. By doing that we avoid the risk of, as I said earlier, homogenising all forms of domestic relationships so that, for example, marriages and same-sex de facto relationships are treated as if they were the same thing. They are not the same thing and the government does not seek to make them the same thing, because there is no proposal before the parliament to amend the Marriage Act and change the definition of a marriage as being a relationship between a man and a woman.
The second way in which the opposition respectfully suggests that this difficult issue is best dealt with is by removing the word ‘parent’ entirely from section 60H, section 60H(1) and section 60H(1A). In the amendment that we offer to the Senate, the word ‘parent’ is not used in relation to either de facto or indeed married relationships. Nothing is lost by that other than the offence to the sensitivities of more conservative Australians that the idea of gay parenting might present. What this is about, as I said at the start, is the rights of children. It is unambiguously the case in the opposition’s amendment that children of all types of households—married households, opposite-sex de facto households and gay households—will be treated equivalently. There will be no discrimination; there will be no distinction made. The observations that Senator Pratt made in her contribution before were, frankly, dead wrong and quite irrational. There is no logical or legal difference in the treatment of children among those different categories of household. But by the avoidance of the use of the word ‘parent’ in relation to all categories, we avoid giving offence to the sensitivities of some of our more conservative fellow Australians.
I conclude on that point: when, particularly with bipartisanship, legislation that does acknowledge and usher into being very important social change is passed through the parliament, it is in everyone’s interest to make sure that the concerns not just of the activists but of people of a more conservative disposition are taken into account and respected. Given that there is no respect whatsoever in which the right to equal treatment of gay people is not respected by this legislation and that there is no respect whatsoever that the right to equal treatment of children, in all varieties of households, is not respected by the opposition’s amendment, it would seem prudent to bring about this important social change in the rather more sensitive way that the opposition commends.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2008-10-16,"—I thank Senator Brandis for his exposition of the coalition’s position. I think it was quite an honest exposition in terms of the concerns that have driven the coalition’s approach in relation to this. I put to Senator Brandis a couple of matters that were put to me by Senator Pratt in a document she provided to me just before question time. There is a concern with this particular amendment—and if Senator Brandis could clarify some of these concerns—that, firstly, there may be issues of legitimacy in relation to children of what is defined as ‘the other person in the relationship’; secondly, does it put at risk the existing rights of the many heterosexual de facto couples who conceive through artificial conception procedures; and, thirdly, is Senator Brandis aware of legislation in other states? Senator Pratt and I had a brief conversation about this—I hope she does not mind me referring to it. In her home state of Western Australia there were similar changes to the law, as I understand it, based on what was very similar to what is before us now in terms of the government’s amendments. To what extent is this breaking new ground in the context of what the government is proposing and also what the opposition is proposing? Are there precedents, if you like, in terms of the approach taken by the opposition to these amendments? If I can reiterate, I understand the coalition’s position in relation to this, but I think they are legitimate questions to ask in the context of this debate.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-10-16,"—I say through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, to Senator Xenophon that they are most appropriate questions to ask and I am very grateful that he did. Let me answer them. The first question you put, Senator Xenophon, is: would the opposition’s proposed amendment put a question mark on the issue of the legitimacy of children? I assume you are talking about children in de facto relationships. The answer to that question is, unequivocally, no—not even a possibility. I cannot begin to imagine what fanciful document Senator Pratt may have produced to you, Senator Xenophon, but if the document suggested that the effect of the opposition’s amendment was otherwise then it is pure rubbish.
The language that the opposition suggests, if I may read it, is that, in the circumstance of an artificial reproductive technology being used in a de facto relationship giving rise to the birth of a child, subsection (c) of the opposition’s proposed amendment states:
(c) the child is the child of the woman, and is deemed to be the child of the other person in the relationship …
It is also a given that the child is not the biological child of the other person in the relationship, so a legal connection has to be established between the other person in the relationship and the child. That legal connection is established by the use of the words ‘is deemed to be the child’. Senator Xenophon, I cannot remember if you are a legally trained gentleman or not, but may I tell you that a deeming provision—which is a very commonplace form of statutory usage, as you, Mr Temporary Chairman, of course know—applies subject to its terms for all purposes. So there is no possible set of circumstances in which the operation or the correct application of these statutory words could result in any result otherwise than the child being the child of the other person. So the answer to your first question, as I said, is unequivocally no.
The second question you asked is: does it put at risk the existing rights of heterosexual couples who have conceived through ART procedures? Again, for precisely the same reasons, the answer to your question is unequivocally no.
The third question you asked is, having regard to the legislation that may exist in some of the other states or territories, whether or not the government’s or the opposition’s amendments break new ground. I am not in a position to tell you what specific statutory words may have been used in other states and territories—and I imagine this is uncontroversial between the minister and me—but the whole purpose of this bill is of course so that the Family Court of Australia, or the Federal Magistrates Court, exercising family law jurisdiction, will be the sole court that will be seized of these matters in all of this range of circumstances. Because section 60H will cover children born as a result of ART into marriages, into heterosexual de facto relationships and into same-sex de facto relationships, that would seem to cover the field. So the Commonwealth legislation would overtake whatever might possibly be—though I am not aware of it—inconsistent statutory language in the states.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2008-10-16,"—I thank Senator Brandis for his answer. I am legally trained but I do not profess to have Senator Brandis’s skills. It has been about 10 years since I have done any practice as a personal injuries lawyer. Senator Ludwig, in terms of the point made by Senator Brandis that in a substantive sense the rights are not altered, is it more a question of terminology—that in a substantive sense the rights of the child are not in any way affected both in relation to the rights of the child and the rights of the persons in the relationship referred to in the context of this particular amendment?",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2008-10-16,"—The short answer is that the substantive rights are not gavelled by the amendment being proposed. The substantive point is this: this amendment to the Family Law Act changes the nature of what a parent is in some people’s minds. What the government says, though, is that the amendment may be motivated by the discomfort of some members opposite towards gay and lesbian parenting. Let us be clear about this: the changes will affect not only gay and lesbian couples but also heterosexual couples who use ART to have a child, and they form the bulk of couples using ART. It is one of those areas where you either agree to remove discrimination from legislation or you do not. There is difficulty with this question: what is the difference between saying that a child is a child of a married couple but is to be deemed to be the child of a heterosexual couple or same-sex de facto couple? Think about that for a moment.
Let me rephrase it. I have the Child Support Agency within my portfolio and I have Centrelink, which deal with married couples and marital breakdown. They also deal with de facto couples. They deal with about 6.5 million customers. What you are saying to certain people is that their child will be deemed to be either the child of a heterosexual couple or a same-sex de facto couple. Very quickly that becomes the nomenclature that attaches to these people. The message that it sends is, quite frankly, not the message that you would want to be part of. The message it sends to children of couples is that they do not really believe that you are their parent but, for the sake of the law, they will deem you. In this legislation, in the family law area, language is very important to people. It is one of those areas where it could be categorised as an example of the opposition wishing to perpetuate discrimination that they are committed to removing. I do not want to ascribe that to the opposition but it really stretches me as to why they cannot accept the word ‘parent’.
I know that children will regard them as parents, not as ‘deemed heterosexual or same-sex de facto parents’. It is a long piece of language to subscribe to someone, so either you agree or disagree. Substantive provision will not be unchanged by that—I think that is right—but it is a simple statement about whether these people are parents. What the opposition is proposing with this amendment is to remove the word ‘parent’ from a section that confers parental rights and responsibilities and to reintroduce discrimination between married couples and de facto couples, both heterosexual and same-sex.
The substantive effect of the section will not be changed by the amendment. However, as members of the opposition have stated time and time again in relation to this bill and related bills, language is important. Language is important, and that is why we do not agree with Senator Brandis’s position. We do not agree that we should accept the amendment. We do not accept that the word ‘deeming’ should be in the legislation in that way. The position of those opposite might be motivated by a range of issues in respect of gay and lesbian parents.
Let us be clear about this: the changes affect not only gay and lesbian couples. They also affect heterosexual couples who use ART to have a child—the bulk of those who use ART. It also ignores the fact that for the past 20 years the Family Law Act has treated married couples and de facto heterosexual couples in the same way when children have been born by artificial conception procedures. What is the difference between saying that a child is a child of a married couple but is deemed to be the child of a heterosexual or same-sex de facto couple? It sends the wrong message, quite frankly, and language in this act is important. The Family Law Act deals with a whole range of family law matters that will be dealt with by suburban solicitors right through to senior counsel. When you then use the phrase ‘deemed to be the child of the heterosexual or same-sex de facto couple’ the message is wrong, quite frankly. You either agree that they are parents or you do not. I do not think there is anywhere in this debate where you can say that you can walk both sides of the street.
It sends the message to children of such couples that we do not really believe that those couples are the parents, but for the sake of the law we will deem them to be so. That language then gets used in guidelines and procedures, by Centrelink and Medicare in dealing with a whole range of issues, and by the Child Support Agency. Why? Because it is in the legislation and we have to follow the legislation and use the language that is contained within it. Therefore that is what you are perpetuating if you accept the amendments moved by Senator Brandis.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-10-16,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, through you to Senator Xenophon—you got your answer from Senator Ludwig in the first sentence he uttered and then several times again during of his contribution. The government’s position is that the opposition’s amendment would not cause any substantive change to the law whatsoever. That is the answer, quite unequivocally, and of course the minister is right. Senator Ludwig and I seem to be in furious agreement about this. It is about terminology and messaging.
The opposition rejects as preposterous the suggestion that the opposition’s amendment involves any discrimination simply on the basis of sexual preference. Opposite-sex and same-sex de facto couples are treated identically, so it cannot logically be said that there is any discrimination against gay people in the opposition’s amendment. On the other hand the opposition makes no apology for treating marriage and de facto relationships as being categorically different. That does not mean that the consequences of the breakdown of such relationships may not be identical and that the treatment of the consequences of the breakdown of those relationships may not be identical. We make no apology for treating marriage as having, as I said before, a unique and privileged status. We note that the government has not sought to amend the definitions in the Marriage Act so we assume by application that the government agrees with us.
Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, to Senator Xenophon—test the logic of what Senator Ludwig has said to you like this: Senator Ludwig says there is something wicked about not using the word ‘parent’. There are only three ways in which the law might acknowledge that a person is the parent of a child or that a child is the child of a person. Firstly, the most obvious case is if the child is the biological child of that person. If the child is the biological child of that person it is uncontroversial that that person is the parent of the child and the child is the child of that parent. You do not even need to say that in the Family Law Act for that to be a commonplace. Secondly, a child may become the child of a person who is not their biological parent by adoption. This amendment does not deal with adoption but we all know that when a child is adopted then for all purposes the adoptive parent becomes the same as the biological parent. I do not think this is quite the statutory language as elsewhere in the Family Law Act or the states’ statutes but he is deemed to be the parent and standing in the shoes of the biological parent for all purposes.
Thirdly, a person may be acknowledged as the parent of a child or a child might be recognised as the child of a particular person, other than biologically or through adoption, if for some reason the law declares it to be so. The law deems it to be so even though the child is neither the biological nor necessarily the adoptive child of that person. And that is this case of artificial reproductive technology where you have a situation in which the child is the biological child of another. There is no question about that. The mother is in a lesbian relationship with another woman and the law then deems that child to be the child of the other person in the relationship. It may well be, depending on what the state and territory laws permit, that that person will go on to adopt that child. But the operation of this provision does not depend upon the adoption because it deems the child, without the need for there to be an adoption, to be the child of the other person in the relationship.
Through you again, Mr Temporary Chairman, to Senator Xenophon—test the logic of the minister’s answer this way. Let us focus on the birth mother, the biological mother of the child. Does anyone seriously suggest that you need a specific provision in the Family Law Act to say that the biological child of a mother is the child of that mother so as to make the birth mother the parent of the child? Of course not. It is preposterous. You do not need to amend the Family Law Act to say that when a woman gives birth to a child she is that child’s mother, that child’s parent. Of course you do not. Therefore if you look at the opposition’s amendment, through you Mr Temporary Chairman, Senator Xenophon, subclause (c) says:
... the child is the child of the woman ...
That is the birth mother. We do not need to use the word ‘parent’ there. Nobody doubts what the biological relationship is. It goes on:
... and is deemed to be the child of the other person in the relationship ...
This is a person, who, it is a premise of this argument, is not biologically related to the child. So you do have to create a legal mechanism. You have to declare or deem it as a matter of law to be the case otherwise it would not be the case. That is all the opposition’s amendment does.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2008-10-16,"—I still do not see that the argument from the coalition is convincing in any way. Yes, we are talking about terminology, but to suggest that the word ‘parent’ is not important in the relationship between a child and their mother and their father is preposterous. It is absolutely essential to strengthening that relationship, to giving a foundation for the roles and responsibilities for the people involved in that relationship. Yes, it is about terminology, but it is absolutely important.
I am astounded that this amendment by the opposition seems to just be put in here without any kind of understanding of the ramifications for heterosexual couples around the country. We are not just talking about the relationship between parents and children of same-sex couples; we are talking about affecting the fundamental understanding of the roles and responsibilities that underpin the word ‘parent’ with regard to even heterosexual couples. If I were in a relationship and my partner was shooting blanks, so to speak, and I needed to go and get assistance to enable us to create a child, under these amendments the opposition is saying that my husband is not the parent of my child. There are families around the country who would be absolutely appalled to hear that this is the position being put forward by the opposition. The word ‘parent’ is absolutely essential to understanding the roles and responsibilities that we as mothers and fathers, regardless of our sexuality, have with our children. It sets a foundation, and in this place where we make the laws of the country it is absolutely important for us to understand how significant those terminologies are, how significant this symbol of what they carry is. For the opposition to suggest that somehow because I am unable to create a child with the partner of my choice I am therefore not the mother or the father is absolutely offensive and preposterous.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-10-16,"—Senator Hanson-Young, you could not possibly be more wrong than you are. It would be almost impossible for you to have fallen further into error than you have fallen in your contribution. First of all, your assertion that this amendment would have implication for existing heterosexual couples who have used artificial reproduction technology to conceive is absolutely wrong. It has none whatsoever, and only somebody who is profoundly ignorant of the law could suggest otherwise. Secondly, Senator Hanson-Young, you must have, if I may say so with respect, a very strange notion of family if you think that a child needs the reassurance of the Family Law Act to know who its parents are. Do you think that a child is going to be unsettled in its certainty about who its parents are because section 60H(1A) of the Family Law Act does not use the word ‘parent’? I cannot imagine any circumstance whatsoever in which it would occur to anyone to imagine that a child would be consulting the Family Law Act to be better informed about who its parents are. Children know who their parents are. We all know that.
Thirdly and finally—and it is a point I should have made in response to the minister before—if the use of the word ‘parent’ in section 60H(1) is such a big deal, why isn’t the word used in the existing section 60H(1)? This debate has proceeded merrily along a false premise that the opposition is proposing that we displace from section 60H(1) of the Family Law Act a usage—that is, the word ‘parent’. But we are not. Section 60H(1) does not contain the word now. So what the opposition is proposing is, in terms of the terminology and the adoption of the word ‘parent’ in the terminology, no different. It is different in other respects, but in terms of the use of terminology it is no different at all from the statutory provision which our amendment would repeal and replace.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2008-10-16,"—Senator Brandis earlier critiqued my remarks in relation to legitimate and illegitimate children. In debating the opposition’s amendments in relation to this matter, I am using that distinction because what the opposition’s amendments do is create a distinction in status between parents who use donor gametes in order to conceive their child. You have two different statuses for two different sets of parents: married parents and unmarried parents. You are prepared to call the married parents parents for the purposes of this act but you are only deeming unmarried people to be parents. That is the reason for my bringing up that example of illegitimate versus legitimate.
We have removed the distinctions between married and unmarried parents for the purposes of family law. These amendments quite clearly bring us back to the days where we have a different set of characteristics for married and unmarried parents—hence my argument with regard to legitimate and illegitimate children. I think this is an unfortunate precedent to be reintroducing into the law. People who need to use donor gametes have struggled through the angst of infertility; through the decision to use reproductive technology, which is not an easy one; through the trauma and the heartache that the use of such technology often involves; through the pregnancy, the birth and the problems with breast-feeding; through the sleepless nights—through all the processes of adjustment, mental and social, that come with the transition to parenthood. These are much-wanted children. You could not have more willing parents than people who resort to using reproductive technology, and they should be referred to as parents within the law.
Senator Brandis raised the fact that the section currently does not use the word ‘parent’. The new provisions do, and you are introducing a distinction between someone who is referred to as a parent versus someone who is deemed to be a parent. The distinction is important. Senator Brandis also raised the issue of adoption. These provisions are very much designed to make adoption unnecessary. Adoption is for when you need to sever the relationship with the previous parent, so I think that that was an unfortunate analogy on the part of Senator Brandis.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-10-16,"—With respect, it was not an analogy. I was merely pointing out that there are ways other than through birth that a parent-child relationship can come into existence. The other ways are by legal rules, of which the most commonly recognised is by adoption, which is not this case. But in the case of the other person in a relationship which has taken advantage of an artificial conception procedure, then the other person in the relationship is, by operation of the law—because it is obviously not through a biological relationship—put in a relationship with the child. Hence, although you, with respect, Senator Pratt, and others have cavilled at the word ‘deem’, that is in fact merely a commonplace, unremarkable way in which a legal relationship is created by statute because a biological relationship does not exist.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2008-10-16,"—I apologise for being ignorant. I guess it is perhaps because the argument put by the opposition has been so pathetic in terms of explaining why these amendments need to be put forward. I would ask Senator Brandis to explain to me why a married couple who need assistance in sorting out their reproductive issues are somehow more parents than those who are not married but are in a de facto relationship—regardless, I must point out, of whether they are in a same-sex or opposite-sex relationship.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-10-16,"—The opposition does not say that. That is not our position. But it is our position that marriage, as I said earlier, is a unique and privileged relationship in our society. We respect and demand equal treatment for other domestic relationships, both opposite-sex and same-sex, but one cannot, at the same time, say that marriage is a unique and privileged institution and that it is the same thing as other domestic relationships, both opposite-sex and same-sex, which we respect. This has nothing to do with the way in which this bears on children because, as I also said earlier, one of the principles that guide the opposition’s approach to this is to ensure that there is no differential treatment of children whatsoever, regardless of the nature of the household to which they belong.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT (DE FACTO FINANCIAL MATTERS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1,speech

I accept everything that Senator Brandis said in terms of what the intent was and in terms of the concerns within the coalition as to why this approach has been taken. On balance I feel uncomfortable with both amendments. I feel less uncomfortable with the government’s amendment for this reason: I am concerned that, in the context of the coalition’s amendment—and I accept all that Senator Brandis has said—there will be a distinction, a difference, a change in the way that de facto heterosexual couples have been described in this context. From my perspective, that tips the issue to support the government’s position. But I do see this as a difficult issue. It is a case of being less uncomfortable with the government’s position than with the coalition’s.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2008-10-16,"—I would like to continue my remarks on the Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008 and related bills. Yesterday I was quoting the comments of the member for Kalgoorlie and I was saying how happy I was to hear opposition senators and members endorsing these bills. I was saying that when the member for Kalgoorlie was endorsing the bills he was also seriously pushing the line of Woodside. As I said yesterday, and as I have said in this chamber on a number of occasions, I like to push Woodside’s argument too, and I am very supportive of Woodside. In fact, I am sounding like a broken record on the wonderful opportunity they have given a lot of Western Australians and other Australians in the great state of Western Australia, particularly up on the North West Shelf and with the future gas reserve areas in the Browse Basin.
I do not wish to mention the opposition senator’s name—and I will not. However, when opposition Western Australian Liberal senators are endorsing a private company, it would not hurt them to let the Senate know that there may be a conflict of interest. I wish that I could say that I owned Woodside shares. I really do. Unfortunately, I do not. When senators and members want to bag the government and push Woodside’s line, the least they could do is let the Senate know that they do, or may, have a conflict of interest. We know that the opposition would certainly not condone a senator for having interests in Woodside shares. But there is enough talk going around about shareholdings, so I will leave it at that.
I commend these bills to the Senate. They are very important. The Rudd government initiative for greenhouse gas storage is a wonderful initiative. We have certainly had some endorsement from senior executives in industry and in science. Therefore, I will say it one more time: I commend these bills to the Senate.
 (Senator Parry)—Thank you, Senator Sterle. I think it is important to note that senators do complete a register of senators’ interests.",SENATE,<title>OFFSHORE PETROLEUM AMENDMENT (GREENHOUSE GAS STORAGE) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-10-16,"—I do not have a pecuniary interest in Woodside. I want to speak briefly to the Offshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008 and  related bills in the wake of the comments of my colleague Senator Christine Milne. The legislation needs amendment, because it is legislation to facilitate carbon storage—carbon being captured and transported to places under the seabed off Australia—without liability. There needs to be liability, and it ought not to be public liability. We are talking here about private enterprise moving to ameliorate the impact of the burning of fossil fuels in an age of climate change, with the public again being the guarantor.
The position of the Greens is that carbon capture and storage is a long way off. It is certainly not the immediate answer to the need to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in this country. We should, as a priority in this place, be dealing with a bill to end the logging of native forests and woodlands in Australia, which would reduce greenhouse gases by 25 per cent straight off. But politics gets in the way of common sense when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions. What we have is this legislation to facilitate some future storage of greenhouse gases under the ocean. The question arises: if you have a hole from which petroleum or gases have been removed so as to be burnt to produce energy for society, will we in the future see the capture of carbon, or indeed other greenhouse gases, from the burning of coal or fossil fuels onshore being transported back out through pipes and deposited in those same vacated holes under the seabed? If that is possible and it can be safely done, the next question that arises is: what about guaranteeing that, once plugged, the greenhouse gases deposited in that hole will stay there? If they are not guaranteed to stay there, the whole exercise becomes pointless. If, in the future, there is leakage, then ameliorating action will have to be taken.
We know that due to human, industrial and other actions over the last two to three centuries, we have increased enormously greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. They are increasing now at the greatest rate in history; it is accelerating. We are moving past the point of no return as far as the onrush of cataclysmic climate change is concerned. A further question arises: if the technology is found to store the carbon, who should be the guarantor for that? We maintain that the guarantee should come from the people, the entities, who are making the profits from burning fossil fuels and who put it under the ground. It is as simple as that. That is how it should be.
I want to make it very clear that the Greens do not believe this technology is available. We know it is not available. Everybody knows it is not available. We do not believe it is going to help us get to the very urgent challenge which scientists put to us: to be past the peak emissions of greenhouse gases and rapidly reducing them within the next two, three, four, five years. That is the critical thing. We should be more urgently dealing with legislation on an end to native forest logging and on energy efficiency for this country and with Senator Milne’s program on behalf of the Greens for retrofitting every house in Australia with energy saving devices like hot water services which could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of this country by 10 per cent in one go and create tens of thousands of jobs and businesses—not least in rural and regional Australia—right across this country, as well as add to export income.

—Senator Fierravanti-Wells said that we could bring back solar panels. Senator, we should be producing them in this country. But the Howard government took the incentives away from the solar panel producing industries, and our excellent technology has been exported to Berlin and Beijing. I recently put a solar hot water service onto my house. It is Australian technology and manufactured in China. That is because the Howard government put hundreds of millions of dollars into the coal industry—wrong way—and took that support from the new solar panel producing industries that you talk about: the solar hot water services and other renewable energies.
I am afraid the same pattern of behaviour is happening under the current government. It undercuts the investment that should be going to ensuring that Australia becomes a powerhouse for new renewable energy, that it develops its own technology and becomes an exporter. Instead of that we have left it to cloudy Germany to be the exporter. I would add, and Senator Milne, if she were here, would be saying this: where are the feed-in laws that not only will make those solar panels you talk about good for households but will also produce money for them? If a person puts solar panels into their household, they produce electricity. When they are away on holidays, then they can feed it into the grid and, when they take it out of the grid, they should get three to four times more electricity than they paid for. That is how the German system works and that is why they have got the steal on the rest of the world.
One little anecdote on that is the pig farmer in Germany who thought he was not doing too well with pigs. In came feed-in laws, and he decided to cover his two hectare farm with solar panels. He now sits on the veranda watching the meter ticking over and makes money out of it. That is the way it should be going but Australia is way behind in that sort of thinking, and the Greens intend to continue to campaign to put us at the forefront.
But here we are dealing with what the big corporations want, legislation for facilitating their so-called carbon capture and storage somewhere down the line, perhaps decades down the line, not legislation to do the things we can do immediately to help small business in this country and to make an immediate impact on the reduction of carbon and other greenhouse gases pouring into the atmosphere due to lack of government action in this country.",SENATE,<title>OFFSHORE PETROLEUM AMENDMENT (GREENHOUSE GAS STORAGE) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1,speech
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2008-10-16,"—I rise to speak on theOffshore Petroleum Amendment (Greenhouse Gas Storage) Bill 2008. In speaking to this bill it is important to recognise that Australia needs to move towards a cleaner, greener future—an energy future with a greater dependence on renewable energy and energy efficiency. We cannot overlook the fact, though, that Australia obtains 80 per cent of its electricity from coal-fired power stations and exports somewhere in the vicinity of 30 per cent of the world’s coal. This is somewhat of a major contribution to global warming. We need to look not only at the footprint of our own country but also at that of our exports.
If we continue to think of this as a viable proposition without reducing the CO2 we emit and that others emit from coal-fired power then I think we are kidding ourselves. It is therefore incumbent on Australia to reduce the amount of CO2 it releases into the atmosphere. Carbon capture and storage—CCS or geosequestration—may prove an effective mechanism for contributing to the reduction of Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. As highlighted by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, a clearly set out competitive framework for CCS will potentially lower the cost of addressing the climate change challenge.
Ultimately this should translate into a smaller increase in household electricity bills to achieve the goal of limiting climate change. However, I do recognise that CCS is not a silver bullet for our greenhouse problems. There are indeed some serious technological and economic challenges to its viability. As Senator Bob Brown pointed out, it is indeed unclear as to the viability and at which point in the future this technology will be able to make a contribution. To highlight this point, the committee was concerned about the location of geologically suitable storage sites, as many existing power stations are a long way from sites of capture. We can see that this is the case with the Hunter Valley.
There are also those against geosequestration as a means of reducing emissions. I can understand those concerns; they are real concerns. There were those who questioned the safety of CCS technology, including both Greenpeace and the Australian Network of Environmental Defenders offices. There was no evidence from the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism or Geoscience Australia to suggest that the technology is inherently unsafe. However, it is important to note that in our committee we thought it appropriate that the onus of proof should lie with the proponents to demonstrate that the technology is safe. Other concerns arise because those concerned about climate change do not want to see this technology used as a free ticket for carbon polluting industries to continue to pollute. They do not want to see the fact that we are working on CCS used as a way of maintaining a ‘business as usual’ attitude.
Encouraging reliance on this technology as an answer to our problems could divert the investment from the transition to cleaner fuels and renewable energy. It is indeed an expensive and somewhat unproven technology. So we do need to look seriously at how CCS will interact with and affect the drive towards greater use of renewable energy. There is no reason for the government to favour carbon capture and storage techniques over other ways of reducing emissions. It is notable that, for this reason, the committee was not convinced by arguments that the government should be subsidising users or providers of CCS by actively taking over long-term liabilities from them either for demonstration or commercial projects.
It is indeed the government’s position that that long-term liability is to be treated in the same way that petroleum production activities are currently treated. The legislation treats liability for offshore injection and storage activities in the same manner as existing offshore petroleum production activities have been treated under the Offshore Petroleum Act—that is, the OPA will not immunise greenhouse gas titleholders or other participants in GHG projects from common-law liability to persons who suffer injury or loss as a result of their actions. This nonintervention will extend to all forms of common-law liability, including long-term liability. Greenhouse gas industry participants will therefore need to make their own arrangements to deal with the potential common-law liability as an ordinary cost of doing business, as must members of any other industry. The Commonwealth will not take over any long-term liability if for some reason, such as the passage of time, the damages are irrecoverable in the long term. The community in those circumstances would, effectively, bear the cost of any damage.
The committee was concerned and, as such, recommended that the government reject calls from some people for the government to assume explicitly long-term liability for any leakage from carbon storage projects. We will need robust arrangements, as companies may not still exist to accept liability for stored CO2 over the decades or centuries. On this basis, the government will need to work with companies undertaking such projects so that they contribute to the future costs of coping with any such leakage. Notwithstanding that, the evidence presented to the committee demonstrated that, when sites are assessed and managed properly, CO2 can be made stable in geological formations and that the prospect of such leakage does not appear to be a significant risk. We also need to be aware that CCS may not be capable of sequestering enough CO2 in the future or be commercially operational to mitigate climate change in optimal time. On that basis, carbon capture and storage, or CCS, should not really be considered the only answer to reducing our CO2 emissions; rather, it should be developed along with other technologies capable of reducing the impact of climate change.
Carbon capture and storage or no carbon capture and storage? We have to remain committed to diversifying our power sources, including our baseload, to do things within those power sources that will reduce their emissions. Nevertheless, as I stated earlier, we are currently highly reliant on fossil fuels. We will need to look at all possible ways of reducing the carbon intensity of our emissions from the use of fossil fuels. To do otherwise would be very irresponsible. It is time to end the old days of industry and big business being able to freely pollute at the expense of everybody else. Action on climate change will involve costs, but I think the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is the best way of reducing carbon pollution at the lowest possible cost to families, industry and business. If polluting industries want to stay viable into the future then they need to find a way forward. That is why many fossil fuel industries are turning to carbon capture and storage. This is clearly the case with the Western Australia Gorgon project. The Gorgon project in the north-west of WA is one example of a project that plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through storing CO2 underground.
It is widely accepted that measures need to be taken to reduce the impact of energy supply on the concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere—and I very much believe that carbon capture and storage is a useful means of reducing atmospheric CO2. It is therefore really significant that we put forward this legislation today so that we provide the framework for these things to be put in place. Industry are looking to make really big investments into carbon capture and storage to lower their emissions, and this investment needs to be facilitated and encouraged. We should be working towards lowering our emissions via all technologies available.
While great advances are being made in renewables, the world is overwhelmingly still reliant on fossil fuels. I really hope that Australia is able to make a contribution by leading the way on a range of technologies—from solar, tidal, wind, solar thermal and geothermal to carbon capture and storage. Carbon capture and storage should be legally provided for so that we have at our disposal all means for reducing emissions. To make a meaningful contribution to tackling global warming we must indeed get on with reducing our emissions. We must facilitate investment through things such as CCS and, following the passing of this legislation, we must get things such as the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme up and running. The introduction of the government’s CPRS provides an appropriate price signal for energy consumers to economise on energy and for energy producers to switch emphasis towards providing energy in ways which involve fewer emissions of CO2 into our atmosphere.
Dr Geoffrey Ingram, Regional Manager, Australasia, Schlumberger Carbon Services, told the committee:
As you will no doubt hear from other witnesses, technologically we believe carbon capture and storage is ready to go. What the industry is waiting on is for the legislation and economic drivers to materialise. We believe the federal government’s commitment to a price on carbon in the amended legislation going through Parliament House at the moment is the start of this process. We have previously provided evidence to the House of Representatives inquiry into the same legislation. We recognise its report has a number of key recommendations that would enable large-scale storage projects.
What we know is that fossil fuels currently provide cheap energy. In order to get investment in things like carbon capture and storage, which is going to add a cost to our energy, we really need to get things like the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme up and running. We need a price signal to do that, and I hope the CPRS will provide such a price signal.
I know senators will have concerns, in the current economic climate, about taking on responsibilities that cost the economy money. Reputable economists, though, have quantified the future impacts of climate change. They have based this work on what hundreds of reputable scientists have said may happen, has happened and will happen to our environment as a result of carbon pollution and the consequential climate change. We are looking towards the very real impacts of more extreme weather in Australia, including more droughts, water shortages, floods, bushfires, rising sea levels and the loss of biodiversity and habitat. These changes in our environment will have very real impacts on the economy. What they say is that a failure to militate against the causes of climate change and its impacts will be economically disastrous. In this time of multiple economic challenges, the worst thing we can do is put our head in the sand. I think it is a good time to be stimulating growth in new industries and investing in the jobs of the future.
This legislation will see Australia become the first country in the world to establish a specific legislative framework for carbon capture and storage. In its submission to the Senate economics committee inquiry, this is what the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association had to say about the legislation:
… it will make Australia the first jurisdiction to develop a comprehensive framework for greenhouse gas injection activities.
I enjoyed the opportunity, through the Senate committee’s inquiry, to look at the technical side of carbon storage. The evidence presented to me illustrated that it is technically viable. Still unproven are its economic competitiveness and its capacity to sequester meaningful quantities of CO2. But, to my mind, it is technically viable and we may well have a price signal in the future that will facilitate investment in this technology.
I note that significant issues have been raised with regard to who has the right to tenure of geosequestration sites. This is an interesting point. On the one hand we have Woodside, which says:
… the greenhouse gas derived from the extraction and processing of that gas from an integrated petroleum development should be able to be sequestered within that project and without the need to bid for access to the disposal site, regardless of the number of existing petroleum licences involved.
Woodside submitted:
… that, provided the fields are covered by petroleum exploration permits, retention leases or production licences, the opportunity for the commercial entities to agree commercial terms for a real and credible geosequestration activity, including early geological studies and tests, should not be impeded by the overlay of an additional and unnecessary acreage bidding system.
On the other hand, Mr Ralph Hillman, Executive Director of the Australian Coal Association, asserted:
Currently, the oil and gas industry naturally have a very large advantage in terms of the information they have to make and defend their case compared with what a storage proponent has.
He went on to say:
 … we do want to see this be an open, competitive industry where new proponents can enter quickly and effectively and with certainty and invest.
They did not want to see any barriers to entry. The committee recognised these issues in its work. An important element of the bill is ensuring a balance between attracting investment to the new CCS industry and protecting the pre-existing rights of oil and gas producers. The committee believed the bill seems to get this balance right, although there is inevitably some uncertainty about this judgement, given the groundbreaking nature of the legislation.
To conclude, I think we need everything in our arsenal to effectively tackle climate change. I know some people have doubts about carbon capture and storage, but it is something that we must facilitate. As legislators, we must play our part in putting the frameworks in place so that we can demonstrate we are serious in our message to the fossil fuel industry that they do not have a limitless mandate to pollute. We need to be serious about the climate change challenge and we especially need to ensure that big polluters are serious about it too.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2008-10-16,"—It is a pleasure to pass some comments on the Regional Telecommunications Review’s Framework for the future document, which was released and tabled in this place yesterday. At the outset, I congratulate and acknowledge the work of Dr Bill Glasson and the members of that committee for the first of the regional telecommunications reviews that were scheduled to be undertaken. This is an important document and an important review process, because it is the first such review to be undertaken since the passage of the sale legislation for Telstra and since the establishment, by the previous government, of the $2 billion Communications Fund. That fund ensured that ongoing funds were made available for regional and rural communications services around Australia. It ensured that there would be approximately $300 million every three years to be invested in critical regional and rural communications infrastructure and service support. We on this side of the chamber recognised that the demand for special assistance in regional Australia, as it relates to rural telecommunications and communications infrastructure, would ever be ongoing. We recognised that communications by its very nature is an evolving and changing area of technology and that there will always be a demand for new services and new infrastructure.
The importance of the framework that we put in place when in government was that it ensured perpetual support through this fund for such infrastructure. At any time when government looked to regional communities and saw that they were missing out, we could step in and deliver. It was towards the end of our time in government that Dr Glasson and his committee were appointed to undertake this work and commence this review. They have presented a comprehensive analysis of the communications needs of rural and regional Australia. In doing so, they have laid out many challenges for the government. I will touch on a couple of those briefly, but most importantly what I wish to reflect on today is the challenge for the government of providing ongoing support. Whilst this is the first review set up to spend the funds generated by the Communications Fund, it will, of course, be the last review if the government has its way and closes the Communications Fund.
The report details the critical nature of communications and how further investment could be made to support education and health services in rural Australia through enhanced communication services. It also details how our emergency services and Indigenous communities would benefit from greater assistance, and how businesses in rural and regional areas would equally benefit strongly from the recommendations in this report. It certainly tackles how, in the future, we should guarantee services to people in rural Australia, that we should move away from the old framework and develop a new framework to guarantee the minimum services that people throughout Australia should expect—especially those in regional areas who would otherwise miss out.
These are all welcome recommendations and ideas. I am sure they will be analysed by the government, and I hope that some of them—if not all—will indeed be taken up. But what is critical about this report is that it shines a spotlight on the fact that the government is leaving regional Australia hanging out to dry at the end of this process. I say that because the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, as part of the national broadband network process, is planning to take all of the $2 billion in the Communications Fund and spend it on the network—a network that has seen many delays so far, will not cover at least two per cent of Australia’s rural and regional areas and will leave people missing out. There will be no money left for future reviews and for, most importantly, the implementation of the recommendations that would have come out of those future reviews. That will leave rural Australians worse off. The government’s first challenge in responding to this review is to guarantee that it will leave the Communications Fund intact, that there will be future three-yearly reviews and that funding will be made available for rural communications infrastructure.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2008-10-16,"—It is my pleasure to speak on the report by the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport on the Coorong and Lower Lakes situation. I speak in light of the remarks that were made by fellow senators in relation to the report, which was tabled earlier this week. This report is critical to my home state of South Australia. Senator Fisher, who is in the chamber, has already made a strong contribution on this. The government’s stance on this report conflicted with the stances taken by the senators of the coalition and the Greens, and also Senator Xenophon, who participated in the inquiry and offered comments at the end. Unfortunately, it seems the government has waved the white flag on the future of the Lower Lakes. The government is unwilling to commit to saving those lakes through to the end of next year.
—There’s no water—it’s as simple as that. It’s got to rain.

Senator Fisher interjecting—

—Senator Sterle says there is no water. Well, the government has been provided with an opportunity, a little bit of time. As Senator Fisher rightly points out, there certainly is water. There is not enough water to do everything, and we recognise that, but the challenge becomes one of prioritisation and doing what is achievable. What is achievable is for the government to guarantee and commit to securing the future of the Coorong and the Lower Lakes at least until winter 2009—and that is possible.
It became quite evident that was possible from the evidence that was presented during this inquiry. The government was provided with a get out of jail card during this inquiry. When it started, the prognosis for the river system was grim; it was dire. The likelihood was that we were talking, in a worst case scenario, of hundreds of gigalitres being required to avoid the risk of acidification of the Lower Lakes. But as time went on, and as rainfall in the Mount Lofty ranges in South Australia proved a little more favourable to the Coorong and Lower Lakes than had been expected, we suddenly saw the opportunity to save those lakes. That expectation of hundreds of gigalitres has progressively come down, and the worst case scenario, on the last evidence provided by the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, is that 10 to 50 gigalitres is required. That is right: the department now says only 10 to 50 gigalitres would be required to ensure acidification of the lakes does not occur between now and next winter.
It beggars belief that, for want of 10 gigalitres or so, the government will not make a commitment to stop acidification. It beggars belief that they would risk taking decisions such as building a weir and flooding these lakes with seawater for want of 10 to 50 gigalitres. It beggars belief that they would potentially risk permanent damage to the ecology of the lakes and to the surrounding farmland—that they would put all of that at stake—for the want of a very small amount of water to maintain the required level of the lakes. If we look at the evidence that was tendered to this inquiry, that could be achieved by a range of different ways that do not appear to have been even considered by the government.
It could be achieved through a minimal lowering of the weir pools. Evidence tendered by other witnesses suggested that a lowering by between 100 and 150 millimetres of the weir pools in the lochs in the lower Murray system could actually provide around 50 gigalitres—at the maximum end of the 10- to 50-gigalitre range. Other evidence suggested that, because you are talking about such small flows, it would be possible to have a ‘shandying’ effect. In fact, you could add a small volume of seawater at present just to keep the level up. You would not have to flood the lakes because, as you admitted freshwater—the 350 gigalitres of dilution flows that are already guaranteed for the lakes—you could shandy them with a little bit of seawater to maintain the required level.
Did the government commit to pursue any of these options—options that would not hurt upstream irrigators and would not take further rights way from those who are struggling to guarantee the food supply of Australia? Did the government offer to look at those options and guarantee that they would use them as a last resort this year to secure the future of the lakes? No, they did not. The government said it was all too hard and seemed to want to concede the future of the lakes at the first possible opportunity. It seems as though they wish to get the problem of the lakes off their hands. They wish to wash their hands of the problem. They know that the sooner that tipping point is reached the sooner the difficult decision to flood the lakes can be made—and no longer will we have this debate about how to manage their future.
That will make life a whole lot easier for them in all the other decisions they have to make. Bugger the consequences, and the environmental and ecological damage that could be done be damned! They do not bother considering the relevance of history, which says that at best those lakes have been an estuarine environment with occasional saltwater incursions that have been flooded out by regular freshwater floods from an unregulated river system. We now have a very regulated river system. Freshwater floods will not reach those lakes again any time soon, if ever. Flooding them with seawater would be a permanent decision, and therefore a permanent change to the ecology of those lakes that would cause ongoing damage.
On top of this failure of the government to guarantee the short-term future of the lakes, we can look at their failure in the longer term as well. They are proposing a plan that would take 75 to 110 gigalitres out of the Murray-Darling Basin catchment area and supply it to Melbourne. Once again, that is a decision that defies logic and beggars belief for anyone who looks at this situation. At a time when the government is buying water entitlements from irrigators—entitlements in the main that do not actually have any water allocation attached to them—and at a time when the government is considering flooding the lakes for the want of 10 to 50 gigalitres, they are proposing to build a pipeline in Victoria that would take another 75 gigalitres out.
In South Australia, the state government is being held to account at present to try to take Adelaide off the Murray as much as possible. That is why they have been pressured—pressure that they have resisted—into committing to build a desalination plant. That is why they have been pressured with Liberal Party policies in South Australia to commit to stormwater harvesting. There is enormous pressure in South Australia to reduce the reliance of Adelaide on the River Murray. Yet at the same time we have the Labor government in Victoria and the federal Labor government doing some type of dirty deal behind closed doors to commit to taking a minimum of 75 gigalitres out of the river and sending it off to Melbourne.
We are going to put another city that is outside of the basin catchment area on the river system just at the time when we are trying to get the major city that has been reliant on the river to reduce its reliance. It is a nonsensical approach. The biggest challenge that this government should take up is the challenge of stopping that pipeline. It needs to say to its Victorian mates: ‘We’re not going to accept a deal for a pipeline to take more water out of the catchment. We expect that Victoria will play ball on this and pursue the infrastructure and the water saving methods that they have talked about and return that water to environmental flows.’ The water should not be shifted to Melbourne through some pipeline but be returned to environmental flows.
This report was a great disappointment for many South Australians, because it failed the challenge of securing the short-term and long-term future of key environmental sites in our state. We know that there will be much further debate as this committee goes on to look at the longer term management of the lakes and at the Water Amendment Bill 2008 that has been introduced into this place. Those will be opportunities for us to hopefully hold the government to account and deliver proper long-term management. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

This report by the Australian National Audit Office looks into what has been one of the most successful programs the Australian government has ever been involved in in relation to protection of its borders and its marine assets. I am delighted that the Audit Office has taken the time to do a fairly intensive investigation into all aspects of the Southern Ocean Maritime Patrol and Response Program that has, since 1997, been administered by the Australian Customs Service.
By way of background, when the Howard government came to power there was indeed a lot of illegal pirate activity in Australia’s EEZ in the Southern Ocean, particularly around Heard Island and McDonald Islands, which are part of the Australian Antarctic Territory. Australian concessions had received licences to fish for the very valuable but very rare Patagonian toothfish, which lives deep in the icy Southern Ocean and attracts a premium price, particularly for the restaurant trade in Japan and North America. That toothfish, which can live for up to 100 years, is a very fine eating fish and attracts very high prices. But it is of course, like all our marine ecology, under some threat.
Over the years the relevant authorities—mainly those associated with the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, referred to as CCAMLR—had set a total catch limit and divided it amongst responsible nations, and Australia had a share of that overall catch limit. The allowable catch was worked out by scientists and fisheries managers to ensure the continuation of the species. But unfortunately, because of the value of the fish and the money to be made, many pirate vessels started taking a real interest in the Southern Ocean and in catching Patagonian toothfish, without any permits or licences whatsoever, and real pressure was put on the sustainability of that species. In response to that, the Australia government commenced patrols and also did a lot of diplomatic work with the French government, which also has a very significant interest in the Southern Ocean and the Patagonian toothfish. That resulted in a treaty between France and Australia which has led to joint patrols, joint enforcement and sharing of intelligence obtained from a wide range of sources to fight the presence of these illegal fishing boats.
Many of the pirate boats became household names over a series of years. The Aliza Glacial, as some might remember, was a very valuable boat that was arrested by Australia back in 1997. Some very tricky international law was employed there. A bank claimed it had a mortgage over the vessel and, under the old English admiralty law, the Australian government were unable to hold it—the mortgagees were successful in court and claimed possession. After that, the Australian laws were changed quite substantially to ensure that that sort of legal trickery could not result in pirates escaping.
There was the South Tomi, a vessel flagged to Togo, which was involved in a long chase across the Southern Ocean; the Lena and the Volga, two Russian vessels; and the Viarsa I, a Uruguayan flagged vessel that, as senators might recall, was involved in the longest maritime chase in Australia’s maritime history. The vessel, found fishing illegally around the Heard and McDonald Islands, was chased by the Australian Customs and Fisheries patrol vessel the Southern Supporter for 21 days across some of the wildest seas known to mankind. Eventually the vessel was apprehended halfway between South Africa and Montevideo—the home port of the vessel—in Uruguay, by a combined international effort involving the South Africans, the British out of the Falklands and the Australians, with the vessel the Southern Supporter. Not many people knew at the time—although it is history now—that the Southern Supporter, whilst following this vessel and continually threatening to board it unless it stopped, was unarmed. I suspect there was not even so much as a cap gun on board. Certainly it was not an armed vessel in any way. But the crew of that vessel and those involved at the time did a magnificent job.
It was as a result of that that the current vessel, the Oceanic Viking, was acquired by the then government to patrol the Southern Ocean. It was a vessel specifically appropriate for the quite horrendous seas that occur in the Southern Ocean and was substantially armed, so for the first time Australia had a real capacity to apprehend pirate vessels down in the Southern Ocean. The Australian Navy had done a lot of work in apprehending some of the vessels. The Lena and the Volga were both apprehended by the Navy, as was the Maya V, in 2004. But, whilst very capably and bravely manned by Australian sailors, the Navy vessels are not really equipped for the sorts of seas you get in the Southern Ocean—hence the acquisition of the Oceanic Viking.
This is a very good report of the ANAO. It gives a big tick, as I read it, to Customs and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, who are very much involved in this. I do want to speak more about this report, and will do so in the future. Suffice it to say at this time that this report does go into, in some detail, the work done by Customs and Fisheries in relation to the Southern Ocean Maritime Patrol and Response Program. I want to pay tribute to the men and women of Customs, and the mainly men—perhaps there are some support staff who are women—in the Australian Fisheries Management Authority who have over many years ensured that our interests are protected and that our assets remain our assets and are not subject to piracy from vessels running flags of convenience. Those people do a magnificent job, to such an extent that, since the Oceanic Viking began to be so visible in these areas and perform such good work, no pirate vessels have been sighted in the Southern Ocean for a considerable time. It is a great credit to the work of Customs and Fisheries that their efforts have saved Australia and chased from our waters these illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing vessels. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2008-10-16,"—I rise to speak tonight on the recent release of the Productivity Commission’s interim report Paid parental leave. As a mother of two young children who has been fortunate enough to have accessed paid maternity leave in the past, I know firsthand just how important it can be for those crucial first months of a child’s life—both for the development of the child and the proper recovery of the mother. Apart from allowing new mothers the grace to reskill, albeit rather quickly, in the practical realities of parenthood, paid maternity leave takes some of the pressure off new parents and, to a certain extent, allows them to just be that: parents. However, as the report details, at present a significant number of parents, particularly new mums, do not enjoy access to paid maternity leave. The report notes that only around half of working mums, and even fewer working dads, are currently eligible to access paid parental leave arrangements.
Indeed, for some time the debate regarding paid parental leave entitlements has been, and continues to be, plagued with constant undertones of doubt, with persistent questioning of why new parents should have access to such a scheme. We all know that argument well—that if couples choose to have children then it should be their sole responsibility to support them. Let us consider for a moment the practical realities facing new parents in the present day, in which the demands on new parents, particularly young mothers, have arguably never been greater.
Working mothers today, as I am well aware, more often than not find themselves in a constant state of strain, trying to juggle the demands of work with the responsibilities that come with parenting, not to mention the ever-increasing weight of social expectation that all new mothers should be able manage all of this with a smile on their face and bounce back instantaneously. The reality is that, at present, an increasing number of mums are sleep deprived and running themselves ragged just to keep up.
A long-running study by the Australian Institute of Family Studies, Growing up in Australia, reveals that full-time working mothers are spending only four hours less per day with their young children—working at least 7.5 hours a day then, on top of that, squeezing in almost the equivalent of another full day’s work outside work hours to take care of their children. In the end, whether we want to admit it or not, something has to give, and the government recognises this.
When taking office last November the government pledged to do what it could to take the pressure off working families. So far we have introduced a number of family based policy initiatives in the areas of early childhood learning, child care and workplace relations that are aimed directly at alleviating this pressure. These include increasing the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, the introduction of more flexible unpaid parental leave options in our new National Employment Standards and the investment of $533.5 million over the next five years to provide universal access to quality early learning programs for 15 hours a week—just to name a few. Indeed, as the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Jenny Macklin, highlighted earlier in the year, the government’s new approach to family policy has been to put children at the centre of policymaking and not on the margin.
The introduction of a national paid parental leave scheme lies at the heart of such an approach, with a plethora of evidence suggesting that babies benefit physically, socially and mentally from having at least one of their parents home with them for the first six months of their life. That does not even take account of the benefits for parents when they can have that time at home with their newborn babies. Therefore the release of the Productivity Commission’s draft report Paid parental leave: support for parents with newborn children represents a logical and practical step in the right direction, both in terms of reconceptualising the work-home debate and moving toward providing both parents and children with the support they need.
As the interim report into paid parental leave highlights, such an approach to family policy is much needed and long overdue, as your typical working family now features a working dad and, more often, a run-off-her-feet working mum. The report notes that roughly 285,000 children were born in Australia last year. Of these, 175,000 were born to mothers who were in the paid workforce prior to giving birth, with at least 80 per cent of these mothers intending to return to full-time work. Further, it notes that women’s participation in the paid workforce is at a historical high, particularly in the key reproductive years age group, between 24 and 34 years. Workforce participation rates in this bracket increased from around 45 per cent to 70 per cent between 1978 to 2008. However, our birth rate currently hovers around 1.81 babies per woman.
Another report released by the Australian Institute of Family Studies earlier this year, titled Fertility and family policy in Australia, reveals that most couples would actually like more children but lack the confidence in their ability provide for them. The handing down of the Productivity Commission’s interim report could not have occurred at a more crucial time. With a government now in power that is committed to instituting socially responsible policy, the tide is beginning to turn—the interim report is testament to this. The report recommends the introduction of a paid parental leave scheme which provides 18 weeks parental leave for new mums, which can also be shared with their partners, and an additional two weeks exclusively reserved for new dads.
The commission is now inviting public comment on the recommendations until 14 November and is due to hand its final report to government in February 2009. The commission will be holding public hearings around the country, starting from 10 November. The National Foundation for Australian Women, and Security for Women, with the support of the Commonwealth Office for Women, will also be holding consultations in each state, including my home state of Tasmania. I understand that the public consultation in Tasmania will occur on 10 November. I strongly encourage people to get involved and have their say about the possible shape of our nation’s future paid parental leave scheme.
Whether the commission’s current recommendations represent the final recommendations they hand to the government next year or not, the handing down of the report has effectively shifted the debate from not if but how a paid parental leave scheme will operate in this country. Not so long ago—just over two years ago in fact—things were not so progressed under the previous government, with the former Treasurer boasting, ‘Have one for mum, one for dad and one for the country,’ whilst all but completely ignoring the demands on new families. Indeed, for 12 long years, those opposite ignored the needs of Australian families and failed to act when it came to the practical realities faced by mums and dads around the country.
While the former Treasurer was encouraging Australians to go out and have more children for the health of the future economy, those opposite neglected the most basic needs of Australian families, whether in relation to the provision of affordable child care or a fair and flexible workplace relations system. Indeed, the failure, by those opposite to even acknowledge the issue of paid parental leave for 12 long years has left Australia as one of only two countries in the developed world without a paid parental leave scheme.
For far too long the needs of Australian mums and dads have been ignored. At the last election we made the commitment to the Australian people that we would address this neglect, beginning with the reintroduction of the concept of flexibility and choice back into the workplace—and that is exactly what we intend to do. Our new National Employment Standards will deliver that flexibility and choice, giving mums and dads a choice to sequence their unpaid maternity and unpaid paternity leave to have a parent at home with a newborn child for the first two years of a child’s life. At the last election we also pledged to ask the Productivity Commission to conduct an inquiry into a paid parental leave model for the country and, as I have said, the interim report represents the first real step forward on this issue.
For far too long Australian mums and dads have been forced to choose between their work and home lives, often having to pit the priorities of one over the priorities of the other. For far too long Australian families, particularly mothers, have had little or no choice when it comes to deciding how best to approach the first few months of their child’s life. The government understands this and, unlike those opposite, understands just how critical the issue of paid parental leave is to promoting a healthier and more productive work-life balance for Australian mums and dads.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Parental Leave</title>,Adjournment,36,1,speech
