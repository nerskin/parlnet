Dear Minister
I refer to the Excise Amendment Regulations 2004 (No. 1), Statutory Rules 2004 No. 27. 
Schedules 1 and 3 are expressed to commence retrospectively, from 18 September 2003. The Explanatory Statement provides an assurance, referring to subsection 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, that this retrospective commencement confers a benefit on persons affected by the amendments. The Committee seeks your advice as to the arrangements, if any are needed, for providing a refund of duty claimable as a result of these retrospective amendments and, if so, how producers will be informed of this.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on this issue as soon as possible, but before 25 March 2004, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this instrument. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra. 
Yours sincerely

Excise Amendment Regulations 2004 (No. 1)
Thank you for your letter of 11 March 2004 concerning issues arising out of the retrospective operation of Schedule 1 of the Excise Amendment Regulations 2004 (No. 1) (Excise Amendment Regulations) that will be taken to have effect from 18 September 2003. I apologise for the delay in responding.
The amendments contained in Schedules 1 and 3 of the Excise Amendment Regulations are consequential to the imposition of excise duty on biodiesel announced in the 2003-2004 Federal Budget and implemented by Excise Tariff Proposal (No. 4) 2003, tabled in the House of Representatives on 17 September 2003, to take effect on and from the 18 September 2003. Schedule 1 extends exemption provisions in Excise Regulations 1925 applying to diesel blends to include biodiesel blends. Schedule 3 extends the definition of petrol, which includes diesel, to biodiesel. Please note that the amendments contained in Schedule 3 are to commence on gazettal.
An effect of the imposition of excise duty on biodiesel was to bring biodiesel manufacture within the excise regime and in particular in the licensing system central to the Excise Act 1901 by requiring biodiesel manufacturers to be licensed. Excise duty on biodiesel and consequential alignment of the treatment of biodiesel with comparable fuels are introduced for reasons of equity. The Australian biodiesel industry is at present in the early stages of development. There is only limited commercial biodiesel production in Australia with a small number of large scale commercial manufacturers of biodiesel. Although size of this relatively infant market is difficult to establish with certainty, advice from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is that there are currently no producers of biodiesel blends who are paying excise on those blends that would fall within the proposed exemption provision.
The ATO holds details of the identities and production levels of licensed biodiesel manufacturers and Treasury has advised the ATO to particularly identify those manufacturers that would potentially benefit from the proposed exemptions in order that the administration of excise collection occurs in the proper manner.
I trust this information will be of assistance to you.
Yours sincerely

Dear Minister
I refer to Temporary Order No. 4 of 2003. 
This Order does not refer to the full title of the Act under which it is made, namely the Fisheries Management Act 1991. The Order refers only to `the Management Act'. Whilst the full title of the Act is provided in the accompanying Explanatory Statement, the Committee considers that it is preferable for this also to be done in the actual instrument.  
The Committee would appreciate your advice on these issues as soon as possible, but before 29 March 2004, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this instrument. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Thank you for your letter of 11 March 2004 regarding Temporary Order No. 4 of 2003 (the Order), made under section 43 of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 (the Act).
I apologise for the error that was made in the correct title of the Act not being used in the Order instrument. It appears that at the time the Order was drafted, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority's (AFMA's) legal section had undergone some staffing changes, with new staff handling the checking of documents. As a result, the error was not picked up in AFMA's normal review process.
I have been assured that AFMA is well aware of the importance of using the correct wording for these documents, and does not expect this mistake to occur again. AFMA has prepared an amendment to the Heard Island and McDonald Islands Fishery Management Plan 2002 to replace the Order and this was recently gazetted.
Thank you again for bringing your concerns to my attention.
Yours sincerely

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-05-13,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee for inquiry and report by 23 June 2004:
The Australian Government's knowledge of the mistreatment of prisoners detained under the control of the United States of America or its coalition partners in Iraq, Afghanistan and at Guantanamo Bay, with particular reference to:
	(a)	when the Government or its agencies first received information about the abuse;
	(b)	when and how this information first came to the notice of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), or other members of the Government; 
	(c)	what action has been taken to assure that there has been and will be no Australian involvement, or Australian acquiescence, in this matter;
	(d)	how and when the Prime Minister conveyed Australia's rebuke to Washington and London;
	(e)	the extent of government knowledge about abuse of prisoners in prisons in Afghanistan, including at Bagram Air Base; and
	(f)	what disapprovals Australia has conveyed to the White House about the practice of placing hoods and manacles on prisoners, including Australians, at Guantanamo Bay and what other information the Government has about mistreatment of prisoners there.
This matter is absolutely critical. We have seen the abuse of prisoners in Iraq, and now we have on the Internet an obscene and disgusting response with the decapitation of an American overnight—appalling behaviour—in the misguided name of some higher authority, totally abandoning human precepts and human principles and with no excuse whatsoever. Such conduct can never be accommodated and no reasoning goes any way towards allowing for it. It is of international concern. What sort of world do we have? What sort of world are we handing on to our kids if, very often in the name of the religion which guides many of the principles that we have in our global civilisation, we have this unseemly humiliation, torture and death of people held in custody—very often people who are entirely innocent.
For our part, the detention and the humiliating and degrading treatment—including, we are led to believe, outright torture—of some prisoners in Iraq and, I believe, also in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay demand a national response. In particular they demand a response from Prime Minister Howard. It is under his government that our involvement in Afghanistan—and therefore the holding of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay—and now our involvement in Iraq has taken place. All these things have been on the authority of this government—not this parliament, I might add, but this government. It is extraordinarily important that this parliament have from the Prime Minister an explanation of the action he has undertaken to try to prevent the abuse of prisoners in these several places and the action that he is planning to undertake to circumvent further abuse, humiliation or torture of prisoners—whoever they might be, guilty or not guilty, whatever they might have allegedly done—because these acts are not acceptable in Australian society and by extension are not acceptable in conflicts in which Australia is involved. It is just simply not on.
The question is to our Prime Minister and our government: when did you know about these abuses taking place? What action did you take? And what action are you now going to take through the Prime Minister's special relationship with both Prime Minister Blair and President George W. Bush? From where I sit, the Prime Minister's reaction has been far short of that required. Certainly he has expressed disgust and he has answered questions from journalists. But where is the statement from the Prime Minister on behalf of this nation, the special dedicated statement of abhorrence of what is happening, an explanation to our nation of the actions taken by this Prime Minister to prevent these acts in the past and now to ensure that they do not happen in the future? Where is the assurance that he has spoken to George W. Bush or to Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, about these matters? We have not heard that from the Prime Minister of Australia. This nation deserves that from its leadership, and it is not getting it.
There is clear evidence that the government knew that prisoners were being held in appalling conditions in Baghdad and elsewhere as far back as the middle of last year from Amnesty International and that from the International Committee of the Red Cross came repeated reports to the governments of the coalition of the willing. Let us have from the government information about when it got these reports, to whom they went and what consideration and reaction was given about people left out in blistering heat, about people being burnt because of the surfaces on which they were left, about prisoners being deprived and, of course, about the emerging pictures of the appalling misconduct of the keepers of these prisoners that has now become a worldwide scandal. 
These are not matters of small moment or just matters of some moral judgment on what has happened in these prisons. They go directly to the safety of our own Defence Force personnel and of Australian civilians in Iraq, in Afghanistan and elsewhere around the world. They require greater action than we have seen from the Prime Minister, from the Minister for Foreign Affairs or from the Minister for Defence. I believe it is incumbent upon the Senate, in the absence of an explanation from the government, that we investigate these matters, that we find out from the government what the truth of the matter is. When did the government become acquainted with the mistreatment of prisoners and what action did it take? On the record at the moment it appears that no action was taken by the government until the matter surfaced in the public arena. That is totally unacceptable. That is neither in the interests of this country nor in the interests of our Defence Force personnel acting on behalf of this country, and on the authority of the Prime Minister, in Iraq and elsewhere. I want to see action and I believe that the Senate and this committee is the right place for us to get at the facts from which action can flow.
I believe this government has not acted sufficiently or adequately or directly or appropriately on these matters of abuse of prisoners in Afghanistan, in Iraq or in Guantanamo Bay. How can we have had leaders of the three countries—Australia, Britain and the United States—not comment on that very public exhibition of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay with hoods over their heads, with chains on their ankles and feet, kneeling in the sun, and the accompanying news of the 24-hour lights-on lockdown prison conditions to which they were subject in Guantanamo Bay? There was not one squeak out of our Prime Minister—nothing. Indeed, quite the reverse. There were words of inherent approval that this was happening in Guantanamo Bay not just to 600 prisoners from around the world—many of whom we know, most of whom we must presume, are not guilty of a crime because they have not been charged and many have since been released—but also to two Australians, Mr Hicks and Mr Habib. They are held there in breach of the Geneva conventions by the President of the United States. They are being held without contact with their relatives and loved ones, without access to legal advice. We know they are being held in conditions of sensory deprivation. We do not know about physical abuse—hoods on heads, manacles, the sorts of breaches that would never be allowed in Australia. The public would never allow that for prisoners in Australian detention.
But our Prime Minister allowed to be fully published before the whole world Australian prisoners being held by the United States in Guantanamo Bay. When that breach of international rules was allowed, where did our Prime Minister then draw the line? Having left the jailers at Guantanamo Bay with no new line of civilised behaviour towards prisoners, particularly prisoners who had not been charged and therefore must be assumed to be innocent, when the rules were withdrawn where did our Prime Minister draw a new line? He did not. Where did President George W. Bush draw a new line? He did not. Where was the inherent new line drawn for those people running prisoners in Afghanistan or in Iraq? It was not. There was a monumental responsibility on Prime Minister Howard, if he was going to allow the flouting of the Geneva conventions for Australians held in captivity, to draw a new line, to instruct the jailers inherently if not directly on where the Australian government would draw this new line. But none was drawn. The Prime Minister was derelict in not drawing new rules if he believed the Geneva convention rules should be flouted in the way that they were being flouted. 
So we now have in Iraq—and I believe it will flow on to Guantanamo Bay—investigations of an absolute failure to treat prisoners in a way civilisation would demand. Whatever else inquiries in the US or elsewhere may find, this is abundantly clear: President George W. Bush authorised the breach of international rules for treating prisoners and left no new line, no new set of rules. He lifted the rules and must, in that sense, bear his share of responsibility for what has happened. I say right here and now: this government should immediately demand that the Geneva conventions be applied in any conflict in which Australia is involved. Those rules must also apply as a minimum to civilians caught up in those conflicts and apprehended, whether by Australians or whether by people of other nationalities; otherwise, no law applies. The matter will test us for a long time to come.
But the Senate has a high responsibility to ensure we get at the truth of the matter, and we have not got at the truth of the matter as to what the government and the Prime Minister knew and as to the action that they should or could have taken or did or did not take as the information came in. I do not accept that because information was on the public record somehow or other, it was okay for the government not to take action—that everybody new about it in some way or other so the government did not have to take action. That is what the government has elected to do, and that is the responsibility of leadership. Nor do I accept the argument that the other side is worse, therefore we can abandon the rules. That is entirely what we are not about. We are about liberty, democracy and the rule of law. As we apply it at home, we should apply it in our actions elsewhere around the world.
Finally, as I brought out in question time yesterday, what a remarkable situation that there are 20,000 prisoners in Iraq—and we are told that up to 90 per cent of them are innocent: they have been civilians caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time, and they include many women—who do not have the Geneva conventions protecting them, except for one, and a few of his associates, and that is Saddam Hussein. This extraordinary situation has arisen because our leaders did not stick by the international rules and ensure that they were abided by. Saddam Hussein is being treated better than innocent civilians kept in Iraqi jails under the authority of the coalition of the willing. What an extraordinary situation for our Prime Minister, the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Great Britain to allow to develop.
We must act swiftly, strongly, diligently and with great responsibility to take the action that our Prime Minister has not taken. That begins with getting at the facts of the matter as best we can. I cannot see a better way of doing that than through the authority of this Senate and the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. The time to do it is now—not in a month's time, not after the elections, not some time next year and not at the end of 2005, which is when, we are told, the commitment so far for the United States to keep its forces in Iraq is paid up till. The time to act on this is now. This is a very, very important motion, and I appeal to the Senate to support it.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-05-13,"—Senator Brown is right: this is an absolutely critical matter. The proposed issues to be canvassed, as outlined by Senator Brown early in his speech, are—to use his words—`absolutely critical'. I do not wish to repeat comments I made at some length in this chamber on Tuesday afternoon, but it is true that the situation in relation to the treatment of certain Iraqi prisoners is utterly horrific, and this Senate has passed a very strong motion in relation to those matters.
What the Senate is now dealing with is the question, in terms of Senate processes, of how we deal with the Australian government response to those issues: when information was received, how it came to the attention of ministers, what assurances we have received that there would be no Australian involvement in these matters, the question of Australia's response when these matters became known to government, and a range of other associated important issues. They are important; they are significant. As far as the opposition is concerned, as this Senate chamber and the Australian people know, we do not underplay them at all.
Senator Brown said in the conclusion to his speech that he cannot see a better way of getting to the truth of these matters than referring these issues to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee for inquiry and report. I can; I think there is a significantly better way. I would commend to the Senate that the Senate use the best accountability mechanism it has available to it, the best accountability mechanism in this Australian parliament, in fact the best accountability mechanism of any Australian parliament—the Senate estimates process—to thoroughly investigate these matters. There would be times when I would not say that, because we have only three rounds of Senate estimates committees in each year. But the truth is that in just a few days the Senate will be examining the budget estimates. We will be back here the week after next for two full weeks of examination of government departments and agencies. There is not a better mechanism available for us to thoroughly scrutinise the government and its agencies on these issues.
Senator Brown says, not unreasonably, that parliament must have an explanation from Prime Minister Howard. That is not an unreasonable thing for Senator Brown to say. But Senator Brown knows—and, if he does not, he should know—that you will not get an explanation from Prime Minister Howard on these issues. That is why in this chamber we use other mechanisms to try to get to the truth, the facts, that relate to these sorts of issues—and the best mechanism we have is the Senate estimates committees. They are meeting the week after next for two full weeks, when not only responsible ministers but also responsible heads of agencies and other officers of the Commonwealth will be present and will be required to answer questions from senators about these issues. That is the sensible way of dealing with this particular matter. That is not to say, of course, that further examination of these issues will not be warranted. It may well be. I do not necessarily say that a Senate references committee is the best place to do it—I do not know. I want to see what information is gleaned through an exhaustive examination of agencies during the Senate estimates committees budget round. 
I am also not sure that there are not other matters, if the Senate so decides, that need to be examined, but I think we will be in a much stronger position in literally a matter of days to make those sorts of assessments. When you have a very good accountability mechanism, the best accountability mechanism in the parliament, isn't it smart for senators to use that mechanism in the first instance? Isn't that a clever thing to do? I would have thought so. I would say that the Senate has proved capable of doing just that. Take, for example, the issue in this parliament that I think received the greatest focus in the Senate committee system, and that is the issue of children overboard. Remember what happened. There was extensive examination of government agencies in the estimates committees on matters relating to that incident, and following that the Senate Select Committee on A Certain Maritime Incident set about its work. I think that is a pretty reasonable model to adopt on a matter of such significance as the extraordinarily serious matter of children overboard.
—It was so good they made a play about it.
—Yes, they did make a play about it, Senator Bartlett. I actually saw the play, and I know that you saw it because we saw the same production. I was told that that was the fourth time you had attended.
—The second.
—Only the second! It just goes to show how people in politics exaggerate, doesn't it? You were so pleased about your characterisation in the play that you went on a couple of occasions. I was quite shocked that when I walked into the play I actually tripped over you, naked on the floor, on the way in.
—And that I had breasts.
—That is true too, Senator Bartlett, but it was not actually you; it was an actor.
—Thank God for that.
—Yes, I was thankful. It was not actually you, Senator Bartlett; it was the actor who was playing you very well in that production. But I digress. I was interrupted by Senator Bartlett wanting to advertise the fact that he has become a cultural icon as a result of the play CMI. The point is that the CMI committee did an exhaustive, thorough job, but it followed very significant attention to this issue at Senate estimates. That is a good model to adopt. I think the right thing for us to do here is to use the budget estimates round—two solid weeks of questioning of government agencies—to further examine these issues and then make an assessment of what further action the Senate should take and what the issues that should be examined might be.
The way to do this is to adjourn this particular matter and determine it on the next day of sitting. There are all sorts of procedural devices that can be used at times to achieve this. The only way it can be done in a reasonable fashion so that there can be a full debate in the chamber on this important matter that Senator Brown has raised is for an adjournment motion to be moved. I have asked Senator Mackay, as the Opposition Whip, to do that at the conclusion of the debate so that any senator who wishes to make a contribution to this can. The impact of that would be that this matter would come on for discussion in the Senate on the next day of sitting—in other words, the first day of sitting after the Senate estimates round. I hope I have got that right. If I were wrong about that, no doubt the clerk would advise me; but I am confident. The clerk has nodded his head—it is a pity that was not on television—so I am reinforced. I am thankful that I have not misled the Senate in relation to that procedural advice. That is the only way to do this sensibly, and that is what Senator Mackay will do on behalf of the opposition. I think that is a perfectly proper, sensible and intelligent way of dealing with these issues which do have the utmost significance. 
While I agree with much of what Senator Brown has said, my conclusions are different in a process sense—on how to deal with them. I think the approach of the opposition is a sensible one. I think it is the proper one. I would be disappointed if we were to bypass our best accountability mechanism on this occasion. With the benefit of a great deal more information we can make a proper assessment on the next day of sitting about how to progress this matter in relation to any future inquiry. That is the approach I commend to the Senate. I think it makes sense and ensures, as is always the opposition's objective, maximum accountability—maximum opportunity to hold the Howard government accountable on these important matters.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade       References Committee</title>",Committees,10,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-05-13,"—This is a very crucial matter of fundamental importance. It is of such fundamental importance that I moved on behalf of the Democrats at the first available opportunity a motion of urgency condemning the mistreatment of prisoners in Iraq and calling for action. I am pleased that the Senate shared our views and stated a shared position that this was utterly unacceptable, that action must be taken to ensure that it does not happen again and that it must be fully and properly investigated. The Democrats are totally of the view that the mistreatment of prisoners by coalition forces in Iraq must be fully investigated in every way. That includes, of course, what the Australian government knew, when they knew it and what they did about it. That must happen, and the Democrats support every mechanism being pursued to ensure that it happens.
The motion before us at the moment is specifically to establish a distinct inquiry by a Senate committee to examine some of those questions. I want to make it quite clear that the Democrats support Senate committees inquiring into these matters. Our view is the same as Senator Faulkner's: that a Senate committee will be inquiring into these matters within the next fortnight. The matter is already referred, in effect, to a Senate committee and will be examined extensively by a Senate committee through the budget estimates process. Senator Faulkner is right in saying that that will provide the best way to explore not just the questions that are put forward in these terms of reference but also a whole range of other questions and at the conclusion of that process we will be much better placed to determine what the next necessary step is. If the government's performance in the parliament this week is anything to go by, there will continue to be dodging of questions, misleading and dishonest answers and a general attempt to refuse to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of coalition forces in Iraq.
I think that is an indictment of this government—one of the biggest indictments amongst many in relation to their dishonesty on so many issues and their refusal to accept responsibility for issues that are their responsibility. I believe this needs to be done not just to hold the government accountable—that is of course essential; it is a key part of what the Senate must do always—but also because I believe that, more than anybody, our troops in Iraq deserve this to be properly investigated. These actions by coalition forces are done in our name—in the name of Australia, which is part of the coalition forces—and our defence personnel in particular are implicated by association through being part of those coalition forces. 
I want to make it absolutely clear that that in no way implies that our troops have been involved in any mistreatment. I make that point pre-emptively to prevent any total misrepresentation by any government speakers now or later about my views on that. In fact, I am not aware of any evidence at all that suggests Australian troops or personnel of any sort have been involved in any of the mistreatment that has come to light. What I am saying is that, because we are part of those coalition forces and part of the governing authority, and obviously part of the invading forces, we are clearly seen to be associated with the activities of the coalition forces and it is done in effect in our name. I think our troops in particular deserve to have this matter properly investigated so that their good reputation can be maintained and so that the damage done to Australia's reputation and to the reputation of the coalition forces and, I might say, to those that seek to promote the rule of law can be minimised. That is my concern. I think it is essential that we examine it in the estimates committee. That is the best way to do it. Once that is done, then we can look at where to go next. I support Senator Faulkner's approach.
Debate (on motion by Senator Mackay) adjourned.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask that it be recorded that that motion was carried without dissent.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask that it be recorded that I oppose the motion.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I have no problem with Senator Brown so recording his views on these matters so that there is a Hansard record, but when this question was put to the vote there was no dissenting voice. That is my point.
—That's true.
—Of course it is true. There was no dissent in the chamber, and I completely accept that Senator Brown is opposed to the motion.
—On the point of order: I had, as everybody knows, just stepped out of the chamber for a moment, but my opposition was very clear and I want it recorded that that opposition stands.
—I remind you, Senator Brown, there was no opposition to your request.
—I had just stepped out of the chamber when the question was put. But I have come back afterwards and I am now recording the fact that I oppose the motion, even though I was not here at the time the question was put.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, the substantive motion is not opposed by anyone that I am aware of. The substantive motion has been adjourned; I am talking about the motion for adjournment. So you understand, Senator Brown, that the substantive motion has not been opposed?
—Yes, I do.
—The adjournment is supported. The substantive motion, as I understand it, has not been opposed by anyone at this point, so I think we might be speaking at cross-purposes here. Are we clear now, Senator Brown?

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-05-13,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee for inquiry and report by 23 June 2004:
The Australian Government's knowledge of the mistreatment of prisoners detained under the control of the United States of America or its coalition partners in Iraq, Afghanistan and at Guantanamo Bay, with particular reference to:
	(a)	when the Government or its agencies first received information about the abuse;
	(b)	when and how this information first came to the notice of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), or other members of the Government; 
	(c)	what action has been taken to assure that there has been and will be no Australian involvement, or Australian acquiescence, in this matter;
	(d)	how and when the Prime Minister conveyed Australia's rebuke to Washington and London;
	(e)	the extent of government knowledge about abuse of prisoners in prisons in Afghanistan, including at Bagram Air Base; and
	(f)	what disapprovals Australia has conveyed to the White House about the practice of placing hoods and manacles on prisoners, including Australians, at Guantanamo Bay and what other information the Government has about mistreatment of prisoners there.
This matter is absolutely critical. We have seen the abuse of prisoners in Iraq, and now we have on the Internet an obscene and disgusting response with the decapitation of an American overnight—appalling behaviour—in the misguided name of some higher authority, totally abandoning human precepts and human principles and with no excuse whatsoever. Such conduct can never be accommodated and no reasoning goes any way towards allowing for it. It is of international concern. What sort of world do we have? What sort of world are we handing on to our kids if, very often in the name of the religion which guides many of the principles that we have in our global civilisation, we have this unseemly humiliation, torture and death of people held in custody—very often people who are entirely innocent.
For our part, the detention and the humiliating and degrading treatment—including, we are led to believe, outright torture—of some prisoners in Iraq and, I believe, also in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay demand a national response. In particular they demand a response from Prime Minister Howard. It is under his government that our involvement in Afghanistan—and therefore the holding of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay—and now our involvement in Iraq has taken place. All these things have been on the authority of this government—not this parliament, I might add, but this government. It is extraordinarily important that this parliament have from the Prime Minister an explanation of the action he has undertaken to try to prevent the abuse of prisoners in these several places and the action that he is planning to undertake to circumvent further abuse, humiliation or torture of prisoners—whoever they might be, guilty or not guilty, whatever they might have allegedly done—because these acts are not acceptable in Australian society and by extension are not acceptable in conflicts in which Australia is involved. It is just simply not on.
The question is to our Prime Minister and our government: when did you know about these abuses taking place? What action did you take? And what action are you now going to take through the Prime Minister's special relationship with both Prime Minister Blair and President George W. Bush? From where I sit, the Prime Minister's reaction has been far short of that required. Certainly he has expressed disgust and he has answered questions from journalists. But where is the statement from the Prime Minister on behalf of this nation, the special dedicated statement of abhorrence of what is happening, an explanation to our nation of the actions taken by this Prime Minister to prevent these acts in the past and now to ensure that they do not happen in the future? Where is the assurance that he has spoken to George W. Bush or to Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, about these matters? We have not heard that from the Prime Minister of Australia. This nation deserves that from its leadership, and it is not getting it.
There is clear evidence that the government knew that prisoners were being held in appalling conditions in Baghdad and elsewhere as far back as the middle of last year from Amnesty International and that from the International Committee of the Red Cross came repeated reports to the governments of the coalition of the willing. Let us have from the government information about when it got these reports, to whom they went and what consideration and reaction was given about people left out in blistering heat, about people being burnt because of the surfaces on which they were left, about prisoners being deprived and, of course, about the emerging pictures of the appalling misconduct of the keepers of these prisoners that has now become a worldwide scandal. 
These are not matters of small moment or just matters of some moral judgment on what has happened in these prisons. They go directly to the safety of our own Defence Force personnel and of Australian civilians in Iraq, in Afghanistan and elsewhere around the world. They require greater action than we have seen from the Prime Minister, from the Minister for Foreign Affairs or from the Minister for Defence. I believe it is incumbent upon the Senate, in the absence of an explanation from the government, that we investigate these matters, that we find out from the government what the truth of the matter is. When did the government become acquainted with the mistreatment of prisoners and what action did it take? On the record at the moment it appears that no action was taken by the government until the matter surfaced in the public arena. That is totally unacceptable. That is neither in the interests of this country nor in the interests of our Defence Force personnel acting on behalf of this country, and on the authority of the Prime Minister, in Iraq and elsewhere. I want to see action and I believe that the Senate and this committee is the right place for us to get at the facts from which action can flow.
I believe this government has not acted sufficiently or adequately or directly or appropriately on these matters of abuse of prisoners in Afghanistan, in Iraq or in Guantanamo Bay. How can we have had leaders of the three countries—Australia, Britain and the United States—not comment on that very public exhibition of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay with hoods over their heads, with chains on their ankles and feet, kneeling in the sun, and the accompanying news of the 24-hour lights-on lockdown prison conditions to which they were subject in Guantanamo Bay? There was not one squeak out of our Prime Minister—nothing. Indeed, quite the reverse. There were words of inherent approval that this was happening in Guantanamo Bay not just to 600 prisoners from around the world—many of whom we know, most of whom we must presume, are not guilty of a crime because they have not been charged and many have since been released—but also to two Australians, Mr Hicks and Mr Habib. They are held there in breach of the Geneva conventions by the President of the United States. They are being held without contact with their relatives and loved ones, without access to legal advice. We know they are being held in conditions of sensory deprivation. We do not know about physical abuse—hoods on heads, manacles, the sorts of breaches that would never be allowed in Australia. The public would never allow that for prisoners in Australian detention.
But our Prime Minister allowed to be fully published before the whole world Australian prisoners being held by the United States in Guantanamo Bay. When that breach of international rules was allowed, where did our Prime Minister then draw the line? Having left the jailers at Guantanamo Bay with no new line of civilised behaviour towards prisoners, particularly prisoners who had not been charged and therefore must be assumed to be innocent, when the rules were withdrawn where did our Prime Minister draw a new line? He did not. Where did President George W. Bush draw a new line? He did not. Where was the inherent new line drawn for those people running prisoners in Afghanistan or in Iraq? It was not. There was a monumental responsibility on Prime Minister Howard, if he was going to allow the flouting of the Geneva conventions for Australians held in captivity, to draw a new line, to instruct the jailers inherently if not directly on where the Australian government would draw this new line. But none was drawn. The Prime Minister was derelict in not drawing new rules if he believed the Geneva convention rules should be flouted in the way that they were being flouted. 
So we now have in Iraq—and I believe it will flow on to Guantanamo Bay—investigations of an absolute failure to treat prisoners in a way civilisation would demand. Whatever else inquiries in the US or elsewhere may find, this is abundantly clear: President George W. Bush authorised the breach of international rules for treating prisoners and left no new line, no new set of rules. He lifted the rules and must, in that sense, bear his share of responsibility for what has happened. I say right here and now: this government should immediately demand that the Geneva conventions be applied in any conflict in which Australia is involved. Those rules must also apply as a minimum to civilians caught up in those conflicts and apprehended, whether by Australians or whether by people of other nationalities; otherwise, no law applies. The matter will test us for a long time to come.
But the Senate has a high responsibility to ensure we get at the truth of the matter, and we have not got at the truth of the matter as to what the government and the Prime Minister knew and as to the action that they should or could have taken or did or did not take as the information came in. I do not accept that because information was on the public record somehow or other, it was okay for the government not to take action—that everybody new about it in some way or other so the government did not have to take action. That is what the government has elected to do, and that is the responsibility of leadership. Nor do I accept the argument that the other side is worse, therefore we can abandon the rules. That is entirely what we are not about. We are about liberty, democracy and the rule of law. As we apply it at home, we should apply it in our actions elsewhere around the world.
Finally, as I brought out in question time yesterday, what a remarkable situation that there are 20,000 prisoners in Iraq—and we are told that up to 90 per cent of them are innocent: they have been civilians caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time, and they include many women—who do not have the Geneva conventions protecting them, except for one, and a few of his associates, and that is Saddam Hussein. This extraordinary situation has arisen because our leaders did not stick by the international rules and ensure that they were abided by. Saddam Hussein is being treated better than innocent civilians kept in Iraqi jails under the authority of the coalition of the willing. What an extraordinary situation for our Prime Minister, the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Great Britain to allow to develop.
We must act swiftly, strongly, diligently and with great responsibility to take the action that our Prime Minister has not taken. That begins with getting at the facts of the matter as best we can. I cannot see a better way of doing that than through the authority of this Senate and the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. The time to do it is now—not in a month's time, not after the elections, not some time next year and not at the end of 2005, which is when, we are told, the commitment so far for the United States to keep its forces in Iraq is paid up till. The time to act on this is now. This is a very, very important motion, and I appeal to the Senate to support it. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,10,2,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-05-13,"—Senator Brown is right: this is an absolutely critical matter. The proposed issues to be canvassed, as outlined by Senator Brown early in his speech, are—to use his words—`absolutely critical'. I do not wish to repeat comments I made at some length in this chamber on Tuesday afternoon, but it is true that the situation in relation to the treatment of certain Iraqi prisoners is utterly horrific, and this Senate has passed a very strong motion in relation to those matters.
What the Senate is now dealing with is the question, in terms of Senate processes, of how we deal with the Australian government response to those issues: when information was received, how it came to the attention of ministers, what assurances we have received that there would be no Australian involvement in these matters, the question of Australia's response when these matters became known to government, and a range of other associated important issues. They are important; they are significant. As far as the opposition is concerned, as this Senate chamber and the Australian people know, we do not underplay them at all.
Senator Brown said in the conclusion to his speech that he cannot see a better way of getting to the truth of these matters than referring these issues to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee for inquiry and report. I can; I think there is a significantly better way. I would commend to the Senate that the Senate use the best accountability mechanism it has available to it, the best accountability mechanism in this Australian parliament, in fact the best accountability mechanism of any Australian parliament—the Senate estimates process—to thoroughly investigate these matters. There would be times when I would not say that, because we have only three rounds of Senate estimates committees in each year. But the truth is that in just a few days the Senate will be examining the budget estimates. We will be back here the week after next for two full weeks of examination of government departments and agencies. There is not a better mechanism available for us to thoroughly scrutinise the government and its agencies on these issues.
Senator Brown says, not unreasonably, that parliament must have an explanation from Prime Minister Howard. That is not an unreasonable thing for Senator Brown to say. But Senator Brown knows—and, if he does not, he should know—that you will not get an explanation from Prime Minister Howard on these issues. That is why in this chamber we use other mechanisms to try to get to the truth, the facts, that relate to these sorts of issues—and the best mechanism we have is the Senate estimates committees. They are meeting the week after next for two full weeks, when not only responsible ministers but also responsible heads of agencies and other officers of the Commonwealth will be present and will be required to answer questions from senators about these issues. That is the sensible way of dealing with this particular matter. That is not to say, of course, that further examination of these issues will not be warranted. It may well be. I do not necessarily say that a Senate references committee is the best place to do it—I do not know. I want to see what information is gleaned through an exhaustive examination of agencies during the Senate estimates committees budget round. 
I am also not sure that there are not other matters, if the Senate so decides, that need to be examined, but I think we will be in a much stronger position in literally a matter of days to make those sorts of assessments. When you have a very good accountability mechanism, the best accountability mechanism in the parliament, isn't it smart for senators to use that mechanism in the first instance? Isn't that a clever thing to do? I would have thought so. I would say that the Senate has proved capable of doing just that. Take, for example, the issue in this parliament that I think received the greatest focus in the Senate committee system, and that is the issue of children overboard. Remember what happened. There was extensive examination of government agencies in the estimates committees on matters relating to that incident, and following that the Senate Select Committee on A Certain Maritime Incident set about its work. I think that is a pretty reasonable model to adopt on a matter of such significance as the extraordinarily serious matter of children overboard.
—It was so good they made a play about it.
—Yes, they did make a play about it, Senator Bartlett. I actually saw the play, and I know that you saw it because we saw the same production. I was told that that was the fourth time you had attended.
—The second.
—Only the second! It just goes to show how people in politics exaggerate, doesn't it? You were so pleased about your characterisation in the play that you went on a couple of occasions. I was quite shocked that when I walked into the play I actually tripped over you, naked on the floor, on the way in.
—And that I had breasts.
—That is true too, Senator Bartlett, but it was not actually you; it was an actor.
—Thank God for that.
—Yes, I was thankful. It was not actually you, Senator Bartlett; it was the actor who was playing you very well in that production. But I digress. I was interrupted by Senator Bartlett wanting to advertise the fact that he has become a cultural icon as a result of the play CMI. The point is that the CMI committee did an exhaustive, thorough job, but it followed very significant attention to this issue at Senate estimates. That is a good model to adopt. I think the right thing for us to do here is to use the budget estimates round—two solid weeks of questioning of government agencies—to further examine these issues and then make an assessment of what further action the Senate should take and what the issues that should be examined might be.
The way to do this is to adjourn this particular matter and determine it on the next day of sitting. There are all sorts of procedural devices that can be used at times to achieve this. The only way it can be done in a reasonable fashion so that there can be a full debate in the chamber on this important matter that Senator Brown has raised is for an adjournment motion to be moved. I have asked Senator Mackay, as the Opposition Whip, to do that at the conclusion of the debate so that any senator who wishes to make a contribution to this can. The impact of that would be that this matter would come on for discussion in the Senate on the next day of sitting—in other words, the first day of sitting after the Senate estimates round. I hope I have got that right. If I were wrong about that, no doubt the clerk would advise me; but I am confident. The clerk has nodded his head—it is a pity that was not on television—so I am reinforced. I am thankful that I have not misled the Senate in relation to that procedural advice. That is the only way to do this sensibly, and that is what Senator Mackay will do on behalf of the opposition. I think that is a perfectly proper, sensible and intelligent way of dealing with these issues which do have the utmost significance. 
While I agree with much of what Senator Brown has said, my conclusions are different in a process sense—on how to deal with them. I think the approach of the opposition is a sensible one. I think it is the proper one. I would be disappointed if we were to bypass our best accountability mechanism on this occasion. With the benefit of a great deal more information we can make a proper assessment on the next day of sitting about how to progress this matter in relation to any future inquiry. That is the approach I commend to the Senate. I think it makes sense and ensures, as is always the opposition's objective, maximum accountability—maximum opportunity to hold the Howard government accountable on these important matters.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,10,2,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-05-13,"—This is a very crucial matter of fundamental importance. It is of such fundamental importance that I moved on behalf of the Democrats at the first available opportunity a motion of urgency condemning the mistreatment of prisoners in Iraq and calling for action. I am pleased that the Senate shared our views and stated a shared position that this was utterly unacceptable, that action must be taken to ensure that it does not happen again and that it must be fully and properly investigated. The Democrats are totally of the view that the mistreatment of prisoners by coalition forces in Iraq must be fully investigated in every way. That includes, of course, what the Australian government knew, when they knew it and what they did about it. That must happen, and the Democrats support every mechanism being pursued to ensure that it happens.
The motion before us at the moment is specifically to establish a distinct inquiry by a Senate committee to examine some of those questions. I want to make it quite clear that the Democrats support Senate committees inquiring into these matters. Our view is the same as Senator Faulkner's: that a Senate committee will be inquiring into these matters within the next fortnight. The matter is already referred, in effect, to a Senate committee and will be examined extensively by a Senate committee through the budget estimates process. Senator Faulkner is right in saying that that will provide the best way to explore not just the questions that are put forward in these terms of reference but also a whole range of other questions and at the conclusion of that process we will be much better placed to determine what the next necessary step is. If the government's performance in the parliament this week is anything to go by, there will continue to be dodging of questions, misleading and dishonest answers and a general attempt to refuse to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of coalition forces in Iraq.
I think that is an indictment of this government—one of the biggest indictments amongst many in relation to their dishonesty on so many issues and their refusal to accept responsibility for issues that are their responsibility. I believe this needs to be done not just to hold the government accountable—that is of course essential; it is a key part of what the Senate must do always—but also because I believe that, more than anybody, our troops in Iraq deserve this to be properly investigated. These actions by coalition forces are done in our name—in the name of Australia, which is part of the coalition forces—and our defence personnel in particular are implicated by association through being part of those coalition forces. 
I want to make it absolutely clear that that in no way implies that our troops have been involved in any mistreatment. I make that point pre-emptively to prevent any total misrepresentation by any government speakers now or later about my views on that. In fact, I am not aware of any evidence at all that suggests Australian troops or personnel of any sort have been involved in any of the mistreatment that has come to light. What I am saying is that, because we are part of those coalition forces and part of the governing authority, and obviously part of the invading forces, we are clearly seen to be associated with the activities of the coalition forces and it is done in effect in our name. I think our troops in particular deserve to have this matter properly investigated so that their good reputation can be maintained and so that the damage done to Australia's reputation and to the reputation of the coalition forces and, I might say, to those that seek to promote the rule of law can be minimised. That is my concern. I think it is essential that we examine it in the estimates committee. That is the best way to do it. Once that is done, then we can look at where to go next. I support Senator Faulkner's approach.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-05-13,"—This motion seeks to enable the debating, in effect, forthwith of the family assistance legislation measures contained in the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—One-off Payments) Bill 2004 and the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—Increased Payments) Bill 2004 that were announced just last Tuesday night, less than 48 hours ago. The legislation was only introduced in the House of Representatives yesterday and was guillotined through the House of Representatives yesterday against the wishes of the Labor opposition in the House of Representatives. 
I recognise that the one-off payments bill seeks to enable, as the name suggests, a one-off payment to be made to people before 30 June. No doubt the government will use that as a reason for the absolute urgency to consider and pass this bill. The Democrats are very concerned about this process of legislation being introduced one day and rushed through the next. It is not simple, straightforward, one-line legislation. It is very significant, complex legislation. The government would be well aware—even more importantly, many, many Australian families are well aware—that there are significant flaws in the existing legislation dealing with family payments because it is very complex and was put through at the time without, in my view, adequate scrutiny. A lot of people have been paying the price ever since.
To repeat that performance and rush through something without any scrutiny at all—and let us be honest here: there will be no serious opportunity for scrutiny of the complexity of this legislation if it is rushed through today—is of concern to the Democrats. That is what this cut-off motion is about. As I understand it, looking a little more closely at the standing orders, the session this week is actually a single session in its own right as a budget session and when we come back in June it is a new session. So the only impact of this motion is to enable it to be debated today. The Democrats are not seeking to hold this up. We are seeking to ensure that it actually gets some respect and is properly examined and that the Australian people, quite frankly, get some respect and have these proposals properly examined. 
There are two bills which seek to exempt the cut-off. I would ask that the question for those two bills be put separately. We will very reluctantly but nonetheless accede to allowing the one-off payment bill to be debated straightaway. We will agree to that. But the other legislation that deals with the broader range of payments and changes to family arrangements should, at a minimum, be examined by the Senate committee process.
Senator Faulkner has just said, in relation to the previous question we were talking about, that we will be examining the budget estimates in just a few days. As we all know, the budget estimates can be used to cover a range of issues. We have just been talking about using them to examine the behaviour of coalition forces in Iraq. But the primary, absolutely fundamental first purpose of estimates is to examine budget proposals: how they are going to work, what the costs are going to be and who is going to be affected. 
Whether what the government says the legislation does is what will actually happen is debatable. We have had problems with family payments legislation to date. The legislation was introduced and it was said that it would work a certain way and be wonderful. Then we found out that it has not worked that way. A lot of people have had difficulties. It is our job—forget about the politics of it—to have a look at this to make sure that, at a minimum, it will do what it says it is going to do and there are not going to be unintended consequences. It is almost inevitable that in an area we all know is complex you will get unintended consequences if you just rush it through solely to suit the Prime Minister's election timetable and the political timetable of the major parties.
I know the Labor Party objected in the House of Representatives yesterday to it being rushed through. I have just seen a press release from the member for Lyons, Mr Dick Adams, complaining about being gagged before he even got through a couple of paragraphs of his speech on this legislation and saying that the government obviously do not want criticism of their bill because it is getting too close to the truth. At least in the Senate we get a chance to talk about these things. That is one advantage we have over the House of Representatives. But let us not sell ourselves shorter than we need to. We have budget estimates. Senator Collins in particular has quite a good record of forensically examining all these sorts of things. I do not want her to miss out on that opportunity by having this pushed through. All the questions will still be asked, but there is hardly any point if the legislation has already gone through.
I do not think it is acceptable to say, `We will put it all through now and then we will see how it is going to work and fix it up later.' I could go on for many hours about the number of pieces of flawed law that currently exist that have been pushed through and about which it has been said, `We will sort it out later if it does not work.' There is no rewind button on legislation and it is very hard to fix up later. It wastes time and public money and the Australian public have to suffer in the meantime with any flaws.
We are not supportive of rushing this through at all. I know that some of the one-off payments are meant to be paid by 30 June. The government will say that we need to have all the systems in place to enable this money to be doled out. Frankly, I think that is a poor excuse as well. Everybody knows when budget day is. To try to basically defy reality and force through payments overnight purely to suit an election timetable, and for no other reason, is not a terribly good reason to rush through legislation. I am not going to let the government get away with misrepresenting our position by saying that we are trying to deny people getting an immediate assistance payment. So we will not oppose the cut-off and we will enable the immediate debate on the one-off payment bill. We will contribute to that debate of course; we believe there are some changes and improvements that can be made. The broader bill to do with family assistance should be examined by Senate estimates to make sure that the very significant amount of taxpayers' money that is going to be committed as part of that legislation will be spent effectively. 
I do not think any of us can pretend that we will be able to make that judgment properly without, at the minimum, having gone through the budget estimates process. Otherwise we may as well not have scrutiny of these sorts of things. Normally, legislation of this significance would go to a legislation committee charged specifically with examining that bill and nothing else. However, the Democrats, as always, are willing to be constructive and flexible. We are not simply trying to get in the way; in fact we are trying to facilitate even better legislation. So we would like the question on the two bills to be put and voted on separately. Let me be clear: we are not seeking to hold up the second piece of legislation, the so-called more help for families—increased payments bill, but we want to ensure that it is not rushed through the Senate before the budget estimates process. We simply seek to adjourn the question on the second bill until the first day of sittings after the budget estimates committee hearings—which, as I understand it, would be 15 June. I do not know whether procedurally that is something we can do now or when the question is put.
To make our position crystal clear, the Democrats are willing, with some reluctance, to support the motion for the immediate debate on the one-off payments bill but wish to amend the motion in relation to the second bill, to do with the broader changes to family assistance, in order to have that motion enabling the cut-off to be deferred or adjourned until the first day of sittings after the budget estimates committee hearings, which is 15 June. That is the next day of sittings anyway, so we are putting it off for one sitting day to enable the budget estimates committees to do their job, to enable the Senate to do its job and to at least give the legislation some degree of examination. I think that is the absolute minimum that the Senate should insist on to enable us to exercise the responsibilities we are elected by the people to carry out.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2004-05-13,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, I was about to commence my comments, before you indicated what we would do with respect to the question, by saying that it would be in the hands of the Senate, but Labor's position is that we will support the cut-off with respect to both bills—the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—One-off Payments) Bill 2004 and the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (More Help for Families—Increased Payments) Bill 2004. If we end up doing that through a process of splitting the question and then opposing a move to adjourn the debate on the second bill, so be it. Labor's position is clearly that we will be supporting the cut-off with respect to both bills. However, following Senator Bartlett's comments, there are a few comments that I should make. We, too, are doing this somewhat reluctantly. We acknowledge all of the concerns that Senator Bartlett has just highlighted—and, indeed, his compliments as well; thank you, Senator Bartlett. 
However, no matter how much questioning I do in Senate estimates or how much time the opposition has with respect to this bill, we will find the same problems that we have found with the family benefits system under this government time and time again. Unfortunately, no amount of time or Senate scrutiny will change some of the basic facts. These basic facts were best highlighted in an opinion piece in the Australian today by Neil Warren. I bring to the attention of the Senate chamber the opening comments in that piece:
The Government has squandered the chance to use its sizeable surplus to fund substantive tax and welfare reforms ... 
This budget does not include those substantive reforms that the government itself has paraded it would achieve in this term—and in fact in the last term. All we have are short-term fixes and election bribes. No amount of Senate estimates questioning and no amount of discussion in this chamber, unfortunately, are going to change that.
What we do have, though, is the opportunity to change some other things. We have the opportunity to change today the financial pressures that many Australian families have been suffering under this government. This budget does—albeit in a fairly clumsy, short-term-fix type way—offer some support for which families have been desperate for many, many years. Whilst Senator Bartlett referred to one Senate sitting day, most of us realise that that actually equates to a period of time of four weeks. I know that Centrelink have given some assurances that, even were we to delay some of this process until the first week of our sittings in June, they could still effect the 1 July time frame. I am a little more sceptical about Centrelink's administration processes and guarantees that they might be able to give to that effect. Labor will do nothing which will delay desperately needed financial support for Australian families.
I highlighted in the chamber yesterday that the last time we had any improvement in maternity benefits for Australian families was in 1995—when I first came into the Senate—when Labor introduced the maternity allowance. Australian families have waited since 1995, almost nine years, for any improvement in their maternity benefits. We will not delay that. Unfortunately, these bills do not include the child-care measures provided for in the budget, because this government has allowed 40,000 child-care places to build up without providing for them over the last several years. That is why it can now say, `We will give 40,000 outside school hours care places.' Families have been waiting for those places for several years. Many of us know families who have been sitting on child-care waiting lists for several years. Labor will have no role in holding up, for any period of time at all, any desperately needed, albeit clumsy, measures by this government—measures made in an attempt to bribe voters in the lead-up to an election. I have a little more confidence in the Australian public—because they will remember what the government did at the last election. They will remember the $1,000 election bribe that was offered in the lead-up to the last election and they will see that the $600 offered this time is just a slightly different version of what the government ran last time. A $1,000 bribe in the lead-up to the election is now a $600 bribe and then another $600 afterwards; so that is $1,200.
The only thing they have learnt this time is that people are a little more cynical and they know that the system continues to roll family tax debts year after year. So the variation the government have come up with this time is that, rather than giving people no dollars in a non-election year, they are giving them $600 in a non-election year. But they still have not fixed the system. The average debt is $900 and the payment will be $600, so families will still have family tax debts of $300. No scrutiny of these bills will change that fact. No amount of questioning in Senate estimates and no amount of debate in this chamber will change that fact but we can at least ensure that that money will go into the pockets of Australian families. That is why Labor will support the cut-off motion with respect to both bills to effect those changes as soon as possible. 
I certainly empathise with Senator Bartlett's comments, though, about the process. I think Mr Swan has made the same points in the other place. This process is absolutely atrocious. Again, we have a bit more confidence in the Australian public's political literacy. They will see what this is. They know that the Treasurer is seeking to buy their votes. I hope the Australian public get this support and I hope they get it in a very timely way but, as some of the press reports have indicated over the last couple of days, they know what this government has delivered—the hardship that has been delivered over several years for Australian families. So let us get them the support they need as quickly as possible. I think they can see through this approach—and let us hope that the government feels that as well.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-05-13,"—The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 is an essentially non-controversial bill which makes minor amendments to some 22 different pieces of legislation. The Democrats do not oppose these amendments. However, there is one amendment which I would like to comment briefly on this afternoon, and that is the proposed amendment to the Evidence Act. The Evidence Act currently provides that evidence may be given outside of Australia by an Australian diplomatic officer. The bill extends this to include locally engaged consular officers. While this amendment is not contentious in itself, it reminds me of a recent issue involving an Australian citizen who is currently imprisoned in the United States, namely Mr Kirk Pinner. I have spoken about this case previously in this place. In fact, in the course of a debate on a previous bill, I asked the Minister for Justice and Customs a series of questions about that particular case. Although he undertook to provide answers to my questions, the minister has not yet responded. 
Mr Pinner's case involved an issue about Australian consular personnel providing evidence regarding Australian citizens. Mr Pinner was charged with a criminal offence, a charge which he denied. He remained in the United States on bail for a considerable time after being charged. Mr Pinner claims he was subsequently advised by Australian consular personnel that he would not receive a fair trial within the US justice system and that he should return to Australia. That allegation is denied by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. However, an Australian consular office in the US did issue a new passport to Mr Pinner and he returned home to Tasmania, breaching his bail. The minister for justice subsequently authorised Mr Pinner's extradition to the US to face trial. The Attorney-General's Department informs me that more Australians are extradited to the United States each year than to any other nation in the world. In the lead-up to Mr Pinner's case, the prosecution indicated that it wished to subpoena a consular officer, Mr Brian Brook, to testify against Mr Pinner during the trial. The Democrats expressed our concern that this would be contrary to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, which protects consular officers from being compelled to provide evidence.
Quite apart from the legalities of the issue, the Democrats' primary concern relates to the interests of Australians travelling abroad. The whole purpose of Australian consular offices in other countries is to provide assistance and to protect the interests of Australian citizens. If Australian consular officers are permitted to provide evidence against Australian citizens, how can that purpose be properly fulfilled? How can Australian citizens have any confidence that, when they seek assistance from an Australian consular office, their interests will not subsequently be compromised by the very people who are supposed to assist them? We Democrats believe this is an issue of some serious concern and one that needs to be clarified and, if necessary, addressed for the benefit of all Australians who travel overseas.
I note that Mr Pinner, following his recent trial in the US, has been convicted and sentenced to a period of imprisonment. We Democrats understand that there is some uncertainty as to whether Mr Pinner will be transferred back to Australia to serve out that prison sentence here and, indeed, whether his sentence of imprisonment will take into account the time he spent in custody in Tasmania prior to his extradition to the United States. I take this opportunity on behalf of the Democrats to call on the government to ensure that Mr Pinner is brought home to Australia to serve out his sentence close to his family—including his parents; his partner, Tracey; and his son—in Tasmania.",SENATE,<title>LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2004-05-13,"—I thank senators for their comments on the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. The bill is an important piece of legislation that will amend 22 acts and thereby neaten the statute books considerably. The bill amends legislation to improve the efficiencies of a variety of court, tribunal and diplomatic and consular functions and to align their procedures with standard practices. The bill also removes typographical errors and makes minor consequential amendments that were not made on previous occasions. It clarifies the operation of certain provisions and removes references to legislation and organisations that are no longer in operation or have been renamed. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2004-05-13,"—The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 2004 makes two changes to Australia's classification regime. Firstly, it will require computer games to be classified in the same way as films according to the same classification categories that apply to films. The Democrats welcome this change but we do not believe it goes quite far enough. We support the move towards a more uniform classification regime. It makes sense to have the same classification names for different genres. This will simplify the classification regime and make it more easily understood by the general public.
While there are some mandatory age restrictions that apply to classifications such as MA, R and X, the other classifications are advisory only. The whole purpose of those classifications is to enable people to make informed choices about what they or their children watch, so it is vital that the community is familiar with the names of each of the classifications and what they mean. I believe that the Australian community is now fairly familiar with the classifications which apply to film and television. But why restrict these classifications to film and television only? This bill goes some way to addressing this issue by extending film classifications to computer games. The Democrats support this extension of the classification regime.
The constant advances in computer technology mean that we now have games that are essentially interactive films. It makes sense to subject this genre to the same classification as television and film. When choosing computer games people should be able to take the classification of those games into account. This is, of course, particularly important for parents and guardians concerned about their young children. 
But the point that the Democrats would particularly like to make is this: why stop at computer games? Why hasn't this extension of the classification regime been applied to publications as well? If people can make informed decisions about what films or television programs they choose to watch or what computer games they choose to buy and play, why shouldn't they also be given the opportunity to make informed choices about what books they choose to read? Perhaps the minister or the parliamentary secretary can indicate whether the government has perhaps considered moving towards a uniform classification regime for all genres including books and, if not, why not? Why is this bill restricted to computer games only?
The second aspect of this bill is to make some minor amendments to the names of classification types. These changes are intended to highlight the distinction between advisory classifications which are advisory and those such as MA, R and X which incorporate mandatory age restrictions. The bill seeks to change the names of these mandatory classifications to MA 15+, R 18+ and X 18+ respectively. Other classifications, namely, G, PG and M, will remain unchanged. The Democrats do not oppose this change. We note that it does not involve any change to the scope of these classifications. The classifications which will have their names changed already involved mandatory age restrictions and they will continue to have them after the enactment of this bill. What the bill does is simply change the names of those classifications so that they reflect these age restrictions. Again, this change will help individuals make informed decisions about what they choose to watch. Notwithstanding our concerns, as indicated by the questions I have raised with the secretary, the Democrats will support this legislation.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2004-05-13,"—I note that the main effect of the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 2004 will be to ensure common classification types for films and computer games to assist people to have a deeper and more understandable system of classification. This will be achieved by adopting the film classifications. On the surface that seems to be a good idea and pretty well accepted round the traps. There have been questions asked about these matters of the department over a period of time. But, upon examination, it turns out to be a turn for the worse if certain things do not occur. This would be both because the film classification system is flawed and because the nature of computer games is such that they allow repetitive and reinforcing actions. The repetitive nature of computer games can reinforce violent images and actions. There is enough violence in the place without more. This means that computer games should have stronger classification standards and not weaker ones. There cannot be such a thing as an R+ computer game, and as for the other classifications I will deal with those at the committee stage.
Senators may be aware that late last year state, territory and Commonwealth ministers changed the 1996 film classification guidelines to what the Attorney-General told me, as a result of estimates questions, is `simplified and streamlined' so they can be `more workable and transparent' about the tests the board must apply. In short, there is a plain English set of guidelines, which I have in my hand. I first started to worry about the new guidelines last year when my plain English reading of them told me that the substance and meaning of the guidelines had in fact changed. But I was told that if I interpreted these supposedly plain English guidelines correctly that was not the case.
Later in November of last year the state, territory and Commonwealth censorship ministers issued a communique in which they stated their agreement to change classification laws to `better inform the community about strong material in films and computer games'. Unfortunately, that commitment has already been brought into question. Rather than better informing the community about film content, changes in classification laws have led to a liberalisation in the censorship and a great deal of confusion about what the standards are. 
Early last year the Attorney-General's Department informed me that the R classification, amongst others, had recently been changed to the new streamlined format. I was assured:
The general rule will ensure that there is no change in classification standards in the R category.
In explanation of one of the `more workable and transparent' tests the department told me:
Sexual activity may be realistically simulated. The general rule is: simulated, yes; the real thing, no.
You would think that that would be a fairly easy test to apply. The 1996 guidelines state:
Sexual violence may only be implied and should not be detailed.
The new streamlined 2003 guidelines state:
Sexual violence may be implied, if justified by context.
A significant change, I would have thought, in allowing violent content, but I was assured that there was no practical change. Last year the Classification Board approved the screening of a film called Irreversible. The Classification Board notes: 
This film includes a brief depiction of actual fellatio.
But the rule `simulation, yes; the real thing, no' was not applied and the film was allowed a classification of R. The Classification Board also noted the impact of an anal rape scene in the film, stating:
The impact of this anal rape scene is high due to the lengthy real-time depiction, with a considerable amount of verbal and visual detail.
Again, an effective change has been made to the classification guidelines, despite the assurances of the department, to allow a film with a horribly violent, lengthy and detailed scene into the R classification. Sexual violence depicted in the film was indeed detailed and went beyond being implied. This is very disconcerting when we are faced time and time again with violent sexual crimes. The type of material that can be allowed—given the experience with the film Irreversible—is material containing a substantial degree of sexual violence. The Attorney-General has assured community organisations that he was `confident that the combined guidelines do not change the classification standards that were applied under the previous film guidelines'. We now know that that is not the case.
I acknowledge that computer games will not be allowed if they have a classification higher than MA, but the value of the exercise has to be called into question when the film classification system is so discredited. Computer games are by their very nature different from films. Playing computer games is an interactive activity, while watching a film is a passive activity. Computer games can reinforce a violent message, as the player can undertake a simulated violent act multiple times in order to perfect it and succeed in the game or simply because there is the opportunity.
Computer games are constantly being made more realistic in their depiction of the virtual world. It is quite natural that undertaking repetitive simulated violence has the effect of dulling the revulsion we naturally feel towards violence. It can help to create and then to reinforce an attitude more accepting of violence. That is why computer games are very different from films and should be treated as such. I know that there are provisions in the code which talk about certain things to be taken into consideration, but this is a subjective judgment. I believe that the system is such that material which was disallowed under the 1996 guidelines in certain circumstances is obviously allowed now, even though there is great concern in the community about the level of violence in the community.
I was very interested in what some of my colleagues in the House of Representatives said. I understand their statements, and I hope that their confidence in what is occurring with this legislation and what is occurring in general is seen to be worth while. My colleagues in the House of Representatives saw fit to deal with this legislation, which is designed to ensure common classification types for films and computer games to assist people in recognising the particular classification. That is fine, and I understand why they praised the legislation, but once they see some of the problems that are emerging as a result of the decisions that have been made by the Classification Board they should take a look at them. They should look particularly at the example that I gave and ask these questions: why did this take place? Why does it appear, on the face of it, that this film would not have got through with the classification that it got under the previous guidelines? Those questions have not been answered. There are a number of other things that I want to raise, but I do not want to keep the chamber. I would require a committee stage debate to deal with those matters. ",SENATE,"<title>CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2004-05-13,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 2004. I will deal with Senator Greig's comments in a moment, and I am happy to attempt to answer the questions that Senator Harradine has raised. This bill makes a number of amendments to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. The bill merely renames the existing classification types and does not affect the criteria used to classify films and computer games.
The bill will improve the operation of the national classification scheme in two ways. First, the amendments will implement common classification types for films and computer games. Research indicates a low level of awareness of computer games classifications, at 43 per cent; and a high level of awareness of film classifications, at 97 per cent. By using the same classifications for films and computer games we will substantially increase the ability of parents in particular to chose computer games for their children. Second, the bill will create a more effective distinction between the advisory and legally restricted classifications. There is substantial difference in the material permissible between the advisory and restricted classifications. The bill creates a clear distinction between these classifications through the inclusion of age references in the names of the restricted classifications only.
The amendments will be of great assistance to consumers, particularly parents, in making informed choices about the appropriateness of film and computer games for themselves and their families. The omission of the schedule to the act does not affect the legal status of the National Classification Code, which under section 6 of the act is the code approved by ministers and published in the Gazette. The version of the code in the act is obsolete. The removal of the schedule which contains the obsolete version of the code will enhance the readability of the legislation and remove the risk of confusion caused by the current situation. Amendments to state and territory classification enforcement legislation will closely follow the passage of this bill. Consequential changes to the National Classification Code have been agreed in principle by censorship ministers and will be formalised prior to the bill's commencement.
I will briefly deal with the matters raised by Senator Greig. His first point was that this bill does not go far enough. Under the national classification scheme all substantive policy matters are agreed by Commonwealth, state and territory censorship ministers and, in the case of legislation, by relevant parliaments. Ministers have not considered the application of the film classifications to publications, although Senator Greig's suggestion is worthy of further consideration and the government will seek to raise this issue with ministers. If ministers agree to pursue this matter, appropriate consultation will need to precede any legislative amendment.
I will move to some of the matters raised by Senator Harradine. The bill does not affect the content of the classifications in the guidelines for the classification of film and computer games. The guidelines will be reprinted prior to the commencement of the bill, as the reference to old classification categories will need to be removed. With regard to interactivity and computer games, issues of interactivity are dealt with in the guidelines themselves and include such matters as repetition. The longstanding direction from censorship ministers that computer games are to be assessed more strictly due to their interactivity is unchanged and is given effect through the guidelines. Pages 4 and 5 of the guidelines discuss the assessment of impact. Page 5 specifically states: `Impact may be higher where a scene ... encourages interactivity.' This part of the guidelines has the effect that, in classifying a computer game, the board must take into account interactivity. Because in practice interactivity most frequently arises in the context of computer games, the outcome is that games are classified more strictly. 
The notion that films and computer games should have different classifications because of interactivity is misguided. Interactivity is not of itself a sufficient reason for distinguishing between the two products. Parents want a simple and more easily understood classification system. Common classifications for films and computer games address this issue. As I have already said, research indicates a low level of awareness of the computer games classification scheme and a high level of awareness of the film classification scheme. By using the same classifications for films and computer games we will substantially increase the ability of parents in particular to choose computer games for their children. We believe this greater understanding by consumers of the classifications for computer games, combined with the specific references to interactivity in the guidelines and the provision of appropriate information and protection, will enable them to make informed choices about computer games for themselves and their families.
Senator Harradine also made some specific comments about the film Irreversible. The Classification Board and the Classification Review Board are independent statutory bodies that classify films, computer games and certain publications under the national classification scheme. The boards are selected to be broadly representative, as far as possible, of the Australian community. When classifying films or computer games, the Classification Board uses the criteria in the National Classification Code and in the Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games.
The Classification Review Board was established under the Classification Act to provide an independent and transparent mechanism for merits based review of decisions of the classification board. In making its decision to classify Irreversible,the board considered the criteria in the Classification Act, the National Classification Code and the Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games. As I said, the act requires the board to be broadly representative of the Australian community. The board noted that `the themes of rape, revenge and violence are portrayed and dealt with in such a way that they may be offensive to some sections of the adult community but were not offensive to the extent that the film warrants refused classification'.
I understand that Senator Harradine wants to take the bill to the committee stage, but at this stage I will commend the bill to the Senate.

Why do all the cameos in the budget document More help for families show an individual or couple on zero private income per annum as receiving an increased assistance of $500 per year in the form of a government superannuation co-contribution?

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-05-13,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I draw the minister's attention to my question, which related to the budget document which shows that individuals or couples with zero income are assuming assistance of $500. How can a person with zero income contribute $1,000 if they do not have any income? If it is not a deception, what are the assumptions made about the take-up rate by people on a zero income that are contained in those costings that she has referred to? How many Australians on a zero income will be able to contribute $1,000 to attract the $500 benefit that the government has illustrated in its own budget document?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget 2004-05</title>,Questions Without Notice,18,1,question
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-05-13,"—I thank Senator Sherry for the question. I would vouch for the correct position in the budget papers. What Senator Sherry's question has asked me to address is the entitlement of those people to the new superannuation co-contribution measure that the government announced as part of the budget. In Tuesday's budget the government announced a very significant expansion of the current super co-contribution scheme. The government will in fact provide a boost to retirement savings of $2.1 billion to the co-contribution for low- to middle-income earners over four years to enhance the already creative and imaginative co-contribution scheme that was introduced in the previous budget. The government will now contribute $1.50 for every $1 of voluntary personal contributions to a maximum of $1,500 for those on incomes up to $28,000. It does not have to be $1,000. This seems to be something that is being peddled around by the Labor Party—that, in order to get the maximum contribution, you have to put in $1,000. That is not the case. In fact, you can put in any amount that could be managed, up to $1,000—$5, if you like, spare change from the shopping. Any amount that someone can manage will be matched by $1.50 from the government—up from $1.
So it is a contribution that has been extended. The superannuation co-contribution tapers for those on incomes from $28,000 up to an income level of $58,000, so it has also been extended, from $40,000 to $58,000. It is fairly and squarely targeted at low- to middle-income earners who will have an opportunity to get a very generous co-contribution for any voluntary amount that they can save. It is a significant expansion of the contribution, which will ensure that many more people are eligible. Of course, it depends on attitude and it depends on take-up. All of those things are subject to people seeing our wonderful ads on co-contribution which encourage people to save whatever they can for their retirement. It will provide further incentives for those on low and middle incomes to contribute to super, and it is a very real way to boost retirement savings. 
There are some very interesting examples of just how successful the co-contribution could be. There is a very interesting example under the expanded super co-contribution. A young person entering the work force who earns $25,000 and makes an additional personal contribution of $1,000 will receive a maximum co-contribution of $1,500 and, whether it is $5 a week or change from the weekly shopping, someone on $25,000 will receive $1.50 from the government for every $1 they personally contribute up to the $1,500 limit. This will actually mean that if an individual continues to make the maximum personal contributions over their working life, their retirement balance is projected to increase by $106,000—that is, an 86 per cent improvement. It is very interesting because, if you look at what Labor have suggested they might do for people in this category and reduce the contributions tax, the benefit to them would be only $3,000. So it is a pretty significant difference. Labor's policy will cost over $1 billion a year and not deliver the same benefits.

Alongside that, given that the housing projects are described as being family friendly domestic environments, will the government allow the children in particular to receive visitors in that domestic environment, namely in the house, rather than them having to go up to the main detention centre just to receive visitors?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget 2004-05</title>,Questions Without Notice,20,1,question
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2004-05-13,"—Senator, as I am sure you understand and presumably agree—and I believe I have heard you indicate that you agree—placement in residential housing projects is a preferable placement for children to having them in immigration detention centres and, by having agreed that, you yourself confirm that it is obviously a more friendly environment for children and women. You raise the point: how can we say `family friendly' if adult men are not permitted to move out of the detention centres into those residential housing projects? But I just seek, first of all, to put on the record your endorsement of residential housing projects as being a better place for children to be in than detention centres, which is certainly the government's view. That is why we have worked so hard to reduce the number of children who are in detention centres. I think the number is now down to less than 12—it might be 11—and of those 11 I understand quite a number could move out but have refused. 
One of the reasons their parents may have refused is the very point that you raise about housing projects, namely that adult males are not permitted in them. There are two reasons for this. One, I am advised that when negotiations were undertaken with relevant communities about placing housing projects there—because they are in what would appear to be normal streets; if you look down the street you would not know necessarily that it was a residential housing project—the particular community, and I am thinking of Port Augusta here, was adamant that it would only be a reasonable proposition if the houses were available to only women and children. 
The second reason is that most of the people who have come here illegally and who have been designated not to be refugees and are therefore in detention centres—as you know, Senator, the refugees are out in the community with visas—are single adult men. I ask you to consider the position of some of the women. If you are one of the few females, and even fewer females with children, you may very well prefer—and I am advised that a number do—to have a place you can go where adult men are not allowed to be. If you were, for example, the mother of a fourteen-year-old female you may well welcome being in a residential housing project where boys over 18 and other adult men would not be. I am advised that those two reasons are why we keep, for example, the Port Augusta residential housing facility as one that is only available to women and children. 
I do understand that there are some children who may still be in detention centres because their mothers have refused to move out and leave the partner behind. The partner has an extensive capacity to visit. Sometimes families have provision for two forms of accommodation because they move back into a detention centre for a week or whatever to be with their partner. I am considering whether there is a capacity to modify that in one of the detention centres and have one, possibly Woomera for example, where you did allow adult males. You would still have to take into account the views of the local community and the views of women and children who were going to be in the housing project. There are good reasons for this. It is more friendly than being in a detention centre—much more family friendly.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget 2004-05</title>,Questions Without Notice,20,1,answer
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2004-05-13,"—I hope you will agree; I suppose in one sense it is immaterial whether you do or not—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—It is, because I am about to make the claim that I am very proud of what this government has done in trying to make facilities better for children. I hope you will agree with that but you may not. Yes, obviously, we will be considering what can be done. I understand the view you take with respect to visitors but I also ask you to understand that there are some lobby groups—generally not service providers—who may seek to take advantage of such arrangements and, unfortunately, it is those who do not play by the rules and may seek to take advantage of such arrangements that make it worse for others. That is always the case. It is the negative people in the community who put limits on the rest of us who are happy to do the right thing. I take you back, for example, to some children who, with the assistance of some of the community, broke out of a detention centre and stayed out. You would not want to allow that sort of thing to happen. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget 2004-05</title>,Questions Without Notice,20,1,answer
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-05-13,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer (Senator Coonan) and the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Patterson) to questions without notice asked by Senators Sherry and Forshaw today relating to the 2004-05 Budget.
Today in the Senate I asked two important questions of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, that related to the announcement in the budget in respect of the changes for the low-income earners co-contribution. My questions went to the government budget document entitled More help for families, which outlines a range of cameos and the alleged benefits that would be received by Australians as a result of the announced changes to the superannuation low-income earners co-contribution scheme.
I asked the Assistant Treasurer why the government claims and all the cameos show that a person who is on a private income of zero, who is earning nothing, who receives no income, or indeed a couple who receive no income would receive an increase of $500 in the superannuation co-contribution. To receive the increased $500 co-contribution, you have to contribute $1,000. I asked the Assistant Treasurer how individuals or couples in these cameos who are shown as having zero private income, as earning nothing, could find $1,000 to put into superannuation to collect the $500 in superannuation co-contribution. I did not get an answer from the Assistant Treasurer.
All these cameos, in respect of the claim made, are wrong. They are wrong and they are deceptive. I submit to the Senate, as I asked Senator Coonan: how can individuals or couples who do not earn any money, who do not receive a private income, then contribute $1,000 into superannuation to receive the increased superannuation co-contribution of $500 per year? Only Senator Coonan and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, could make the incredible claim that people earning nothing, having no private income, could find $1,000 and so collect the increased benefit of $500. This is in all the cameos. All the cameos are wrong and all the cameos are deceptive in this regard.
There is another area that is, again, wrong and, in my view, deceptive. As I have indicated, to receive the government's co-contribution on superannuation you need to contribute up to $1,000. In all the columns on all the cameos, once again, where it is shown that a person will receive the additional $500 superannuation co-contribution, in order to receive $500 you have to have made a contribution of $1,000. What the government does not show, in the disposable income per annum column, is the reduction of $1,000, which is taken out of your disposable income in order for you to receive back $500. What the cameos fail to point out—they are wrong and deceptive—is that the government illustrates a benefit gain of $500 but does not show the $1,000 reduction in your income that must occur in order for you to receive that $500. These cameos are wrong and they are clearly deceptive. What was Senator Coonan's response to my questions? She said it was an imaginative and creative contribution scheme. 
You would certainly have to be imaginative and creative as an Australian on zero income, earning nothing, to be able to find $1,000 to pick up the $500 increase in benefit that the government is claiming is delivered in this document. The cameos are wrong, they should be reissued and they should be corrected. They are deceptive. This issue has been widely reported in the media based on these cameos, and the Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer should apologise and reissue the cameos.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2004-05-13,"—It is somewhat surprising to hear Senator Sherry talking about some incorrect arithmetic and the cameos being wrong. I draw Senator Sherry's attention to the fact that these cameos are prepared by Treasury officers, for whom I have the greatest respect. To suggest that they are all wrong is going a little bit over the top, Senator Sherry. Senator Sherry knows that a lot of his colleagues in the industry superannuation funds are out there at the moment selling this proposal as hard as they can. His friends in the industry know the benefit of this co-contribution for low- to middle-income earners. There is no doubt about it.
To honourable members of the Senate I say: this has to be the best investment in town for low- to middle-income earners. Does Senator Sherry suggest that if they do not have an income they are not in a position to put money into superannuation? I could tell you that mums, dads and relatives are out there lending or giving money to their children and to others to enable them to get this super investment, because it is very significant.
Just because people may not temporarily have an income does not mean that they do not have savings which they can draw upon to put money into this absolutely fantastic scheme. The scheme caught everybody in the industry by surprise because of its generosity. Predicting a change to the superannuation co-contribution, Fitzgerald suggested that it would be extremely generous if, instead of matching the contribution dollar for dollar, as was the case last time, the government dropped it to 50c in the dollar for every dollar that was put in. But no—people got a double whammy. The government lifted the level at which people became eligible so that more people became eligible for this benefit. The second leg of the trifecta was the fact that people got an extra 50c—$1.50—for every dollar they put in. So the cameos are not unrealistic. You can draw from your savings. Your partner or your relatives can contribute for you. It is such a good investment that you cannot afford not to do it.
If you read the newspapers carefully today, you will notice that people such as Ian Silk are promoting the scheme. Where does Ian Silk come from, honourable gentlemen opposite? He comes from the Australian Retirement Fund, one of the biggest industry funds out there, and a very good fund. People such as Ian Silk are out there promoting and selling this benefit as hard as they can. It is a real incentive for low- and middle-income earners to make voluntary savings through the superannuation system. It is costly to government, but the benefits are there. We have to encourage people to contribute early and frequently to superannuation. The cost is $2.1 billion over the next four years. So, to put the record straight, the figures are not wrong; they are realistic and they do provide a generous benefit. I think the problem with Senator Sherry is that he is confounded by the generosity of the offer. Because it is so generous Senator Sherry believes that the figures must be wrong. That is not really logical, but there is no other way to explain why he is so determined to pursue the allegation that the cameos are wrong. 
The maximum co-contribution will be increased from $1,000 to $1,500 to match the $1,000 personal contribution that a person can make. That is the maximum. But if they cannot make that maximum they can put in $100 or $5. It does not sound like much but, if you are a young person and you contribute regularly, over the next 30 to 40 years you will build up a substantial benefit.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2004-05-13,"—I wish to add some remarks to this debate on the motion to take note of the response—or lack of response, really—by Senator Patterson to the question I asked her today in question time about the family tax benefit payments. However, I have to comment on Senator Watson's remarks of a moment ago. He has completely missed the point. The point is that if you are a low-income family and you are not getting—as they will not—any tax cut benefits how do you find the $1,000 in the first place to put into the fund in order to get the extra $1,500 contribution from the government? It might be all right for wealthy parents who can find the money to put into the fund for their kids, but a lot of low-income families in this country cannot access that benefit, as Senator Watson well knows. That is the deception in this budget proposal.
This is also true of the issues I raised with Senator Patterson. Once again, Senator Patterson completely ignored the question. I return to what I asked Senator Patterson. In the government's published budget cameos, it is claimed that a single-income family earning $35,000 a year with two children, one under five, would receive an increase of $43.74 a week from 1 July. The reality is that that figure is grossly inflated. The truth is that they will only get $6.24 a week. The $600 payment that is to be sent to families for the family tax benefit is not going to help in the least all those families who have accrued debts to Centrelink throughout this year and maybe last year for overpayment of family tax benefit—a system that was introduced by this government. They might get the cheque for $600—we are still trying to find out how this system will work.
Senator Bishop, in his question, referred to the fact that many families have debts of $800, $900, $1,000 or more. They have been hit with those debts at the end of the financial year. They have seen their tax returns reduced or in many cases eliminated in order to pay off that debt. If they still have a debt remaining, the $600—effectively an election bribe—will be eaten up in repaying the outstanding debt. I ask senators to recall the length of time it took this government, when Senator Vanstone was the minister, to address the problem it created with overpayments of family tax benefit by bringing in a new system where people had to estimate their income in advance.
It took over 12 months to get the government to appreciate the fact that there were hundreds of thousands of families in this country who were being hit with massive debts—low-income families trying to find the money to pay back debts to Centrelink. The government refused to take any action until they were dragged kicking and screaming to the table to effectively wipe off the debts in the first year. Those debts have continued to accrue in subsequent years. Contrast that slowness to act with the speed with which they want to send this $600 payment out to families now. It is clearly all set up as an election bribe.
It is becoming clear as we expose the inaccuracies in the budget cameos that have been published that people are being misled. As I said, they are being told that they are going to receive increases of up to $43 a week when, if you go through the figures properly, you find that those increases may be as low as $6 a week. That is the real situation and that is the sort of game—the thimble and pea trick—that this government is playing with the lives and the financial viability of low-income families in this country. They are being conned and I do not think they will cop it.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2004-05-13,"—I would like to take up some of the points raised by Senator Forshaw and Senator Sherry. Firstly, in relation to the super co-contribution, I think we have got to come back to the facts. Let us remember that the government is going to be providing a boost to retirement savings of $2.1 billion over four years to enhance this scheme. The government will now be contributing $1.50 for every dollar of voluntary personal contribution to a maximum of $1,500 for those on incomes of up to $28,000. For example, under the expanded super co-contribution, a young person entering the work force who earns $25,000 and makes an additional personal contribution of $1,000 will now receive a maximum government co-contribution of $1,500. Whether we are talking about $5 a week or the change from the weekly shopping, someone on $25,000 a year will receive $1.50 from the government for every dollar they personally contribute up to the $1,500 limit.
Senator Sherry talks a lot about cameos. We did not hear a lot about cameos when Labor promised to introduce their l-a-w law tax cuts, because it is hard to have cameos on things that do not really exist. It is very interesting that Labor are avoiding at all costs talking about tax at the moment. That is because there are only three types of tax cuts that Labor believe in. There are those that are l-a-w, One Nation tax cuts—in other words, those that never get delivered. There are those tax cuts that Labor just oppose outright—the tax cuts we had with the new tax system. How you could oppose them I do not know, but Labor did. We have to remember that, when Labor talk about tax cuts not being generous enough for those on low incomes, Labor opposed tax cuts to directly benefit those people. Whatever tax people on lower incomes are paying today, they would have been paying far more if not for that first round of tax cuts. The third lot of tax cuts are those that Labor reluctantly support—those in this budget and those in the last budget. It is the height of hypocrisy for Labor to talk about tax cuts not being generous when they have failed to deliver their own tax cuts and opposed our new tax system tax cuts.
I want to return to superannuation for a moment. Again, Labor on superannuation is the height of hypocrisy. The government introduced the superannuation surcharge. We are reducing the rate. The only reason the superannuation surcharge was introduced in the first place was that Labor left us a $96 billion deficit. The only reason that measure was introduced was that Labor forced it on the government. It is hypocrisy for Labor to talk about superannuation—and to talk about tax as well.
Labor just do not believe Australians deserve more money in their pockets. They do not like Australians having choice in how they spend that money. Now we hear the great deception: not only are Labor going to support our tax cuts but they are going to deliver bigger tax cuts. Remember when Mr Crean in his first incarnation as shadow Treasurer promised bigger surpluses than the coalition? Now I have heard everything—Labor then supporting bigger surpluses than the coalition and Labor now supporting bigger tax cuts than the coalition? It is a very good trick! 
Senator Forshaw was speaking about family assistance. This budget delivers a $37 billion family package. There is a $600 per year increase in family tax benefit part A for each dependent child and an immediate lump sum payment of $600 before 30 June 2004 for all families receiving or eligible for family tax benefit part A. This is the most significant family benefit package in Australian history. But we did not hear anything today about what Labor's response will be tonight. The Leader of the Opposition in the other place has to say tonight what he is going to do in relation to taxation and how he is going to fund bigger tax cuts.

"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2004-05-13,"—I rise to take note of the questions raised by Senator Sherry of Senator Coonan earlier today. I think Senator Sherry very clearly demonstrated the real error the government has made in suggesting that those with no income could contribute $1,000 to the superannuation scheme. He has exposed the government for the frauds that they are in suggesting that this could be done. Senator Watson wanted to debate that point and talk about those without income. But I think we should talk about those who have income and about those who have the minimum income—those who earn less than $28,000. These are workers in factories, they are shop workers, they work in hotels and in hospitality. They do essential work. They are bus drivers, they are people that our society cannot operate without. But they are low- income earners.
I was absolutely amazed to hear Senator Coonan, as the minister responsible, suggesting that you do not have to put $1,000 in; you can put part of that in. She suggested—and it was echoed by Senator Fifield just a few moments ago—that you can put the change from the shopping in there. People on low incomes do not have change from shopping. If there is anything at all left over then let me assure you it goes on paying rent or on buying a new pair of shoes for the children at school or on some other essential thing to keep the household running.
Low-income earners got absolutely nothing from this `wonderful' budget—as claimed made by the government—handed down earlier this week. These people who are currently paying a reasonably low amount of taxation, I must admit—17 per cent—get nothing at all. Because their financial circumstances have not changed in relation to tax, does that mean that the government suspects or anticipates or is going to do something to ensure that those people on low incomes—the part-time workers and the casual workers—are going to move into full-time work and start earning in excess of $55,000 so that they can get some assistance? Or is the government not going to oppose wage increases for low-income workers so that they can catch up to the rest of society?
This government does not care about those without full-time employment, those who are relying on one income to try to make ends meet, those who cannot aspire to owning their own home, those who cannot aspire to owning their own car and those who cannot aspire to giving their families an annual holiday. This government does not care about those people. They cannot afford to be paying anything extra into superannuation. They are struggling to make ends meet as it is. To make it even worse, a comment made by the Treasurer today was that these low-paid workers, the ones that need help, would be better off if we had different industrial relations laws. So not only are they getting no tax incentives or tax help, not only can they not contribute to superannuation, but now he wants to rip away any protection they have from the industrial relations regime.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2004-05-13,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the documents.
The tabling of these documents relates to the Senate order for the production of documents which detail the government's grubby deal to give import protection and pay a massive subsidy to the Manildra group. That deal was made behind closed doors at a secret meeting between the Prime Minister and the chairman of the Manildra group in August 2002. In October 2002 the Senate sought full details of the government's deal through the production of relevant documents even though, at the time, we did not know about the secret meeting. Despite repeated promises for delivery of the documents to this chamber by the Manager of Government Business, Senator Ian Campbell, the government refused to comply with the order. I then initiated a complex freedom of information process to get access to some—I repeat, some—of the documents that established the truth of the government's dealings. In return, I got a range of documents, many almost completely masked, and a large schedule of documents showing which had been withheld.
One of those documents—the famous meeting minutes—revealed the Prime Minister's meeting with Mr Dick Honan, a meeting the Prime Minister denied three times in the other place as having occurred. It was a meeting at which questions at the heart of the government's subsequently announced Manildra-friendly ethanol policy were discussed. On 1 April, as outlined by Senator Hill in his comments just now, and almost 18 months after the Senate demanded the ethanol documents, a small number of documents were tabled in response to the order. And what were they? According to the unfortunate minister who was required to do the tabling, Senator Ian Macdonald, the documents were the same ones already released to me by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet under FOI 12 months earlier. He announced at that time that documents already released to me by other departments would be tabled at a later time—and I take it that that is what is now being tabled, if I understand Senator Hill's comments correctly and the undertaking given by Senator Ian Macdonald.
Frankly, the government's actions in terms of this return to order, ignoring it and simply tabling documents already released under the limited terms of the Freedom of Information Act, do not constitute compliance with the original Senate return to order. The Senate did take a stand in respect of this matter by previously deferring debate on two ethanol bills until the government complied with the order. Unfortunately, that stand was fatally undermined by yet another deal between the Howard government and none other than the Democrats, this time under Senator Bartlett's leadership. That inadequate compliance resulted in the passage of the bills. Today is the final act in that ethanol return to order, because the Democrats lack the will to join Labor in demanding accountability from this government for its private dealings with its powerful mates behind closed doors. It is an act which we will be reminding both the government and the Democrats about in the future, and I trust that we will not hear too many pious comments about returns to order from Senator Bartlett again.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-05-13,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I wish to take note of the report by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission A last resort? The report of the national inquiry into children in immigration detention which, as senators in the chamber can see, is a very sizeable document. I do not know the number of pages but it is in the hundreds, so I am not going to pretend that I have absorbed its full contents and can elaborate on it at length now. It is appropriate that it be kept on the Notice Paper for speaking to at a later date. But it is also appropriate to acknowledge, firstly, that it is an historic report. It is certainly not the first report from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission into detention, but it is one of the most significant and it is the first one focusing specifically on children. It is the end product of a very extensive investigation over more than two years—getting closer to three years—and I think we should acknowledge the amount of work that has gone into this and congratulate the commission for it.
The report has been with the government for some time. It is unfortunate that it is being tabled at a time when a vast amount of media and public attention is being focused on the budget and on early election speculation. I certainly hope, and the Democrats will do everything we can to ensure, that it does not sink into obscurity and not get the attention it deserves as a result of other activities that are happening.
What I would like to say at this initial stage, before fully absorbing the report, is that even from some of the leaks and such that I have been able to see I have no doubt that the report reflects the basic fact that having children in detention is extremely damaging for their immediate wellbeing and, even more importantly, for their long-term wellbeing. We should not have a policy or a law that enables—in fact, almost requires—the damaging of children and the harming of their development.
I understand this report has involved commission officers going to every detention centre in Australia, interviewing some of the detainees and other people, hearing from departmental staff and from all sorts of people. But I want to emphasise that this report does not include the many children who have been detained on Nauru, because that is outside the jurisdiction of the commission. However, that is still detention that has occurred as a direct consequence of Australian laws and Australian government policy and, of course, it continues to occur.
There are still 70 children detained on Nauru. They have been there for over two years, apart from one or two who have been born there and are obviously younger. I was in Baxter detention centre just a couple of weeks ago and spoke with families and detainees, including the young children. One family that I saw there I had also seen there over a year ago when the wife was pregnant. This time around they had a particularly attractive 10-month-old baby who was walking around. I think all of us would acknowledge that that is far from the ideal situation for children to be brought up in. 
There is a wider debate, obviously, about refugee policy, immigration policy and detention policy that this issue is contained within. I would seek not to broaden out the debate on this report but to focus on the simple fact that, regardless of what people think about the broader policy parameters, this component of it means that children are kept in detention for prolonged periods of time and that does not have a good outcome. In my view, any policy, any law, that has as one component of its functioning such damage being done to children is flawed and we need to change it.
That applies even more so to the children who are on Nauru, because they are outside any form of scrutiny, any form of accountability and any form of judicial oversight. I have met with some of the children who are on Nauru. I have seen the difference in those children between meeting them in the Nauru detention centre, separated from their fathers, in July last year and then meeting those same children living free in New Zealand six months later with the family reunited. The difference was extraordinary. It is fairly self-evident to think about it and to talk about it, but it is extraordinary to actually see those children in person, to see the difference between children in despair, separated from their father for two or three years, not knowing what their future holds, not knowing why they are in this situation. Six months later, living with the family like any other family in the community that is free to choose their own future, one six-year-old girl was just about to go to school, able to play with her friends like anybody else. To actually see that distinction, you can see how much damage is done by doing this to children. I have no doubt that there are specific incidents detailed in the report that the government will have responded to and to which they will have said, `We have done things and acted on these concerns.' That is all positive, but none of it addresses the fundamental problem, the fundamental flaw that is continuing as we speak, which is that children are in detention.
I also had the opportunity, with the cooperation of the minister's office and the department—for which I thank them—to visit the housing project in Port Augusta just a couple of weeks ago which was referred to today in question time by the minister. It is the so-called housing project where women and children are able to live in housing in the Port Augusta community. There is no doubt that it is a more pleasant physical environment for those children to be in. It is rather similar to a suburban street, as the minister said, with the fairly significant distinction that it is surrounded by a fence and nobody is allowed out and nobody is allowed in. So it is a fenced-off suburban street, and that is a very significant distinction.
The other significant distinction is that the fathers and husbands are not allowed to live with the rest of their family. They are kept in the main security detention centre at Baxter. Nobody is allowed to visit—or very few people are allowed to visit—the children in the housing. Appointments have to be made with the Baxter detention centre, and arrangements have to be made for the children to be bussed to Baxter to meet their fathers behind the wire of the detention centre. The fathers are usually allowed to go to the houses about twice a week for around four hours each time. Otherwise, the family have to make an appointment—with about a day's notice, I was told—to go to Baxter detention centre just to interact with the father or husband. So there is still a very significant flaw there, despite the undoubtedly far more pleasant living environment that the children are in—there is that lack of hope for their future, that separation from husband and father, that separation from friends. 
The children are allowed out to go to school. That is great, that is welcomed, but after school they have to come back. They cannot have their friends come back to their house with them and they cannot go to their friend's house after school. They might sound like simple things, but they are very significant things. I think anyone who thinks that that is acceptable and appropriate and says that that is like living in a community is clearly not acknowledging or understanding, firstly, what a simple concept freedom is, but also what an absolutely fundamental and crucial concept freedom is and how damaging it is to deny it to anybody but particularly to children.
That is the fundamental underpinning of this report. It is a very important report. It is obviously a politically contentious issue, but I do hope that all of us here seek to engage with it constructively and attempt to alleviate the core problem that is at the centre of the community concern that generated this report—that is, that children do not belong in detention. Whilst we need to act on individual incidents and individual situations where things are wrong, the fundamental thing we need to do is get them out of detention altogether. I understand others might want to speak to this report but might not be doing so now, so I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-05-13,"—I seek leave to incorporate my response to the budget speech. 
Leave granted. 
The speech read as follows—
For the past five months Mark Latham has been travelling around this great country of ours as Labor Leader, talking to the Australian people about their concerns. Mark says it's been the experience of a lifetime.
Mark Latham has been holding community forums: old-town-hall style meetings, open to all comers.
Thousands have come along to have their say—community leaders, school teachers, small businesspeople, mums, dads and students.
Mark Latham calls these meetings “democracy in the raw”—a chance to listen and learn, a chance to talk to people face-to-face.
It's an important process, because as parliamentarians we need to be honest with ourselves. The Australian people have become disillusioned with the political process.
We have lost their trust and confidence. And we need to regain it.
Listening to people and addressing their concerns. Staying in-touch with the real-life circumstances of the Australian people.
Tonight Mark Latham is bringing those concerns and circumstances to Canberra. This is what the people have been telling him.
On the Central Coast of New South Wales they told him about the need to create new training and employment opportunities for the youth of the district. Plus put them in contact with mentors—role models who can point troubled teenagers in the right direction.
At Gladstone in Central Queensland they told him about the need for more apprenticeships and group training opportunities—workforce skills for the next generation.
In Brisbane, Mark heard about the need for bulk-billing doctors and a national dental program—something positive to help our senior citizens get their teeth fixed up.
In Adelaide, he heard about the problems in the social security system: family debts and disincentives for people who want to move from welfare to work.
In the La Trobe Valley and Gippsland, they told him about the loss of basic services, particularly in higher education and Medicare.
At the community forum in Bairnsdale, one man summarised what Mark had been hearing all over the country. He said that people were coming forward with “cries for help”.
Cries for increased social investment and better services.
Cries for stronger communities and more lasting relationships.
Cries for a fairer society—where by working hard and pulling together, we can give all Australians a fair go.
Australia needs a government that answers this cry for help—a government that invests in its people and builds the services of a civilised society.
After 20 years of economic reform—some of it Labor, some of it Liberal—our wealth and prosperity have grown.
But surely as a nation, we can make better use of our wealth. We can give it a stronger social purpose.
We can use it to restore our services and rebuild our communities. We can answer the cry for help.
This is what the Australian people are saying: it must be prosperity with a purpose.
Surely in a prosperous nation we shouldn't have 370,000 Australians on unemployment benefits for more than 12 months many of them young people, without hope and direction in their lives.
Surely in a prosperous nation we shouldn't be losing bulk-billing doctors and Medicare services—the universality of our health system.
Surely in a country like Australia we shouldn't have children failing ill with serious diseases because their parents can't afford the vaccines.
Surely in a prosperous nation we shouldn't have 500,000 Australians, most of them elderly, waiting to get their teeth fixed.
That's the problem with the current government. It's a waiting list government that's turned us into a waiting list nation. 
It's got the wrong set of priorities. It's wasting our prosperity instead of turning it into opportunity for all Australians.
Just look at Tuesday's budget. It's a political patch-up job, a short term fix for the next election. It doesn't look to the long term, the sort of future we want for our nation a decade from now.
The Government always spends up big before an election. But then it claws the money back in the years that follow-through higher taxes and family debts, higher Telstra line charges and user pays in education and health. It gives and then it takes. It never lasts.
Tonight I want to outline Labor's alternative approach—the policies and priorities we believe are important for our country—the things we didn't hear about in the Budget.
Labor has been listening to the Australian people, absolutely. But not just listening. We have been responding to their concerns with a new plan for the nation, a new program of social investment.
Investing in early childhood development, in our schools, universities and TAFE colleges. Investing in our doctors and dental services. Investing in families and newborn babies.
And not just social investment. Labor believes in investing in the environment, passing on our natural assets and heritage to the next generation. Taking climate change seriously—ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and establishing an emissions trading system. New national policies to save the Murray/Darling, to protect our native forests, our beaches, our coastline.
And when it comes to national security, Labor will never, neglect the homefront. Always, Australia first we'll establish a Department of Homeland Security, upgrade our port and regional airport security and create an Australian Coastguard—maritime policing for our 37,000kms of coastline.
This is the future for our nation: services, conservation, security. Opening up new opportunities—not just now, but for the next 10 years.
When Mark Latham became Leader of the Opposition, he said that he wanted to be positive. He said that he didn't believe in Opposition for Opposition's sake. So let me outline Labor's positive alternative, our plan for Australia's future.
Economic Management
Our starting point is better Budget management. The Howard-Costello Government is the highest taxing government in Australia's history. There is no shortage of funds pouring into Canberra. Our task is to make better use of this money: to cut waste and mismanagement, to reorder priorities.
While the Government has gone on a spending spree, Labor has taken a different approach. For every dollar of extra social investment, we've been making a dollar of budget savings—cutting back on government waste. So far, we have identified more than $8 billion in savings, with more to come.
In this Budget, the Government is spending more than 100 million on taxpayer-funded political advertising—spending for the Liberal Party, not the Australian people.
It also plans to sell Telstra, wasting $650 million on consultants and financial advisers. Under Labor, we'll be saving the taxpayer money. We'll be keeping Telstra where it belongs: in majority public ownership.
A Labor Government will reduce bureaucracy, abolishing seven government agencies and cutting a further 13 government programs. And as we examine this Budget, more cuts will be made.
Not all of these decisions will be popular. Some interest groups will inevitably complain.
But the decisions need to be made. Budgets are about choices. And Labor's choice is to cut bureaucracy and wasteful spending to make way for our investments in education and health.
This is also responsible economic policy. A Labor Government will produce budget surpluses in each year of the next Parliament—cutting net debt and holding down interest rates.
We also believe in limiting the size of government. Too much spending, too much bureaucracy is bad for the Australian economy. This is why we will reduce Commonwealth expenditure and Commonwealth taxation as a proportion of GDP.
This is our Budget Pledge to the Australian people. Social investment, Yes, but also an attack on waste and mismanagement. 
We also want to grow the Australian economy through more assistance for small business—backing their hard work and enterprise.
We need to reduce red-tape and paperwork, starting with the Business Activity Statement. This involves huge compliance costs—small businesspeople filling out forms for the government, instead of spending time with their families or actually running their businesses.
This is why Labor will simplify the Business Activity Statement. Our Simpler BAS Option will allow small businesses to use a Tax Office ratio to calculate their quarterly GST payments, with no annual or quarterly reconciliations.
This method couldn't be simpler, with just one calculation and just two boxes on the BAS form. It is estimated that our policy will reduce compliance costs by 80 to 90 percent.
Labor will also ensure that small businesses are not smothered by the market power of big business. We want a fair trading environment—strengthening the Trade Practices Act and the ACCC to protect small business against anti competitive practices.
Labor will outlaw predatory pricing and introduce gaol terms and divestiture powers to deal with hard-core cartels. The ACCC will be authorised to issue “cease and desist” orders to provide immediate relief against market abuse. It will also be given new powers to deal with creeping acquisitions and the exploitation of franchisees.
The Trade Practices Act is now 30 years old. It urgently needs an overhaul—new powers to protect small business against the anti-competitive conduct of big business. It's time to give the small business sector a fair go in the Australian marketplace.
Ladder of Opportunity
Mark Latham has always believed in governments helping people providing opportunity for all Australians. But he also knows that people should be willing to help themselves—to work hard, to exercise responsibility. There is no way out of poverty and disadvantage without having a go, without effort.
This is what Mark Latham calls the ladder of opportunity the importance of hard work, strong communities and the civilising role of government.
Mark Latham wants all Australians climbing the ladder—getting stuck in and working hard, supported by decent community services. The Howard-Costello Government has been irking the rungs out of the ladder. Mark wants to put them back in.
The first rung is education—investing the skills and ability of the Australian people. Under the current Government, this has been an area of big budget cuts. Under Labor, it will be our most important area of social investment.
Our national reading program will help parents give their infant children the greatest gift of all: reading books aloud, building literacy in the early years.
The parents of each newborn child will receive a series of storybooks. And for parents who lack the skills to read them, Labor will provide new adult literacy services to overcome this problem.
We want to invest early in education. Learning doesn't start the first day of school. It starts the first day of life.
And when our children go to school—with a love of reading and the ability to recognise numbers—their schools must be high-achieving schools.
It doesn't matter whether they are government or non-government schools. That's a tired, old debate. We want quality and opportunity for all our students.
Under Labor's new funding system, all schools will be funded on the basis of need. We will bring every school up to a high national standard of resources and achievement.
The overall funding level for non-government schools will be maintained, but with a different pattern of funding distribution. Under-resourced Catholic, Christian and Independent schools will receive more, at the expense of wealthy schools like Kings and Geelong Grammar.
We will also provide additional funds for government schools—lifting them up to our national standard of resources and results. For the most disadvantaged parts of our society, they have one great hope in life: the neighbourhood government school at the end of their street. It's their passport out of poverty. 
As Prime Minister, Mark Latham won't rest until that hope is fulfilled. Until every school in this country is a good school.
A Labor Government will provide incentives for the best teachers to teach in our struggling schools.
We will also improve school discipline through mentoring, community justice and `time out' programs. Parents have got the right to have their children taught in an orderly school environment. Discipline isn't an optional extra. It's an essential part of a good education.
And at the end of the school years, we don't want any talented child who has worked hard and studied hard to have to pause for a moment to consider whether they can afford a higher education. It goes against the great Australian principle that rewards in life should flow from talent and hard work, not your bank balance.
That's why we'll implement Labor's $2.3 billion Aim Higher policy: 20,000 extra university places and 20,000 extra TAFE places, without the need for slugging students. We'll reverse the Government's 25 per cent HECS hike and abolish its full fee system.
We don't want $100,000 university degrees. We want opportunity for all—a pathway to excellence in education.
Youth Guarantee
But still, not every young Australian will take advantage of these opportunities. We need to reduce the school drop-out rate and tackle the crisis in youth unemployment.
Each year in Australia we waste the skills of 45,000 young people who leave school early and don't go on to full-time work or study. They're at risk of becoming a lost generation—dropping out of the system, dropping out of society.
In some communities, the problem is critical: youth unemployment rates of more than 30 per cent in places like Wollongong, the northern suburbs of Adelaide and Wide Bay in Queensland.
As a society, we cannot afford to waste the potential of so many young Australians. We must give them new opportunities to work and to develop their skills.
But so too, we need to demand from them a new level responsibility—making good use of the education and employment services of government. Working hard and having a go.
Tonight we can announce that a Labor Government will create a Youth Guarantee: young Australians either in employment or education and training.
Under our policy, young people will have just two options: they can be either learning or earning. No third option of sitting around doing nothing.
We'll provide additional work and training opportunities. And young people will be obliged to participate, to do something good for themselves, their families and the community. Learning or earning—no third option.
A Labor Government will abolish TAFE fees for all secondary school students—a financial benefit for these students and their families. This policy will also encourage an extra 15,000 students to stay on and undertake vocational education and training while still at school.
We'll also create 7,500 new apprenticeships. Plus 7,500 TAFE places for 15 to 18 year old students.
For those who want to move into work, we'll create a Jobs Gateway—wage and training subsidies to give 10,000 early school leavers opportunities in the workforce.
And we'll also support 5,000 homeless and disadvantaged youth, with life skills and training opportunities.
So we say to young Australians: if you fall, we will pick you up. We will help you, but we also expect you to help yourself: to respond to our Youth Guarantee, to be hungry for new skills and employment.
The Youth Guarantee is a $700 million investment in solving one of our most pressing social problems the youth problem. It's a long term investment in Australia's future, a chance to give our prosperity a true social purpose.
Our policy involves the employment of 1,100 Training Mentors, working directly with young people at risk of dropping out. The mentors will help with education and employment, but also social skills. 
We should never forget this social dimension in helping young Australians—giving them a sense of belonging and purpose in their lives. We need mentors right across the community—role models who can teach troubled teenagers the difference between right and wrong.
This is why a Labor Government will establish a National Mentoring Foundation, providing training support and other resources for 10,000 new mentors. We will also bring thousands of extra men into our schools—male teachers and community leaders to assist with the development of boys.
Health Care
Another rung on the ladder of opportunity is health care. Medicare must be a universal system, with good public hospitals and bulk-billing doctors available across the country. If it's not universal, it's not Medicare.
The Government talks about a safety net. But you don't need a safety net unless you've turned the health system into a highwire act and families are in danger of failing off.
Labor doesn't believe in a safety net. We believe in Medicare. And we'll never give up on increasing the rate of bulk-billing. We want it at 80 per cent:
	Increasing the patient rebate by $5 for every bulk-billed consultation.
	Providing incentive payments of up to $22,500 for doctors who reach bulk-billing targets;
	And making more doctors and nurses available in regional Australia.
In areas where bulk-billing has collapsed, a Labor Government will provide Medicare Teams—salaried doctors and nurses to deliver bulk-billing through public hospitals and community health services.
There's another responsibility we'll meet in the health system: the provision of dental services. It's not just a moral responsibility it's part of the Australian Constitution. If the current government won't carry out its duty to the Australian people, Labor will.
We'll create a national dental program: a $300 million investment with an extra 1.3 million dental procedures for aged pensioners and health card holders. This will clear away the existing backlog and give our senior citizens what they deserve: the care of a civilised society in getting their teeth fixed up.
The Government says this is a Budget for families, But without a decent health system, what guarantees do we have for the future of our families?
Every year in Australia 1,800 children contract the deadly pneumococcal disease. Today Mark Latham met one of the affected families—the Brooks family from Canberra.
On Anzac Day, their 15-month-old daughter, Bella, was diagnosed with pneumococcal, and began a fortnight-long battle for her life. Fortunately, young Bella is now out of danger and recovering well. But that's not always the case. Every year in Australia 50 babies don't survive this disease.
In an attempt to save lives, the Government's expert advisory group has recommended that a new vaccine against pneumococcal be made available to every baby free of charge. Yet this Government, in all its meanness, has refused.
Why can't it see the compassion and commonsense of this policy—saving the lives of children like Bella Brooks? The vaccine costs $500 and many families simply can't afford it. They're having to make a choice between their limited finances and the health of their children.
Nothing could better illustrate why our health system must never become a two-tiered system. Why Medicare has to be saved. A universal system, not a welfare system.
Nothing could be more important in the creation of a good society than funding this essential vaccine. That's what Labor will do in government, making it available to every Australian child free of charge. Our babies can't afford to wait any longer.
Family Policy
Another rung on the ladder of opportunity is the balance between work and family—spending decent time with our children, nurturing the next generation of young Australians. 
Let me congratulate the Government on introducing a new Baby Care Payment—$3,000 for working and non-working mothers to help ease the financial pressures of a new bub in the home.
Labor announced this policy two months ago, so we're glad to see it in the Budget. And I hope the Government also adopts Labor's policy to spread the payment over at least three months rather than pay it as a lump sum.
It's like the reform of parliamentary superannuation. It doesn't matter where good ideas come from—Labor or Liberal—let's get them done for the benefit of the Australian people.
A Labor Government will take this agenda further. We'll improve the rights of working parents, especially their ability to return to part-time work after having a child.
In government, we'll also overhaul and improve the tax and family assistance measures in this Budget.
When he was first elected, the Prime Minister promised to govern for all of us. In this Budget, he's forgotten about most Australians.
He's forgotten about the hard-workers on less than $52,000 a year the sales reps, the technicians, the shop assistants, the teachers, the office workers (the backbone of the Australian economy)—who expected tax relief in the Budget but got nothing. Not one red cent.
For them, last year's sandwich and milkshake looks like a feast.
Since 1996 the average Australian household is paying an extra $9,000 in Federal taxes. Yet in this Budget four out of every five families and singles have missed out on a tax cut.
They've been forgotten by the Government, but not by Labor. We will implement a bigger program of tax relief. A broader and fairer tax plan for the future.
That's the best way of growing the Australian economy—giving people incentive and reward—for effort. Ensuring that the hard workers—the people who do the overtime, the families with two or three jobs—receive a decent return on their work.
Prior to the next election Labor will be announcing our tax plan for Australia—a broader and fairer plan. Fairer for low income earners. Broader for middle Australia. A tax policy that puts incentive and productivity back into the Australian economy.
This Budget introduces three new taxes that affect business. Labor has a policy for a tax cut: to the superannuation contributions tax. We'll reduce the rate from 15 to 13. We want retirement savings to work for the retirement years, not be eaten up by taxes, fees and charges.
And we don't support the Treasurer's policy of `work till you drop'. Labor will always protect the aged pension and the superannuation system. 
For families, the Government has produced a policy for the next election, not a plan for Australia's future. The new lump sum payment is compensating families for bad government policy—its inability to overcome the family debt crisis.
More than 600,000 Australian families have family benefit debts averaging $900. They are unlikely to ever see the lump sum payment—it'll be eaten up by their existing debt. The Government is spending money without necessarily solving problems. It needs to take a lesson from families themselves.
Raising children is not a temporary job—it takes long term commitment, planning and care. And that's the way governments should approach family policy—don't patch-up for today get it right for the future.
That's what a Labor Government will do. Families need more assistance and we'll provide it in a more effective way:
	Resolving the family debt crisis.
	Providing greater incentive for families in the interaction between the tax and social security systems.
	And paying the assistance when families need it most—not at the end of the year, but fortnightly—as the bills come in, as the children need new clothes, shoes and school books.
Conclusion
Tonight I've outlined the way in which Labor will answer the cries for help we've been hearing across Australia. Cries for social investment and opportunity: health, education and community services. 
Those cries are growing louder every day and this Budget will not silence them. It's not a Budget of opportunity. It's a statement of opportunism.
The Government's had eight years to address these problems and its only response is an election spending spree. It's run out of ideas and it's run out of puff.
We're sensing that the people want to move past this Prime Minister. They are not really interested in his one obsession: his place in the Guinness Book of Records. They want to get on with the future. Not the past, the future.
The Australian people can't afford to wait another three years:
	To restore bulk-billing and save Medicare.
	To establish a dental program and vaccinate our children.
	To make education more affordable and tackle youth unemployment.
As a Parliament, we can't afford to wait another three years to answer the cries for help.
Australia needs a new government. A government that solves problems and believes in opportunity for all.
A government that delivers better services, fully paid for. A government that uses our prosperity for a good social purpose. A government that governs for the people, not the powerful.
That's our goal—to give this country a government every bit as big and warm-hearted as the Australian people themselves.
A government as big and generous as the country we love. That's what we want to achieve through an Australian Labor Government.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,27,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-05-13,"—On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I present the party's formal response to the government's budget for 2004-05. I remind the Senate that every budget is just a range of proposals presented for consideration by the Senate and the parliament. The Senate has the right and indeed the responsibility to do all it can to ensure that the budget is economically responsible, socially fair and environmentally sustainable. 
The Senate has the right and the responsibility to attempt to improve the various budget proposals wherever it can. The history of the Senate, and certainly the history of the Democrats, is full of examples of where significant improvements to original budget proposals have been made and dangerous measures have been prevented. We will be looking at the tax cuts, at the family payments and at the health, education, defence and environment budgets—indeed, every portfolio—and judging each measure on its merits.
Unfortunately, it appears that many in the Senate will be using the excuse of an imminent election to avoid the responsibilities that they were elected to this chamber to perform. We have already seen one major budget measure—the spending of an enormous $19 billion of public money—pushed through both houses of parliament in the space of 24 hours, without any genuine scrutiny. This is the Senate acting irresponsibly and unacceptably. The Democrats do not believe that is what we were elected here to do. 
The Democrats call on the Labor Party not to fall into the small-target trap they made for themselves prior to the last election. It was not just they who were the victims of that; the biggest victims were the Australian people, who have had to live with so many of the bad pieces of legislation that were passed as a consequence of that approach. The Labor Party should at least stand up to the most offensive part of this budget, which is the income tax cut measures, by supporting the Democrats' proposed tax cut amendments. The Australian people are the biggest losers, as is democracy itself, when the Senate dodges its responsibility. 
As our name suggests, the Democrats take democracy very seriously. We will exercise our vote on each budget proposal measure with care, regardless of the Prime Minister's election timetable. We will not be making judgments that will affect 20 million Australians for many years to come or that will have global consequences, just on the basis of whether or not the Prime Minister might call an election in a couple of months. The Democrats will work hard to ensure that government and opposition parties are held accountable for the budget and the decisions they make. We will seek to use the Senate and public processes to expose the truth. The role that the Senate plays is more important than ever, given that we have one of the most dishonest governments in our nation's history. As the Democrats' history and record show, we put in the hard work on a wide range of issues, not just on the one or two that get the headlines. 
I will summarise a few key points from this budget, before I expand on some of its detail. Its central proposal of huge tax cuts only going to those on high incomes is fundamentally unjust and economically irresponsible. The tax cuts must be shared equally, and the Democrats will vote against the tax cuts in the Senate unless they are. Whilst there are many measures in the budget that will provide welcome funds to various areas of need, the tactic of saving up money until just before an election to address these areas rather than at the start of the government's term or when those needs are identified is not only cynical but also irresponsible. It is bad management, it is bad economics and it means that many areas of need are left unaddressed much longer than they should or need be. A key area in which the budget fails massively is that of the environment. The opposition is running the risk of failing massively in doing its job in the Senate. The budget makes it clear that the government has walked away from the major challenge, the important challenge, of welfare reform once and for all. It has once again failed the honesty test.
Before addressing some specific budget proposals, I want to briefly address the economic foundations which underpin this budget as a whole. The Democrats have shown since the last election that we always constructively exercise our balance of power responsibilities while sticking to our principles, and we will continue to do so in responding to this budget. The Democrats unashamedly take some of the credit for the strong economic situation which Australia finds itself in. The Democrats hold the balance of power in the Senate, and we have not succumbed to the temptation of insisting on getting 100 per cent of what we want before we pass measures. We have acted responsibly and effectively, recognising the policies must be paid for and that economic stability, fair and comprehensive revenue flows and effective expenditure on public needs are all essential. The solid financial position of Australia is not simply a result of the handiwork of the Treasurer, Mr Costello; it is also due to the sound and responsible actions and decisions of the Senate.
The Democrats have played an effective, responsible and constructive role in reforms in a range of areas, including industrial relations, tax, the welfare system, the environment and a range of other areas. We have made things fairer by preventing some of the worst initiatives of this conservative government from hurting Australians. We have stopped previous budget proposals that aimed to attack the sick and the disabled, and we have significantly improved other measures. I call on the Senate as a whole to not remove our own power to improve measures in this budget. Treasurer Costello complains about the so-called obstructionism of the Senate damaging the economy yet, whenever he gets good economic results, he claims that it is all his own work. The Senate legitimately claims a share of that credit, as do the Democrats as the balance of power party in the Senate. 
The area of tax cuts is a fundamental component of this budget. I repeat the Democrats' position that we will not support or vote for the budget's income tax cuts as they stand. The Democrats' approach to tax cuts varies significantly from that of all the other parties in this chamber. The Liberals obviously want big tax cuts but only for people earning over $52,000 a year. The Labor Party have quite correctly identified that the tax cuts are unfair and need to be changed, but they will not back up their words with action and they will not, on their statements to date, make any attempt in the Senate to make this happen. The Greens say no-one should get any income tax cuts at all, including low-income earners. Only the Democrats say that all Australians should benefit from income tax relief. We say that tax cuts, if we are going to have them, must be fairly shared amongst all Australians, and we will take action in the Senate to back up our words.
Our tax position is based on a simple question: are the tax cuts in the budget fair? Quite clearly they are not. Not only are they unfair; they are offensive, they are unjust and they will significantly widen inequality in Australia. To give $42 a week to higher income earners but no tax relief at all to the average earner—to those who are genuinely on a middle income—is contemptuous and unacceptable. The egalitarian principle that is at the heart of Australia's essence, and which so many people hold so dear, will be heavily damaged by these tax cuts, which is why the Democrats call so strongly for the Senate to exercise its responsibility and seek to improve them. The Democrats will certainly do that. We will seek to amend the tax cuts so that all taxpayers get the opportunity to share in some of the money being returned to income earners.
The Democrats' proposal, which we flagged before the budget was announced, is to raise the bottom income tax threshold, not the top one. Our proposal would give each taxpayer a $5 a week tax cut in the next financial year, increasing to $10 a week the following year—that is, the same amount for everybody. Tax cuts for lower income earners—tax cuts that I emphasise the Greens do not believe should be supported—are needed to prevent poverty traps and to encourage people off welfare and into work. The Senate's recent inquiry into poverty clearly demonstrated that providing extra money in the pockets of those on the lowest income is an effective way of addressing poverty. To deny those people income tax cuts is irresponsible. Our amendments would cost about the same as the government's proposal, but they are much fairer.
I must also defend the Democrats' position against some of the false claims that the government has already made. In stating the position that I have just outlined, we are not saying that people who earn $50,000 or $60,000 a year are rich. We are not saying that individuals and families who earn this money do not deserve tax cuts; we are simply saying that people who earn less than this also deserve tax cuts and would also benefit from them. The funds should be fairly shared. Let us also not forget that higher income earners also have the benefit of a range of existing measures that have already delivered to many high-income earners significant extra income. Mechanisms such as negative gearing, capital gains tax cuts, salary packaging of company cars, personal trusts not being taxed as companies and the private health insurance rebate, just to name a few, all overwhelmingly benefit higher income earners. These areas should all be addressed, but we should make our revenue base broader and fairer, with additional revenue being used to provide services or to alleviate poverty. 
I remind the Senate that last year the Democrats forced the government to change the superannuation priorities that they announced in last year's budget. We negotiated an additional $455 million, nearly half a billion dollars, for lower and middle-income Australians to encourage them to boost their superannuation savings, while reducing the proposed tax cuts for higher income earners. This doubled the number of working Australians who could access the superannuation co-contribution and laid the foundation for further assistance to those people.
About the only sweetener in the budget for many low- and moderate-income earners with no dependent children is possible access to the superannuation co-contribution scheme. This budget attempts to build on that foundation of superannuation co-contributions for middle- and lower income earners, which the Democrats established, trebling the cost of it by pushing the benefit to a higher level of income and by changing the dollar-for-dollar benefit to a $1.50 for $1 benefit. The Democrats have some sympathy with the view that the superannuation co-contribution should be extended—indeed, we did foreshadow that we wanted to explore this area—however, whether or not the model proposed by the government is the best way to achieve that needs to be tested and examined. We need to look at the likely impact on national savings and whether we are getting the best value for the money. Part of the proposal includes a reduction in the superannuation surcharge. This is another tax cut that will apply only to those earning over $100,000 a year. We will once again seek to use our balance of power in the Senate to ensure that these measures are made more equitable, more responsible and more effective.
The work and family area is one that the Democrats have spent a lot of time on, working on policy proposals and raising it in the community. This government's work and family package is, I am sure, a welcome relief for many families who have been struggling to balance work and family responsibilities, but it still falls short. The measures announced in the budget should have been implemented in the early part of this government's third term. Very early in his third term, the Prime Minister told us that the work and family issue was a barbecue stopper and promised it would be a priority. He has left this priority until possibly the very last days of his term—and, even now, it really looks like those barbecues are going to be stopped for a while yet because there is still much that needs to be done.
The maternity payment to all Australian women is much better than the regressive and ill-targeted baby bonus, but the $3,000 is still selling three-quarters of Australian women short. The government's payment does not replace the lost earnings that occur because of the physical need to take a break from the work force. It is less than half the amount of the Democrats' proposal of 14 weeks paid maternity leave at the minimum wage, which is currently $6,543 before tax. 
Some of the changes to family tax benefits A and B will assist families with incentives to enter the work force and go some way to reducing the effective marginal tax rate, but they do not do enough to eliminate poverty traps. There is no doubt in my mind that a longer term, more sustainable solution can be found, and the Democrats' policies are a good place to start. The work and family package is short term and ignores the mid- and long-term pressures on family. Cash in your pocket now does not compensate for a lack of child-care places, an underfunded Medicare system or increased higher education costs. 
The Treasurer has asked families to go and get procreating and will reward them for doing that but failed to adequately fund child care. Without access to affordable, flexible, quality child care, we will see pressure on parents—in particular mothers—to withdraw from the work force. The government has ignored some of the recommendations of its own child-care experts to increase the child-care benefit to pay for a wage increase to child-care workers and to counteract the 30 per cent increase in child-care fees over the past two years. 
One of the forgotten groups of this budget is sole parents, but there is a measure there for them—unfortunately, it is a negative one. At the same time as the government gives tax cuts to high-income couples, it is to spend an extra $1 million unfairly chasing sole parent `relationship status' reviews. Every time a sole parent changes their address, Centrelink has the power to haul them in for an interview to discuss their circumstances. This is particularly unfair given the difficulty of finding safe, secure low-cost housing—low-cost housing being particularly necessary for many sole parents.
The area of carers is an important one. As Australia ages, a growing number of Australians provide care for family members. Let me say that I believe that, if there is one group in the community that really deserves all it can get in extra assistance, it is carers. However, whilst the $1,000 payment for carers will be welcome, and it might buy the government a vote or two, it will not ease the long-term burden of caring. Many carers will miss out on this payment because only those who are receiving the actual carer payment on 11 May will receive the one-off payment of $1,000. Many age pensioners, disability support pensioners and sole parents provide the same full-time care for elderly partners, elderly parents or children with a disability. They are part of the `silent army' of carers, and they will miss out on any assistance. The Democrats attempted to fix this problem by amending the legislation earlier today. Disgracefully, both the major parties were so desperate to rush through the legislation and ignore any flaws that they did not support our amendment. As a result, this silent army of carers will miss out.
Again, in the area of disability, there is plenty of assistance for other people—people already in the work force and earning high incomes—but nothing to assist disadvantaged Australians in the transition from welfare to work. People with a disability missed out on the $300 lump sum payment in the last pre-election budget, and again they miss out this time around. The government is offering lump sum one-off payments to families, carers and aged care facilities but nothing to the person with a disability.
There are many other sections of the community that were virtually ignored. The Indigenous budget is one key example. The Indigenous budget is the budget of the smiling assassin. It shows the government is just marking time in this absolutely crucial area. It has thrown money around in generous tax cuts and other budget bribes in other areas, but there is no real increase in Indigenous funding. Prior to the budget, the Democrats called for an extra $300 million annual investment in the key area of Indigenous primary health care and preventative programs as a top priority, just to try to bring the health of Indigenous Australians up to par with—or at least closer to—the rest of the population. This, of course, was a costed measure. Instead, we see that the Indigenous health budget has barely increased by $40 million over four years—far short of what is needed. The government could have used a small amount of the surplus to dramatically improve the life chances of Indigenous Australians instead of providing so much assistance to higher income earners. Further funding to address family violence and assistance with Aboriginal home ownership are welcome, but they should have been funded anyway, not at the expense of ATSIC. 
Health and health care costs more broadly remain significant areas of concern for all Australians. This budget does little extra to alleviate those concerns. It does little more than fund existing programs, with the odd handful of responses to pandemics and terrorism. The ongoing $2.5 billion a year drain on the public purse of the grossly inefficient and inequitable private health insurance rebate continues untouched—money which could be far better spent on addressing some of the glaring needs in the community. The government has failed to deliver in a number of key critical areas such as mental health, dental health or long-range health work force planning. There is nothing in this budget to contain the spiralling costs of specialists that have so undermined the fundamentals of Medicare.
The government's aged care package only goes part of the way to addressing the needs of the aged care sector. It does not underpin the long-term structural needs of the sector. The underlying failure of the indexation system for operational grants in aged care has not been addressed. It will not provide sustainability, and so the problems will emerge again, probably around the time of the next electoral cycle.
The one-off payment to aged care residents enables them to meet accreditation. This is welcome but it should and could have been provided earlier. The 1.75 per cent annual increase to providers in line with the review of pricing arrangements is a good response but it is still less than the government's own inflation figures. The conditional adjustment payment will assist with attracting staff but is only one-tenth of what is required. The one-off payments for capital works will help providers in the immediate term but, again, do not provide any long-term sustainable solutions.
In the area of education, the budget has failed to ensure a fair school funding system. It leaves funding for public school students well below the OECD average. It is ironic that a government that has consistently undermined teachers and public education can now find $34.6 million over four years to spend on so-called values and citizenship education in Australian schools. The budget projections of declining public school enrolments over the next four years clearly expose the policy objectives and funding priorities of this government.
In the area of higher education, our universities and students continue to have their needs ignored. There is no relief for students in relation to income support despite them being slugged with HECS increases of up to 25 per cent in many universities, adding even further pressure and disincentive. In addition, we have the abolition of the Educational Textbook Subsidy Scheme that will result in textbook costs increasing by up to 10 per cent from 1 July. The meagre improvement to scholarships announced in the budget does little to ease students' financial burden nor improve income support for the 70 per cent of students who have to work at least two days a week during the semester to survive while they try to fit in studies as well.
This budget does not deliver the increases that are needed to significantly improve our national research and development investment and is likely to see Australia fall even further behind the OECD average. According to the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, the sector requires an additional $405 million a year to adequately support universities' research infrastructure. The Democrats support their calls—and those of others—for increased research infrastructure funding and a proper target of R&D spending of two per cent of GDP by 2010. 
In the areas of defence and security, the Democrats welcome the extra $26 million to extend our presence in East Timor, but it is a pity that our current intransigence in grabbing more than our fair share of the oil and gas in the Timor Sea is costing that impoverished country far more in lost revenue. The Democrats have already expressed our support for extra money for intelligence, although it highlights again the need for a proper investigation into our intelligence services to make sure they are functioning properly so the extra money can be properly spent. Extra money continues—$16 million this time around—to be wasted by misusing our defence forces to try to keep out refugees and asylum seekers. We remain concerned that extra money is going to Defence purchases despite little being done to address the scandalous record of money being wasted in that area. The fact is that Defence are simply very bad shoppers. They put items on lay-by and come back later to find they do not fit. If you sent them to the shop to buy the classic $5 sandwich and milkshake, they would either spend $50 or come back with half a packet of chewing gum—used chewing gum.
In the area of communications the Democrats believe that our democracy depends on the diversity of opinion and questioning of the government and all political parties that public and community broadcasters provide. We were pleased to see there was some additional funding to the ABC to continue their regional and local programming initiative and for program acquisition, but it does not come close to making up for the 30 per cent cut in real terms over the last 15 years. We are also very disappointed that SBS and community broadcasters missed out.
In the budget figures for trade, it was interesting to see confirmation that the much promoted Australia-US free trade agreement will cost Australia at least $1.5 billion in the first few years after the agreement comes into effect. The budget papers clearly spell out that allowing US goods to be imported into Australia duty-free under this agreement will reduce tariff revenue by around $1.5 billion over the next four years. This is part of the high price of a substandard trade deal that compromises critical aspects of Australia's social, cultural and environmental policy and locks us into commitments that will severely limit the sovereignty of future Australian governments. It is worth noting that in all the rush by this government to clear the decks for an election, there is still no sign of legislation that would be needed to implement key parts of the deal. This suggests to me that the government knows that the community is cottoning on to the fact that the benefits the government claims come from the free trade agreement are grossly overstated and often dishonest.
In the agricultural area the Democrats welcome the continued commitment to the Agriculture Advancing Australia suite of programs, which has delivered benefits to farmers. The commitment of $1 billion of drought assistance funding is positive. The commitment of $11 million to implement the recommendations of the Keniry inquiry into the live export trade will make only minor improvements to an industry that continues to be unjustifiable in its enormous cruelty. When our frozen carcass trade is worth about $5 billion more per year than the live export trade, we should not persist in making our animals suffer and continue to waste public money to prop up an unjustifiable trade.
The environmental area, as I have mentioned, is an absolute con in this budget. The government must address the declining environmental conditions and the important rivers and aquifers that ensure the sustainability of this country. This budget fails the sustainability test and, more importantly, the honesty test. The budget papers fudge the figures, and we have already identified and detailed more than $1 billion of broken promises. It has slashed funding from several highly effective programs at important research centres and failed to keep numerous promises on salinity and water quality. 
Undoubtedly, the government's greatest failure is in relation to climate change. It made the grossly dishonest promise to spend almost $1 billion on climate change over the last four years, yet this budget shows that the spend has been less than a third of that amount. It has now scrapped the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program, which was negotiated with the Democrats and has been the government's most successful greenhouse measure. It has replaced that with a collection of voluntary programs that have little chance of achieving significant cuts in emissions.
In summary, there is unfairness and a blinkered focus on the short term in this budget. It is full of misconceptions and deceptions. It is economically irresponsible. This government has lost once and for all any credibility in its claims to be effective economic managers or strong and effective in the areas of defence and security. That is in no small part due to its ongoing dishonesty towards the Australian people and the Senate. I have pointed out just some of the dishonesty and irresponsibility in this budget tonight. The Senate must examine it for more. 
There is a bigger question and it should be asked—were there other choices available to the government? Was there a fairer approach or another way? Of course, there was. There was, and is, considerable public support for more spending on services. Many Australians were prepared to put their hands up for better services instead of tax cuts. We believe that any government's first priority should be to ensure affordable quality standards of health, education and housing for all Australians, as well as an adequate standard of living and a protected and clean environment. Many Australians agreed with us, but instead the government gave priority to tax cuts for higher income earners. I guarantee that the Democrats will scrutinise carefully all budget legislation that comes before the Senate. We will seek to responsibly amend bills to achieve fairness and sustainability. We will do the job that we were elected to do. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,27,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-05-13,"—After nine years in the job the Treasurer, with the budget of 2004-05, has perfected the art of the missed opportunity. After 13 of the richest years in Australia's history, the opportunity to build the nation during these times of prosperity has been squandered. Instead of investing in our common future, money has gone on waging an illegal war, on regressive tax cuts, on buying swinging votes and on divisive public policy—all this whilst presiding over the most dramatic decline in our essential public services.
This budget has been hailed as a budget for families but it is not a family budget, because it fails families in the long term. There is a handout to family tax benefit recipients that many families will not see and there are lump sum payments for new mothers that fall well short of a national paid maternity leave scheme. But there is no action to support the overstressed public services that all of us, and families in particular, rely on. There is no real investment in public health, nothing for public schools, nothing for universities, and nothing new for sustaining our environment. The Treasurer, a man who aspires to be Prime Minister, has failed to show any vision for our common future. 
The Greens have a more optimistic vision and a more responsible plan for the investment of our public tax dollars—a vision of free, high-quality public education; nation building investment in our environment and infrastructure; strengthening Medicare; boosting our overseas aid; and, at home, a fairer and more effective welfare system that guarantees an adequate income for all. These are the kinds of measures that Australians are crying out for in increasing numbers, because these are the kinds of ideas that, unlike election oriented tax cuts, people recognise as offering a concrete path to a better, brighter and healthier future for all Australians.
In the Senate last year the Greens alone rejected the irresponsible tax cuts and we will oppose these tax cuts in favour of much needed investment in high-quality public services. We do this in recognition that budgets should not be about swinging votes but rather must focus on how we build better communities and a stronger, healthier society. Services, not tax cuts—that is what people want. Both Newspoll and the Morgan poll have found that over 70 per cent of Australians are in favour of investment in services over tax cuts. Visiting ANU fellow economist Fred Argy last week warned about the social, economic and environmental consequences of favouring short-term spending in place of investing in infrastructure for the future. An ANU study found that:
A clear majority thinks the standard of health and Medicare has declined over the past two years, and a near majority thinks the same of education. Voters want these services looked after—and this is not the priority they see reflected in government policy.
That is because the Howard government is failing in one of the main responsibilities of government—providing essential public services. This government has shifted the spending on these services from the public sphere, in which all Australians contribute to the cost and share the benefits, to the private sphere, where those with private financial resources buy essential services based on their capacity to pay rather than their need. It is the poor and the vulnerable who are the biggest losers.
The Senate report into poverty released in March revealed the extent of need in Australia, estimating that 3.6 million people—that is almost one in five Australians—live on a weekly income of $400 or less, lower than the federal minimum wage. Some 700,000 children live in a household without a wage-earner, and a million Australians do not make enough from their paid work to live above the poverty line. These are the people who most need government investment in our public services. Their voices are some of the loudest voices calling for services, not tax cuts.
The Australian Council of Social Service identified $4.7 billion of urgent spending needed on health, education, housing and child care. Treasurer Costello says that the government has increased spending on services, including health and education. But the money has gone to private schools, to privatising higher education, to private health insurance and to privatising health services. The $2.4 billion per annum private health insurance rebate adds around seven per cent to health spending, but it does not pay for health services. It pays for insurance.
Higher education spending has fallen as a share of total government spending from 3.9 per cent to 2.5 per cent of the budget. When people call for services rather than tax cuts, public education and public health are top of their lists. This government has failed a generation of young Australians by not investing in their education and the nation's future. Australia lags behind comparable countries on its public investment in preschool care and education, public schools and tertiary institutions. This government has pursued an ideological agenda of pouring money into the private school sector at the expense of public schools. 
In contrast the Greens are committed to building a high quality public education system and, in doing so, turning around the worrying growth trend in private schooling that is dividing our communities. The Greens would scrap the appallingly unfair SES model that funds non-government schools. In doing so we would redirect the $1.5 billion earmarked for the wealthiest private schools over the next four years into priority public schools funding programs. The Greens would freeze the funding of private schools at 2003-04 levels in order to direct those savings into urgently needed catch-up funds for the public sector. Through these and other measures the Greens will continue working to ensure that every child can be guaranteed that an education at the local government school continues to be the best educational, cultural and social experience on offer.
The forgotten one million Australians who are enrolled at TAFE must also be resourced. TAFE has been a world-leading provider of low-fee postsecondary education, and the Greens would build on that record by returning growth funding to TAFE. Rodney Tiffen and Ross Gittins, in their new book How Australia Compares,wrote:
In real terms, the government is spending about half per university student of what it spent in 1975.
A return to free university education is the best way to guarantee that all Australians who are academically qualified to study at university can do so, thereby drawing on the full potential of this nation's talent. The Greens advocate abolishing the HECS system and forgiving all HECS debt, returning Australia to a system of free public tertiary education. This measure would cost just under $2 billion, the same amount of money the Treasurer is spending next year on tax cuts for the rich.
In the area of health, the Howard government has squandered public funds and a critical opportunity to improve our public health system. Instead of strengthening Medicare, the government has moved Australia closer to a situation where the health care you obtain depends on what you can afford to pay. The government refuses to accept that people happily pay for Medicare through their taxes. They pay for a quality public health care system that provides quality care for all Australians when they need it. The Greens have proposed a number of measures to strengthen Medicare. Abolition of the $2.4 billion of public money going into the private health insurance rebate would allow the redirection of funds to public hospitals, to increasing the bulk-billing rebate for GP services, to mental health services, to preventative health care and to Indigenous health care.
The Greens would allocate additional funding to have medically necessary dentistry covered under Medicare. Currently, around half a million low-income earners are waiting for dental treatment through public schemes with waiting periods as long as four years. Millions more Australians who do not qualify for a health care card and do not have private health insurance simply miss out on dental treatment. We could fund these kinds of initiatives if we opted for services not tax cuts.
We are surrounded by the evidence of the damage that we are doing to the Earth—the planet that provides for all our needs, including spiritual nourishment. The Pentagon report on climate change, released earlier this year, should have dispelled any doubts about the threats that we face if we fail to reverse global warming. The Measures of Australia's progress 2004 report, published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics last month, confirmed the extent of the challenge. That report painted a disturbing picture of the deterioration of our natural environment and highlighted the urgent need for us to address major problems. Surface and groundwater is being extracted at unsustainable rates. Almost 3,000 ecosystems are listed as threatened. In the decade to the year 2003 the number of terrestrial bird and mammal species listed as extinct, endangered or vulnerable rose by 40 per cent. There were 248,000 hectares cleared in 2001 alone, and 70 per cent of this was in Queensland. Almost six million hectares of land were at risk from salinity in the year 2000. 
The damage we wreak on the Earth's natural systems has an economic cost. Using our natural resources wisely and protecting our precious places and wildlife is at the heart of the Australian Greens' work. Climate change is one of our biggest priorities. The Greens propose a carbon levy, as many European countries have, as the best way to encourage the switch to sustainable energy. The proceeds would finance energy conservation, renewable energy and measures to protect low-income earners from higher electricity prices. We also propose a $35 billion, 10-year investment plan to build a sustainable future. By using the government bond market to offer green bonds to green Australia's essential infrastructure we can help transform the nation bringing social, environmental and economic benefits. This scheme proposed by the Greens offers a secure investment, guaranteed return and the opportunity to invest in a greener future. Greening Australia's infrastructure is only one essential component of making it sustainable. We also need a mindset change to focus on reducing consumption of energy and materials, eliminating waste and improving the quality of services to meet people's needs.
The decision to de-fund environmentally beneficial research shows that the Howard government has no commitment to the task of addressing global warming. It has allocated $92 million to fossil fuel cooperative research centres for coal, petroleum and geosequestration, compared with $10 million for renewable energy, and it has just rejected an application for a solar CRC whilst approving a CRC for the so-called clean power coming from brown coal. The government's budget also fails to provide enough funding to restore the health of the Murray River by ensuring that the 1,500 gigalitre minimum increase in environmental flows is achieved within a decade. This is an urgent task that the government has failed to address. Eighty-five per cent of Australians want the federal government to intervene to protect Tasmania's old-growth forests and their wildlife. The Greens have an industry transition strategy that would save the forests and create 500 new jobs, but there is zero allocation in this budget towards such a win-win outcome.
In this budget the government continues its abysmal record on assisting the world's poorest people. Under the Howard government, Australia's overseas aid has fallen well short of the UN recommended level of 0.7 per cent of gross national income. This financial year, Australia gave just 0.26 per cent. Lifting Australia's official development assistance to the UN recommended level would cost approximately $5,740 million next financial year. Improving the living conditions and life opportunities for the poorest people on the planet is one of the best investments we can make to secure a safer world. Let us target the causes of terrorism—that is, global inequality, instability and imperial foreign policy—rather than go to war on the symptoms. Every bomb we drop and every war we fight creates the conditions for more terrorism, costing us in lives and money as the cycle of violence continues. We need to withdraw our troops from Iraq and instead put resources into reconstruction and humanitarian aid managed by the Iraqi people and their future government. Appallingly, Australia's civil aid to Iraq has been almost halved, going from a piddling $40 million to $27 million in this year's budget. 
The Howard government is depriving the poorest nation in our region, East Timor, of billions of dollars in royalties from the exploitation of oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea whilst cutting direct aid to the East Timorese. Australia refuses to allow independent arbitration of the sea boundary dispute that sits at the heart of this robbery. East Timor's Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri says the funds that under international law belong to the struggling nation are needed to pay for schools and health care. It is, he says, `literally a matter of life and death'. The Greens support East Timor's internationally recognised claim and call on the Howard government to meet it. Our global responsibilities include providing asylum to refugees. The Greens continue to call for an end to mandatory detention and for savings to be redirected to help asylum seekers live in the community whilst their claims for asylum are being assessed.
The cost of housing has skyrocketed in many cities in recent years, pricing many people out of buying or renting a home. The ACTU has calculated that the average house price rose by 70 per cent in the five years to 2003, compared with average full-time wage rises in the same period of 26 per cent. Housing as an investment is driving up prices. The Productivity Commission has identified negative gearing as a factor in this investment trend. The 50 per cent capital gains tax discount introduced by the Howard government has seen people pour millions of dollars into property but has not delivered affordable housing. The Greens believe that affordable housing is a right and that governments have a responsibility to facilitate it. We want the capital gains tax concession reversed and negative gearing phased out, with funds redirected to public housing—that is, to public housing with energy and water efficiency features that not only benefit the environment but also save on ongoing expenses.
The budget contains nothing to promote employment and training for workers who are unemployed. While the official unemployment rate is 5.7 per cent, the real level of unemployment is at least double and possibly higher than this. The growth in casual employment—that is, in insecure work with low pay and no standard conditions—and the increasing reliance on part-time employees are major causes of poverty. One in four workers is now employed as a casual, whilst the wages of the lowest paid workers fail to provide a decent living. This is in addition to the hundreds of thousands of Australians and their dependants who do not have paid work. The extent of poverty in Australia has risen from 8.2 per cent of the population in 1990 to 8.7 per cent in 2000.
The findings of the Senate report into poverty, released in March, support the Greens' firm view that increasing privilege at the top of the social ladder does not translate to better conditions for those at the bottom. We have now had a decade of consistent economic growth and still between two million and 3½ million of our fellow citizens struggle to provide food, shelter, clothing and health care for themselves and their families. The Greens are seeking a commitment from the Labor Party, if elected to government, to hold a poverty summit to develop a national strategy, as the Senate report recommended, to work towards ensuring that every Australian can live with dignity. 
The government's maternity payment is no substitute for a proper paid maternity leave scheme. It does not ensure women's rights of return to work nor will it cover the minimum 16 weeks off work that is recommended by the World Health Organisation. Unless a scheme ensures a continuing attachment to the work force, Australian women's rights to engage in paid work will continue to be restricted. The ALP has lowered the bar on the issue of national paid maternity leave by proposing a welfare payment not a national paid maternity leave scheme. The Greens have developed a scheme to deliver replacement income to 75 per cent of women for 18 weeks, with a further 34 weeks of unpaid leave, a right to return to work part time and a right to share the leave period with a partner. This scheme can be funded by redirecting the baby bonus, which the government itself has abandoned in this budget. Australia can afford a scheme of this kind and Australian women deserve it. Until the government provides practical assistance of this kind to families it has no credibility in claiming to support families. Unmet demand for child care, high fees and pay levels as low as $12 an hour for child-care workers are major problems the Howard government has failed to address. The drive for private child care will only exacerbate these problems.
The Greens welcome the government's provision of more child-care places in this budget but the measure only meets one-quarter of the unmet demand in this area. The present federal funding regime has led to the growth in the corporate child-care sector, arguably at the expense of quality care. As of June 2000, some 67 per cent of long day care centres across Australia were privately owned and several child-care companies have now listed on the stock exchange. Taxpayers are effectively subsidising the huge profits being made by corporate operators. The measures announced in the budget will do nothing to curb this alarming trend towards the commercialisation of early childhood care. The Greens call on the government to provide funding that prioritises the local government based and community managed child-care sector. This includes a commitment to provide operational and capital grants to establish and develop community- based, not-for-profit centres—a commitment the government abandoned in 1997. Child care is fundamentally about the nurture and education of the youngest members of our society. We do not allow schools to be run for profit, so why child-care centres? A government that was fair dinkum about helping Australian families would invest in public services for families, not in tax cuts.
Taxation policy should be used to redistribute wealth and generate it for the future. Under the Howard government, taxation policy has become less progressive. This means that the greatest burden falls on those least able to pay. The Greens support progressive taxation. As part of this we call for the abolition of the GST. The company tax rate should be returned to the 33 per cent it was at before this government gave corporations a tax break before the last election. The Australian Council of Social Service, ACOSS, has identified tax loopholes worth $8.2 billion a year, which benefit only the very well off, including diverting income to a private company and executive perks such as salary sacrificing for a company car or extra superannuation. These loopholes must be closed and the savings redirected to public services.
The tax cuts the Treasurer announced on Tuesday night will cost the Commonwealth $14 billion over the life of the next parliament. Add to that the tax cuts from 2003, the tax loopholes that have not been closed and the projected surpluses, and a massive $71 billion of public money has been wasted by this government. This pool of money could have achieved a fully funded, free tertiary education system, more teachers and better resourced public schools. Together with the abolition of the private health insurance rebate, it could also have paid for the expansion of Medicare to cover such things as necessary dental care, a boost in bulk-billing rates for GPs and the establishment of new community health centres. It could do all this with money left over. Instead we have public schools that are struggling, university students who are being slugged by higher fees and doctors fees that are rising. The question that the Greens ask is: do we feel richer? The answer is no. 
The public expects the government to provide quality public services. When it chooses to give tax cuts instead of providing these services the public quite rightly feels cheated. When existing services are left to degrade whilst money is poured into rival private schemes, the public feels betrayed. And when governments cry poor with regard to teaching children, saving our rivers or increasing bulk-billing and then spend billions of dollars to illegally invade and occupy another country, the public gets angry. By putting services before tax cuts, the Greens would set Australia in a much better, much fairer policy direction. We will take these progressive policies to the election and ask the Australian people to join us in supporting public services, peace, the nation's environment and a better investment for its future generations.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2004-05-13,"—I rise tonight to commend the benefits that the Newcastle and Hunter regions will receive from the 2004-05 federal budget. This year the Howard government reported another budget surplus. This is as a result of sound economic management policy, which has reduced the $96 billion debt left by the last Labor government. Buoyed by strong economic conditions, Australia is enjoying a quality of life currently unparalleled in any other part of the world. Unemployment is at an all-time low. Regional areas, particularly in my duty area of Newcastle and the Hunter region, are benefiting from these sound economic times. Unemployment in Newcastle and the Hunter region is currently at 6.7 per cent, down from 8.7 per cent last year in Newcastle, according to the latest labour market report. Contrast this with the unemployment levels of 15.5 per cent in Newcastle under Labor in the mid-1990s. The Newcastle and Hunter area will benefit greatly from this budget. 
Among the major winners in the region are the University of Newcastle, which is set to benefit from the $5.3 billion science and innovation package. The University of Newcastle is the ninth-ranking research-intensive university out of Australia's 40 universities and is now well placed to take advantage of the flexibility provided by last year's university reforms. The science and innovation funding through Backing Australia's Ability will benefit the University of Newcastle immensely, as well as give it a chance to enter the prestigious circle of the Group of Eight. Backing Australia's Ability—Building our future through science and innovation is 75 per cent larger than the original $3 billion Backing Australia's Ability plan announced in 2001 which, at that time, was the largest ever increase in funding for science and innovation in Australia. Together, the package consists of a 10-year $8.3 billion funding commitment. 
Backing Australia's Ability targets the three key areas of the innovation system: strengthening Australia's ability to generate ideas and undertake research, including an extra $1.2 billion for the Australian Research Council's national competitive grant; accelerating the commercialisation of ideas through a new $1 billion Commercial Ready Program; and, developing and retaining skills, including $200 million to continue funding an additional 2,000 university places in ICT, maths and science and $38.8 million for a new initiative to boost innovation, science and technology and mathematics teaching. These highlighted figures will benefit the University of Newcastle, as well as all universities in Australia.
The Hunter Medical Research Institute, which is affiliated with the University of Newcastle, will receive an extra $5 million towards the cost of constructing an independent building that will act as a central headquarters for research. This funding will be matched by the state government and extra funding will be provided by the University of Newcastle and also the Hunter Area Health Service. The community will then be required to contribute $3 million to complete the centre. For those people in Newcastle who are listening tonight, I urge you to contribute to this centre so that we can have a world-class medical research centre in Newcastle.
The Hunter Medical Research Institute has approximately 350 researchers who study and develop treatments for a range of illnesses and disease. The outstanding research undertaken by the HMRI has led to many breakthroughs, such as the discovery of placental clocks that determine when a baby is born, and the discovery of a particular compound found in green leafy vegetables which stops cancer cell growth. Research that is undertaken at the HMRI has benefits for everyone in key research areas, including mental health, cardiovascular health, mothers' and babies' health, vaccines and immunity.
An amount of $5 million in funding will ensure that the HMRI can continue their contribution to the communities of Newcastle and the Hunter region, as well as to the wider society. The research and subsequent technology which is brought to market touches the lives of every Australian in some way. I am sure that nobody in the Newcastle area, the Hunter region or surrounding area would take this funding for granted. The saving of lives and the enhancement to the quality of life for so many people is a really big win for the area.
Another big win is the significant changes to the current wine tax arrangements that will provide over $300 million in tax relief to the Australian wine industry over the next four years. This is very good news for the Hunter region, where winemaking is a key industry, supporting economic growth in the area. There will be a rebate of $290,000 per annum from the wine equalisation tax to every wine producer. Up to 90 per cent of wine producers will benefit from this rebate. The effect of this decision is to exempt $1 million of each producer's domestic wholesale wine sales from the WET tax on an annual basis. The new maximum rebate is $290,000 maximum each year, compared with the current maximum rebate of $42,000 under the Australian Government Wine Producer Cellar Door Rebate scheme. 
This budget also spells good news for Defence, and RAAF Base Williamtown stands out as another winner. This is critical for the Hunter Valley as the RAAF not only plays a critical role in the defence of the nation but also provides a mainstay for the Hunter economy through the direct flow--on to employment. For RAAF Williamtown, the budget contains $38 million for new and redeveloped facilities and infrastructure necessary for the introduction into service of the early warning aircraft control system. An amount of $50 million will be provided for the FA18 Hornet fighter aircraft, to equip them with the capability to conduct all-weather precision bombing operations. Announcements in this budget, which will also impact on RAAF Williamtown and its personnel, include the purchase of two more early warning aircraft control systems at a cost of $323 million, an increase in the size of the order of the EWACs from four to six and $357 million to enhance accommodation arrangements for Defence Force personnel. 
In recent years we have seen many developments at the base. They include the opening of new headquarters for No. 2 Squadron, which will oversee the $3.3 billion airborne early warning and control aircraft system, the $149 million redevelopment of the base itself and the $300 million upgrade of the FA18 Hornets, which will largely be undertaken at Williamtown. RAAF Williamtown is one of the major employers in the Hunter region and injects some $170 million into the local economy each year. The base also attracts defence related industries to the area, which again adds investment and local jobs.
Newcastle and the Hunter region have seen some dramatic shifts over the past 15 years. A city which was once a blue-collar steel town is growing into a very diversified economy which has already started to provide solid benefits for citizens, both economically and socially. Changes across the Newcastle skyline are indicative of changes in the city's centre and its local economy. New developments, residential as well as commercial, are material proof that Newcastle is indeed entering a new era. New buildings such as the Newcastle Cruising Yacht Club and hotels such as the Crown Plaza in the city centre are representative of the new economy which is providing jobs and opportunities for Newcastle and Hunter Residents.
—I welcome the interjection from Senator Ian Macdonald, who was instrumental in gaining that yacht facility, a 220-berth marina, for Newcastle, which is helping to drive the local economy.
—It is all to your credit, Senator Tierney.
—Thank you, Senator Macdonald. This year's budget is supportive of many of the initiatives developing in the Hunter economy. It enhances industries that will continue to drive the area towards a prosperous future. I commend this year's budget and the benefits it will bring to the people of Newcastle and the Hunter, as well as to all Australians in the wider community.

(2)	Defence processes are designed to ensure personnel are fit for operations. The objective of the Annual Health Assessment and the five yearly Comprehensive Preventive Health Examination is to confirm continuing good health and fitness for deployment. Australian Defence Force personnel must be Medical Employment Category 1 or 2, have a current Annual Health Assessment or Comprehensive Preventative Health Examination and have been found medically fit for deployment or seagoing service before they are permitted to deploy on operations. Annual Health Assessments or Comprehensive Preventative Health Examinations that fall due during the deployment period are conducted prior to departure. Additionally, personnel undergo another medical check within seven days of deployment to confirm their medical readiness, that is, no recent illness or disability and confirmation of their vaccination status. Members who are Medical Employment Category 3 or 4 are not deployed.
(3)	At present, personal medical documents maintained by Defence do not contain Department of Veterans' Affairs compensation assessments. Under the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Bill, which passed through Parliament on 1 April 2004, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission will provide the relevant Service Chief with a copy of both a serving Australian Defence Force member's claim and the resultant Commission determination on that claim.
