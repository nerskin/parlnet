 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (09:31):  Regarding the amendments proposed on sheet 8565, I seek leave to withdraw amendment (2) and I intend to proceed with amendment (1). This is based on some advice that clarifies that the amendment will address the issue of 14- to 17-year-olds.


Leave granted.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (09:32):  Labor will support the amendment. The government concedes that parental access to My Health Records of people aged 14 to 17 is problematic. They have promised a review of this issue, basically saying, 'Trust us; we'll fix this later.' But, given the government's complete bungling of the opt-out period, Labor doesn't trust that assurance. The amendment moved by the Greens was proposed by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. The GPs say that it's important to move to ensure the trust of young patients, and Labor will support it. But this amendment addresses only one issue in the government's opt-out scheme. 


Today we have seen alarming new reports that a range of health providers will be able to access Australians' most sensitive health information on My Health Record. This could include whether Australians are impotent or have a sexually transmitted disease or an alcohol or drug issue. Labor has been calling for a Privacy Commissioner review of the default access settings for weeks, but the government has stubbornly refused to act, just as they stubbornly refused to act on the opt-out period until yesterday. Now that the government has backflipped on the opt-out period, they should backflip on these concerns and order an urgent Privacy Commissioner review.

"Steele-John, Sen Jordon",AG,2018-11-15,"



Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (09:33):  When you go to the doctor, when you engage with a healthcare professional, and you are a young person, you have a right to privacy. You have a right to know that the things you discuss of a highly personal nature will be kept between the two of you. This trust that exists between patient and practitioner enables many private, sensitive issues to be discussed. The legislation as drafted wholly failed to protect young people in this regard and to enshrine our right to privacy. It would have enabled health records to be shared automatically with parents or guardians, placing young people at significant risk of information, such as that relating to the disclosure of abuse and to the requirement to access sexual health services, mental health services and reproductive health services, being shared. It would have put all of that at risk and enabled it to be shared with a parent or guardian. It was a travesty, and the youth sector rightly came together and demanded that something be done.


I support this amendment wholeheartedly. I am proud to be a member of the movement that has brought it into being here today. We must always ensure that the right of young people to privacy is protected; that, when our information is accessed, our active consent is first sought so that trust can be maintained; and that rights are preserved. Thank you very much.



The CHAIR:  The question is that the amendment as amended by Senator Di Natale, (1) on sheet 8565, be agreed to.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2018-11-15,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (09:37):  Chair, we welcome the fact that the government has followed Labor's lead on these amendments. When Labor initiated the Senate inquiry into the My Health Record, the health minister dismissed it as a stunt. But the inquiry demonstrated the need for these six amendments, and Labor proposed them more than a month ago. The government announced last week that it would back down and make these amendments to its own bill, but, as usual when it comes to My Health Record, the government has bungled these amendments. The government's proposed restrictions only apply to national system employees, a definition that excludes state public sector and local governments. And, despite the government saying that they would ban employers from requesting or requiring My Health Record information, these amendments don't actually do that. So we will be moving further changes to the government's amendments. 


Can I clarify with the government that those amendments that you put with the memorandum of understanding relate to those six government amendments?

 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (09:38):  They do indeed, Senator. I'm sorry, it has been difficult through the process to actually put that. It was in front of me yesterday but we didn't have time. There should be a copy in front of you very shortly. They are indeed; they do relate exactly to the amendments on, I think, sheet 5840.



The CHAIR:  Minister, if I may assist the process: you need to actually move the amendments.




Senator SCULLION:
  I move those amendments. I think they relate—at least yesterday—to sheet 5840.



The CHAIR:  No, I believe, Minister, what you're seeking to do is move amendments (1) to (8) on sheet EH276. We can go to other senators, if you want to seek clarification.




Senator SCULLION:
  Certainly. I've actually been seeking the sheet number.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (09:39):  The government has bungled the opt-out period badly and lost the trust and confidence of the Australian people in My Health Record. This Centre Alliance amendment is an effort to restore that trust and confidence by limiting the use of the record to health purposes. However, Labor accepts that in very limited circumstances access to My Health Records may be needed by law enforcement or other government agencies. Labor is also satisfied that the government's changes, which require a court order for that access to occur, are appropriate protections, so Labor will not be supporting this amendment.



The CHAIR:  The question is that the amendments, as moved by Senator Griff, on sheet 8539 be agreed to.


Question negatived.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2018-11-15,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (09:41):  I've made comments previously on the government's amendments, and I now move our amendments relating to those.



The CHAIR:  Which amendments are these? Senator Bernardi.




Senator Bernardi:
  I was just seeking the call after the amendments had been moved by the government. I wonder whether they'd be in a position to explain what these amendments actually do.



The CHAIR:  Yes, we're just in the process of Senator Polley moving amendments, so I think we might deal with that.




Senator Bernardi:
  I was seeking the call before because the government had moved amendments and I wanted to know, from the minister, what the amendments actually were.



The CHAIR:  Yes, and we'll come back to that. We're just in the process of doing that. I will get Senator Polley to finish what she started, and then we'll see if the government wants to respond to the question you've just asked.




Senator POLLEY:
  I move amendments on sheet 8574, circulated in my name:


(1) Amendment (3), item 1A, omit the definition of national system employer.


(2) Amendment (6), item 16A, subparagraph 70A(1)(a)(iv), omit ""a national system employer"", substitute ""an employer"".


(3) Amendment (6), item 16A, omit subsection 70A(4).


(4) Amendment (6), item 16A, at the end of section 70A, add:

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (09:42):  My question simply was: when the original amendments were moved—



The CHAIR:  Are these the ones on sheet EH276?




Senator BERNARDI:
  That's the point: I don't know, because I don't have it in front of me. I'm interested in asking the minister, who has moved some amendments, for a brief explanation of what the amendments actually do. Then I will ask the same question of Senator Polley—what her amendments actually do to the government's amendments. This is in the interest of clarification, because I don't have the complete information in front of me.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>My Health Records Amendment (Strengthening Privacy) Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2018-11-15,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (09:42):  I thank Senator Bernardi for the invitation to make a contribution on these amendments. There are two amendments. The first is to remove the ability of the system operator—that's actually the Australian Digital Health Agency—to disclose information to law enforcement agencies and other government bodies without a court order or the consumer's express consent. This is actually consistent with the Australian Digital Health Agency's current policy position, which has remained unchanged and has resulted in no My Health Records being disclosed under such circumstances. We did deal, a moment ago, with the Centre Alliance amendment. Whilst it wasn't supported, they intended to delete the new sections 69A and 69B, which deal with very narrow confines under which a court order can be made.


The second element of those amendments is going to require the Australian Digital Health Agency to permanently delete health information it holds for any consumer who has cancelled their My Health Record. This makes it clear that, if a person chooses to cancel at any time, their record will be deleted completely and forever. The new amendments are as follows. Particular concerns have been raised regarding the potential for domestic violence to occur. As a result of that, for example, a parent may be able to access a child's My Health Record and get access to information on where the mum has moved to with the child. The government recognise that this is a serious matter, so we've put in a range of safeguards. There are a series of safeguards already in place in the system. These amendments will apply if a person has parental responsibility or if a person's access to the child is subject to supervision. This isn't intended if the court decides that you have access to 60:40 periods of time. It's only when there are particular supervision circumstances, so they only get access to the child in supervised circumstances. This would be taken into consideration. It also applies if the Australian Digital Health Agency considers that they may pose a risk, so there may be other circumstances where access to this information may pose a risk. This is ensuring that that person can't get access to the child's My Health Record.


The amendments will also provide greater clarity that My Health Records cannot be used for insurance or employment purposes. We've had a lot of discussion about that. This just provides some clarification. It will prohibit an employer from requesting or using health information in an individual's My Health Record, protecting employees and potential employees from any discriminatory use or use of their My Health Record. Information can be obtained from a My Health Record by healthcare providers and individuals. These amendments will also ensure that information derived from the My Health Record system cannot be used for insurance or employment purposes, regardless of where it is being viewed or stored. This will be one of the prohibited uses. This prohibition will apply to any activity for insurance or employment purposes, regardless of whether it is considered to be for the purposes of providing health care. For example, a healthcare provider undertaking a health assessment of an individual for employment purposes, which sometimes happens, would be expressly prohibited from using the individual's My Health Record or from using information that has been derived from that.


Through these amendments we'll also be increasing the maximum penalty levels for breaches of key privacy protections. This was an expressed recommendation of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. The maximum penalty level is just under double: in broad terms, I think for a corporation it is up to $1.5 million and five years imprisonment and for an individual it is $315,000. In any event, we have reflected the recommendations of the Senate inquiry. These penalty levels are now the maximum penalty levels for breaches of key privacy protections. They will be associated with any misuse of a person's health information obtained by unauthorised access to the My Health Record system or taking My Health Record information outside of Australia. Effectively, for example, if you downloaded something, printed a hard copy, took it outside of Australia and sold it outside of Australia, you wouldn't be subject to Australia's laws in that regard, so that prohibition about taking information outside of Australia ensures that you cannot take those My Health Records out of Australia. But if you were in London, for example, and went to a doctor or practitioner, you could still get access to the benefits of your My Health Record.


This will result in much stronger penalties for persons who collect, use or disclose health information if they are not authorised to do so. An individual who knowingly misuses a person's health information contained in their My Health Record will now face up to five years in jail and a maximum penalty of $315,000. Without going into too much detail, secondary use—if you tell someone something and they use it—is exactly the same; there is not a diminished penalty. The penalty remains at the maximum for the secondary person who obtains information from a prohibited act; they are subject to the same penalties. These increases in penalties acknowledge that as the system grows it will contain a larger volume of health information that needs to have the appropriate level of security. We think these safeguards are appropriate. The amendments also make clear that if a person chooses to cancel their My Health Record at any time it will be deleted permanently, including any backups, saved copies or the like.


In May this year the minister released the framework for the secondary use of the My Health system data, and now these amendments, as I indicated earlier, provide a legislative basis to support another tier of the appropriate use of My Health data for research and public health purposes. The amendments also remove the ability of the Australian Digital Health Agency to provide identified or de-identified information to the private health insurers and other types of insurers for research or for public health purposes. For the purposes of clarity: we're removing the ability that currently exists in de-identified form, to ensure that any of the data cannot be provided to insurers for research and public health purposes. They'll also provide that the minister's rule-making power will include the ability to specify requirements that apply to entities handling information for research and public health purposes, and set out processes for seeking to use or deciding to disclose this de-identified information. The amendments will also remove the ability of the Australian Digital Health Agency to delegate its functions and powers to an entity other than the Department of Health and the chief executive, Medicare. Such functions are delegated as appropriate to ensure the effective management of the system.


Finally, the government remains committed to the My Health Record system being government owned and operated. There was some talk about what would happen if we sold it. Are these same processes going to be in place? We are committed to this being government owned and operated as a national health asset, and the legislation clearly and unequivocally reflects this position. As a package, these amendments comprehensively address the concerns that have been raised by the public and in the Senate inquiries, and enhance the safety and privacy protections in the My Health Record system. The My Health record system will provide significant health and economic benefits for all Australians through avoided hospital admissions, fewer adverse drug events, reduced duplication of tests, better coordination of care for people seeing multiple healthcare providers and better informed treatment decisions. We're committed to this system because it is changing health care in Australia for the better, and we're equally committed to the privacy of the individual's health information. These measures strengthen the privacy protections and demonstrate this commitment.


I thank all senators who have made a significant contribution through the Senate inquiry and through this process. I commend the amendments to the house.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (09:53):  To assist Senator Bernardi: from the outset this government has bungled the process. The amendments that have just been moved by the government were in fact ones that we have been pushing hard on. But, even though they have attempted to pick up our concerns, as usual they have continued to bungle the process. The government's proposed restrictions only apply to national system employers, a definition that excludes state public sectors and local governments. Despite the government saying that they would ban employees from requesting or requiring My Health information, these amendments don't actually do that. That's why we have moved in our amendments a further amendment to strengthen the concerns that we have and why I moved that we take sheet 8574, circulated in my name. We do appreciate the fact that the government has finally got on board in supporting our amendments and proposing the ones that they did and that, at the end of the day, they've followed the lead of Labor on this very important initiative.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (09:32):  Labor will support the amendment. The government concedes that parental access to My Health Records of people aged 14 to 17 is problematic. They have promised a review of this issue, basically saying, 'Trust us; we'll fix this later.' But, given the government's complete bungling of the opt-out period, Labor doesn't trust that assurance. The amendment moved by the Greens was proposed by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. The GPs say that it's important to move to ensure the trust of young patients, and Labor will support it. But this amendment addresses only one issue in the government's opt-out scheme. 


Today we have seen alarming new reports that a range of health providers will be able to access Australians' most sensitive health information on My Health Record. This could include whether Australians are impotent or have a sexually transmitted disease or an alcohol or drug issue. Labor has been calling for a Privacy Commissioner review of the default access settings for weeks, but the government has stubbornly refused to act, just as they stubbornly refused to act on the opt-out period until yesterday. Now that the government has backflipped on the opt-out period, they should backflip on these concerns and order an urgent Privacy Commissioner review.

Senator STEELE-JOHN
 (Western Australia) (09:33):  When you go to the doctor, when you engage with a healthcare professional, and you are a young person, you have a right to privacy. You have a right to know that the things you discuss of a highly personal nature will be kept between the two of you. This trust that exists between patient and practitioner enables many private, sensitive issues to be discussed. The legislation as drafted wholly failed to protect young people in this regard and to enshrine our right to privacy. It would have enabled health records to be shared automatically with parents or guardians, placing young people at significant risk of information, such as that relating to the disclosure of abuse and to the requirement to access sexual health services, mental health services and reproductive health services, being shared. It would have put all of that at risk and enabled it to be shared with a parent or guardian. It was a travesty, and the youth sector rightly came together and demanded that something be done.


I support this amendment wholeheartedly. I am proud to be a member of the movement that has brought it into being here today. We must always ensure that the right of young people to privacy is protected; that, when our information is accessed, our active consent is first sought so that trust can be maintained; and that rights are preserved. Thank you very much.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (09:37):  Chair, we welcome the fact that the government has followed Labor's lead on these amendments. When Labor initiated the Senate inquiry into the My Health Record, the health minister dismissed it as a stunt. But the inquiry demonstrated the need for these six amendments, and Labor proposed them more than a month ago. The government announced last week that it would back down and make these amendments to its own bill, but, as usual when it comes to My Health Record, the government has bungled these amendments. The government's proposed restrictions only apply to national system employees, a definition that excludes state public sector and local governments. And, despite the government saying that they would ban employers from requesting or requiring My Health Record information, these amendments don't actually do that. So we will be moving further changes to the government's amendments. 


Can I clarify with the government that those amendments that you put with the memorandum of understanding relate to those six government amendments?

 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (09:38):  They do indeed, Senator. I'm sorry, it has been difficult through the process to actually put that. It was in front of me yesterday but we didn't have time. There should be a copy in front of you very shortly. They are indeed; they do relate exactly to the amendments on, I think, sheet 5840.



The CHAIR:  Minister, if I may assist the process: you need to actually move the amendments.




Senator SCULLION:
  I move those amendments. I think they relate—at least yesterday—to sheet 5840.



The CHAIR:  No, I believe, Minister, what you're seeking to do is move amendments (1) to (8) on sheet EH276. We can go to other senators, if you want to seek clarification.




Senator SCULLION:
  Certainly. I've actually been seeking the sheet number.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (09:39):  The government has bungled the opt-out period badly and lost the trust and confidence of the Australian people in My Health Record. This Centre Alliance amendment is an effort to restore that trust and confidence by limiting the use of the record to health purposes. However, Labor accepts that in very limited circumstances access to My Health Records may be needed by law enforcement or other government agencies. Labor is also satisfied that the government's changes, which require a court order for that access to occur, are appropriate protections, so Labor will not be supporting this amendment.



The CHAIR:  The question is that the amendments, as moved by Senator Griff, on sheet 8539 be agreed to.


Question negatived.

Functions of data custodian



   (2) The data custodian has the following functions, and the rules may make provision in relation to the performance of those functions:


   (a) under the direction of the Data Governance Board and in accordance with this Act—helping to implement the prescribed framework by:


      (i) receiving de‑identified data and health information from the My Health Record system; and


      (ii) as necessary—de‑identifying health information; and


      (iii) as necessary—providing data linkage services (within the meaning of the rules); and


      (iv) preparing and providing de‑identified data and health information to users of data and information whose use has been approved by the Data Governance Board; and


      (v) ensuring that users of de‑identified data and health information are subject to conditions of use;


(b) any other functions conferred on the data custodian by this Act or the rules.




Limits on rules



   (3) The rules:


   (a) must not allow the health information of a healthcare recipient to be collected, used or disclosed otherwise than with the consent of the healthcare recipient; and


   (b) must not allow de‑identified data or health information to be provided to a private health insurer (within the meaning of the Private Health Insurance Act 2007) or any other insurer (with or without the consent of the healthcare recipient); and


(c) must not provide that any of the following is enforceable for the purposes of paragraph 77A(1)(c) or subsection 78(2):


      (i) a provision of a policy, guideline or other instrument made under the rules;


      (ii) a provision of the rules that requires an entity to comply with such a policy, guideline or instrument.




Constitutional limits on rules



   (4) If the rules make provision for the disclosure of de‑identified data or health information obtained by using or gaining access to the My Health Record system, the rules must have the effect that the data or information is to be disclosed only:

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (09:41):  I've made comments previously on the government's amendments, and I now move our amendments relating to those.



The CHAIR:  Which amendments are these? Senator Bernardi.




Senator Bernardi:
  I was just seeking the call after the amendments had been moved by the government. I wonder whether they'd be in a position to explain what these amendments actually do.



The CHAIR:  Yes, we're just in the process of Senator Polley moving amendments, so I think we might deal with that.




Senator Bernardi:
  I was seeking the call before because the government had moved amendments and I wanted to know, from the minister, what the amendments actually were.



The CHAIR:  Yes, and we'll come back to that. We're just in the process of doing that. I will get Senator Polley to finish what she started, and then we'll see if the government wants to respond to the question you've just asked.




Senator POLLEY:
  I move amendments on sheet 8574, circulated in my name:


(1) Amendment (3), item 1A, omit the definition of national system employer.


(2) Amendment (6), item 16A, subparagraph 70A(1)(a)(iv), omit ""a national system employer"", substitute ""an employer"".


(3) Amendment (6), item 16A, omit subsection 70A(4).


(4) Amendment (6), item 16A, at the end of section 70A, add:


   (6) For the purposes of this section, using information for a purpose includes requesting or requiring the information for that purpose.


(5) Amendment (6), item 16B, before section 71A, insert:




71AA


Definitions



      In this Division:




   My Health Record of a healthcare recipient includes a My Health Record of the healthcare recipient that has been cancelled or suspended.



   use information for a purpose includes request or require the information for that purpose.



The CHAIR:  Senator Bernardi, would you like to put your question now?

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2018-11-15,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (09:42):  My question simply was: when the original amendments were moved—



The CHAIR:  Are these the ones on sheet EH276?




Senator BERNARDI:
  That's the point: I don't know, because I don't have it in front of me. I'm interested in asking the minister, who has moved some amendments, for a brief explanation of what the amendments actually do. Then I will ask the same question of Senator Polley—what her amendments actually do to the government's amendments. This is in the interest of clarification, because I don't have the complete information in front of me.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,2,speech
"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2018-11-15,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (09:42):  I thank Senator Bernardi for the invitation to make a contribution on these amendments. There are two amendments. The first is to remove the ability of the system operator—that's actually the Australian Digital Health Agency—to disclose information to law enforcement agencies and other government bodies without a court order or the consumer's express consent. This is actually consistent with the Australian Digital Health Agency's current policy position, which has remained unchanged and has resulted in no My Health Records being disclosed under such circumstances. We did deal, a moment ago, with the Centre Alliance amendment. Whilst it wasn't supported, they intended to delete the new sections 69A and 69B, which deal with very narrow confines under which a court order can be made.


The second element of those amendments is going to require the Australian Digital Health Agency to permanently delete health information it holds for any consumer who has cancelled their My Health Record. This makes it clear that, if a person chooses to cancel at any time, their record will be deleted completely and forever. The new amendments are as follows. Particular concerns have been raised regarding the potential for domestic violence to occur. As a result of that, for example, a parent may be able to access a child's My Health Record and get access to information on where the mum has moved to with the child. The government recognise that this is a serious matter, so we've put in a range of safeguards. There are a series of safeguards already in place in the system. These amendments will apply if a person has parental responsibility or if a person's access to the child is subject to supervision. This isn't intended if the court decides that you have access to 60:40 periods of time. It's only when there are particular supervision circumstances, so they only get access to the child in supervised circumstances. This would be taken into consideration. It also applies if the Australian Digital Health Agency considers that they may pose a risk, so there may be other circumstances where access to this information may pose a risk. This is ensuring that that person can't get access to the child's My Health Record.


The amendments will also provide greater clarity that My Health Records cannot be used for insurance or employment purposes. We've had a lot of discussion about that. This just provides some clarification. It will prohibit an employer from requesting or using health information in an individual's My Health Record, protecting employees and potential employees from any discriminatory use or use of their My Health Record. Information can be obtained from a My Health Record by healthcare providers and individuals. These amendments will also ensure that information derived from the My Health Record system cannot be used for insurance or employment purposes, regardless of where it is being viewed or stored. This will be one of the prohibited uses. This prohibition will apply to any activity for insurance or employment purposes, regardless of whether it is considered to be for the purposes of providing health care. For example, a healthcare provider undertaking a health assessment of an individual for employment purposes, which sometimes happens, would be expressly prohibited from using the individual's My Health Record or from using information that has been derived from that.


Through these amendments we'll also be increasing the maximum penalty levels for breaches of key privacy protections. This was an expressed recommendation of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. The maximum penalty level is just under double: in broad terms, I think for a corporation it is up to $1.5 million and five years imprisonment and for an individual it is $315,000. In any event, we have reflected the recommendations of the Senate inquiry. These penalty levels are now the maximum penalty levels for breaches of key privacy protections. They will be associated with any misuse of a person's health information obtained by unauthorised access to the My Health Record system or taking My Health Record information outside of Australia. Effectively, for example, if you downloaded something, printed a hard copy, took it outside of Australia and sold it outside of Australia, you wouldn't be subject to Australia's laws in that regard, so that prohibition about taking information outside of Australia ensures that you cannot take those My Health Records out of Australia. But if you were in London, for example, and went to a doctor or practitioner, you could still get access to the benefits of your My Health Record.


This will result in much stronger penalties for persons who collect, use or disclose health information if they are not authorised to do so. An individual who knowingly misuses a person's health information contained in their My Health Record will now face up to five years in jail and a maximum penalty of $315,000. Without going into too much detail, secondary use—if you tell someone something and they use it—is exactly the same; there is not a diminished penalty. The penalty remains at the maximum for the secondary person who obtains information from a prohibited act; they are subject to the same penalties. These increases in penalties acknowledge that as the system grows it will contain a larger volume of health information that needs to have the appropriate level of security. We think these safeguards are appropriate. The amendments also make clear that if a person chooses to cancel their My Health Record at any time it will be deleted permanently, including any backups, saved copies or the like.


In May this year the minister released the framework for the secondary use of the My Health system data, and now these amendments, as I indicated earlier, provide a legislative basis to support another tier of the appropriate use of My Health data for research and public health purposes. The amendments also remove the ability of the Australian Digital Health Agency to provide identified or de-identified information to the private health insurers and other types of insurers for research or for public health purposes. For the purposes of clarity: we're removing the ability that currently exists in de-identified form, to ensure that any of the data cannot be provided to insurers for research and public health purposes. They'll also provide that the minister's rule-making power will include the ability to specify requirements that apply to entities handling information for research and public health purposes, and set out processes for seeking to use or deciding to disclose this de-identified information. The amendments will also remove the ability of the Australian Digital Health Agency to delegate its functions and powers to an entity other than the Department of Health and the chief executive, Medicare. Such functions are delegated as appropriate to ensure the effective management of the system.


Finally, the government remains committed to the My Health Record system being government owned and operated. There was some talk about what would happen if we sold it. Are these same processes going to be in place? We are committed to this being government owned and operated as a national health asset, and the legislation clearly and unequivocally reflects this position. As a package, these amendments comprehensively address the concerns that have been raised by the public and in the Senate inquiries, and enhance the safety and privacy protections in the My Health Record system. The My Health record system will provide significant health and economic benefits for all Australians through avoided hospital admissions, fewer adverse drug events, reduced duplication of tests, better coordination of care for people seeing multiple healthcare providers and better informed treatment decisions. We're committed to this system because it is changing health care in Australia for the better, and we're equally committed to the privacy of the individual's health information. These measures strengthen the privacy protections and demonstrate this commitment.


I thank all senators who have made a significant contribution through the Senate inquiry and through this process. I commend the amendments to the house.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (09:53):  I understand Senator Polley has some amendments, and I would be interested in a brief explanation of how they alter this. Minister, if I could have your attention for a second, could the government indicate whether they are generally supportive of Senator Polley's amendments to your amendments?

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (09:53):  To assist Senator Bernardi: from the outset this government has bungled the process. The amendments that have just been moved by the government were in fact ones that we have been pushing hard on. But, even though they have attempted to pick up our concerns, as usual they have continued to bungle the process. The government's proposed restrictions only apply to national system employers, a definition that excludes state public sectors and local governments. Despite the government saying that they would ban employees from requesting or requiring My Health information, these amendments don't actually do that. That's why we have moved in our amendments a further amendment to strengthen the concerns that we have and why I moved that we take sheet 8574, circulated in my name. We do appreciate the fact that the government has finally got on board in supporting our amendments and proposing the ones that they did and that, at the end of the day, they've followed the lead of Labor on this very important initiative.

The speech read as follows—



This Bill amends the Australian Research Council Act 2001 (ARC Act). The intent of the Bill is to remove Ministerial discretion from approving or rejecting research grants recommended and administered by the Australian Research Council (ARC). The ARC is established as an independent Commonwealth body under the ARC Act. 


Currently, the Act gives the Minister the power approve or reject research grants that have been recommended by the ARC, including powers relating to the approval of expenditure on research programs, primarily sections 51–53 of the ARC Act (in Division 1 of Part 7). This Bill amends various provisions in the Act to remove the Minister's discretion to approve or reject a research proposal recommended by the ARC by providing that the Minister must approve a research proposal and the associated expenditure recommended by the ARC. 


It is not remotely novel to suggest that academic research grant funding in Australia should be completely independent of the Government of the day. That is why today, I am introducing a Greens bill to amend the ARC Act to remove political interference from research.


This would mean that research projects, recommended by experts at the Australian Research Council, after a thorough vetting and peer review by the ARC, will be free from political and ideological interference. 


No Minister should be able to dictate which research projects get funded and which ones don't. The true test of academic freedom is that it must be free from political interference, no matter who is in Government. It should be based only on an independent rigorous assessment process.


We know that this isn't currently true. It has been recently revealed that under this Government, former Education Minister, Senator Birmingham, vetoed eleven grants worth $4.2 million. 


The reality is that it is entirely possible under the current system for the Minister to reject a research grant, which has been approved by the ARC, on almost any ground including disagreement with the subject matter or even the political leanings of the researcher. It is not hard to imagine that if we continue down this road, any number of research areas could be vetoed. If the Minister is a climate denier, defund all climate work. If the Minister is a coal hugger, defund all renewables work. If the Minister hates non-Western culture, bam there it goes. 


We need to trust the research process. I was an academic for many years; I know getting an ARC grant is no easy thing. In 2017, the ARC approved only 18% of discovery grant applications and 17% of Discovery Early Career Researcher Awards. In 2018, only 20% of Future Fellowships applications were awarded. 


Academics have a right to be supported in developing and maintaining their pursuit of research with freedom and trusting the centuries old tried and tested process. Funding should not be tied to ideological leanings of Ministers. 


This approach is not without precedent, there are other similar bodies which have grant-making responsibilities but operate without Ministerial involvement in funding approval decisions. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) reports to the Health Minister, who does not have any formal role in the grant approval process.


There's no need for a Minister to be involved in which research projects get approved and funded. It may assist the Senate to be reminded of the rigour with which applications for funding through ARC are assessed. 


To begin with, the Grant Guidelines are developed in consultation with the research community in Eligible Organisations. Every Application is checked by the ARC against the eligibility criteria set out in the relevant scheme Grant Guidelines. This is done initially by General Assessors, who are distinguished academic researchers drawn from the ARC College of Experts. Detailed Assessors who are experts in the subject matter, drawn from the ARC Assessor Community, then review the project. The applications are then ranked and brought to a Selection Advisory Committee who make a recommendation to the Minister. 


This is a highly organised and strategic process based on the age old process of peer review. The Minister simply isn't qualified to make these decisions. It doesn't even seem like the then Minister for Education Senator Birmingham bothered to find out more about any of the projects or contact the researchers before striking his red pen through it. 


We as a country are poorer when political interference tampers with academic research. 


For individual researchers it devalues their work and their time. Brett Hutchins, Professor of Media and Communications Studies at Monash University and Libby Lester, Professor of Journalism, Media and Communications at University of Tasmania had their research on environmentalism knocked back by the Minister for no reason. They said ""We can live with rejection – it is a professional by-product of producing research. However, the rules through which funding decisions are reached should be transparent and the reasons for rejection should be communicated clearly to researchers and their universities. Neither has occurred on this occasion"".


Academic Mark Stevens was another academic who had his research vetoed. After political interference from Minister Birmingham to veto his successful grant, he was forced to move overseas and now lectures at the University of Essex in the United Kingdom. He said that the veto had ""very real, human effects"" and his family had been put through hardship by having to move overseas to find work. ""Securing that grant would have been a way of staying in Australia, where [my wife and I] were born, raised, educated, and where we worked"".


For the research community it undermines confidence and job security. The universities themselves have come out strongly against political interference. Universities Australia chief executive Catriona Jackson said ""You don't expect the federal sports minister to choose Australia's Olympic team. Our world-leading researchers depend on an impartial system that funds research on the basis of merit – this is why we rely on the competitive peer-review system to fund the highest quality applications.""


This is just one of a litany of attacks on universities by the Liberal-National Government. The contempt for higher education from this Government is really troubling. The funding cut of $2.2 billion, effectively reintroduced a cap on a sector still reeling from billions cut from their budgets under the Gillard Labor Government. We have attacks on freedom of protest at universities by the Government and we have this ridiculous proposal for a national interest test for research grants.


And just when you think the Morrison Government is beginning to end its war on universities and students by lifting the cap on places at regional universities, we find out they are robbing Peter to pay Paul by cutting research grants to fund this.


There is no end to their attack on higher education. 


The Government and the opposition response has been weak. Merely publishing the reasons for the veto is not good enough. It is already too late. There is no justification for the veto and it has to go. No Minister, no matter which party they are from, should be able to undermine the rigorous approval process of academic research grants.


I commend the Bill to the Senate.

 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (12:45):  The Aviation Transport Security Amendment Bill 2018 responds to expert advice that concluded that when it comes to small airports, the level of red tape involved in the transport security process is excessive when weighed against the security threats they face. Accordingly, the legislation proposes the creation of a model TSP for small industry participants. The model TSP would ensure operators were aware of their responsibilities under the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004. It would allow operators of airports that are assessed as low risk to focus on implementing and maintaining the robust security measures in their plan rather than focus on red tape and reports for the Commonwealth. This is an approach that reflects informed risk management. It has broad support across the aviation sector and has been positively examined by a Senate committee.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (12:52):  Labor will be supporting the Treasury Laws Amendment (Black Economy Taskforce Measures No. 2) Bill 2018 and the Excise Tariff Amendment (Collecting Tobacco Duties at Manufacture) Bill 2018. These two bills implement three measures announced in the 2018-19 budget under the banner 'black economy package'. The measures add $4.2 billion to revenue over the forward estimates.


Schedule 1 to the black economy bill denies an income tax deduction for certain payments if the associated withholding obligations have not been complied with. Withholding payments such as pay-as-you-go earnings can currently be claimed as a deduction, even if the required withholding obligation hasn't been met. The government argues that this will provide a greater incentive for employers and entities engaging contractors to comply with their withholding obligations. This measure has an unquantifiable gain to revenue. This implements a recommendation of the Black Economy Taskforce's final report.


Schedule 2 to the bill requires entities providing road freight, IT or security, investigation or surveillance services that have an ABN to report to the ATO information about transactions that involve engaging other entities to undertake those services for them. This is an expansion of the taxable payment reporting system introduced by the former Labor government for the construction sector. It has already been expanded by the government to courier and cleaning services, with Labor's support. The measure increases revenue by $605.8 million over the forward estimates. The measure was a recommendation of the Black Economy Taskforce's final report.


The bills also amend the excise acts to establish a framework to make excise duty on tobacco due and payable at the time of manufacture. Presently, excise on tobacco goods is generally due and payable upon entry into Australia for consumption at the rate of excise applying at that time. The change in timing is to reduce the importation of illicit tobacco. The measure had a net gain in revenue of $3.6 billion over the forward estimates.


While we support the bill, it would be remiss of me not to note how a desperate government has thrown fiscal responsibility out the window, and at best now relies on accounting tricks to deliver its projected surplus. The sneakiest thing of all in the most recent budget is taxing tobacco 12 weeks earlier upon entry into Australia rather than, at present, when it leaves the warehouse. That will boost tax receipts once and once only in 2019-20 by $3.27 billion. As many commentators note, the Prime Minister, the former Treasurer who delivered this budget, is a former advertising executive and, like many advertisements, the projected budget surplus relied on a gimmick. Without that timing trick, the return to surplus would be pushed back a year to 2020-21. Nonetheless, I reiterate that Labor will support these bills.

  I haven't even finished my answer! I haven't even finished my sentence! My advice is that no such suggestion has been made by Minister Ciobo either. I'm not in the habit of responding to unsourced allegations in the media. The government's position on looking into the merits of moving the embassy to West Jerusalem are clear and, the process has been set out by the Prime Minister very clearly as well.

"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2018-11-15,"



Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (15:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the explanation.


On Tuesday, I gave notice and asked the Minister for Indigenous Affairs for advice provided by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to him regarding the grants to the NT Cattlemen's Association, the Amateur Fishermen's Association of the NT and the NT Seafood Council that were referred to during estimates on Friday, 26 October. I also asked for copies of grant applications by the NTCA, AFANT and NTSC for funding from the Indigenous Advancement Strategy and any correspondence or other information, including briefs and meeting and file notes from or to the Indigenous affairs minister about these grants. This morning I did receive from the minister some of those documents. I received the briefs provided to the minister by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet concerning the applications, and I thank him for that. However, I have not received the grant applications from the three organisations under the IAS, because apparently they are commercial-in-confidence documents. I await production of these documents by, as the minister has said, 21 November.


The limited documents I have received do show some interesting facts about the whole process of how these grants to non-Indigenous peak bodies were made. Let's take a moment just to go over the facts. In April this year, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs stood up at the Amateur Fishermen's Association of the NT annual general meeting and said he was giving them $100,000 to help them run detriment cases in land claims. The papers provided to me today show that he did not sign off on an IAS grant to AFANT until 21 May, and the grant was for $155,000. According to departmental advice, it was a non-competitive direct approach to AFANT, which was recommended because:


There is a clear need for the stakeholder group to be better informed on Aboriginal issues in the NT …


It goes on to say:


This has been demonstrated by recent NT media on NT land claims which has attracted negative, uninformed comment from members of the recreational fishing community.


I'm wondering why the minister was able to make a promise to AFANT at its AGM in April about a $100,000 grant when at that stage he didn't know where the money was coming from. The AFANT money hadn't even started going through the grants process at that stage.


I also note that nowhere on any of the departmental advice to the three organisations does it mention the funding being used to meet legal costs in running detriment arguments in land claims. It talks about the stakeholder groups needing to be better informed about Indigenous people, how they should be better educated about land rights and native title, and how this funding will help their members to learn more about Indigenous people. In Senate estimates on 26 October, when I asked you, Minister, about the nearly half a million dollars granted under the IAS to the peak bodies, you said the funding was for 'just the legal fees, effectively'. I'm wondering why none of this advice from the department to you, Minister, about these IAS grants refers anywhere to the provision of fees for legal advice.


The minister said that he granted $1.4 million to a non-Indigenous company, North Australian Rural Management Consultants, for accountancy services, because they happen to have some Indigenous organisations as clients. I find this is an extraordinary use of funds that are meant to improve Indigenous communities and Indigenous lives. I would like to make clear, as I wrote to all the peak bodies on 2 November, that I understand and support their efforts to resolve some of these outstanding land claims. Further, I fully support the rights of these organisations to pursue legal assistance for the associated costs of putting forward their arguments in land claim hearings. However, it is my view that using IAS funding that is meant to support Indigenous participation and culture and strengthen Indigenous organisations for this purpose is an inappropriate use of these funds. I am advised that there are alternative and more usual funding streams and access to support for legal representation in land claims through the Attorney-General.


I will continue to ask why the minister did not follow this process. I will certainly continue to seek information and ask questions about the process that the Minister for Indigenous Affairs and the coalition government have followed with the allocation of IAS grants, and I will continue to ask the minister why grants from the Indigenous Advancement Strategy are provided to non-Indigenous companies that are run by his political mates.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2018-11-15,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:11):  I thank the senator for clarifying that we hadn't actually got the documents in time. We have clarified with the senator that we have provided those documents. There are three documents, which are the funding applications. Until we can ascertain that there are no commercial-in-confidence issues with those three organisations, we can't provide them those documents. We indicated that, as soon as that process has been finished and as soon as we have clarified that, we will add those to the tabled documents. This is a standard process and a process that we would always follow.


The senator made a number of remarks about this, and it does give me an opportunity to perhaps clarify the sorts of matters that the land commissioner is considering. First of all, as a principle, I am very, very keen to make sure that these land claims are advanced. The senators opposite may know—I know Senator McCarthy would know—that the longest-standing land claim in the Northern Territory was the Kenbi land claim, and I am very proud to be the minister who signed off on it, eventually. That was a bit of a struggle at the last minute. Aboriginal people who are the beneficiaries of the declaration of that grant are so happy that it was eventually granted. As Senator McCarthy would also acknowledge, I'm sure, many people say that the lands rights process takes so long that many of the people who champion a claim actually pass away. 


There are two things that a land commissioner would take into consideration when dealing with these matters. The first is: 'When I make the determination to grant this land, what do those people impacted understand about it? What do they understand about what happens to their rights and what happens to them? Do they know about what I'm about to determine?' The second matter he takes into consideration is: 'What impact am I going to have on those stakeholders?' It's usually referred to as detriment. One is fundamentally an education process and one is a legal process. Let's say you take native title—it's just a legal process. But with both of the processes in this case—particularly the Beds and Banks case, because it's a precedent case and hasn't been dealt with under ALRA before—it is essential that we have both elements. I recall the senator referring to, I think, 52C of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, under which the Attorney-General may make grants. But, if you look deeper, it is only for legal elements; it is not for where we have an education package because of those two matters.


It is useful to understand what else I have done in these matters. I know Senator McCarthy knows that all the land councils have said, 'We want this advanced as quickly as possible.' There is only a suite now remaining, and we can deal with that suite. I want them dealt with as quickly as possible, and I have committed to resolving those land claims. So I have provided $8 million to the Northern Land Council. I've provided an additional million dollars to the Office of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner because they're going to have more hearings and those sorts of processes, knowing that the land commissioner will ask himself two questions, as I said. The first is: 'Do they understand the legislation around my determination over whatever rights and interests they may have?' The second is: 'Are these stakeholders able to tell me what impact it will have on them?' They are the two fundamental things the land commissioner will actually consider. These grants have been specifically for that. They have been specifically to do that. And I can tell you I'll make sure that it is done in a way that they are not wasted. We put a lot of time and thought into making sure that these investments will advance those processes.


I'll go to some comments that Senator McCarthy made about some associated IAS funding to NARMCO—a very hurtful 'to your mates' at the end. I don't know who writes your speeches, Senator, but you should keep less of that. So we're supporting NARMCO, which is supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander businesses. As I've indicated in an answer to a question today, we should add to that; there are a great deal more. There's $18 million to CatholicCare, $2 million to Australian Red Cross and $1.1 million to World Vision. I know that Senator McCarthy would wish that we ensure that we lift the capacity of Aboriginal businesses to provide services to themselves—in fact, I've done it, because, frankly, they do it better. They can do it as efficiently and they do it better. And I have, in my time here, got the biggest jump ever in Aboriginal businesses providing those services. But, for some time, it will be the case that others do them.


I indicate that I don't know a great deal of detail in terms of NARMCO, but my general understanding is that this is an organisation that specialises in providing back-of-house, principally advocacy services around accounting and finance. They do applications on behalf of people. People want to apply for a particular grant in a particular area, so they go and do those grant applications for them. I understand they have been highly commended by many of the Aboriginal businesses they work for. My understanding is that they predominantly provide a very focused piece of work for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander businesses. I look very carefully at every element of this funding. Every element of this funding is provided under the guidance of the department and under the IAS guidelines. I haven't shifted from those guidelines. 


With regard to the opportunity that the senator took to make some comments today and say that we haven't produced the documents, the documents were produced with a statement that said, 'There are three remaining documents, but the process is, because there is a connection between the people who gave us those documents, that we simply need to check.' I expect they will be with the Senate very shortly—within days. It's up to them. I can't see that they would be anywhere else. I'm not sure if someone's held them up. The adviser indicates no. Okay. They should be here very shortly. There are six documents that meet the terms of Senator McCarthy's request—three briefs to me seeking approval for funding in a direct funding application from each organisation. All of those briefs have been tabled. Now, if there's some relevant information—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Minister, I might just correct that, because you've come back to it a few times. They are with the Table Office, so you can seek to table those.




Senator SCULLION:
  I wasn't aware at all.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes. No, that's fine.




Senator SCULLION:
  So I can table those remaining documents now. Thank you, Madam Deputy President.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes. So we're talking about the initial three documents.




Senator SCULLION:
  No; those have already been tabled, I understand.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  No; they haven't been tabled in the Senate.




Senator SCULLION:
  So the original documents I can table now. I assumed they were tabled. They were with the Table Office this morning; they haven't been tabled. My apologies. With regard to the other application, the hold-up would only be a matter of days, but it is a convention. I'm advised by the department that I have to seek the okay from those three organisations. I can't see it being any material matter. I've actually given a fixed date. I've said the department has to consult with these organisations by 21 November. I've also instructed them just to get it done as quickly as they can, and I'm quite sure the documents will be tabled with the Senate as soon as possible.

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (15:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the explanation.


On Tuesday, I gave notice and asked the Minister for Indigenous Affairs for advice provided by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to him regarding the grants to the NT Cattlemen's Association, the Amateur Fishermen's Association of the NT and the NT Seafood Council that were referred to during estimates on Friday, 26 October. I also asked for copies of grant applications by the NTCA, AFANT and NTSC for funding from the Indigenous Advancement Strategy and any correspondence or other information, including briefs and meeting and file notes from or to the Indigenous affairs minister about these grants. This morning I did receive from the minister some of those documents. I received the briefs provided to the minister by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet concerning the applications, and I thank him for that. However, I have not received the grant applications from the three organisations under the IAS, because apparently they are commercial-in-confidence documents. I await production of these documents by, as the minister has said, 21 November.


The limited documents I have received do show some interesting facts about the whole process of how these grants to non-Indigenous peak bodies were made. Let's take a moment just to go over the facts. In April this year, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs stood up at the Amateur Fishermen's Association of the NT annual general meeting and said he was giving them $100,000 to help them run detriment cases in land claims. The papers provided to me today show that he did not sign off on an IAS grant to AFANT until 21 May, and the grant was for $155,000. According to departmental advice, it was a non-competitive direct approach to AFANT, which was recommended because:


There is a clear need for the stakeholder group to be better informed on Aboriginal issues in the NT …


It goes on to say:


This has been demonstrated by recent NT media on NT land claims which has attracted negative, uninformed comment from members of the recreational fishing community.


I'm wondering why the minister was able to make a promise to AFANT at its AGM in April about a $100,000 grant when at that stage he didn't know where the money was coming from. The AFANT money hadn't even started going through the grants process at that stage.


I also note that nowhere on any of the departmental advice to the three organisations does it mention the funding being used to meet legal costs in running detriment arguments in land claims. It talks about the stakeholder groups needing to be better informed about Indigenous people, how they should be better educated about land rights and native title, and how this funding will help their members to learn more about Indigenous people. In Senate estimates on 26 October, when I asked you, Minister, about the nearly half a million dollars granted under the IAS to the peak bodies, you said the funding was for 'just the legal fees, effectively'. I'm wondering why none of this advice from the department to you, Minister, about these IAS grants refers anywhere to the provision of fees for legal advice.


The minister said that he granted $1.4 million to a non-Indigenous company, North Australian Rural Management Consultants, for accountancy services, because they happen to have some Indigenous organisations as clients. I find this is an extraordinary use of funds that are meant to improve Indigenous communities and Indigenous lives. I would like to make clear, as I wrote to all the peak bodies on 2 November, that I understand and support their efforts to resolve some of these outstanding land claims. Further, I fully support the rights of these organisations to pursue legal assistance for the associated costs of putting forward their arguments in land claim hearings. However, it is my view that using IAS funding that is meant to support Indigenous participation and culture and strengthen Indigenous organisations for this purpose is an inappropriate use of these funds. I am advised that there are alternative and more usual funding streams and access to support for legal representation in land claims through the Attorney-General.


I will continue to ask why the minister did not follow this process. I will certainly continue to seek information and ask questions about the process that the Minister for Indigenous Affairs and the coalition government have followed with the allocation of IAS grants, and I will continue to ask the minister why grants from the Indigenous Advancement Strategy are provided to non-Indigenous companies that are run by his political mates.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2018-11-15,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:11):  I thank the senator for clarifying that we hadn't actually got the documents in time. We have clarified with the senator that we have provided those documents. There are three documents, which are the funding applications. Until we can ascertain that there are no commercial-in-confidence issues with those three organisations, we can't provide them those documents. We indicated that, as soon as that process has been finished and as soon as we have clarified that, we will add those to the tabled documents. This is a standard process and a process that we would always follow.


The senator made a number of remarks about this, and it does give me an opportunity to perhaps clarify the sorts of matters that the land commissioner is considering. First of all, as a principle, I am very, very keen to make sure that these land claims are advanced. The senators opposite may know—I know Senator McCarthy would know—that the longest-standing land claim in the Northern Territory was the Kenbi land claim, and I am very proud to be the minister who signed off on it, eventually. That was a bit of a struggle at the last minute. Aboriginal people who are the beneficiaries of the declaration of that grant are so happy that it was eventually granted. As Senator McCarthy would also acknowledge, I'm sure, many people say that the lands rights process takes so long that many of the people who champion a claim actually pass away. 


There are two things that a land commissioner would take into consideration when dealing with these matters. The first is: 'When I make the determination to grant this land, what do those people impacted understand about it? What do they understand about what happens to their rights and what happens to them? Do they know about what I'm about to determine?' The second matter he takes into consideration is: 'What impact am I going to have on those stakeholders?' It's usually referred to as detriment. One is fundamentally an education process and one is a legal process. Let's say you take native title—it's just a legal process. But with both of the processes in this case—particularly the Beds and Banks case, because it's a precedent case and hasn't been dealt with under ALRA before—it is essential that we have both elements. I recall the senator referring to, I think, 52C of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, under which the Attorney-General may make grants. But, if you look deeper, it is only for legal elements; it is not for where we have an education package because of those two matters.


It is useful to understand what else I have done in these matters. I know Senator McCarthy knows that all the land councils have said, 'We want this advanced as quickly as possible.' There is only a suite now remaining, and we can deal with that suite. I want them dealt with as quickly as possible, and I have committed to resolving those land claims. So I have provided $8 million to the Northern Land Council. I've provided an additional million dollars to the Office of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner because they're going to have more hearings and those sorts of processes, knowing that the land commissioner will ask himself two questions, as I said. The first is: 'Do they understand the legislation around my determination over whatever rights and interests they may have?' The second is: 'Are these stakeholders able to tell me what impact it will have on them?' They are the two fundamental things the land commissioner will actually consider. These grants have been specifically for that. They have been specifically to do that. And I can tell you I'll make sure that it is done in a way that they are not wasted. We put a lot of time and thought into making sure that these investments will advance those processes.


I'll go to some comments that Senator McCarthy made about some associated IAS funding to NARMCO—a very hurtful 'to your mates' at the end. I don't know who writes your speeches, Senator, but you should keep less of that. So we're supporting NARMCO, which is supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander businesses. As I've indicated in an answer to a question today, we should add to that; there are a great deal more. There's $18 million to CatholicCare, $2 million to Australian Red Cross and $1.1 million to World Vision.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2018-11-15,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (15:20):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


I rise to take note of answers given by government senators to questions asked by Labor senators. I want to go to a very important question I asked the minister, which was the question as to who actually made the decision to spend $8.2 million on advertising home care packages, when this government knew that the waiting list had blown out.


We know that the government sat on the last two lots of data. They sat on it for weeks and weeks instead of releasing it. When they finally released the last set of data, the waiting list had grown by an additional 13,000 Australians. Now, as it currently stands—we know from the government's own data—there are 121,000 older Australians who are still waiting for their approved packages of care. As I said in my question, there are 56,000 older Australians who have been assessed to get care but are getting nothing—not even level 1 or level 2, let alone levels 3 or 4, which are what the majority of them, 96,000 of them, have been waiting for. This government has failed on every single policy decision when it comes to older Australians. What they've done is spend $8.2 million on advertising home care packages, when the waiting times in some circumstances have blown out to two years.


Just so that those opposite actually understand what they're doing as far as the impact on older Australians goes, let me say that I had a woman email me this morning, having heard the comments I made in a speech yesterday about this blowout in the waiting list, to say: 'People are dying while they wait for their home care package.' That's what the reality is. This lady wrote: 'My husband had cancer of the stomach and liver. He was approved for a level 3 package earlier this year. He was provided with a glossy booklet that promoted and explained how the packages worked et cetera. As my husband's condition seriously deteriorated, I contacted My Aged Care to see when he could start receiving his level 3 package.' It was at this time that this lady learned about the 121,000 older Australians on the national waiting list. She was shocked and in total disbelief that the government promoted the benefit of the home care packages in the glossy booklet but was unable to deliver the care in a timely manner. Her husband passed away last month, before he could receive his level 3 home care package. This poor man went through the whole year very unwell without adequate care. The toll on this lady and her family was just a nightmare. That's just one example. I could go through countless. I outlined three others in my speech yesterday.


The government has been unable to deliver the services. This is a government that has been in charge of this policy area for five years. There have been three ministers. It was this government that actually called a royal commission into its own failures as a government. That's what it's done. It wasn't us calling for a royal commission; it was the government itself, because it has failed.


When the minister today, in his response, tried to suggest it was their idea to have the home care packages, he was blatantly wrong. He doesn't know what he's talking about. They were part of the Living Longer Living Better package, which was developed in consultation with the opposition at the time—that crew over there—and the sector. The framework was already there. All those opposite have had to do is roll out the plans that were established between the Labor government, the sector and the then opposition, and they've failed. They have failed miserably in not being able to do that.


What they want us to do is trust them. Well, the next data is due to be rolled out in the next few weeks, and I warned those opposite yesterday: don't release this new data on Christmas Eve, because you can't hide. They might try to run, but they can't hide from the fact that the waitlist will have blown out by, I would suggest, in excess of another 10,000 to 15,000 older Australians. It was a disgrace and dishonest for the Prime Minister to promise older Australians—when he knifed Malcolm Turnbull—that he would make older Australians a priority. He hasn't. If he calls allowing this wait list to blow out without taking any recourse at all a priority, he is a failure and he should stand condemned.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2018-11-15,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (15:25):  The cynical use of older Australians by the Australian Labor Party is to be condemned. The simple fact is that, under the previous Labor government, there was no home care approval list. So that of which the Labor Party complain is something they never thought of in government and never implemented, which as a result meant that senior Australians were left in the dark and subjected to unbearable delays in assessment and home care support. When quoting statistics, it's a bit like skimpy bathers: what they show is interesting; what they hide is vital. And what Senator Polley's speech has done is hide that which is vital.




Senator Polley:
  I rise on a point of order, Madam Deputy President. That was a totally disrespectful analysis. Senator Abetz's pathetic attempt—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Polley, that is not a point of order. Please resume your seat.




Senator ABETZ:
  You know you've got them between the eyes when they make an absolutely vacuous point of order such as that.




Senator Polley:
  We'll see who has it between the eyes at the next election.




Senator ABETZ:
  The honourable senator knows exactly what I am about to say. While you are attacking Mr Morrison personally, I advise you that the Liberal-National Party government is rolling out an additional 14,000 higher level packages.




Senator Polley:
  Fourteen thousand over three years.




Senator ABETZ:
  That began on 1 July. They are being rolled out as we speak. Senator Polley, with her insistent interjections, would hope the Australian people are not informed of this information. But I just happen to have the microphone for a few minutes, so I will repeat the fact that there are going to be 14,000 additional high-level packages. They are being rolled out and have been as of 1 July. We will grow overall home care packages from 87,000 to 151,000 over the next four years. So there is a plan. The plan is being implemented. We are seeking to serve the needs—



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator Reynolds:
  I rise on a point of order, Madam Deputy President. Senator Polley had her opportunity to speak and take note. I think she is now interjecting more than Senator Abetz is actually speaking. I would also point out, on her point of order—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Reynolds, thank you—




Senator Reynolds:
  that Senator Polley was the one who yesterday—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Reynolds, resume your seat, please. Senator Reynolds, when I ask you to resume your seat, I expect you to do so. Senators do have the right to be heard in silence, so let's continue with that.




Senator ABETZ:
  And, to assist me being heard in silence, I note that Senator Polley's wisely removing herself from the chamber.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Abetz, I do remind you that it is not appropriate to refer to whether senators are in or out of the chamber. You have no idea what may or may not be in their diaries, so do not make that reference.




Senator ABETZ:
  I wasn't reflecting on whether she was in or out; I was just reflecting on the fact that she was removing herself.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Abetz, I've asked you not to do that. When I asked you not to do that, you simply repeated it. Please continue.




Senator ABETZ:
  The facts are, which the Labor Party just don't like hearing, that up to three-quarters of the people on the national list are receiving some form of Commonwealth aged-care support, in any event. Is there a backlog? Yes. What did we inherit from the Australian Labor Party? It was a system that did not even have a proper, orderly list. So people were left in mayhem, uncertainty and insecurity. We are seeking to deal with that by allocating further funds and by telling the Australian people in the aged-care sector what they're entitled to with what is in the scheme of things a relatively small proportion of $8.2 million out of $5,500 million. Do the percentages on that; it's a minuscule percentage. To advise them as to what they actually might be entitled to and how the system is going to be rolled out is something that I think is appropriate.


If the Australian Labor Party were genuinely concerned about older Australians, they would repudiate and cancel their policy in relation to the treatment of franked dividends for those Australians who are seeking to prepare for their own retirement to ensure that they are not a burden on their fellow Australians. But what Mr Shorten and the Australian Labor Party are seeking to do is double-tax our older Australians who so heavily rely, through their self-managed super fund, their own investment or indeed other retirement schemes, on the benefit of getting a reimbursement of tax that is already paid. For many thousands of Australians, that impacts people on an income of less than $18,000. The vast bulk of people who will be impacted will be people who earn less than $87,000 per annum, not the filthy rich. But they're the people from whose pockets Mr Shorten and the Australian Labor Party will be pilfering money to put into Labor's spending spree.


Let's be very clear: when it comes to the actual issue that Senator Polley sought to address, the government has a plan. We are caring for more and more Australians and we will continue to do so on the back of sound economic management. (Time expired)

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2018-11-15,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (15:32):  I seek leave to take note of all answers, but in particular Senator Fifield's answer to Senator Keneally.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Polley has already done that.




Senator WATT:
  Oh, has she? Okay, thank you. Today in question time we had another display from this rabble, as my good friend Senator Cameron refers to them, or this muppet show of a government. I think he started calling them the mad muppet show. It is no more evident than it was today in every single answer, but in particular the answer from Senator Fifield. The question that Senator Keneally directed to Senator Fifield regarded the latest example of division and dysfunction that we see from the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison-Joyce-Truss-McCormack—whoever's next—government, and that is the display of disunity, particularly from Senator Fierravanti-Wells in her most recent opinion piece in TheSydney Morning Herald yesterday. It's always interesting to see what happens when former ministers go to the backbench. They discover their honesty gene, their openness gene, and are more at liberty to talk about what they really think about their government's policies and about their own ministerial colleagues. Senator Fierravanti-Wells left us in absolutely no doubt about what she thinks of the new environment minister, Ms Melissa Price, by labelling her 'an environment minister on L-plates'. It's hard to imagine a more cutting jibe to receive from one of your own colleagues than that remark, and Senator Fierravanti-Wells certainly was happy to dish it out. I think we are all surprised to see Senator Fierravanti-Wells be consigned to the backbench after the most recent leadership spill. She at least had the good grace to be quite open with former Prime Minister Turnbull about his performance, more so than many of her colleagues. While many of her colleagues quite openly voted against Mr Turnbull in the most recent leadership ballot, most of them have kept their spots and in some cases have been promoted. Senator Fierravanti-Wells has been picked on and has been consigned to the backbench, so it's no wonder that she wants to tell the Australian public what she really thinks about her colleagues.


What gave rise to these comments from Senator Fierravanti-Wells?


It was about the allegations that surfaced in our last sitting weeks that Minister Price offended a key Pacific leader, former Kiribati President Mr Tong, at a restaurant in Canberra by essentially accusing him of really only turning up to Canberra wanting more cash from the Australian government; she allegedly said that she had her chequebook out. This was an appalling slur to throw against one of our Pacific neighbours, in an area where we should and rightly do have significant influence. That's a pretty good way to make sure that our Pacific neighbours don't really think much of us—to treat them like that. It was, in fact, reminiscent of the comments that we heard from another minister in this government, Minister Dutton, when, in talking about climate change, he was caught saying that it's hard to care about things when you've got water lapping at your door—again, deeply offensive remarks made at the expense of our Pacific neighbours. But that's just another day in the job of a minister in this government.


Of course that's not the only foreign policy faux pas that we've seen from ministers, right up to the Prime Minister of late, with the embarrassing, deeply damaging and growing rift that we see between Australia and our largest near neighbour, Indonesia, over the Prime Minister's clearly political but counterproductive move to announce the possible move of the Australian embassy in Israel. We know that our relationship with Indonesia is vital to our future, whether it be on an economic basis, a security basis or a cultural basis, and we've seen Prime Minister Morrison happy to junk that relationship and put it into real danger just to try to score a few votes in Wentworth, which, of course, miserably failed.


So, whether it be Minister Price wandering around restaurants in Canberra offending Pacific leaders or whether it be the Prime Minister running around with his baseball cap on offending Indonesian leaders, it seems that this government just doesn't care about how Australia is regarded by our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific, which is a very short-sighted approach and one that shows that this government has lost any sense of where it wants to take the country. This latest outburst from Senator Fierravanti-Wells about the L-plate environment minister is just the latest incident of division and dysfunction that we've seen from this government. They have completely lost control. Everyone in Canberra is talking about what a boring week this has been because the government has no agenda that it wants to put forward. All the government have time for is to fight with each other and throw insults at each other in the newspapers. (Time expired)

That's what the Labor Party have been doing all week: falling flat on their backsides with a series of questions, including today, where they run up, they think they're on a winner, they think they're going to kick that ball to the other end of the field, but they swing and miss and land on their backsides yet again. They want to bring up things that happened over a decade ago. They want to bring up L-plate leaders.

It is a stronger rate than the world's seven largest advanced economies—the USA, Canada, France, Italy, the UK and Japan—and faster than the OECD average. What does that economic growth lead to? The most important thing it leads to is jobs, something that those opposite claim to care about—I have my suspicions. What did this government commit to achieving? It committed to achieving one million new jobs within five years, and we have more than achieved that—in fact, 1,144,500 jobs since 2013. Actually, I think that figure is slightly out of date. I think it's more than that now.


We see a government delivering on GST reform. The government has delivered something that many members opposite said could never be done. Western Australian Labor members of parliament said it couldn't be done, because it was too hard politically, but this government has delivered it.


For the first time, we've seen a significant reduction in the welfare rolls. This leads to a double benefit. It means more people are in work, so there is more tax revenue, but it also means that our expenditure is less. And we're giving those people a chance at a new future—not stuck in a welfare-dependent situation. Contrary to what those opposite try to draw out—the political, the 'inside the beltway' stories—this government is getting on with the job.


We are signing free trade agreements. Again, those opposite are walking away from a long-term bipartisan commitment to open and free trade. It is very sad that the Labor Party has fallen so far since the days of Hawke and Keating. I'm surprised to find myself saying that, because Hawke and Keating were certainly no favourites of mine. For the Labor Party to walk away from the benefits of trade and the jobs it creates is quite extraordinary.


Today we had an extraordinary attack on the Home Support Program. Labor didn't even have a list when they were in power. They criticised this government for actually finding out the scope of the issue that needs to be addressed. That is the great evil—when they were last in power, only a few short years ago, no such list existed. Again, our government is getting on with the job. The Morrison government committed $1.6 billion for extra home care packages, a rollout of 14,000 additional high-level packages, growing overall home care packages from 87,000 to 151,000 over the next four years. In so many ways this government is getting on with the job of delivering for Australians, unlike those opposite, who just want to play political games.

"Keneally, Sen Kristina",ALP,2018-11-15,"



Senator KENEALLY
 (New South Wales) (15:42):  Today, question time was all about captain's calls, big sticks, pinpoints, L-plates and the deep wounds that exist on the coalition side. Captain's calls: here we have a Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, who decided just days out from the Wentworth by-election that it was time to unilaterally announce that Australia was considering moving its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. There was no consultation with our armed forces, many of our public servants had to find out about it from the media and there was no consideration from the Prime Minister as to how this might affect our neighbour to the north, Indonesia. Well, we now know how it affects them. They're very upset and very angry, and understandably so—and we have a free trade agreement that has been put on ice. Senators on the other side have gotten up in this debate and talked about the free trade agreement. They didn't mention Indonesia, the one that this Prime Minister has stabbed in the heart with his captain's call to move the Australian embassy to Jerusalem. We heard from Minister Ciobo that there might be only a five per cent chance of that. He refuses to confirm that he said it. Minister Cormann refuses to confirm that he said it here today in this chamber. So now we just sit here and wait, yet again, for the Prime Minister to make another captain's call.


But that's all right, because they've got their big stick. They're waving their big stick around at the energy companies, with one of the most illiberal ideas you can imagine. That is a party over there, a government, that used to be believe in the market. Now they're talking about the forced divestment of power companies—how extraordinary! Labor shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, said this is a policy more suited to Venezuela than to Australia, and he was right. This is the big stick they're waving around, because they have no energy policy.


Amazingly, we have a government that has no policy to bring down the price of energy, to bring down emissions or, indeed, to secure our energy future. We're missing out on jobs. We're missing out on opportunity, because we're not investing in renewables. But don't worry: they've got a big stick; they're going to wave it around. Meanwhile, we have a minister who cannot pinpoint when Australia's emissions are going to start coming down. I'm not asking for the date; I'm asking for the year. She can't tell us that. 'She can't pinpoint it,' she said last night in a radio interview.


Minister Fifield had information that was a bit more specific. Perhaps he should choose to share it with the Minister for the Environment, Melissa Price, who seems intent on proving Senator Fierravanti-Wells's point that Minister Price is an L-plate minister. Anyone who has ever driven with an L-plate driver knows that it can be quite scary. We now have an L-plate driver in the driver's seat of our environment portfolio and, quite frankly, she's driving the environment—she's driving this country—off a cliff. The reality is she is an L-plate minister.


Senator Fierravanti-Wells simply spoke the truth in her opinion piece, yet we have this minister unable to pinpoint when we're going to get emissions down in this country and unable to acknowledge that her words to the former President of Kiribati were deeply offensive. It's no wonder Senator Fierravanti-Wells, who, as a minister, worked so hard in the Pacific portfolio, felt the need to step up and provide some dignity and reflection where Minister Price had failed to do so. But don't worry, Minister Price had her say last night. She's not concerned about the hurt she might have caused to our Pacific neighbours; she's concerned about the hurt that has been caused to her. She is deeply, deeply wounded, she says, as a result of what Senator Fierravanti-Wells wrote.


I think this points to the abject failure of this government—their chaos, their division, their internal bickering, their hurt feelings back and forth. They're not focusing on Australians and Australian families and on what they need and what they desire. From Senator Polley today in her questions and in her speech we heard how many tens of thousands—hundreds of thousands—of Australians are waiting for their home care package or have no home care package at all.


I'm going to end on this point: all of this chaos and division is hurting real people. When the government is focused on itself and not on real people, what we have are real Australians who are really dying as they wait for their home care. There is a whole range of other areas where this government has cut, but this is shameful today. (Time expired)

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (16:18):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


The government has sought to claim executive privilege in regard to the release of the incoming ministers brief from the Australian Research Council, claiming public interest immunity on the basis that release of the documents would prejudice relations with the Commonwealth and the states. I might indicate that this is inconsistent with the approach that's been taken with the release of other incoming ministers briefs in recent times, which we've seen with the Department of Defence, the Special Minister of State and the childcare section of the Department of Education and Training. I know that in 2010 many departmental or government documents were also released. So I put it to the Senate that the government's assertions in this letter that's been tabled by Senator McKenzie on behalf of the Minister for Education are simply not credible.


What we have here is a proposition which really is seeking to disguise or hide the fact that this government is now engaged in a comprehensive assault upon universities and their role in the life of this nation. Hardly a day goes by in which this government does not bring forward yet another attack upon universities. The idea of the university itself seems to be under assault by this government. The idea of autonomous, self-accrediting institutions devoted to free and independent inquiry is something that this government finds that it can't accept. It regards the university system as essentially hostile to its interests, and, as a consequence, the universities are to be harassed by this government. Specifically, we've seen this in the government's rejection of 11 grants in the humanities and social sciences under the former education minister, Minister Birmingham, which he sought to keep secret until it was revealed through the Senate estimates. We saw 11 grant applications from outstanding, internationally renowned scholars—all of which were recommended through proper, due peer review processes and assessed as being worthy of support, and some of which were unprecedented in their areas—subject to veto. This was a clear political intervention in contravention of the Haldane principles, which have been established in our political system, I might say, for well over 100 years. Of course, this is a circumstance we haven't seen since the last occasion when this happened, when Minister Brendan Nelson sought to do similar things.


When I was minister, we established a practice whereby, if the ARC's recommendations were not accepted, there was to be a public declaration setting out the reasons why ministers should reject the grant. Little did we know that that convention, which had been agreed on a bipartisan basis, was to be rejected. These actions were taken in secret, and the scholars were not to be informed. In fact, the ARC appears to have been instructed not to do so.


We now know that the government have further sought to cover up this disgraceful performance by seeking to impose new conditions on research grants in this country, by the establishment of what they call a national interest test. The current application process already has built into it a national interest test. People seeking to secure support from the ARC are required not only to demonstrate how their projects meet the requirements of a peer review by demonstrating their competence, their capability and their contribution to new knowledge but also to meet the national science and research priorities. They also have to demonstrate economic, social and cultural advantages to the nation. These are the terms that Minister Tehan outlined when he spoke on these matters on Radio National only recently. So what's redundant about those arrangements that the minister feels the need to impose yet further restrictions on the grant and, in fact, to delay the current round of grant applications? Some $300 million worth of grants are being delayed until after Christmas—in fact, until February—leaving a high level of uncertainty for those who are seeking the grants, many of whose jobs depend upon access to this money and many of whom won't know whether or not they are to be employed.


On top of that, the minister, as part of this assault on the university system, has now sought further impositions of national interest by declaring a national security provision, notwithstanding that there is a current review put in place through various defence arrangements to see how effectively the Defence Trade Controls Act is working. Not one example of breaches of those national control provisions or the legislation supporting them has been demonstrated through the processes of this parliament. Not one example has there been of the operations of our research agencies in regard to those arrangements. Yet the Department of Defence brings forward new proposals to have unparalleled overreach powers in regard to the capacity to search, seize and suppress research, and to do so without a warrant and without judicial processes. That would be undermining the processes that were established in 2015, which provide that balance between the needs of the security agencies and the needs of our researchers to ensure that they're able to work in collaborations with international research agencies. 


On top of that, we now have a situation where the government has sought to claim that it's funding regional students by taking money out of the research budget. For instance, it's funding students at Berwick, claiming that it is a regional campus. It's in suburban Melbourne, some 37 kilometres from the CBD. It just happens to be in a marginal seat. The government is now taking that money out of the research program, costing the Group of Eight universities alone some 550 jobs. We've got the situation at Caboolture, another suburban campus which the government claimed was a regional campus, where money was paid to the University of the Sunshine Coast to take the facility, and money was taken off the Queensland University of Technology, in terms of their grants, not once but twice. Now the government are faced with the reality. When they have frozen the funding arrangements for regional universities, the consequences become clear. And what do they do? They launch an attack on universities themselves. 


Today, the minister made further claims there is no research undertaken by the ARC on education. He made assertions that that's the case, when it's demonstrably untrue in terms of what the ARC has actually done. Furthermore, given the fact that this government closed down the Office for Learning and Teaching, which was the body that did the bulk of the education research in this country, it is profoundly ironic that the government should seek to assert that it's the universities themselves that are at fault—for government policies. Is it any surprise the government doesn't want to release documents?


What we've got now is a renewal of the culture wars against the university system in this country. We've got a government that commissioned a review into free speech. What, the IPA don't get enough of a say in this government that they want to impose their desire to get more right-wingers up in universities? We know, of course, that the knuckle-draggers have seized control of this government—the philistines that seek to demean researchers that have an international reputation. This government claim that it's acting in the people's interest, when in reality we know what this is about. It's an attempt to appease the shock jocks and the most backward elements of this coalition. It's a contemptible approach seeking to undermine the fundamental principles of the way in which our university system works—a mechanism that actually undermines the quality of our university system and our capacity, through our research system, to develop new knowledge, new technologies and new jobs, and to keep us at the cutting edge. 


This is a government that seems to have stopped listening, dominated by a party that stopped listening about 10 years ago. They continue to repeat the mistakes that we saw in the Howard government, and in their last, desperate throes— (Time expired)

I seek leave to have the documents incorporated in Hansard.

The documents read as follows—



PRIME MINISTER


Dear Mr President


I write with regard to questions I took on notice from Senator Bilyk during Question Time on Wednesday, 14 November 2018 on the matter of the employment of the Prime Minister as Director of the New Zealand Office of Tourism and Sport.


I can confirm that the Prime Minister was Director of the New Zealand Office of Tourism and Sport from 1998 to 2000. This included a period serving in the role following the election of the Clark Labour Government where he agreed to remain on following discussions with then Tourism Minister Mark Burton, with whom he had a very positive and productive relationship, until deciding to return home to Australia to take up an opportunity in the private sector.


I can confirm that the Auditor-General report to which Senator Bilyk referred was an inquiry into the appointments of, payments to, and resignations of, members of the New Zealand Tourism Board.


I can confirm that the New Zealand Office of Tourism and Sport was responsible to the Minister of Tourism and was a semi-autonomous body within the Department of Internal Affairs. The New Zealand Tourism Board was a Crown entity separately accountable to the Minister of Tourism.


I can further confirm that all organisations, government and non-government, including those led by the Prime Minister, which are required to make financial statements are audited on a regular basis as part of their usual obligations.


I have copied this letter to the Prime Minister and Senator Bilyk.

INDIGENOUS HOUSING


Dear Mr President


I write with regard to questions I took on notice from Senator McCarthy during Question Time on Wednesday, 14 November 2018 on the matter of the Government's plan to provide housing infrastructure in Borroloola, which will provide immediate relief to families and children living in some of the worst housing conditions in the country before the wet season.


I can advise the Senate that the decision to provide Borroloola with immediate housing relief was a decision of Government made in the normal way and with the full knowledge of the Prime Minister. Furthermore, representatives from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, as well as the Australian Army and the Northern Territory (NT) Government met with the community on 7 and 8 November 2018, to discuss options for addressing the urgent need for housing.


I can further advise that the commitment to delivering housing in Borroloola is in addition to the $14.6 million committed to Borroloola under the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing. The commitment also follows the decision by the Government to provide the NT Government with additional assistance worth $259.6 million to deliver essential services, including to remote communities.


The use of former Royal Australian Air Force houses was discussed with the community as a solution which could be immediately rolled out, noting these were existing older stock. All dwellings in Borroloola must be certified, which means they must be appropriate for the cyclone areas and adhere to the building code of Australia. I can confirm that dwellings will not be installed with asbestos.


Following these discussions and further assessment of the options, no former Royal Australian Air Force houses have been purchased. The Government is not pursuing the purchase of any former Royal Australian Air Force houses for use in Borroloola.


The Government will continue to consult with the NT Government, the Northern Land Council and communities as it works towards a solution for the housing issues in Borroloola.


I have copied this letter to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, the Special Envoy for Indigenous Affairs and Senator McCarthy.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (16:31):  In closing this second reading debate, I would like to thank all of those senators who have contributed to the debate so far in relation to the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Bill 2017. Australia, as I said earlier today, is one of the few Western democracies in which foreign donors can still influence domestic elections. The government's bill will ensure that our electoral system protects our national sovereignty. Most importantly, the bill will assure Australians that all political campaigning that targets Australian voters, be it election advertising, campaign phone calls or how-to-vote recommendations, is paid for by Australians. Foreign governments, foreign billionaires and foreign companies have no legitimate role in funding these activities to influence Australian politics.


I once again thank the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for their significant work on the topic of foreign political donations and on this bill over the course of the 45th Parliament. The government very much appreciates both the constructive approach and the goodwill demonstrated by all members of the committee and their sensible recommendations, which have played an integral part in informing the government's work on this topic, and the ultimate form of this bill.


The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters tabled two advisory reports on the bill, the first delivered in April 2018, which made 15 recommendations. The government responded positively to those recommendations by sharing draft amendments with the committee and inviting its further views on those proposed amendments. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters made 12 further recommendations in relation to those draft amendments, including supporting passage of the bill, subject to those final suggestions. The government has agreed to all of those recommendations and final amendments were circulated to senators at the end of October, reflecting a positive response to the last recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I will make some brief comments during the committee stage about some of the most significant government amendments that respond to recommendations from the joint standing committee.


Subsequent to those committee reports, the government has engaged in further constructive dialogue with the opposition and with stakeholders in the charitable sector. I again would like to place on record my appreciation for the constructive way in which the shadow special minister of state, Senator Farrell and his office have engaged with my team. A final suggestion that was raised in these discussions was for a post-implementation review in two years' time. The government is very happy to confirm that we support that proposal.


Given the extensive and cross-party work of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on the bill over the course of this parliament, it's the government's view that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is best placed to run this post-implementation review of the bill's operation. Accordingly, I put on the public record that, after passage of the bill, the government will initiate a referral to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, seeking that it review the bill in two years time. This review will take into account experience from the next election and ensure that the bill's objectives continue to be achieved in a way that minimises red tape. The review will include assessment of any impacts on issue based advocacy. And because the inquiry will need to occur in the next parliament, with a potentially different committee membership, we propose to make this referral by way of Senate motion rather than by way of referral in correspondence.


The reforms in this bill are important and are necessary to support the integrity of Australia's electoral system and Australia's sovereignty by ensuring that only those with a meaningful connection to Australia are able to fund Australian political activity. These reforms will ensure that the Commonwealth's electoral funding and disclosure regime keeps pace with international and domestic developments and provides transparency for Australian voters ahead of the next federal election.


Before I close, I also thank in particular Daniel Clode, senior adviser in my office, who's done an absolutely amazing body of work to help us get to this point. Once again, I thank senators for their contribution and commend the bill to the chamber. In doing so, I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill.

 (Queensland) (16:44):  As foreshadowed, I move my second reading amendment:


Leave out all words after ""that"", insert:


""the bill be withdrawn because the Senate is of the opinion that:


(a) the bill ignores corporate influence over politics and disproportionately targets the not-for-profit sector, which is an attack on public interest advocacy;


(b) the bill is likely to discourage charities from engaging in issue-based advocacy in furtherance of their charitable purposes, because of uncertainty in the definition of 'electoral matter';


(c) there is no public interest benefit to the proposed added layer of regulation for the charitable sector, because the existing regulatory framework for not-for-profit organisations under the Charities Act 2013 is sufficient to prevent charitable organisations from engaging in partisan political activities; and


(d) the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 should be amended to introduce caps on campaign expenditure by political parties, candidates and associated entities, which are indexed to inflation and subject to periodic review.""

Meaning of 
electoral matter



(1) Electoral matter means matter communicated or intended to be communicated for the dominant purpose of influencing the way electors vote in an election (a federal election) of a member of the House of Representatives or of Senators for a State or Territory, including by promoting or opposing:


(a) a political entity, to the extent that the matter relates to a federal election; or


(b) a member of the House of Representatives or a Senator.


Note: Communications whose dominant purpose is to educate their audience on a public policy issue, or to raise awareness of, or encourage debate on, a public policy issue, are not for the dominant purpose of influencing the way electors vote in an election (as there can be only one dominant purpose for any given communication).


(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), each creation, recreation, communication or recommunication of matter is to be treated separately for the purposes of determining whether matter is electoral matter.


Note: For example, matter that is covered by an exception under subsection (5) when originally communicated may become electoral matter if recommunicated for the dominant purpose referred to in subsection (1).




Rebuttable presumption for matter that expressly promotes or opposes political entities etc.



(3) Without limiting subsection (1), the dominant purpose of the communication or intended communication of matter that expressly promotes or opposes:


(a) a political entity, to the extent that the matter relates to a federal election; or


(b) a member of the House of Representatives or a Senator;


is presumed to be the purpose referred to in subsection (1), unless the contrary is proved.




Matters to be taken into account



(4) Without limiting subsection (1), the following matters must be taken into account in determining the dominant purpose of the communication or intended communication of matter:


(a) whether the communication or intended communication is or would be to the public or a section of the public;


(b) whether the communication or intended communication is or would be by a political entity or political campaigner (within the meaning of Part XX);


(c) whether the matter contains an express or implicit comment on a political entity, a member of the House of Representatives or a Senator;


(d) whether the communication or intended communication is or would be received by electors near a polling place;


(e) how soon a federal election is to be held after the creation or communication of the matter;


(f) whether the communication or intended communication is or would be unsolicited.




Exceptions



(5) Despite subsections (1) and (3), matter is not electoral matter if the communication or intended communication of the matter:


(a) forms or would form part of the reporting of news, the presenting of current affairs or any genuine editorial content in news media; or


(b) is or would be by a person for a dominant purpose that is a satirical, academic, educative or artistic purpose, taking into account any relevant consideration including the dominant purpose of any other communication of matter by the person; or


(c) is or would be a private communication by a person to another person who is known to the first person; or


(d) is or would be by or to a person who is a Commonwealth public official (within the meaning of the Criminal Code) in that person's capacity as such an official; or


(e) is or would be a private communication to a political entity (who is not a Commonwealth public official) in relation to public policy or public administration; or


(f) occurs or would occur in the House of Representatives or the Senate, or is or would be to a parliamentary committee.


Note: A person who wishes to rely on this subsection bears an evidential burden in relation to the matters in this subsection (see subsection 13.3(3) of the Criminal Code and section 96 of the Regulatory Powers Act).

Meaning of

Dominant purpose of creating or communicating electoral matter



(1) Electoral expenditure means expenditure incurred for the dominant purpose of creating or communicating electoral matter, except to the extent that:


(a) the expenditure is, or is to be, paid or reimbursed by the Commonwealth (except under Division 3 (election funding)) to or in relation to a person who is or was a member of the House of Representatives, a Senator or a Minister, because that person is or was such a member, Senator or Minister; or


(b) the expenditure is incurred by a person or entity (the service provider):


   (i) in providing a communication service or communication platform that is used to create or communicate electoral matter; or


   (ii) in providing a service for another person or entity that engaged the service provider, on a commercial basis, to create or communicate electoral matter.


Note 1: For example, expenditure incurred in relation to the communication of electoral matter for which particulars are required to be notified under section 321D is electoral expenditure.


Note 2: Expenditure by a person who creates matter that is covered by an exception under subsection 4AA(5) is not electoral expenditure. However, as each creation or communication of matter is treated as separate matter under subsection 4AA(2), expenditure incurred by another person who communicates the same matter for the dominant purpose referred to in subsection 4AA(1) may be electoral expenditure.


Note 3: For deemed electoral expenditure for political campaigners, see section 287J.


(2) Expenditure may be electoral expenditure whether the expenditure is incurred for the dominant purpose of creating or communicating particular electoral matter or electoral matter generally.




Expenditure in relation to an election



(3) In addition, any expenditure incurred by or with the authority of a political entity, a member of the House of Representatives or a Senator in relation to an election is electoral expenditure, except to the extent that the expenditure is, or is to be, paid or reimbursed by the Commonwealth (except under Division 3 (election funding)) to or in relation to a person who is or was a member of the House of Representatives, a Senator or a Minister, because that person is or was such a member, Senator or Minister.

This Division regulates gifts that are made to registered political parties, candidates, groups, political campaigners and third parties.


Gifts of over $1,000 to political entities (broadly, registered political parties, candidates and Senate groups) or political campaigners must not be made by foreign donors. A foreign donor is a person who does not have a connection to Australia, such as a person who is not an Australian citizen or an entity that does not have a significant business presence in Australia.


Broadly, gifts must not be made to a political entity, political campaigner or third party by a foreign donor for the purpose of incurring electoral expenditure or creating or communicating electoral matter.


Anti-avoidance provisions apply to strengthen these requirements.


A person or entity may commit an offence or be liable for a civil penalty if the person or entity contravenes the requirements. There are some exceptions, such as when a gift is made in a personal capacity.

Relationship with State and Territory laws





Information on amounts provided or received



(1) Despite any State or Territory electoral law, a person or entity is not required to disclose under the law an amount, or information relating to an amount, (including a gift or loan) if:


(a) the amount is provided to or for the benefit of a political entity, political campaigner, third party or associated entity (the gift recipient); and


(b) the person or entity is:


   (i) the gift recipient; or


   (ii) the person or entity providing the amount; or


   (iii) another person acting on behalf of the person or entity referred to in subparagraph (i) or (ii); and


(c) either:


   (i) the amount is required to be used by or with the authority of the gift recipient for the purposes of incurring electoral expenditure, or creating or communicating electoral matter, in accordance with subsection (2); or


   (ii) the amount may be used by or with the authority of the gift recipient for the purposes of incurring electoral expenditure, or creating or communicating electoral matter, in accordance with subsection (2), and has not been used for a State or Territory electoral purpose before the end of the period during which the amount is required to be disclosed under the State or Territory electoral law.


(2) An amount is required to be, or may be, used for a purpose of incurring electoral expenditure, or creating or communicating electoral matter, if:


(a) any terms set by the person or entity providing the amount explicitly require or allow the amount to be used for that purpose (whether or not those terms are enforceable); or


(b) the person or entity providing the amount does not set terms relating to the purpose for which the amount can be used.




Information on expenditure and debts



(3) Despite any State or Territory electoral law, a person or entity (the debtor) is not required to disclose under the law an amount, or information relating to an amount, of expenditure or a debt (except a debt incurred as a result of a loan) if:


(a) the debtor is a political entity, political campaigner, third party or associated entity; and


(b) either of the following apply:


   (i) the expenditure is electoral expenditure;


   (ii) the debt was incurred for the purposes of incurring electoral expenditure, or creating or communicating electoral matter.




Interpretation



(4) To avoid doubt, despite any State or Territory electoral law, a person is not required to disclose under the law an amount, or information relating to an amount, whether:


(a) the amount or information is required to be included in a return provided under this Part; or


(b) the amount or information is not required to be included in a return provided under this Part.


(5) Despite any State or Territory electoral law, if, under this section, an amount, or information relating to an amount, is not required to be disclosed under the law, then a total amount, or information relating to a total amount, that is required to be disclosed under the law is not required to include the amount.




Amounts made or retained for State or Territory electoral purposes



(6) Without limiting when subsection (1) does not apply, that subsection does not apply in relation to an amount of a gift if:


(a) any terms set by the person or entity providing the amount explicitly require the amount to be used only for a State or Territory electoral purpose (whether or not those terms are enforceable); or


(b) either:


   (i) the effect of a State or Territory electoral law is to require the amount to be kept or identified separately (or to require the amount to be kept or identified separately in order to be entitled to a benefit under that law); or


   (ii) the gift recipient keeps or identifies the amount separately;


 in order to be used only for a State or Territory electoral purpose.


(7) Without limiting paragraph (6) (b), an amount is kept or identified separately in order to be used only for a State or Territory electoral purpose if:


(a) the amount is kept in an account where:


   (i) the only amounts deposited into the account are amounts to be used only for a State or Territory electoral purpose; and


   (ii) the only amounts paid out of the account are amounts incurred for a State or Territory electoral purpose; or


(b) the amount is designated as an amount that must be used only for a State or Territory electoral purpose.

Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Bill 2017



(1) Amendment (112), item 33, at the end of subsection 302CA(3), add:


Note: For the purposes of subparagraph (3)(b)(ii), a gift recipient may identify the electoral purpose for which a gift is to be used at any time prior to using that gift. A person who gives, receives or retains a gift that is used for a State or Territory electoral purpose in contravention of a State or Territory electoral law may be liable to a penalty under the State or Territory electoral law.


Example:   A gift is given without expressing an intended purpose, and ultimately is used for a State or Territory electoral purpose. The giving, receipt, retention and use of that gift must comply with the State or Territory electoral law.


(2) Amendment (194), item 106, at the end of subsection 314B(1), add:


Note: If an amount was used for State or Territory electoral purposes during the applicable State or Territory disclosure period, State or Territory electoral laws apply to the amount. A person who does not disclose, under a State or Territory electoral law, an amount used for a State or Territory electoral purpose before the end of that period may be liable to a penalty under the State or Territory electoral law.


We also oppose schedule 1 in the following terms:


(4) Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (lines 11 to 21), to be opposed.


(37) Schedule 1, item 11, page 11 (line 24) to page 12 (line 23), section 287G to be opposed.

(180) Schedule 1, item 87, page 62 (line 31) to page 64 (line 11), section 314ABA to be opposed.


I will go through them in turn. The government proposes to move amendments in response to public feedback and recommendations from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. We have agreed to address all of the committee's recommendations made in relation to amendments to the bill. This includes recommendations to sensibly adjust the complaints burden for political actors, including relevant charities. We have reduced red tape, simplified compliance arrangements and made penalties more proportionate to the size of any breaches while ensuring that the measures reducing regulatory burdens do not compromise the bill's ability to protect our national sovereignty. Importantly, these amendments clarify that spending solely on issue advocacy is not treated as electoral expenditure when that spending is not aimed at influencing voting in a federal location. The amendments also clarify the overlap of state and Commonwealth disclosure regimes, an issue that has arisen in recent state based litigation.


These amendments ensure that federal law regulates federal elections, including political donations towards federal elections, and state and territory laws regulate donations for elections within their jurisdictions, namely state and local government elections. This week, we also have agreed to a further change, following discussion with the opposition, to make clear that communication that expressly promotes or opposes a member or senator is presumed to be a regulated electoral matter only where the matter relates to a federal election. In other words, criticism of a federal member in relation to their views on a state issue should not be presumed to be a federal electoral matter.


The government has always been open to recommendations on how our bill could be further improved and we have appreciated, as I have indicated in my summing-up speech, the constructive work by the members of JSCEM to help us design a foreign donations ban that is effective and fair. The additional amendments on sheet UV100 simply add two explanatory notes to add additional clarity about circumstances where our amended bill will not interfere with state laws regulating state locations or local government elections.


The government has listened to JSCEM concerns about particular scenarios where additional clarity is desirable. While the government's other amendments already address JSCEM's general concerns, the addition of these two explanatory notes also deal with a specific integrity risk that has been a point of concern. The notes include an example to make clear that silence about the purpose of a donation does not prevent the application of state law where a donation is ultimately used for a state purpose. Under section 15AD of the Acts Interpretation Act, an example like this has the effect of extending the operation of the relevant provision that it illustrates. Those notes recognise that a recipient may identify the true purpose of a gift at any time up until the time the money is spent. These notes explain that deciding to use a particular donation to pay a particular election expense will be enough to make an amount subject to the electoral laws of the relevant jurisdiction. These notes give a very strong level of assurance about where federal law starts and stops and where state law starts and stops.


In relation to some of the other amendments, I have moved government amendments which delete clauses from the bill to streamline obligations and reduce the regulatory burden. The government has already publicly explained in considerable detail where it is making changes to simplify the bill and this information has been released publicly through the website of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I commend the government's amendments to the Senate.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:54):  As I stated in my speech during the second reading debate, the opposition will be supporting this set of government amendments. These amendments are in direct response to the work undertaken by the opposition to fix the government's legislation.


Again, I want to highlight the work of members of JSCEM Mr Andrew Giles, Mr Milton Dick and Senators Ketter and Brown for their ongoing work in this area. I would also like to commend the work of Dr Andrew Leigh MP and all those charities and not-for-profits which placed their trust in Labor to successfully negotiate an outcome.


I also want to speak specifically to the government's amendments dealing with the Commonwealth and state law. There has been continuing fearmongering by the Greens today in order to justify—




Senator Siewert:
  Fearmongering!




Senator FARRELL:
  Yes, that's right—continuing fearmongering in order to justify their opposition to a ban on foreign donations. It was Labor who negotiated this outcome to ensure that state law is protected, as the minister just indicated. Labor was incredibly concerned to hear that the Commonwealth law could be used under any circumstances to override or avoid state disclosure regimes and electoral regulation.


The opposition believes in the right of state jurisdictions to determine their own electoral regulations and we requested that the government close this loophole immediately. Labor has sought constant assurances that state provisions will not be undermined by this bill. Provided this amendment is successful, that assurance and clarity has been provided. As we have stated throughout this process, Labor is committed to reviewing the operation of this legislation and will reserve the right to review the act and its application at a later date. Labor will not accept Commonwealth legislation being exploited by any party or political actor to avoid their obligation in state jurisdictions. I'd like to thank all of my colleagues in Queensland, in particular, for working constructively to ensure that state law is protected.


Meanwhile, the Greens have never engaged in the process of reviewing this legislation and they've never sought the views of the opposition. At least former Senator Rhiannon would engage constructively in policy rather than merely grandstanding.

Amendment (3), item 1E, at the end of subsection 4AA(5), add:


; or (g)  is or would be made for a charitable purpose.


As I outlined earlier, whilst we acknowledge that this bill has been softened considerably in its impact on the not-for-profit and charitable sector, we are still concerned about the sheer weight of regulation that has now been placed, disproportionately, on that sector by this bill and by five years of attacks by this government on that sector. This amendment seeks to put beyond doubt that any activities conducted by the not-for-profit and charitable sector in furtherance of their charitable purposes are not then required to comply with this new barrage of regulations. So this is an amendment that seeks to ensure that charities are able to continue their legitimate activities in a way that isn't being muzzled by this government, which can't take criticism.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2018-11-15,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (16:58):  The government will oppose this amendment. Where charities spend significant amounts of money to influence the outcome of an election they are already subject to disclosure requirements in the Electoral Act. This is necessary to protect the integrity of the electoral process and will continue to be the case.


The Greens are not correct when they claim that the Charities Act already prevents charities from engaging in partisan political activities. The Charities Act prohibits registered charities from having an overall purpose of promoting or opposing a political party or candidate for political office. However, this does not prevent registered charities from undertaking an activity of promoting or opposing a political party or candidate in pursuit of their broader charitable aim. For example, a charity focused on reducing homelessness might lawfully oppose a candidate seeking to eliminate public housing, to use an extreme example to demonstrate the point.


In the 2015-16 financial year, which included the last election campaign, third-party campaign groups spent almost $40 million on election advertising, polling and campaigning and, indeed, issuing how-to-vote cards. It is clear that elections are no longer just fought between political parties and candidates, and it is appropriate that all participants who choose to make significant amounts of political expenditure are subject to consistent transparency, disclosure and reporting requirements that apply to all other relevant political actors.


The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters considered evidence, including photographs in social media, showing charities and not-for-profits opposing the election of some candidates and promoting the election of other candidates. New political actors do not field candidates from their own ranks or seek to form government, but they actively seek to influence who gets elected and can sway the outcomes of elections. While this is a positive indication of the strength of Australian civil society and civic engagement in our democracy, it is important that these actors be subject to appropriate transparency and accountability rules when their election spending is significant.


I would make the general point, which I have made on the public record on many occasions, that a blanket exemption of charities from, for example, the proposed ban in this bill on foreign political donations would make that ban entirely ineffective, because it would create a massive loophole and a massive incentive for those foreign actors intent on influencing the outcome of elections here in Australia to channel their donations through relevant charitable organisations.


We have considered the views, assessment and recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, and we believe that we have ended up with an appropriate balance. Of course, issue advocacy is important and will not be affected through this bill, but, where there is significant expenditure to a relevant level on political campaigns, of course the same or similar transparency, disclosure and reporting requirements should apply and the same ban on foreign political donations should apply.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2018-11-15,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:02):  The opposition will be opposing the amendment moved by the Australian Greens. Labor has worked with the charities and not-for-profits for almost a year, guaranteeing that the bill before the Senate, the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Bill 2017, protects public policy advocacy. Labor has approached this debate and the year of negotiations that has preceded it with careful consideration of why the Commonwealth Electoral Act exists and the important role it plays in ensuring any organisation that seeks to influence an election meets the expectations of the Australian public, especially relating to transparency. In advocating for the charities and the not-for-profits, Labor has ensured that the very definition of 'electoral matter' is sensibly defined. Our changes, moved today by the government, have ensured that those who should not bear the burden of political actors do not and that those who seek to influence elections are regulated appropriately.


Labor has always opposed seeking blanket exemptions in the Commonwealth Electoral Act, and the reason is clear: blanket exemptions, regardless of their intent, create loopholes in our law. Any organisation seeking to deliberately influence an election, insofar as it is still captured by the narrow definition negotiated by Labor, should comply with those transparency measures outlined in the revised bill and the ban on using foreign money. We cannot support an exemption where those seeking to deliberately influence an election can hide behind an unintentional loophole of charitable purpose. That is not good government, not good policy and not good for our charities.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:03):  There has obviously been a level of public debate and public reporting here in Australia over the last two years in relation to these matters. As I've indicated in my summing-up speech and also in introducing the amendments, Australia is actually one of very few Western democracies in which foreign donors can still influence domestic elections. In the United States, for example, if you are foreigner, you are not allowed to donate towards a presidential or congressional election.




Senator Farrell:
  You're not allowed to run, either.




Senator CORMANN:
  You're not allowed to run for president, that's right. That counts the two of us out, Senator Farrell. But Australia is one of the few Western democracies in which foreign donors can still influence domestic elections. Senator Hanson would remember that the government announced some time ago now, I think this time last year, a package of reforms, of which this is a component, to protect Australia from undue foreign interference in our internal democratic processes.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:05):  Minister, if you are going to protect the electoral process and our democracy in Australia from foreign investment in or donations to political parties, how can you assure that, if you have a foreign company, that foreign company will not divest their moneys through their Australian subsidiary companies here?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:05):  The government, based on advice not just from our own officials but also from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, has made the ban on foreign political donations as effective as possible considering the constraints that we face under our Constitution. Under our Constitution we are not able to ban donations from Australian residents or from Australian companies, so this ban on foreign political donations has been structured to be as effective as possible, as mindful of the limitations in terms of our authority to legislate to that effect under our Constitution.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:06):  Minister, under the Electoral Act you would be changing the electoral funding so it is actually going to be on receipts—is that correct? So $10,000 if you receive four per cent of the vote, and you will automatically receive $10,000 if your electoral funding is more than that? In that case, for anything over $10,000, is it that all candidates, all political parties, must submit their receipts to the Electoral Commission for electoral funding?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:07):  I thank Senator Hanson for that question. Public funding entitlements have not changed under this bill. Public funding will continue to be payable in relation to candidates that receive at least four per cent of formal first preference votes and will be calculated in the same way. What has changed is the process. To assist less well financed candidates and to minimise red tape, the first $10,000 of funding will continue to be paid automatically shortly after polling day. A claim setting out electoral expenditure will need to be submitted for more than the first $10,000 to be paid. The amount of public election funding paid will be capped at the amount of electoral expenditure specified in the claim. Claimants must keep records of claimed electoral expenditure for five years after polling day. Records are likely to be receipts and invoices in most instances. In examining claims, the Australian Electoral Commission will be checking that claimed electoral expenditure is accurate and unique. In other words, no double-dipping by claiming the same expense in different claims, for example for different states, or claiming fictional expenditure. Like the way the tax office checks for fraud in claimed tax credits, the Australian Electoral Commission will have flexibility in determining what they need to do to conduct this check at any particular time. This flexibility allows them to minimise red tape. For example, if the Australian Electoral Commission determines there is a high risk that claims will be inaccurate, they might require that all receipts are submitted with the claim. Or they might decide to randomly select claims for audit and ask to see selected claimants' receipts. If they determine there is a low risk of fraudulent claims at a particular time or for a particular type of claimant, they might not ask to see proof of electoral expenditure at all. As the Senate is well aware, the Australian Electoral Commission of course is an independent statutory organisation which acts in an entirely non-partisan fashion.

gift
)



Repeal the definition, substitute:



gift means any disposition of property made by a person to another person, being a disposition made without consideration in money or money's worth or with inadequate consideration, and includes:


(a) the provision of a service (other than volunteer labour) for no consideration or for inadequate consideration; and


(b) an annual subscription paid to a political party, to a State branch of a political party or to a division of a State branch of a political party by a person in respect of the person's membership of the party, branch or division; and


(c) a payment in respect of attendance at a fundraiser or similar event held by, or for the benefit of, a political entity;


but does not include:


(d) a payment under Division 3; or


(e) any visit, experience or activity provided for the purposes of a political exchange program.




[meaning of gift]



These amendments relate to, firstly, the commencement date of these new laws. Importantly, amendment (2) goes to whether or not the federal government can override state donation rules. Senator Farrell has received advice that is in conflict with the advice that I've received, and I've formed my own view on the effect of the amendments. My understanding is that, as the bill is currently drafted, it will still enable property developers to avoid the donations ban that would otherwise apply in Queensland. My understanding is that the Queensland laws will now need to be amended to require that donations be placed into a separate bank account. If that amendment goes through the Queensland parliament—presumably it will—we won't have a problem. But until such time as that amendment occurs, this bill enables the developer donation ban to be circumvented.


I take objection to the description of my legal view of that as being grandstanding. It's quite the contrary. We're actually trying to clean up politics here. We're trying to get big money out of politics and we're trying to make sure that the rules that were brought in in Queensland by your counterpart, Senator O'Farrell, are effective. So we have moved this amendment in—




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator McCarthy
):  What is your point of order, Senator Farrell?




Senator Farrell:
  On a point of order: Senator Waters should call me by my correct name, which is Senator Farrell, not Senator O'Farrell.




Senator WATERS:
  Sorry. It was my mistake, Senator Farrell. I do apologise. It was not deliberate. I apologise. So that was amendment (2). I'll just move to briefly outline amendment (3). We are seeking here to lower the disclosure threshold for donations to $1,000. We think that enables far more public scrutiny of what money is being received by whom and, in particular, by which political parties.


Amendment (4) goes to the fact that, at the moment, membership fees aren't considered donations and moneys provided to political parties to attend fundraising events are also not considered donations. There is so much dark money flowing around, going into the coffers of the larger political parties, that is not properly accounted for and that is not able to be scrutinised by the public. This amendment, amendment (4), would say that those contributions are to be considered a donation and therefore should be subject to the other rules that donations are subject to; namely, the disclosure threshold—and, if our amendment is successful—a cap on the amount. I moved those four amendments, as listed earlier.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2018-11-15,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:17):  The government will not be supporting any of the Greens amendments. The first Greens amendment would change the commencement date to push back commencement until after the next election, rather than allowing a ban on foreign political donations to come into effect from proclamation, which would be well and truly in time, before the next election, to ensure we can prevent inappropriate foreign political interference in our next federal election. I don't quite know why the Greens would want to help facilitate continued foreign political interference in our Australian federal election next year. I don't understand the intent behind this amendment, to be honest. It would be bad policy to deliberately delay the start of a foreign political donations ban until after the next election, given the increased evidence around the world of the risk of foreign interference in elections. The parliament needs to act in a timely way to prevent future risks to our democracy.


In relation to amendment (2) Senator Waters is entirely incorrect—Senator Waters is not correct—in her assertion that Queensland laws would need amendment to avoid conflict with federal law. I can only assume that Senator Waters hasn't sufficiently reviewed government amendments that were passed through this chamber a few minutes ago. The government's amendments make it clear that the mere decision to spend a donation on a state electoral expense will invoke state law. That's a very important point. The mere decision to spend a political donation on a state electoral expense will invoke state law.


The government's intent here has been very clear from the start. We have worked successfully with the opposition to refine the way that we are approaching this. Our intent is to ensure that there is clarity, that federal laws regulate federal elections and that state laws regulate elections under state jurisdictions; principally state and local government elections. We also believe it's very important there is clarity for all of the impacted stakeholders who have to comply with various regulatory regimes in terms of where the boundary is between federal law and the regulation of federal elections and state law and the regulation of elections under state jurisdiction.


Government amendments comprehensively dealt with the Commonwealth and state law interactions. This amendment would reverse those changes. If the government's amendments were not made, there would be ambiguity for regulated entities and, in light of recent court decisions, overlap between various state, territory and Commonwealth laws on political donations. Any ambiguity and overlap would increase the regulatory compliance burden for affected entities, with multiple laws in different jurisdictions applying to the same financial transaction. On that basis we would urge the Senate not to support this Greens amendment.


In relation to the disclosure threshold, this amendment would reduce the disclosure threshold from $13,800 to $1,000. This amendment is very badly drafted, because it not only impacts donors but also has the consequence of reclassifying numerous very small organisations as third-party campaigners if they spend more than $1,000 in a year on electoral expenses. The Greens would tie up the sectors that they supposedly support in massive additional red tape; they would choke the charitable sector in massive additional red tape. This change alone would, as I say, drag numerous not-for-profit and charitable organisations under the new reporting rules for third parties. This would sweep up tiny groups like neighbourhood associations, RSL branches, footy clubs and other tiny players who comment favourably or adversely on a federal politician or federal party. This extreme change in this third amendment, in terms of expanding the reporting net, has not been discussed, as I understand it, with the charitable or non-profit sector, and, unlike other major amendments, was not considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. You see, we, the government, have exposed ourselves to proper process; we have exposed ourselves to thorough, constructive and good-faith engagement with the opposition, and so we have a high level of confidence that there is broad support—perhaps not 100 per cent support—for the balance that we have reached. This third amendment would be an extreme change in the reporting net and, as I say, would actually have a massively negative impact on the charitable and not-for-profit sector, which the Greens assert they are standing up for in this chamber today.


The fourth amendment, redefining gifts, is in our assessment lacking in logic. The amendment would treat the cost of food at a fundraising event as if it were a gift. By contrast, the government's amendments, which are supported by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, have greater logic, because it is only the profit component of an event price that should be treated as a gift.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:22):  The opposition will be opposing these amendments by the Australian Greens. Unfortunately, the issues caused by the Greens amendments outweigh any benefit. The Greens amendments seek to place obligations on donors but not on recipients of donations, a clear loophole allowing those receiving donations to flout the law. Most troubling, the Greens amendments seek to delay the commencement of this legislation until after the next federal election, allowing foreign donations to flow into the coffers of political parties for the next poll. Labor has longstanding policy for electoral reform, including lower disclosure and shorter disclosure times. However, the Greens again are seeking to conflate, with a series of poorly drafted changes, the issues that Labor has been negotiating with our trusted charities for close to a year.


The substantive issue here is a foreign donations ban. Labor has sought to ensure that third parties and charities are protected from the government's overreach without creating further issues within the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Labor believes the issues surrounding disclosure require further consideration and consultation with those third parties that we have worked so hard to protect. Labor, as a party of government and as a party who wants the system to work, is committed to addressing these matters constructively and will always do so.

The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator McCarthy
):  No, but you got to your feet.




Senator FARRELL:
  But I am happy to answer Senator Hanson's very sensible question. I might add that it is a very sensible question. I certainly don't know every foreign donation—




Senator Hanson:
  Just give me one.




Senator FARRELL:
  Well, I can give you one.




Senator Hanson:
  Sam Dastyari.




Senator FARRELL:
  No—Mrs Zou, for instance. If we take the last state election in South Australia, there was Sally Zou's contribution to the Liberal Party. She originally wrote a cheque for $1 million which she then took a selfie of, and we understood she was going to donate that to the Liberal Party in South Australia. A $1 million donation by a foreign citizen to a state campaign is a very large amount of money. We had every reason to believe that it was correct that she was going to do that, because she had already set up a foundation. I might have the name of this incorrect, but it was something like the Julie Bishop Glorious Foundation. I see Senator Cormann is laughing there. He would know much more about this particular donation. You wanted me to name one. I think there is a number there that you can refer to. I would be happy, Senator Hanson, to go back and try to provide you with as much information as I can get on all of the political donations.


Just so I'm not seen to be partisan, the reality is that the Labor Party has also been receiving donations from these foreign groups, and we will lose those funds from these foreign groups. But I have to point out that our leader six months ago took the very principled stand of saying, 'We will stop accepting those foreign donations.' So, yes, we have in the past, as a political organisation, accepted foreign donations. It has been legal, up until this legislation, for Australian political parties to do that. Bill Shorten took the principled stand that we would no longer receive or accept political donations. You might recall that, in my initial speech on this matter, I called on the government to take that same principled stand today when this legislation passes and not to wait until it passes the lower house.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:28):  I'm very disappointed that my good friend and valued colleague Senator Farrell allowed himself to be provoked into partisanship, but the only thing that I could detect in the garbled first half of his contribution was that he was talking about a donation that never happened. It took him a very long time to get to the proposition that there was some suggestion of a donation that might happen but never happened. He didn't quite get to that conclusion, but that was the effect of what I heard him say.


Let me give a more coherent answer to the question that Senator Hanson has asked. At present, while details of political donations above the threshold of $13,800 need to be disclosed under the current rules, it is often not possible to ascertain whether a foreign source is involved. Thus it is not possible to ascertain, under the current disclosure rules, how common foreign donations are or what their value is. However, we do know that preventing undue foreign influence and the perception of such undue influence is critical to our democracy. Our amendments will increase the transparency and assurance about the source of donations to help keep foreign donations out of Australian elections.


Media reports increasingly document foreign attempts to influence elections around the world, which is a disturbing development. As I've indicated, Australia is one of the very few Western democracies in which foreign political donations are not as yet prohibited. It is good electoral reform housekeeping for us to catch up with what is already the prevailing law in most other Western democracies. Nobody can actually tell you with precision what has happened in the past, but, given international developments, given what's clearly been a matter of public debate in Australia for some time and given the views and the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on what should happen here, this is the best way forward. I hasten to add that it was, of course, the Liberal-National government that put forward this legislation. We put forward this legislation a year ago. It would have been great if we could have passed it more quickly, but we did think it was important to get this right in time for the next election, which is why we engaged in good faith with all relevant stakeholders and the opposition. I was somewhat saddened to see that that level of constructive bipartisanship disappeared for a moment.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:30):  I commend the government, the opposition and Labor on their stance against foreign donations; the principal parties now won't take these because of the influence it may have over their political decisions in this place.

Will these organisations not have influence over government policy?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:31):  I did actually address this earlier. Under the Australian Constitution, Australians—including Australian businesses, Australian organisations and Australian residents—are entitled to participate in our democracy. There's nothing wrong with Australians seeking to influence each other in terms of how they ultimately vote. The ultimate decision is a decision for individual voters who vote in secrecy. That is, of course, the way the process works. What we are very deliberately seeking here is to prevent attempts of foreign interference in our domestic democratic process. In particular, through the ban on foreign political donations, we are seeking to prevent and prohibit influence by foreign donors on our Australian democratic process. In terms of attempting to do what Senator Hanson appears to be suggesting we should consider, which is similar to what the Greens appear to have been suggesting, the best available advice we have is that that would not be constitutionally sustainable.

The Constitution, yes, is made up of the document that Senator Hanson has in her hot little hands, but it also, of course, needs to be considered in the context of decisions made by the High Court interpreting our Constitution over a long period of time. There is a consensus view that it would not be possible to prohibit participation, and, in fact, there have been previous cases in relation to relevant legislation where that has been made very clear. The best available advice that we have is that it would not be constitutionally sustainable to completely prohibit any Australian company or Australian citizen from participating in the Australian democratic process, including by making political donations.

 (Queensland) (17:35):  I now move Australian Greens amendment (9) on sheet 8546 revised:

64A After section 305B



Insert:




   
   
305C Real
‑time disclosure of gifts



      (1) If a person or entity makes a gift to:


      (a) a registered political party; or


      (b) a State branch of a registered political party; 


the person or entity must, in accordance with this section, notify the Electoral Commission of the gift.


Note 1: A contravention of this civil penalty provision may be a continuing contravention (see section 93 of the Regulatory Powers Act).


Note 2: A restricted donor is not permitted to make gifts to political entities. See section 302EA.


Note 3: Persons and entities other than restricted donors are not permitted to make gifts that exceed the disclosure threshold to political entities. See section 302EB.


Civil penalty: 60 penalty units.


      (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), a person or entity who makes a gift to any person or body with the intention of benefiting a particular registered political party or a State branch of a registered political party is taken to have made that gift directly to that party or branch.


      (3) The notification must be made as soon as practicable after the gift is received.


      (4) The notification must set out the following:


      (a) the amount or value of the gift;


      (b) the date on which it was made;


      (c) the name and address of the registered political party or branch.


      (5) The notification must be in the approved form.


      (6) The Electoral Commission must publish the notification on its website, in a readily accessible format, as soon as practicable after receiving the notification.


This is an amendment that would allow and require real-time disclosure of donations made to political parties. I'll move some other amendments that say we think that shouldn't happen for particular vested interests that have a stranglehold on our democratic decision-making process, and I'll move separately another amendment that says we think all donations should be capped at $1,000, because we don't think big money should play a role in decision-making, but this particular amendment relates to real-time disclosure. I will be very interested to see how the chamber votes on this issue because I understand, in fact, that there's some agreement that this is a good idea. Will those parties have the courage to actually vote for it? That is what I am very keen to know.


I want to hearken back to the fact that we've had some by-elections recently. By the time we get to the next general election, the public still won't know who donated to the large political parties at those by-elections, yet we'll be at the next election. So how on earth are people meant to know who is pulling the strings? It's pretty clear that the big donors are pulling the strings, but these parties don't want to tell the public who is donating to them.


So that's why this amendment would give the public the right to know who's paying these folk who are making decisions on behalf of their donors to promote the donors' vested interests and putting the community a distant last. These amendments would give the community a right to know so that, when people cast their vote, they are doing so in full knowledge of the priorities of the people that they might consider voting or not voting for.

 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:37):  The government will not be supporting this amendment, nor will we support the other amendment that relates to this particular proposition. It's quite strange, in our view, that the Greens propose that the onus of making real-time disclosure should only be on the donor and not on the political parties that benefit and can most efficiently undertake reporting. This amendment is also contrary to a fundamental principle in the bill in that it would create inconsistency between the transparency of donations to parties and that of donations to political campaigners. I leave it to observers and analysts to speculate as to why that would be. The government's view is that organisations which spend over half a million dollars a year on federal election expenditure, including GetUp!, which indeed spent $10 million in the lead-up to the last federal election—let me say that again: $10 million—should be treated on the same basis as political parties and other relevant actors, and the Greens have not made out a convincing case for why such organisations should get special treatment.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:38):  The opposition also will not be supporting this amendment. Labor has a clear policy in support of real-time disclosure. We believe that donations over $1,000 should be disclosed and disclosed quickly. Labor has a strong record on transparency in politics, and we approach every issue on the facts before us. As I've stated before, including to members of the crossbench in our discussions on this legislation, real-time disclosure at a federal level requires a significant consultation with the AEC and consideration by those parties who will need to ensure their own compliance. We are committed to achieving this policy, and we will do so with the appropriate consideration should we form government. It's vital that we always approach such issues not just with our values and beliefs but also with the practical view of actually getting it done.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:39):  The minister made reference to GetUp! and the $500,000. What is the government's response to the donations that are made by the unions, which are tax exempt—the millions of dollars that they give to the Labor Party and to other political parties? Is the amount of money they give to the political parties reined in? They are tax exempt—they don't pay any taxes in this country. How do they sit under this legislation?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:40):  There are longstanding transparency, disclosure and reporting requirements under the Electoral Act, as it stands, that apply to political parties and other relevant political actors, principally associated entities. That is a longstanding arrangement and it is not something that is changed with this bill. What we are doing in this bill is adding a further category—the category of political campaigner—as a new category of political actor that has to comply with the relevant disclosure, transparency and reporting requirements and will be subject to the same ban on foreign political donations. I mentioned the example of GetUp! but, no, I didn't mention $500,000. I mentioned $10 million of expenditure in the 12 months leading up to the 2016 federal election. Off the top of my head, I seem to remember that at various times GetUp! bragged that they had distributed half a million or a million how-to-vote cards—I can't remember, so I'll get it back to you on notice, but half a million or a million seems to ring a bell. I think it was a million how-to-vote cards at 500 polling booths. I'll check it out and get back to you.


The point is that all organisations, including unions, businesses and individuals, have to comply with the requirements in terms of disclosure and reporting that are already in place. The bill in front of us strengthens those requirements in relation to some organisations that currently are not captured. It also ensures that we put in place a ban on foreign political donations, which we believe is widely supported across the chamber.

"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2018-11-15,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (17:49):  by leave—I move Greens amendments (5) and (6) on sheet 8546 revised together:


(5) Schedule 1, item 7, page 6 (before line 19), before the definition of senior staff, insert:



restricted donor means:


(a) a person or entity that carries on:


   (i) a property development business; or


   (ii) a mining business; or


   (iii) a business manufacturing tobacco products; or


   (iv) a business manufacturing alcoholic products; or


   (v) a business providing gambling services; or


   (vi) a business providing banking services; or


   (vii) a business manufacturing pharmaceutical products; or


   (viii) a business manufacturing defence products; or


(b) an associate (within the meaning of the Corporations Act 2001) of such a person or entity.


(6) Schedule 1, item 33, page 42 (after line 5), after section 302E, insert:




302EA Donations to political entities by restricted donors



(1) A person or entity (the donor) contravenes this subsection if:


(a) the donor is a restricted donor; and


(b) the donor makes a gift to, or for the benefit of, a political entity.


Note: The physical elements of an offence against subsection (2) are set out in this subsection (see section 302R).




Offence



(2) A person or entity commits an offence if the person or entity contravenes subsection (1).


Penalty: 2 years imprisonment or 800 penalty units.


(3) Section 15 of the Criminal Code (extended geographical jurisdiction—category D) applies to an offence against subsection (2).




Civil penalty



(4) A person or entity is liable to a civil penalty if the person or entity contravenes subsection (1).


Civil penalty:


The higher of the following:


(a) 800 penalty units;


(b) if there is sufficient evidence for the court to determine the amount or value, or an estimate of the amount or value, of the gift at the time the gift is made—3 times that amount or value.


(5) Subsection (4) applies:


(a) whether or not the conduct constituting the contravention of subsection (1) occurs in Australia; and 


(b) whether or not a result of the conduct constituting the alleged contravention of subsection (1) occurs in Australia.


I will outline for the chamber the effect of these amendments. We have already seen how enormous the influence of big corporates is over this chamber, and the public are absolutely sick of the vested interests of donors getting put ahead of the interests of the community. This amendment would seek to ban donations from eight of the most influential and self-interested industries that so far have had a stranglehold over this parliament. This amendment would completely ban donations from the property development industry, mining, tobacco, alcohol, gambling, the big banks, defence and big pharma. The Australian people have the right to expect that decisions are made in their interests and not in the interests of those big corporations. There have previously been some comments about the questionable constitutionality of these amendments. I would simply direct anyone interested in that to the McCloy case. We are perfectly able to have those restrictions; it is simply a question of whether or not the big parties want their money to dry up. I am not expecting support for this amendment, because we know that both of the big parties have taken $100 million in donations from the big corporates in the last six years, but we live in hope.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (17:51):  Let me firstly agree with something that Senator Waters has said: the Australian people are absolutely entitled to expect that decisions be made in their interest. Do you know who judges to what extent is we have made decisions in their interest? The judge of that is the Australian people at every election. That is the process. Senator Waters is essentially implying that the Australian people are too stupid to form their judgements in relation to how individual candidates or relevant parties are performing. This is clearly just part of the democratic discourse.


If there is a level of concern about policies, and a view by the Greens about what influences certain policies, then under our democratic system you are entitled to express that view and to inform the Australian people. The Australian people might believe you and then they will vote for you if they think that it is a really terrible thing that there is a particular policy that supports the mining industry, the farming sector or access to pharmaceutical products. If people share your view that that is a bad thing, they'll vote for you; if they believe that policies that support the mining sector, the agricultural sector, the education sector and access to pharmaceutical products for patients across Australia are good things then they will support relevant candidates and parties who promote those particular policy agendas. That is the way democracy works: if you have a concern, you point out your concern and seek to persuade the Australian people of your point of view. Ultimately the Australian people are the judge.


I also agree with Senator Waters—so there are two agreements in relation to one amendment; I am sure the senator is very surprised by that—that the Senate will be opposing this amendment, because the Greens are proposing an entirely arbitrary ban on eight different specific categories of businesses from giving donations. There are clear questions of constitutionality. Senator Waters dismisses this. Clearly Senator Waters doesn't believe in freedom of political communication, but some of us do believe in freedom of political communication.


A level of internal logic and consistency is also lacking. For example, under the Greens amendment, businesses manufacturing pharmaceuticals would be banned, but not those involved in distribution or sale of such products. If you are involved in the manufacture of tobacco you are banned, but if you are involved in the distribution of tobacco you are fine. Even more unusually, the proposed ban will put only donors at risk of criminal offences while keeping it lawful for a recipient to accept such a gift. That doesn't sound very internally consistent.


The more fundamental point is that, under our Constitution, under our principles, under the constitutional principle of implied political freedom of communication, the best advice that we have is that this would not be constitutionally sustainable. In any event, we have great confidence that the Australian people voting at elections are very capable of making judgements on what they think is right and wrong.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (17:55):  One Nation will be opposing this amendment put up by the Greens to state a case that donations shouldn't come from different organisations. I can understand what they are saying, but then again I find it very hypocritical because the Greens are quite happy to take their donations from environmental groups and organisations that are quite happy to see mining, which provides jobs in Australia, shut down. It actually brings in resources and royalties to our nation—a lot of money. And they are quite happy to shut down the fishing industry, with lost jobs again. And, of course, with their native vegetation management acts they are actually destroying Queensland's farming sector. In that case, they are quite happy to take their political donations—




Senator Hanson-Young:
  I have a point of order, Mr Temporary Chair. I would just like some clarification from Senator Hanson. It seems that she's misled the chamber. I am not aware of any donation given by an environmental organisation to my party—




The TEMPORARY CHAIR

Senator HANSON:

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (18:03):  I will move Australian Greens amendment (7) on sheet 8546 revised. But, before I do that, I flag that I will withdraw amendment (8) on sheet 8546. Coming to amendment (7), there has been a lot of talk here, particularly in relation to the last amendments, where only the Greens and a couple of our other colleagues voted to oppose donations from large corporate vested interests. Some of the earlier criticism was, 'You're singling out these people unfairly.' Folks, now is your chance! This amendment would say that all donations will be capped at $1,000 per year. We don't care who you are—absolutely everyone, whether you're an individual, a union or a business: no more donations of more than $1,000 a year. We genuinely want to clean up politics, and this is how you do it.


There is a small step forward in this bill that restricts some foreign donations. We think you can drive a truck through the loopholes. We want to fix those loopholes with an amendment just like this. Let's get big money out of politics. Let's put people back into the heart of decision-making. Now is your chance to show whether you actually want to fix this problem or whether you just want to look like you're doing something in the hope that this issue goes away. The community wants something done about this. There is widespread support for this amendment. Getting big money out of politics is the single most common issue raised with me as I move around the state and the country.




Senator Colbeck:
  Really?




Senator WATERS:
  Yes, really. Maybe you should do some more moving or perhaps do some more listening. This is the biggest issue that the community has. They feel disenfranchised by politics, they feel unheard and they feel like the parliament has been sold to the highest bidder. Well, it has. This is our chance to get our democracy back. The Greens are very proud to move this amendment to restrict donations to no more than $1,000 per year. I'm very interested to see how people vote. I hereby move Greens amendment (7) on sheet 8546 revised:


(7) Schedule 1, item 33, page 42 (before line 6), before section 302F, insert:




302EB Donations to political entities by donors other than restricted donors



(1) A person or entity (the donor) contravenes this subsection if:


(a) the donor is not a restricted donor; and


(b) the donor makes, in a financial year, gifts totalling more than the disclosure threshold to, or for the benefit of, a political entity.


Note: The physical elements of an offence against subsection (2) are set out in this subsection (see section 302R).




Offence



(2) A person or entity commits an offence if the person or entity contravenes subsection (1).


Penalty: 2 years imprisonment or 800 penalty units.


(3) Section 15 of the Criminal Code (extended geographical jurisdiction—category D) applies to an offence against subsection (2).

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2018-11-15,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:05):  The committee has already voted on the substance of the issue that Senator Waters is raising. Greens amendment (7) on sheet 8546 revised is in fact redundant, because it is a consequential amendment in relation to some previous amendments that the committee has already voted to reject. So it should, in fact, have been withdrawn because it can't actually have the effect that Senator Waters is advising the chamber it would have.


Even if this amendment were to apply in the context of the government's bill, it also introduces imprisonment for gifting over the disclosure threshold, which is explicitly contrary to what the cross-party Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which considered these matters carefully, recommended. So the Greens are proposing to introduce imprisonment offences. But, as I've indicated, this amendment is, in fact, redundant because it is consequential to some amendments that have already been rejected by the committee.


This amendment also lets political campaigners off the hook. Again, I'm not quite sure why the Greens political party takes the view that political campaigners spending substantial amounts of money on political campaigns in the lead-up to elections, seeking to influence election outcomes, should not be subject to the same disclosure, transparency and reporting requirements and the same ban on foreign political donations as other political actors, including political parties. The government's view is that they should apply on the same basis or a similar basis to all those actors.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and the Public Service, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (16:31):  In closing this second reading debate, I would like to thank all of those senators who have contributed to the debate so far in relation to the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Bill 2017. Australia, as I said earlier today, is one of the few Western democracies in which foreign donors can still influence domestic elections. The government's bill will ensure that our electoral system protects our national sovereignty. Most importantly, the bill will assure Australians that all political campaigning that targets Australian voters, be it election advertising, campaign phone calls or how-to-vote recommendations, is paid for by Australians. Foreign governments, foreign billionaires and foreign companies have no legitimate role in funding these activities to influence Australian politics.


I once again thank the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for their significant work on the topic of foreign political donations and on this bill over the course of the 45th Parliament. The government very much appreciates both the constructive approach and the goodwill demonstrated by all members of the committee and their sensible recommendations, which have played an integral part in informing the government's work on this topic, and the ultimate form of this bill.


The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters tabled two advisory reports on the bill, the first delivered in April 2018, which made 15 recommendations. The government responded positively to those recommendations by sharing draft amendments with the committee and inviting its further views on those proposed amendments. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters made 12 further recommendations in relation to those draft amendments, including supporting passage of the bill, subject to those final suggestions. The government has agreed to all of those recommendations and final amendments were circulated to senators at the end of October, reflecting a positive response to the last recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I will make some brief comments during the committee stage about some of the most significant government amendments that respond to recommendations from the joint standing committee.


Subsequent to those committee reports, the government has engaged in further constructive dialogue with the opposition and with stakeholders in the charitable sector. I again would like to place on record my appreciation for the constructive way in which the shadow special minister of state, Senator Farrell and his office have engaged with my team. A final suggestion that was raised in these discussions was for a post-implementation review in two years' time. The government is very happy to confirm that we support that proposal.


Given the extensive and cross-party work of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on the bill over the course of this parliament, it's the government's view that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is best placed to run this post-implementation review of the bill's operation. Accordingly, I put on the public record that, after passage of the bill, the government will initiate a referral to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, seeking that it review the bill in two years time. This review will take into account experience from the next election and ensure that the bill's objectives continue to be achieved in a way that minimises red tape. The review will include assessment of any impacts on issue based advocacy. And because the inquiry will need to occur in the next parliament, with a potentially different committee membership, we propose to make this referral by way of Senate motion rather than by way of referral in correspondence.


The reforms in this bill are important and are necessary to support the integrity of Australia's electoral system and Australia's sovereignty by ensuring that only those with a meaningful connection to Australia are able to fund Australian political activity. These reforms will ensure that the Commonwealth's electoral funding and disclosure regime keeps pace with international and domestic developments and provides transparency for Australian voters ahead of the next federal election.


Before I close, I also thank in particular Daniel Clode, senior adviser in my office, who's done an absolutely amazing body of work to help us get to this point. Once again, I thank senators for their contribution and commend the bill to the chamber. In doing so, I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator Farrell on sheet 8576 be agreed to.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (16:44):  As foreshadowed, I move my second reading amendment:


Leave out all words after ""that"", insert:


""the bill be withdrawn because the Senate is of the opinion that:


(a) the bill ignores corporate influence over politics and disproportionately targets the not-for-profit sector, which is an attack on public interest advocacy;


(b) the bill is likely to discourage charities from engaging in issue-based advocacy in furtherance of their charitable purposes, because of uncertainty in the definition of 'electoral matter';


(c) there is no public interest benefit to the proposed added layer of regulation for the charitable sector, because the existing regulatory framework for not-for-profit organisations under the Charities Act 2013 is sufficient to prevent charitable organisations from engaging in partisan political activities; and


(d) the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 should be amended to introduce caps on campaign expenditure by political parties, candidates and associated entities, which are indexed to inflation and subject to periodic review.""

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (18:54):  On 2 October, Jamal Khashoggi, a citizen of Saudi Arabia, walked into its Istanbul consulate to obtain a simple marriage document while his wife waited outside. What happened next has shocked the world. Khashoggi would never return. Six weeks later, we now know that he was murdered brutally in the consulate in what was a premeditated event. The details of his death have yet to be confirmed, but all reports agree that he was tortured and his body has yet to be located. Horrific rumours abound. We are living in extraordinary times. The norms and values that underpin international peace, security and prosperity are being eroded. As Bill Shorten said in his recent speech at the Lowy Institute:


The international order in which Australia has operated since the Second World War is being disrupted.


The effect of this disruption is becoming increasingly clear. Khashoggi's murder could only have been sanctioned by individuals who calculated their actions would be met with impunity. Indeed, in the immediate aftermath of the event, incorrect claims were made by Saudi officials that the consulate was sovereign, connoting immunity from prosecution and echoing nationalist rhetoric that has now unfortunately become an all-too-familiar excuse for abdicating moral and legal responsibility.


But international law is clear. Khashoggi's murder occurred on Turkish soil, and Turkish law applies. Of great concern, however, is the reason Khashoggi was targeted in the first place—for exercising the right to freedom of speech, a right guaranteed under every human rights treaty. Across the world, freedom of speech and, importantly, freedom of the press are deteriorating. Very few bright spots remain. According to Freedom House, only 13 per cent of the world's population enjoys a free press, and, as The Economist recently observed, it is becoming a luxury limited only to Western states. It is axiomatic that, in the absence of an unfettered press, democracy dies and corruption flourishes, and, right now, there are perhaps no regions more hostile to the transparent press than the Middle East and North Africa. Indeed, Freedom House observes that only Israel has something close to resembling a free press, while Iran and Syria are among the world's 10 most restrictive countries on press freedoms. Across the region, the Arab Spring brought freedom to very few countries. Tunisia is perhaps a stand-out. Australians watched with anger and despair in 2014 as one of our own very fine journalists, Peter Greste, along with his Al Jazeera colleagues, was arrested and jailed in Egypt. I acknowledge the efforts of our diplomats and the former foreign minister, Julie Bishop, in securing Peter's release.


Khashoggi's demise is the clearest example yet of the lengths to which some regimes will go to silence freedom of speech. Khashoggi was a veteran Saudi journalist and a former government adviser. After becoming critical of the government and seeing what was happening to his counterparts who expressed criticism, he fled to the United States and lived there in exile. He was a columnist at The Washington Post, writing, as its editorial page editor, Fred Hiatt, said, 'out of a sense of love for his country and deep faith in human dignity and freedom'. In what would become his final column, released posthumously, Khashoggi highlighted that the Arab world suffers from poverty, mismanagement and poor education. His articles pleaded for improvements in human rights, for peace in Yemen, for the end of political meddling and corruption across the Arab world, and for women's rights. These pleas of course are not confined to the Arab world. Human rights, democratic values and civil rights are being devalued worldwide. Recently, the United States withdrew altogether from the United Nations peak human rights body, the Human Rights Council. Even here in Australia we all are aware that more can be done to progress human rights.


But Khashoggi's murder has brought human rights back to the forefront of international relations. Condemnation from many in the international community has been swift, but it is only the starting point. Protecting and upholding human rights must be a priority. A United Nations investigation is necessary and those responsible for this heinous act must be brought to justice. That is why I am pleased to learn that Turkey has now called for an international investigation into the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. This was a level of treachery the world has been rightly shocked by. It involved extrajudicial torture, murder and forced disappearance.


Australia and the international community must be unequivocal that such brazen acts, indeed any derogation of human rights, will never, ever be tolerated.
