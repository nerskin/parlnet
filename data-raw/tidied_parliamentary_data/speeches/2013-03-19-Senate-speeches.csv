Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:32):  The opposition supports the Royal Commissions Amendment Bill 2010, which proposes two substantive amendments to the Royal Commissions Act 1902. The first amendment provides that, where a royal commission is constituted by more than one commissioner, its chair may authorise one or more members to hold a hearing. The present act requires evidence to be taken before all the commissioners or a quorum of them.


The second amendment proposes measures particular to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse which will permit persons directly or indirectly affected by child sexual abuse to provide information in a private session. Participation in a private session, which is not a commission hearing, would be voluntary. Such material will not be received on oath or affirmation and is not considered to be the giving of evidence to the commission. Any use of this material in a commission report must not identify individuals unless it is subsequently given in evidence to a commission hearing. However, documents and other material disclosed at a private session may be communicated to relevant officeholders, in particular the commissioner of a police force.


Mr Deputy President, the coalition supported the establishment of a royal commission into institutional child abuse; indeed, as I recall, Mr Abbott called for the establishment of such a royal commission even before it was announced, so this is an entirely bipartisan matter. The amendments relating to multimember royal commissions—and, as you know, there are several royal commissioners to whom commissions have been issued—will allow for the efficient distribution of work among commissioners in appropriate circumstances in what is, I am sorry to say, expected to be a very, very voluminous evidence-gathering task, given the evidently widespread prevalence of institutional abuse of children.


Might I also say that there is nothing particularly unusual in allowing evidence before a royal commission to be taken by one member of the royal commission when there is more than one person appointed to the commission. I remember from my own experience in Queensland in the 1980s the famous Fitzgerald inquiry operated on the basis that Mr Fitzgerald QC took most of the evidence but he appointed a deputy commissioner, Patsy Wolfe—now Her Honour Judge Wolfe, chairman of the Queensland District Court—as an associate commissioner and much of the evidence at the Fitzgerald inquiry was given not before Mr Fitzgerald but before Ms Wolfe. So there is nothing unusual in this. It is an appropriate measure. It is not limited or specific to the royal commission into institutional child sexual abuse, but it will apply in general hereafter to all Commonwealth royal commissions.


The measures peculiar to the current royal commission permit the taking of evidence from vulnerable or traumatised witnesses in a setting similar to that applicable for protected witnesses in criminal trials of sexual offenders. Because the evidence is not given on oath or affirmation and bearing in mind that the commission's purpose is to inquire, not to prosecute or to determine guilt or innocence, it is appropriate that restrictions are placed on the use of such information. 


The coalition has seen the government's amendments, which are circulated in the chamber, which relate to the documentary and archival treatment of material produced or arising from a private session, including relevant amendments to the Freedom of Information Act. These amendments seek to ensure as far as possible that private sessions are treated with appropriate sensitivity. Mr Deputy President, I am sure you will remember from your days as a police officer—and I remember from my days as a barrister once having to adduce evidence from a child complainant in a sexual abuse case—what a very difficult and sensitive task that is.


The coalition, as I have said, supports the establishment of the royal commission and the measures contained in the bill which will facilitate its efficient operation. It therefore has the coalition's wholehearted support.


Question agreed to.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Royal Commissions Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-03-19,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:39):  I will make a short comment, thank you, Mr Chairman. I am sorry I could not be here for the second reading stage of the bill, but I do support this bill. I think that announcing this royal commission will be a lasting legacy of this government. I congratulate the government for getting on with this. It is very important for those who have suffered to ensure that there is a process for the healing to begin, and I think that what the government has established here is welcome. I think that having multiple hearings is something that is very welcome. Those multiple hearings are in the sense that we have a number of commissioners and that there can be hearings held in a number of states, because if only one commissioner were hearing the evidence then we would be in a situation where this could go on and on for a number of years. I think the multiple commissioners will clearly expedite the work of this royal commission.


What I want to ask the minister in relation to this particular exemption is whether he could walk us through it briefly in terms of the privacy of practice sessions and the amendments that affect the Freedom of Information Act. How will this help facilitate the work of the royal commission, and what weight of evidence will there be for those private sessions? In other words, if evidence is given in a private session, what constraints will there be on the royal commission in referring to that publicly? If that information indicates an allegation of a criminal offence, will that information be forwarded as a matter of course to the authorities? I just want to understand in a constructive sense how it would work. If Senator Farrell, who as parliamentary secretary has the conduct of this, can give a brief explanation then that would be useful, I think, in the context of how the royal commission would work, because so far I have been encouraged by what the government has proposed in terms of the structures and the like but I think it is important to know, if it can be put into context, how the privacy of the private sessions will operate, what weight will be given to those and also how the Freedom of Information Act amendment will operate in the scheme of this particular amendment.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2013-03-19,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (12:42):  I thank Senator Xenophon for his question. My understanding is that the private sessions will allow the royal commission to hear personal accounts directly from people affected by the child sexual abuse in a less formal setting than a hearing. One of the outcomes of the public consultation on the terms of reference for the commission was the importance of putting in place processes sensitive to the needs of victims so that they could tell their stories to the commission. Hearing these personal accounts will be important to the commission so that it can develop its recommendations for institutional reforms, which I know you have a significant interest in. As is ordinarily the case in the conduct of a royal commission, issues relating to procedural fairness for the third parties named in evidence or information received will be a matter for the royal commission to determine, and I am advised that the royal commission intends to publish draft procedures and will be inviting comments on those draft procedures.


Some features of the private sessions are that they will serve to preserve not only the privacy of persons giving information at a private session but also the reputations of people referred to in information given at the private session. In particular, the sessions will not be open to the public. Information relating to a natural person could only be used in the report of the royal commission if the information is de-identified or if the information is also given in evidence to the commission or in response to a summons, and it will be an offence to use or disclose information obtained at a private session except in certain permitted circumstances.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-03-19,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:44):  I thank Senator Farrell for his answer on behalf of the government. Can I just confirm this—and I apologise if it is apparent in the explanatory memorandum and I have not seen this: if a person goes before a private session of the royal commission and they say, 'It is my wish to go public in respect of these allegations,' does the discretion lie with the commissioner about it being a private session? Further, in relation to the matter I raised earlier, if there appears on the face of it to be allegations of a criminal nature, will they be referred to the relevant authorities—to the police, for instance—for appropriate investigation?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Royal Commissions Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2013-03-19,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (12:45):  The short answer to that question, Senator Xenophon, is that they can be. I might make some reference here to some information I have. Under the existing section 6P of the Royal Commissions Act, the commission is able to communicate information it receives that relates or may relate to a contravention of the law to a range of specified authorities and persons, including the police. The commission is able to communicate this information where it considers it is appropriate to do so and for this purpose it is not a requirement that consent be obtained from the person who gave the information.


The bill enables the commission to communicate information it receives at a private session to authorities like the police under existing section 6P of the act where the commission considers that it is appropriate to do so. The Commonwealth letters patent directs the commissioners to consider the need to establish mechanisms to facilitate the timely communication of information in accordance with section 6P of the act, including, for example, for the purposes of enabling the timely investigation and prosecution of offences.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:46):  I have one final question in relation to this. Senator Farrell would well now, as a fellow South Australian, of the work of the Mullighan commission of inquiry into institutional abuse—into child abuse; something established by the former Rann government when now Premier Weatherill was the relevant minister. I think almost all South Australians would agree that that was a very worthy and good exercise by the late Ted Mullighan QC. My question is this: insofar as there have been other inquiries at a state level—and I note there is currently an inquiry or there has been a commission of inquiry through the New South Wales government in relation to allegations of abuse in a particular region of New South Wales— or even if it is at federal level, to what extent can the findings or the evidence or statements taken form a part of this inquiry, or will this particular commission start from the beginning and make its own inquiries? In other words, what capacity is there to take statements or findings from the Mullighan commission of inquiry, for instance, or other state commissions of inquiry in other states, in relation to this inquiry?

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (12:48):  Thank you for the question. As I say, I know you have taken a great deal of interest in this area of concern. Ultimately it is a matter for the royal commission; but, in terms of the federal government's approach to this matter, the government would encourage it to consider other inquiries. Obviously ultimately it is a decision for the royal commission to make a determination about, but the government would encourage consideration of other inquiries.

Senator BRANDIS

 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (14:00):  My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate representing the Prime Minister. I refer the minister to an interview by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr, with Leon Compton on ABC Radio in Hobart yesterday morning where the minister on two occasions, when asked specifically to do so, refused to support the government's proposed media reforms. I also refer the minister to reports this morning by the journalists Peter Hartcher and Mark Kenny that Senator Bob Carr has told people overseas that he has lost confidence in the Prime Minister and that the minister for aged care, Mr Mark Butler, has also lost confidence in the Prime Minister. Does the fact that two senior members of the cabinet refused to publicly express their confidence in the Prime Minister, and that one of the most senior ministers in the government, Senator Bob Carr, has said that that is because of the media package, inevitably mean that the Prime Minister presides over a divided and dysfunctional government?

Twenty-four hours to come up with a policy, talk about the National Broadband Network, talk even about media policy—at least for the last few days you have been on the media policy; you have actually been on policy. But, Mr President, those opposite are dredging the bottom of the barrel. We have already seen this morning a press conference—through you, Mr President, I draw your attention, Senator Brandis, to the press conference—that the foreign affairs minister held in New York or, I think, Washington. He is on his way to New York now. In Washington he came on the ABC and he said the report was completely untrue.

  I can draw you to the transcripts or we could possibly let you see it on iView—that is able to be seen on computers, Senator Heffernan; it is called IPTV. Senator Carr could not have been more categorical when he said, 'The journalists never even attempted to contact my office.' He had spoken to his office and they had never even attempted to contact the office, to paraphrase what Senator Carr said, but reasonably accurately. And we have seen this morning Mr Butler tweet that it is also untrue.


Those opposite have got no substance. They are policy free and they are stooping to the bottom of the barrel because they have no care for the vision for this country. They do not care about childcare workers. They do not care about textile workers. They do not care about transport workers.

  Mr President, on a point of order: it is hardly sleazy to ask whether the Prime Minister of Australia enjoys the confidence of her own caucus. The question was very simple: can the minister who does lead the government in this place give to the Senate a full and unequivocal assurance that the Prime Minister enjoys the confidence of all her ministers?

Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory—Minister Assisting for Industry and Innovation, Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Minister for Sport) (14:09):  The government made it clear, when the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship first announced the changes to the 457 visa system, that we are unapologetic in implementing changes to stop employers rorting the system. We know that unscrupulous practices by employers that are not enforceable under current rules have emerged: for example, the project administrator who is actually scaffolding on a building site. The protection of local workers' pay and conditions is a core Labor value that we have fought for over generations, and these protections apply regardless of your citizenship. We need fair workplaces for all workers irrespective of your passport.


That is why the government further announced that we are seeking to amend legislation to enable inspectors of the Fair Work Ombudsman to investigate whether a subclass 457 visa sponsor is meeting their sponsorship obligations. Currently in the Department of Immigration and Citizenship there are 34 inspectors appointed under the Migration Act to monitor compliance with sponsorship obligations. That is 34 inspectors looking at over 100,000 primary 457 visa holders in Australia at the moment. By enabling Fair Work Ombudsman inspectors to investigate compliance with the subclass 457 sponsorship obligations, we are significantly increasing the number of officers who can investigate sponsors and pursue complaints. This government supports the 457 visa system, but it does not support the integrity of the system being undermined by it becoming the low road to exploitation of workers and the undercutting of wages and conditions. It has an appropriate place where there are legitimate skill shortages and it is used in the way for which it was designed.

Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory—Minister Assisting for Industry and Innovation, Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Minister for Sport) (14:12):  We know there are genuine skill shortages in some sectors and in some regions in Australia, and overseas temporary skilled workers are needed to fill those gaps. But we do not and will never support employers exploiting loopholes to undermine the integrity of the 457 visa system. Let me be very clear: employers who use the 457 scheme as it was intended—to fill skill shortages—have nothing to fear from the announcement the government has made. There will be no additional compliance and no additional red tape. But the government is committed to stamping out exploitation of the system by those unscrupulous employers. When the 457 system is exploited all Australians, including permanent residents, migrants and refugees who are seeking work, are the ones that miss out. We are committed to sending a very clear message to those employers. (Time expired)

Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory—Minister Assisting for Industry and Innovation, Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Minister for Sport) (14:13):  I thank the senator for this question. This government is one that governs on the Labor values of protecting all workers. We need to be persistent as we face an opposition that chooses to campaign on fear rather than on fact. The minister for immigration was presented with clear facts that showed the 457 visa system was being rorted and, as a government, we acted on that evidence. Yesterday we put in place further protections for those on 457 visas to ensure those employers who wish to rort the system are caught. The opposition see the 457 visa system as they have described it: as a mainstay of immigration. This is not what subclass 457 visas were created for. They are not a mainstay of immigration; they are there to fill specific skill shortages for a specific period of time. (Time expired)

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:02):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to questions without notice asked by Senators Brandis, McKenzie, Smith and Birmingham today relating to proposed media legislation and to the National Broadband Network.


In The Castle there is a bloke called Steve who is an ideas man. That is why his dad calls him an ideas man. He has lots of ideas, like a motorcycle helmet with brake lights on it. Steve also has other ideas. Instead of a motorcycle helmet with brake lights on it, he can put underpants on his head. He is an ideas man. That is why we like ideas men. He has some great ideas.


Another idea of his was the NBN. Some of his best ideas have been in media policy. He is just an incredible ideas man. You have to understand that he is across it all. He has got it all worked out: 'It's the Constitution. It's the vibe. It's Mabo. It's the law.' It is the vibe—that is what it is all about. That is what the ideas man is all about.


We are so proud to have an ideas man like Senator Conroy. We are so lucky. Unfortunately, the ideas man is not very Apollonian in his ways. I always think of the ideas man as a little more Dionysian in how he goes about things. We are just trying to make sense of this absolutely chaotic state of the unconstructed. This ideas man has been coming up with some marvellous ideas of late. I want to go through a couple of them.


Removing the reach rules is a wonderful idea by the ideas man. We actually do have diversity in regional areas. We do have the capacity to inhibit centralisation. The ideas man has come up with the idea of basically removing the reach rules so that we can start having centralisation in the regional market.


His latest idea is a rather truncated idea. The idea he dropped on us on Thursday last week was new media laws and we have to vote for it—take it or leave it—by the next Thursday. On Monday we found out that some of the key players, such as Mr Kerry Stokes, do not have any idea what the ideas man is up to. He found out about it only on Monday. On Monday he found out that something that was instrumental to the media market was being devised by none other than his eminence, 'Mr Underpants on His Head', Senator Stephen Conroy.


What else have we got? Now the ideas man has a bit of a problem because his take-it-or-leave-it deal has turned into a 'I'll take anything to get it done' deal. We now find that they are desperately looking around for somebody who might agree with the ideas man. Where are we now? We are a couple of days away from when we find out whether the ideas man's idea is going to hit the deck. I think it will.


One of the greatest ideas of the ideas man is the public interest test. We have absolutely no idea what this is and neither did Senator Feeney last night when asked on Q&A: 'What is the public interest test?' It was so simple: 'It's the Constitution. It's Mabo. It's justice. It's the law. It's the vibe.' That is it—it is the vibe; that is what the public interest test is. Nobody has any idea what the ideas man has dreamt up with this one.


There is a sense that it is actually about censorship. I know why the Labor Party would be so worried. They feel that the media is so biased because the media has pulled them up on some of their great ideas like ceiling insulation when they set fire to 194 houses. That was a great idea! They had other ideas as well. They had the idea of building school halls to try to save us from the global financial crisis. They had the $900 cheques. They had computers for every schoolroom.


Another one of his great ideas is the NBN. That is another brilliant idea. It was an idea that he did on the back of an envelope. No cost-benefit analysis, just a marvellous idea that he took onto a plane with Mr Kevin Rudd, who then became the Prime Minister. And then they had the idea to remove him as the Prime Minister—that was obviously not a good idea—and now we think they might have another idea to move back to Mr Kevin Rudd. This is really chapter and verse of our own version of The Castle, because we have own Steve, our own Mr Ideas man. (Time expired)

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2013-03-19,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:07):  Senator Joyce, what a rhetorical load of—well, you know, the kind of—




Senator Johnston:
  Truth!




Senator Edwards:
  Truth!




Senator PRATT:
  Oh well, if you think that is the truth, then so be it. If you want to stand by the right of media organisations in this country to misrepresent citizens and to stand up for vested interests instead of the ordinary rights of citizens to have their privacy protected, then so be it. That seems to be the line in the sand that you have drawn, because we know that this debate is not about free speech, as those opposite would like to mislead the country; it is actually about them lining up with vested interests and media alignments.


The opposition not only misrepresented Minister Carr in their questions today; they are also doing a great discredit to what is an important need for reform in this country. There is no doubt that we need reform of media laws in this country because they are not working. They are simply not working and the Finkelstein report put that very, very firmly on the agenda. It is not doing justice to Australia's citizens.


Just today we have seen the United Kingdom go much further than Australia is proposing to go. We have seen good conservative government in the UK standing up for good citizens—people like the McCanns—who were terribly misrepresented. I can tell you that there are Australians who are misrepresented by Australian media and they deserve good process for the handling of complaints. Free speech is about standing up for diverse media voices in this country. You cannot have freedom of the press in this country if the media voices in this nation continue to consolidate in their ownership patterns. That spells trouble for free press and freedom of speech in this country.


Australia already has a highly consolidated media market, much more consolidated than comparable countries which value free press. This is an issue of critical concern. It is of critical concern so that we can have freedom of speech, freedom of press and a diversity of voices in this country. How can you have free speech without a diversity of voices? If we have media outlets that own two of the local TV stations and the daily newspaper, what of that kind of environment? What does that spell for free speech? I tell you: in my book, it spells disaster for free speech.


These media laws are also about free Australian voices. It is about getting our media outlets and our TV stations to deliver Australian content. The media are asking for the capacity to broadcast, for example, across the whole footprint of this country. Senator McKenzie's question went to this point, saying that we already have media diversity, because they are a threat to the local media voices. But if you listen to what citizens in this country actually want, you will hear that they want more content, they want access to the same content that the rest of the country has access to, they want to keep their local TV stations and they want to keep their local news. What is so unreasonable about that? There is nothing unreasonable about it. In this digital day and age where we are delivering more content via things like the NBN, we should be able to give our citizens the best of both worlds when we are delivering that content to them.


We also need a system that handles complaints properly. I feel very, very strongly about this. Why? Because people's reputations can be trashed on the front page of the paper. You will go through a long and complex complaints process, by which time your reputation has been damaged, only to find the apology is printed many, many, many pages back and many months later. There has to be a quicker turnaround than this. (Time expired)

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia) (15:12):  This is, undoubtedly, the most dysfunctional government we have ever seen, politically and administratively. It is more than a year ago that Mr Finkelstein did his report and provided the government with a path to media reform. The question must be asked by someone: what has this minister been doing for the last 12 months? What has he been doing? We know he has been doing a bit of skiing and other things. Is anybody surprised that when he pulled the pin on this grenade this was the result and that, when he sought to set up the public interest media commissar, there would be universal outrage? He seems the only one who is surprised. But I am sure that he is no orphan, because I think his Prime Minister is surprised. I look at Fairfax Media doing the reporting of yesterday's proceedings and they say:


Billionaire media mogul Kerry Stokes has accused the federal government of planning more oversight of the press than the Chinese government does as media moguls descended on Canberra to attack the media package. 


And further: 'Media executives were united in their opposition to the proposed Public Interest Media Advocate, labelling the power of the position as unprecedented, far-reaching and direct government interference of the press.' Mr Stokes, who set up the Shanghai Daily, said, 'We didn't have to go through this to do that.' Greg Hywood of Fairfax Media said that the public interest media commissar will have seriously dangerous consequences for good government. They are just two senior media commentators.


What on earth was this minister thinking when he introduced this stuff—seriously loopy stuff, seriously out there stuff, seriously politically dysfunctional stuff. But all of that is matched by the level and quality of leadership he is getting from his Prime Minister. There has never been an identification of the mischief. Why do we need this stuff? What is it all about? What is the legislation designed to cure or arrest? No-one seems to have any answer to this. I think it is actually criticism, because heaven only knows there has been enough criticism of this government on boats, with 34,000 people arriving since 2007. What a fiasco that has been. The mining resource rent tax—the tax that actually costs the taxpayers money—what a disaster, what a fiasco that has been. The carbon tax, the Malaysia solution, the East Timor solution—all of these are the creatures and children of this Prime Minister. We have Mr Graham Perrett conceding:


The Prime Minister's in more trouble than Indiana Jones.


And then we have an unnamed minister talking about a leadership move. He says, 'I can't see it not happening'. I think it is a logical, explained consequence of this crazy media reform at this time. It is an election year. You guys over there have really lost the plot. And this minister has tremendous form—why would you ride him into battle on this? He mucked up anti-siphoning, completely stuffed it up; his performance on NBN has been utterly hopeless; he tried to do an internet filter that was just laughed out of this chamber; and his interception of the Australia Network tender meant the whole thing cost the taxpayer probably $5 million or $10 million. He is one of the few ministers who can actually wear a medal for about $60 million of wasted cost in various tenders for the provision of internet services.


Ultimately, this dysfunctional government has to do something. This PM has got to go. She has got to go. I cannot see how this government can continue with this level of incompetence, but I am sure I will be surprised in the future.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2013-03-19,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:18):  I rise to make a contribution to this debate to take note of answers in question time. You have to say one thing: the opposition is consistent. They are consistent in deriding; they are consistently rubbishing and putting down our side of politics. That is fair enough; that is their job. But the facts are that interest rates are now three per cent compared with 6.75 per cent when the Liberals left office. That means for a $300,000 mortgage there is a saving of $5,000 per annum—$5,000 per annum that a family is saving on their mortgage. We have delivered schoolkids bonuses of $410 for primary school children and $820 for high school children. There are 3.2 million pensioners who are better off—$172 for singles and $182 for couples. These are just a couple of the basic things that the Labor Party has delivered, that this Gillard Labor government has delivered.


We see this impending storm, or this continual storm, about the media bills. As I said yesterday, I do know people who are concerned about the way the media conducts itself and, when they get it wrong, what redress there is for the ordinary citizen. There must be a redress for the ordinary citizen who has been maligned or put into an invidious position by the media. That is what is really at stake here. No-one wants to stop the press from writing truthfully and faithfully about what happens, no-one is worried about politics. We here are all well able to defend ourselves either under parliamentary privilege or we can sue for defamation—we can do any number of things. But the average citizen in the street, if they are taken apart by a media event, what is their redress? The answer is: they can go to the Press Council, they can complain to the principals of the newspapers. Mr Finkelstein gave evidence this morning in a committee, and he said there is probably room for improvement there. It is not the government that is saying there is room for improvement, it is the chair of the Australian Press Council who is saying there is room for improvement.


We have had a continual barrage from Senator Joyce. He rattles off that the BER is a waste of money. I have not experienced that. I have officiated at, I think, 18 or 20 BER ceremonies and each one has been a great community event, supported by the communities who support their schools. Each one that I have been to has been a resoundingly good use of public money in schools which have often been starved of capital investment, particularly in the electorate of Grey, which is one of the largest regional seats in Australia. I have not met a principal, a parent, a president of the governing council or a member of the community who has shared Senator Joyce's cynicism about the BER projects.


We have to touch on the NBN. We know that 73 per cent of Australians really support the NBN. We know it is a huge project. I cannot wait to get it past my house; I cannot wait to get the benefits of the NBN in my electorate office and also in my home. The opportunities that the NBN will provide are genuinely startling and will change the way we do any number of things, and most importantly could well improve the productivity of our nation.


I turn to the leadership speculation. We have had this speculation on and on and on. It is all designed, in my view, by those on the other side to draw attention away from the genuine achievements of this government. You cannot fudge the figures on interest rates: interest rates of around three per cent compared with 6.75 per cent when those opposite were last in office. On a $300,000 mortgage homeowners get savings of $5,000 per annum for their families. Those things you can eat. You can take them to the bank. People can clothe and feed their families with some of the savings delivered by this Labor government in one area alone—that is, in mortgage rates. That lot over there think they are the champions of delivering low mortgage rates. (Time expired)

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (15:23):  I too rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Conroy in relation to questions asked today in the area of his portfolio. Before I get to the communications and broadband portfolio I would like to comment on some things that Senator Gallacher said: 'The BER is a resoundingly good use of public money.' I find that quite an interesting comment. Maybe he would like to tell the people of Berry Bay in South Australia that it was a resoundingly good use of public money when they built their school shelter in a school that they moved out of about three months after it had been completed. The other thing Senator Gallaher said is he cannot wait to get the NBN 'past my house'. He referred to the electorate of Grey, which I assume he is a paired senator for, and that is fine for Senator Gallaher, who probably lives in the country. But what about the many people in Grey who will not be getting the NBN going past their houses?


I also draw attention to Senator Gallaher in relation to this constant suggestion that it is this side of the chamber, and only this side of the chamber, that is making any complaints in relation to the suite of media bills currently being debated. I have been sitting in the inquiries for the last two days and, apart from Mr Finkelstein, so far there has not been one person before us who has made any comment to suggest that they believe that this suite of bills is satisfactory. It seems odd that only the opposition is being castigated by the other side in relation to this.


The Australian media space is a highly regulated environment, and to a large extent that is a necessary thing. But it can only be regulated as long as it is regulated in a way that is beyond repute, is impartial, is transparent and so that it serves some benefit to society by being regulated. I would question the purpose of the increased regulation that is being proposed by this suite of bills and whether it is delivering much in the way of public benefit. This is probably not because there are no public benefits in there, but more because we do not seem to have terribly much information about the detail of what is being proposed. We have been given absolutely no time whatsoever in which to consider this suite of bills. I am afraid this does not give me a great deal of confidence.


Senator Pratt today alleged that the question about these bills showed that we support the misrepresentation of Australian citizens. I contest that by drawing this chamber's attention to the report published this morning on the website of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Human Rights. This committee published some findings on its investigation into these bills. Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guarantees the right of citizens to participate in government through their elected representatives. This committee has suggested that this suite of bills has been pushed through with such extraordinary haste that we are breaching our human rights obligations to give the citizens of Australia the opportunity, through their elected representatives, to participate in this process.


The news media diversity reforms create a number of offences and civil penalty provisions. It is proposed that these offences are ones of strict liability. Once again, we talk about the human rights implications of this in that it says that strict liability offences allow for the imposition of criminal liability without the need to prove fault, and so engage and limit the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. Once again we have a human right that is being questioned by the method of implementation of this suite of bills.


The Public Interest Media Advocate Bill seeks further to corrupt basic human rights in the right not to incriminate oneself through the public interest media advocate's power to compel somebody to give information. Here we have a situation where a whole series of threats is being imposed on our human rights through threats to freedom of expression, threats to freedom of association, threats to freedom of speech, threats to the fundamental right to be innocent until proven guilty and threats to the freedom not to incriminate oneself. They are all potential threats to human rights encompassed in this suite of bills. (Time expired)

In fact, it is supported by the contractors in Tasmania—they want the same answers.

 (Victoria) (15:37):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill.


Leave granted.




Senator MADIGAN:
  I table the explanatory memorandum and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The purpose of this Bill is to remove Medicare funding from the abhorrent practice of abortion for sex selection. This practice has, for many years, attracted the attention of the international community to the tendency in many cultures to prefer a boy child over a girl child. Such a practice is prevalent in some cultures in particular where there is a cost burden associated with female children and where family size is forcibly restricted by a one-child policy. The enormity of this concern had been the subject of many discussions at the United Nations where five key agencies have joined in condemning the practice: Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR), the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) and the World Health Organization (WHO).


To suggest that this situation is confined to Asian or South East Asian countries is either naïve or deliberately ignores the fact that this practice occurs in Australia and not only within migrant communities. There are documented cases of sex selection abortion in Australia not only for a preferred male child but for 'family-balancing'.


In the weeks since I announced by intention to move this Bill I have had contact from surprising people. I have had doctors offer evidence of this situation from within their own practice. Some of these doctors are pursuing the issue within their professional association, others lament that there is no recourse under present State laws to prevent abortion for sex selection. It is not illegal to have an abortion on the basis of the sex of the foetus. The law does not require women to give a reason for abortion.


Interestingly, it is illegal for couples to select the sex of the child when undergoing IVF—except for some medical circumstances. It is, however, common for sex-selection for 'family-balancing' to be requested by IVF patients. So far this has not received ethical approval anywhere in Australia, but there are many documented cases of Australian couples travelling overseas for IVF so that they may select the sex of their child. Again, I have evidence that requests for sex-selection to IVF ethics boards are growing, and many are concerned that these same couples may be resorting to sex selection abortion when their requests are denied.


It is obscene and offensive to suggest that the gender of a child can be its death sentence; that we select our own children on the basis of gender. As Australian families have shrunk, the pressure to have one of each has increased. Children are no longer a unique gift in themselves but are increasingly expected to conform to designer standards. Accessories to complete our chosen lifestyle—just check out the latest pregnancy magazines on your newsstand. 


The problem of sex-selection abortion has been the subject of serious and on-going discussion amongst doctors in Canada, the United States and in the United Kingdom. The American Association of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists takes the issue seriously. The Canadian Medical Journal has carried numerous articles over the last twelve months discussing the best methods for controlling the problem. 


To suggest that it does not happen in Australia, as some of my colleagues in this place have done, is an exercise in deliberate avoidance of the issue or to have some bizarre view that Australians are morally superior to the rest of humanity.


Sex-selection abortions do happen in this country. That they happen is of deep moral abhorrence. It is something we should not tolerate under any circumstances. That a child will be destroyed if it is not of the desired gender is obscene. In an era when we claim equality for women and men, it is even more scandalous. Human beings are valued for their dignity as human persons. If having a boy to 'carry on the family name' is out-moded then so too should we shun the pressure for our children to be complementary book-ends. Sex-selection abortion is a further means of entrenching sexual prejudice and devaluing the human person.


This Bill aims to remove any government sanction to these abhorrent practices of abortion for sex selection.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2013-03-19,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:58):  Northern Australia constitutes something like three million square kilometres. It has approximately one million people, of which I am very proud to say that I am one. Two other people from our side are joining me in this debate today: Senator Eggleston, who has spent most of his life in Northern Australia and is an expert on the north of Western Australia and Northern Australia generally, as a very distinguished former mayor of Port Hedland; and Senator Bill Heffernan who, whilst he does not live in Northern Australia, could well do and indeed knows more about Northern Australia than practically anyone else in this chamber, through, amongst other things, his very successful and very visionary leadership of the Northern Australian Land and Water Taskforce set up by the Howard government.


Out of Northern Australia comes some $96 billion worth of exports via seaports, and that constitutes about 54 per cent of Australia's total. More than 636 million tonnes is exported from seaports in Northern Australia, and that represents some 74 per cent of the national exports via seaports.


 


And what are the big exports from Northern Australia? They are minerals and beef cattle. Have a look at what Labor has done to the minerals industry and the beef cattle industry, two industries significant in Northern Australia brought to their knees by the actions of the Gillard and Rudd Labor government. The imposition of a mining tax does more to chase away investment that is so needed in Northern Australia to unlock the wealth that is there.




Senator Sterle:
  Rubbish! You are a liar. What a load of crap!




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Order! Senator Sterle.




Senator Heffernan:
  Could I plead with Senator Sterle. He can talk like that to me, but he cannot go around calling someone in the chamber a liar. 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Resume your seat, Senator Heffernan. Senator Sterle, I will caution you about your language. It is inappropriate in the Senate and I would ask you to withdraw your imputation and your reflection on Senator Macdonald.




Senator Sterle:
  Being a liar, okay, I withdraw that, Mr Acting Deputy President, for now.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It simply shows Labor's approach to Northern Australia. Here they are, setting out to destroy the industry that comes from Northern Australia that contributes so much to Australia, and what do you get from the Labor Party: name-calling, childish, bully schoolyard actions of calling people names. Names do not worry me at all, I have to say, Senator Sterle. Go your hardest! It will not alter the fact. Ask anyone in the minerals exploration industry or in the mining industry—things are being placed on hold. The only reason that there is a slight confidence in the minerals industry is that most international miners can read the opinion polls the same as Australians can, and they are hoping with bated breath that there will be a change of government later in this year. Why? Because we will get rid of the minerals tax that does so much damage to Northern Australia but, on the other side, raises no money for the Australian people. Only Labor could do that, but the thought, the sovereign risk threat of this and other initiatives, like the carbon tax, all show impacts on costs of living particularly in Northern Australia.


Let us move on to beef cattle. Here we had a very successful industry in Northern Australia. Northern beef cattle are not quite the quality of southern beef cattle, but they had found a niche market. There was a very significant trade to Indonesia from Northern Australia. It was booming. It was increasing. People had invested a lot in it. And what happened? The Labor government came along and, without even 24 hours notice either to the industry or to the Indonesians who relied on that food, they banned the export of cattle to Indonesia. So through a couple of actions, the Labor government has clearly imposed upon Northern Australia initiatives which will not help with the development. 


That is what this discussion today is all about. There is no plan by the Labor government about the north. Indeed, I refer senators to the estimates of 12 February 2013 when a Labor senator was silly enough to ask some officials about the Labor Party's plans for Northern Australia. I urge people to have a look at pages 104-106. Do you know what it is all about? There is a strategy about this, a committee about that, a forum about something else, an investigation about something. Nowhere in those three pages is there any action. In fact there is very little money, and the little money that was put forward, is all for more studies, more forums, more meetings, more gatherings, more talkfests—but no action. 


I am pleased to say that after years—decades—of dillydallying by Labor governments both at Queensland and federal levels, the new Campbell Newman government came into power and within six months was actually allocating water out of the Flinders River. They were doing things that Labor governments state and federal had talked about for decades. Labor across the board will have more investigations, more studies, more analyses, more forums, more talkfests—but no action whatsoever. By contrast, the coalition will have a plan for Northern Australia, and that plan is in the final stages of its release. It relies on and pays tribute to the natural and people assets of Northern Australia. It actually builds upon those natural assets. 


Most irrigated agriculture in Australia of course occurs around the Murray-Darling Basin in southern Australia, but regions in Northern Australia record almost twice as much as their average annual rainfall. This rainfall could be put to more productive use without compromising the environment. The surface rainfall in Northern Australia is almost 152,000 gigalitres, of which currently only six per cent is used. To put that in perspective, I indicate that the total water use is about 12,200 gigalitres in Northern Australia and the run-off is 152,000 gigalitres. So there are clearly opportunities there.


But it just does not go to producing food and finding and exporting more minerals—and processing, I might say, more minerals. In Northern Australia we have a particular advantage because of our proximity to Asia. We have a very skilled workforce. We have some of the best universities in the world and, certainly, universities in the tropical part of the world, that lead the way in many areas of science. We have an expertise in health and research, and not just research into human health but also into animal health and into our natural biodiversity that is world class. Bearing in mind that more than a third of the world is in tropical areas, these assets should be more productively used.


These are just some of the advantages that we have in Northern Australia which under Labor have been ignored or, worse still, seriously undermined by taxes on the mining industry and practical destruction of the Northern beef cattle industry. I can understand why Labor is not interested. There are not many members of parliament up there—eight in the upper house, of which I am proud to say nearly all are members of the Liberal or National parties. There are only a couple of senators—Senator Scullion is one from the coalition. There are not many voices up there, but, for the coalition, this is not about votes. It is not about political popularity. It is about doing things for Australia that can be done on the basis of the natural assets and people assets of the North.


As with so many other things, the Labor Party has no plan. They work from day-to-day. They make promises that they think will be useful and then break them with impunity. They have no interest in Northern Australia. They know there are few votes there for them. I and all of us in Northern Australia look forward to the day we have a government that takes a real interest in the sustainable development of the North.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2013-03-19,"



Senator CROSSIN
 (Northern Territory) (16:08):  It is not often in this place that you can walk in and get a basketball lobbed right through the middle of the net for those of us who come from Northern Australia. When I saw the MPI today, I thought: 'Wow, an opportunity for my colleagues such as Senator Sterle and Senator McLucas to talk about what is happening in Northern Australia—bring it on!' If there is one great story that we have to talk about over the last five years of the Labor government, it is about the financial investment, the hard work that has been put in by ministers in this government and the absolute spotlight that has been put on Northern Australia in this country. I only have about nine minutes left so I am going to have to hand it over to my colleagues to continue this, but there are so many terrific things happening up there. I will try to go through some of them. I will concentrate on what is happening in the Northern Territory.


I do not want to criticise your contribution, Senator Macdonald. I know you probably spend most of your time gazing at the ocean from the east coast of Queensland, but when you actually jump across the border into the Northern Territory and you have a look at the concentrated effort that has gone into building the Northern Territory, its natural resources, its education hubs, its medical hubs, its infrastructure and its support for diverse industries, I think the work that has gone on in the last five years has been absolutely spectacular.


There are a number of particular ministers to whom this credit is owed: Nicola Roxon, Minister Ferguson and Simon Crean. I start with Simon Crean. When the former Howard government came into power they abolished the Office of Northern Development. When we came into power in 2007, we re-established that—a one-stop-shop so that northern development and Northern Australia could get back on its feet again and have a place where it could go for advice, for support, for ideas and for innovation. So in 2008 we established the Office of Northern Australia. It has been able to provide a focus on sustainable economic development in Northern Australia. As a result of that, $6 million has gone into the Northern Australia Sustainable Futures program, which was announced in August 2010 to address key challenges in the development of the North.


Out of that we have the establishment of the Northern Australia Ministerial Forum, which has now met five times. It has included ministers from conservative governments in Queensland and WA, the previous Labor government in the Northern Territory and now the Country Liberals. It has met in Darwin, Port Hedland, Mt Isa, Alice Springs and Kununurra and is due to meet again in Cairns. Out of that we have experts groups like the Northern Australia Indigenous Experts Forum on Sustainable Economic Development, chaired and led by Pat Dodson and Peter Yu. What is it doing? It is bringing together Indigenous experts from across the North. It has drafted a framework for Indigenous participation in Northern economic development based around the theme of 'resilient communities through reliable prosperity'.


There is also the expert advisory panel—a panel of experts who have knowledge in the industry and in the habitat of what is happening in Northern Australia. The panel consists of 30 academic and industry experts coordinated by Dr Andrew Johnson from the CSIRO. What is it doing? It is looking at opportunities and challenges in emerging markets for carbon. Out of that we have the Aboriginal Carbon Fund, which has been established in Alice Springs under the umbrella of the Central Land Council, which is moving ahead in leaps and bounds in providing alternative industry for Indigenous people in respect of carbon pricing, carbon marketing and the emerging market that we see under climate change.


That is what is happening in terms of actually getting together some expert advice, looking at what needs to be done in Northern Australia and capitalising on Indigenous knowledge and Indigenous expertise to see how Northern Australia can work side by side with Indigenous people and make use of their knowledge and expertise to provide some decent economic development and outcomes for these people.


If we have a look at what else has happened in the North, there is the Ichthys LNG Project. This has got to be one of the most substantial outcomes in terms of the future of this country, let alone the Northern Territory. This is a $34 billion gas plant and project that will be based in Darwin and harvest gas off the coast of Western Australia. It is the second largest industrial program to have ever been signed up to in this country.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  What did the Gillard government have to do with that?




Senator CROSSIN:
  I will take that interjection, Senator Macdonald. You say, 'What did the Gillard government or the Rudd government do to secure this? I put it to you that I know personally that Minister Martin Ferguson and his department worked day-in and day-out. They undertook many trips to Japan and had many discussions convincing this operator based in Tokyo that it should in fact, first of all, look at Australia and look at Darwin in which to base this gas hub. This is of enormous benefit to Northern Australian. It was a major project that was facilitated through the Department of Infrastructure and Transport and through Minister Ferguson's department. Undeniably a lot of hard work went into this project in order to get it to go ahead.


The Ichthys major project facilitation status was granted by this government. Let us not underestimate this. We are talking about a $34 billion infrastructure and export market in relation to gas here. We are talking about the employment of more than 3,000 people. We are already talking about 700 people being employed during the operation phase of this and additional jobs being created during the offshore construction. Already JKC have a shopfront established in Darwin Mall. They are recruiting people right now to try and get the workers village built and established in rural Darwin, and from there the major LNG plant will be established. That is what this government has done for Northern Australia. It has secured the second largest ever infrastructure in gas and gas hub in this country. That is what we have been doing.


Hand in hand with that, we have worked with the INPEX project to encourage Larrakia Development Corporation to get on board with the local Indigenous people. This is not just about a Japanese company coming to Darwin and setting up and creating jobs for 3,000 people. This is also about the work that has gone on behind the scenes ensuring that INPEX and the Japanese consortium provide employment opportunities for Indigenous people. It does not happen without a plan, it does not happen without a vision and it does not happen without hard work either.


The other thing I want to talk about quickly is the infrastructure that we have put in places like Darwin to grow and create our own doctors. The Flinders Medical School has been established at Charles Darwin University. Last year, for the first time ever, this government purpose-built a facility so that people in Northern Australia and particularly in the Northern Territory could train in Darwin to become doctors. We know that if you train in Darwin to become a doctor you are highly likely to stay in Darwin and undertake your work there as a doctor. We have put a lot of effort and emphasis into training and recruiting our own so that the number of doctors we have in Northern Australia increases because we are training them locally.


Finally, I just want to talk about our plan to put more health infrastructure in Darwin and Palmerston and our commitment to build a $70 million hospital in Palmerston, in one of this country's fastest-growing cities. Even today in the NT News we have a headline 'Plan to move Royal Darwin' about the CLP and the hospital. They plan not to replace it but to knock it down and to try and build a new one out in Palmerston. Such foolishness shows to me that the Liberal Party and the Country Liberal Party have really no vision for the growth and the expectations of the people in Darwin and Palmerston. If you think you can simply relocate the Royal Darwin Hospital, move it out of the infrastructure and the grounds that it is on, move it away from the oncology unit, move it away from the private hospital and try and create some megastructure in 10 years at $3 billion cost, you have no plan.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2013-03-19,"



Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (16:18):  As Senator Macdonald says, I have spent a long time in the north. I went to live in Port Hedland in 1974, which is a while ago, so I do have some experience of the north and the issues that it faces. I must say that never before have the circumstances been so opportune as to warrant the serious promotion of and support for sustainable growth across Northern Australia. But, sadly, the Gillard government is not capitalising on these opportunities.


The vast region north of the Tropic of Capricorn covers almost three million square kilometres and is Australia's gateway to the Asia-Pacific century. This government is simply not grasping at the opportunities that it represents to be taken up and exploited. In fact, the Gillard government is absolutely no friend of regional Australia or of Northern Australia. If it were it would not have closed down the live cattle industry, which is so very vital to the economy of all three northern jurisdictions: the Northern Territory, North Queensland and the north of Western Australia. The live cattle industry, as we all remember, was closed down overnight in response to a single television program which, it seems, exaggerated a situation. There is no doubt that the closing down of the cattle industry which followed the banning of live cattle exports to Indonesia has had a devastating effect on both northern families and our international reputation.


But the real importance of the North and its potential in agriculture at least is that the north of Australia could be the food bowl of Asia. That is a great opportunity that should not be missed.



Senator McLucas interjecting—




Senator EGGLESTON:
  I see Senator McLucas shaking her head which is what I would expect, sadly, from a person from a government that has no vision.


Some 60 per cent of Australia's rain falls north of the Tropic of Capricorn and this means that the north, as I said, has the potential to become a vast food bowl for the Asian region. Asia is just over the horizon from the north of Australia. Port Hedland is closer to Denpasar than it is to Perth; from Broome it is even closer and from Kununurra, where there is a great deal of irrigated agriculture, the hop over the horizon to Jakarta or Singapore to sell horticulture freighted in by air is not very hard to see as a great opportunity for future development.


Although we have 60 per cent of Australia's rainfall in the north, we capitalise on less than two per cent of it. The iconic Ord River scheme in my home state of Western Australia—set up, I must say, by the Menzies government back in the 1960s—is a great example of what can be done in the north of Australia. Already, in Kununurra there is a plan to extend the Ord River irrigation area into the Northern Territory, and they plan to grow sugar there which will be exported to Asia. It is a very, very important precedent, which could be followed in other areas around the north of Australia. The CSIRO has concluded that five to 17 million hectares across northern Australia are potentially suitable for a variety of agricultural purposes on account of arable soil. And yet this government is doing almost nothing to capitalise on that potential.


The Northern Australian Land and Water Taskforce, set up by the previous coalition government, was designed to explore the opportunities in the north. Both Senators MacDonald and, I think, Heffernan were on that. This process, however, was nobbled by the Rudd government; it was restricted in its scope and is shaped by the ALP government by influences which were not supportive of further growth in the north of Australia. For instance, it was not asked to look at opportunities for new surface water storages. In addition, the recent National Food Plan, released by Senator Ludwig, was a document devoid of any real vision, and ignorant of the potential of the north. It is little wonder that it sank without trace.


Australia has remained a net food exporter for well over a century, producing enough food currently to feed 60 million people, and our agricultural technology, moreover, helps feed some 400 million people. One simple statistic which is very important to the north of Australia is that the OECD report The emerging middle class in developing countries sets out in stark terms the economic potential that lies ahead for Australia and Asia. It shows the extraordinary projected growth of the middle class in Asia and the Pacific. In 2009, the region accounted for 28 per cent of the global middle class, or 525 million people. By 2030 that figure is expected to increase by 66 per cent to an incredible 3.2 billion people. Europe will be a distant second, with 14 per cent of the world's population.


Over this same period, the middle class in Asia is expected to have a surge in spending power from $4.9 billion currently to $32.5 billion by 2030. By 2020, more than half the world's middle class will be in Asia, and Asian consumers will account for 40 per cent of the global middle class. These people will need to be fed, and northern Australia has the opportunity of providing food to these people.


Senator Macdonald and others have talked about the mining industry, which is also very important in the north of Australia, and one has to say that the Gillard government's mining and resources rent tax, which has increased Australia's sovereign risk, is certainly not doing anything to encourage development in northern Australia and to provide jobs for the local people.


Senator Crossin has talked about Indigenous people, and of course the Indigenous people of the north are probably the poorest of the Indigenous people in Australia. Many of them live on stations and outstations. They lack education, they have health problems which need to be addressed and they often have a sense of despair about the future that lies ahead of them. What we need to do is create jobs for them in the mining industry and in agriculture. But if they had to rely on the Gillard government to provide jobs in these sectors then nothing would change for them, because under the Gillard government, and the ALP in general, nothing is going to be done to promote agriculture or to promote mining in the north.


One of the great opportunities which also exists in the north is tourism. Tourists from around the world come to areas which are different, and the part of Australia that is different is the north of Australia—from northern Queensland and the Barrier Reef through to the Northern Territory and the Red Centre and on into the Kimberley, with the Bungle Bungles, down into the Pilbara with the Wittenoom area and the gorges there, to Exmouth and the Ningaloo Reef. There is great potential for tourist development. There has not been a word from the ALP about setting up a task force to promote tourist development in the north, simply because I think they lack the imagination to see that great potential.


The north is a land of enormous potential. There are great prospects there in agriculture, great prospects in mining and great prospects in tourism; and there is a great need to improve the lot of the Aboriginal people. None of this is going to be happening under the Gillard government because they simply do not have the vision to see the potential which the north offers.

Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (16:29):  I really do look forward to contributing to this debate today on the MPI. When I saw it on the Notice Paper this morning, I thought it was a joke. I thought it could not be possible that the Liberals would gift us this fantastic opportunity to talk about what great stuff we have done in the north. But before I do, I want to talk about being called to apologise because I called Senator Macdonald a few things, which I retracted in this chamber. It did hurt me to have to retract them because I still stand by them. I will have a fight with anyone in here on any issue—hang on, I probably should not say 'have a fight' or I will get sooks from the House of Representatives, like Dennis Jensen, saying I am threatening to bop them. I should say that I am happy to have a debate.


One thing I cannot cop and will not cop is senators on that side blatantly telling lies. That happened earlier today at the start of this conversation. When I hear Liberal senators—look, this is cruelty to dumb animals; it really is having to listen to some of the fibs coming out here—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Edwards
):  Order, Senator Sterle!




Senator STERLE:
  and I am not talking about people in the chamber; I am talking about myself—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Sterle, you will have to withdraw that imputation.




Senator STERLE:
  Which one—the 'dumb animals'? I was talking about myself.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  If you could do all of them, that would be good.




Senator STERLE:
  I will. I withdraw them. Let us get back to the fibs or the nontruths that are being told in this chamber. I hear Liberal senators carry on about the poor mining industry that is going to be shackled and not invest in mines in Australia because if they dare get $75 million of profit they may have to pay the minerals resource rent tax. What a load of bollocks! If that is incorrect parliamentary language, I withdraw that. What a load of rubbish to whinge and carp because they may have to pay a tax after they earn $75 million of profit.


Let us get back to what we should be debating. We should be debating the truth. I will debate the truth, unlike some on that side—and one of them is still in the chamber. Before I do talk about the great stuff that the Gillard Labor government has done in the north I want to take this opportunity to congratulate a very good friend of mine Josie Farrer. Josie is a very highly regarded Gidja woman from Halls Creek. Josie was a very well respected shire president. Josie won the seat of Kimberley in the last state election. It is fantastic to see an Aboriginal woman being replaced by another Aboriginal woman in the Kimberley. It was tight for a while there. Have no doubt, there was a four-way contest. In the end Josie had a resounding victory. So all good to Josie and all good to the Aboriginal people in the Kimberley.


This gift from Senator Fifield is about the north, but I want to talk about the Kimberley. I want to talk about the East Kimberley Development Package that was negotiated between the federal government under the leadership of the Hon. Gary Gray as the parliamentary secretary for northern Australia and the Hon. Brendon Grylls, who is a member of the National Party, in his role as regional development minister in the Barnett government. The federal government tipped in some $195 million and the state government tipped in some $221 million I think. Let us have a look at what it has delivered to the Kimberley.


I have the greatest respect for Senator Eggleston. Sometimes Senator Eggleston can wander off a little bit on some of the mistruths about the mining industry and how bad they are going to go if they have to pay a tax on their profits, but I will forgive Senator Eggleston because he is, was and should be highly regarded in the Pilbara. As I have said before, Senator Eggleston and I have a lot in common: he used to deliver babies to the Pilbara and I used to deliver furniture, but no-one ever congratulated me!


Let us look at this $195 million package. It delivered $54 million to the Kimberley for health. I want to let the Senate know of some of the things that were delivered under this fantastic package. There was $20.5 million for the Kununurra hospital expansion. There was $3.4 million for the refurbishment of the Wyndham health facilities. There was $5.1 million for the short-stay patient accommodation in Kununurra. The residential rehabilitation facility in Wyndham got $3.2 million. There was $4.5 million for remote aged-care services. Then there were a few remote clinics in Kalumburu and Warmun. If you do not know the Kimberley, Warmun is on the blacktop, but Kalumburu, goodness me, is not. That is a fantastic achievement right up the top there. There were environmental health measures in Kalumburu and Warmun as well. It has also delivered health service provider housing in Kununurra to the tune of $6.8 million. That is a fantastic initiative.


For education and training $64 million was delivered. What did it build? It built the Wyndham Early Learning Activities Centre. That is fantastic. It built the Warmun Early Learning Centre. There were Kununurra school precinct upgrades and expansions—to the primary school, the high school, the community library and teacher training—to the value of no less than $48.9 million. While we are on education, there was the Kimberley TAFE upgrades in Kununurra and Wyndham of another $10 million.


Then we go to housing. There are those of us who have an interest in remote and rural Australia and achieving everything we can to close the gap in Indigenous communities. Under this program there was $46 million for housing. There was social housing in Kununurra and Wyndham and there was transitional housing in Kununurra to the value of $46 million. I had the pleasure of accompanying Mr Ian Trust from the Wunan Foundation. Mr Ian Trust is a wonderful human being. Ian is also a Gidja man. Ian heads up the Wunan Foundation. Part of their dream is to provide transitional housing for Aboriginal people. He proudly took me around and showed me the transitional housing project and we met and talked with young people and working couples in Kununurra and Aboriginal people who for the first time in their life actually have a house, somewhere they can call home. It is a magnificent achievement and a fantastic outcome from a very good project under the Gillard government.


In transport some $15 million has been spent. I know under the guidance and leadership of Senator Heffernan the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee will be in the Kimberley in a couple of weeks time. We will be proudly showcasing the Kimberley and the improvements that have been achieved because of the federal government and the state government working cohesively together. There has also been $16 million of community spending for sports facilities, swimming pools and art centres. This is wonderful stuff.


I am not the only one who thinks that the East Kimberley Development Package is a fantastic thing. Mr Brendon Grylls was the regional development minister in the Barnett Liberal government. I do not know Brendon enough to share a couple of beers and have a few bets on a Saturday with him, but I have met Brendon on a number of occasions and I can say is that he is committed to rural and regional Australia, particularly the north. Mr Grylss made these remarks at the opening of the new Ochre Health Centre in Kununurra on 22 November 2012, and he was with our federal regional development minister, Simon Crean. I know Simon has a passion for the north, being the Pilbara and the Kimberley. How do I know? Because he came up with me on no less than two occasions in the last six months. He has had a commitment to the Kimberley and the Pilbara for many years. This is what Mr Grylls goes on to say—it is part of his speech and I am quoting him:


Politics is sometimes tough but this should be a huge celebration for the Federal Labor Government to have come to your community and essentially rebuilt it.


Mr Grylls also goes on to say:


And thank you, Simon. Please pass that on to Prime Minister Gillard. Please acknowledge former Prime Minister Rudd when you next see him. This is a spectacular achievement of a partnership between the Federal government and the State government and local traditional owners and the local community.


I concur with him. And further:


We—


that is, the state and federal governments—


closely engaged the traditional owners and working with them closely to understand their needs, celebrated their culture, made them part of the process and listened to the local community about the sorts of needs and aspirations they have for the future so, Simon, I'm almost speechless.


Well done, Brendon. I agree. So there you go. We have wild accusations in this chamber that are unfounded, but we have Liberal and National counterparts in Western Australia doing everything that they can to stand beside the federal government—and so they should—to acknowledge the fantastic opportunity the Kimberley was given under a federal Labor government. But that is not the end of it. What happens from here? I was reading The West Australiantoday, and I note that sources have downplayed speculation that Nationals leader, Brendon Grylls, will lose regional development but the Nationals may— (Time expired)

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2013-03-19,"



Senator HEFFERNAN
 (New South Wales) (16:39):  I rise to speak on this MPI. I was fascinated by Senator McLucas's remarks that Northern Australia does not have much agricultural potential. She was shaking her head when Senator Eggleston was referring to the food bowl. She obviously does not know what she is talking about but is also ignoring the facts. Since the Northern Development Task Force changed hands, from the coalition government to the Labor government, they have shut it down. They have found a whole lot of people who can find reasons why we should not develop Northern Australia for agriculture.


I would like to focus on agriculture against the background of what the world faces in the next 50 years—and Mr Acting Deputy President Edwards, you are aware of that because you are on the committee—that is, the doubling of the food task by 2050. Places like China will have to feed half of its population, estimated, barring a human catastrophe, to be two billion people by 2070, from somewhere else other than China. Of course, there is the consideration by the wider public in Australia that agriculture is somehow a mature industry and that we should rest on our laurels, think of the past and retire to the coast. I do not think so. An incoming coalition government will take a completely different attitude, with fire in the belly—firstly, from the people themselves and people like Senator Eggleston and Senator Macdonald—to find ways to get things done.


The challenge for the world is doubling the food task by 2050, in a world that is going to see 30 per cent of the productive land of Asia go out of production, while two-thirds of the world's population live there. The land that we are talking about is closer to two-thirds of the world's population than that of Sydney, but it is Australia. We should be giving hope to the next generation of Australia's farmers and we should be doing the things that do not necessarily have great political clout but have great vision for Australia and Australia's participation in the contribution of the global food task. I heard comments earlier about Cape York Peninsula. There is a plan by some people in this place to shut down the productive capacity of Cape York Peninsula.




Senator McLucas:
  You have no idea what you are talking about.




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  We will try that out, Senator McLucas, Thank you for telling me I do not know what I am talking about. Cape York Peninsula is 17.5 million hectares. It is the same size as Victoria. I presume you knew that.




Senator McLucas:
  Yes.




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  It has an estimated 800,000 feral pigs. It has about 30,000 untagged feral cattle. It has about 14,000 people who live off the coast—12,000 of them Indigenous. It has about 17 pastoral stations. The rest of it is either sit-down blackfella country or national park. And they want to turn it all into a World Heritage area. They want to lock up the first kilometre from all the rivers there, which are as good as the Murrumbidgee Flats. Sure we need new agricultural technologies. Sure we need GM production. See that against the background, Senator McLucas—you say I do not know what I am talking about—of a place like Bangladesh.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Heffernan, you address your comments through the chair.




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  Through you, Mr Chair, I am terribly sorry. Bangladesh is half the size of Cape York Peninsula and if the science is half right—it might be half wrong—it will have to find somewhere else to go because, by 2050, there could be 1.6 billion people on the planet displaced. I could go through that, only I do not have time.


Bangladesh is half the size of Cape York Peninsula and 160 million people live there. Fifty-four of their 57 rivers flow in out of India. India is mining those rivers. If the sea rises to half the level predicted by the scientists, by 2050, they are going to lose where they live. They are going to have to find somewhere else to live. The UN will not fix that. The UN are the largest, most corrupt bureaucracy on the planet—most definitely. I have been there and told them to their own face and they just sat there with a glum look. The UN will not fix this issue. People will make their own arrangements. And do you think we should lock up the capabilities of Cape York Peninsula and prevent any commercial agricultural production which will take some research and work? Do you think we should say to the Indigenous people up there, 'Look, mate, if you just get your photo taken on a spear for the next 50 years, that's a great commercial opportunity for tourism.'




Senator McLucas:
  That is offensive.




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  It's not; it is what is proposed and I have been talking to them. It is a disgrace. There are still 5,000 kids in the north there who do not have a high school to go to and we do not give a rats!


The Northern Development Taskforce commissioned the CSIRO to do a study of the water resources of the north. Just so you know that I do not know what I am talking about, Senator McLucas, there are 78,000 gigs of run-off in the Timor catchment, there are 98,000 gigs of run-off in the gulf catchment and there are 85,000 gigs of run-off in the eastern catchment, which has the complication of the run-off into the Great Barrier Reef. So we have said to the CSIRO, 'Can you study the water resources of the north?' As you would be aware, because I do not know, but you will know and you can work that out for yourself, the most northern aquifers up there are annual recharge. By the time you get down to Alice Springs, it is very old water.


We said to the CSIRO, 'Give us a study on what we can do and what the potential is.' The government changed and you said to the same mob that we instructed to do that, 'Still do it, but don't have dams in your terms of reference', because the Northern Territory and the Western Australian governments at the time opposed new dams. You said to the CSIRO, 'Do this study of the water capabilities of the North, but don't consider storing the water or damming the water.' What a stupid bloody proposition. That is your mob. Do not tell me I don't know what I am talking about!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Heffernan, can you please address your comments through the chair.




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  Sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President. I get pretty stirred up about this stuff. What we should be doing is considering ways of value-adding, as Senator Eggleston and Senator Macdonald said, not only to agriculture but also to complement downstream value-adding to the mining industry. Why haven't we got a urea plant coming out of the gas industry in Northern Australia? I don't know. Why haven't we got a phosphate plant? Why haven't we joined up Mount Isa to the north-south railway line to make that happen?




Senator McLucas:
  Because we killed Townsville, that's why!




Senator HEFFERNAN:
  Excuse me, if I had time I would take you through it and you would learn something. But why haven't we done this stuff? Do you know what Clare Martin said to me as the task force chairman? I am sure she will not mind me saying, so I can tell you what she said—and what Beattie told me too. She said, 'We're not interested in developing Ord stage 3 because we haven't got the wherewithal.' That is what Clare Martin said to me. And so Ord stage 2, which is being developed, was part of a deal for Ord stage 3. Poor old Eric Ripper did not even know when he was trying to do Ord stage 2 expressions of interest—that would have been a white shoe brigade operation—and there was still a ban on GM farming, which means it would not have worked, that the drainage had to go out through the Keep River. He had no understanding that they would have had to deal with the lead mine there, because that is a serious problem for the development of the Ord.


Clare Martin was not interested, but we are. We need infrastructure that will value-add at the same time to the mining industry, to the tourism industry and to the agriculture industry. The great opportunity in the north is for our Indigenous people because they own most of the country. This is silly stuff, to put people on the Northern Development Taskforce to find ways to shut it down. They have shut the cattle industry down. The 'don't ask, don't tell' issues with the live export trade is that we do not have the culture that some of these Asian countries have where you have to pay for every signature you require on a piece of paper with what they call 'facilitation money', which is code for bribing. These are serious issues.


We have a vision for the north. It will be real and it will include—if there is no development opportunity for the north and north-west of Australia, why is a Chinese company at the present time negotiating to buy ten 10,000-hectare parcels of land up the coast there to create a series of fish farms? The reason they are doing that against the background of problems with the fishing industry in Asia, which is completely contaminated, is that they want to have a secure supply of farmed fish for the future. There are umpteen ways that we can value-add to them.


We should take the politics out of this because if you did it on the politics, because there are not very many votes up there, we would all sit down here and tell the next generation of farmers to go jump. (Time expired)

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2013-03-19,"



Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (16:49):  I join this debate, like Senator Crossin and Senator Sterle, with some relish because this is an opportunity to really put down on the public record the differences between the former Howard government and their record, when they had 11½ years in government, and what they did for us, and our Labor government. In my case, I am going to speak about Northern Queensland. We have heard a lot of bluff and bluster, a lot of very loud noise—I do acknowledge that Senator Heffernan was quite quiet, and I do appreciate that—and wild assertions, but these assertions in this motion that we are dealing with today are simply not based on fact. I encourage people to look at the record of the former LNP government under Mr Howard and make the comparison with our Labor governments' achievements and then make their decision.


Let us first go to roads. Since coming to office in 2007, our federal Labor government has committed $3.3 billion to maintaining and upgrading the Bruce Highway. This compares with the former Howard government, which could only manage to find in 11½ long years $1.3 billion. So $3.3 billion in the time that we have been in government compared to $1.3 billion in the time that the Howard government was in office. Let us go to some of those developments: $150 million, Bruce Highway upgrades south of Cairns, coming along fine; $160 million toward the Townsville ring-road; $50 million to upgrade the southern approach to Mackay; $25 million toward the upgrade of the Burdekin River Bridge; $90 million to flatten and straighten the Bruce Highway over the Cardwell Range; $95 million towards the Townsville port access road. Double the money in half the time: that is our commitment. They are the facts on roads.


Let us go to regional infrastructure. In the time we have been in government we have invested more than $101 million in community infrastructure in the Herbert electorate: more than $16 million for the Flinders Street redevelopment, $5 million for the Magnetic Island walkway. This is something that the people of Magnetic Island have been calling for for more than 15 years. Senator Macdonald, you know that and your member for Herbert tried to take the credit for a Labor government commitment to deliver the Magnetic Island walkway. There is $5 million for the Upper Ross community hub, $3.45 million toward the Murray sports complex, $4 million toward the Townsville cruise ship terminal and $2 million for the youth services hub, which will include the headstart facility.


In Leichhardt we have invested $297.5 million in funding for community infrastructure, including a $3 million upgrade to Cazaly's stadium, a $3½ million upgrade to Jones Park, $1.5 million for the Edmonton Leisure Centre and $1.5 million for the Cooktown Community Events Centre. We have also invested $4.5 million in the AFL Indigenous Academy and $9.37 million in the Daintree Rainforest Observatory. In the Dawson area we have invested $156 million for community infrastructure, including $8 million for Mackay's multi-use stadium; $6 million to upgrade the Mackay Basketball Stadium, which is also going along well; $5 million to upgrade the main street of Airlie Beach, which I inspected; and $1.5 million for the Bowen foreshore redevelopment, which I opened recently.


Compare those investments to what happened under the Howard government, when we had the notorious regional rorts program. In my area we have the allocation of $17 million to the Atherton Tablelands area west of Cairns. With the exception of the final round, that money was largely wasted. Who could forget the money allocated to the Black Stump hotel in Atherton for a so-called convention centre. The Black Stump hotel was given large amounts of taxpayers' money to establish a convention centre in a pub that has topless waitresses on a Friday night. It has never seen the light of day. Money was given to the wildlife park on the way to Kuranda and money was given to a company that went into receivership some weeks after this investment was made. Most of the $17 million was wasted.


In comparison, we have Regional Development Australia, which has taken the politics out of decision making about infrastructure projects. I commend our hardworking volunteer Regional Development Australia committees for the work that they have done to truly connect with communities to make recommendations about what infrastructure projects should be prioritised for the future.


In respect of that, let's talk about seawalls and climate change in the Torres Strait. Since about 2004 or 2005, I have been talking in this place about my concerns about the impacts of climate change on the outer islands in the Torres Strait.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Thanks to Mr Entsch.




Senator McLUCAS:
  I will take that interjection. Mr Entsch did nothing. I have been talking about this for nearly 10 years. All of that time I have been promoting the rights and needs of people of the Torres Strait. It took the election of a Labor government to get a commitment from Minister Wong to do some baseline mapping of where the sea level is in the Torres Strait. We did not even know that: 10 years of Liberal government could at least have done the basic mapping. The second step has been Labor announcing $12 million to build seawalls to protect communities in the Torres Strait. I very much look forward to those seawalls being constructed.


Other RDA projects funded in the north include the ACT for Kids project, investing $4.6 million for the ACT for Kids Child and Family Centre of Excellence in Townsville, which will support abused children not only in the Townsville region but right across the north. There is also funding for the Mackay regional events centre. In regional aviation we have seen the Horn Island airport provided with $5.09 million towards its $9 million upgrade. That airport has been calling for an upgrade for years to allow more seats and more services to and from the Torres Strait. The Mornington Island upgrade has also been delivered. If you look at the global figures on regional aviation, the Labor government has invested $145 million in remote facilities and services in the six years since 2008. Compare that with the $16 million that the Howard government invested in the six years before. These are the facts and they are in the budget papers. This is what has happened and I hope people take the opportunity to make a comparison.


Add to that the work that we have done in health and education. Speaking of health, let's make some observations about what has happened in the north of Queensland. We have seen a bit of a test run, a trial run or a taste of what would occur if Mr Abbott were to assume the prime ministership of this country since the election of the Campbell Newman government in Queensland.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Are you going to talk about Mr Norman's letter, when he called you a liar?




Senator McLUCAS:
  Let's talk again about Mr Norman. Mr Norman, the Liberal Party chair of the Cairns Health and Hospital district, has sacked through his management 243 hardworking health workers who now cannot deliver the services to people of the north that we very much desire.


We have had a taste of what Mr Abbott would be like as a prime minister, because we have the Premier of Queensland showing us the way. I have great faith in Northern Australia. I have great faith in the future of our part of the world, but it was a Labor government which has truly invested in North Queensland—in our roads, in our regional infrastructure, in our health and in our education services. These services support families in the north. They support families to make good, strong decisions about their futures and the ability to maintain the population of Northern Australia. We have seen since Mr Newman came to government a loss of workers totally in the north.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2013-03-19,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (17:00):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I rise to respond to the ministerial statement on the 57th Session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women.


Violence against women is a global epidemic and, tragically, a normal part of life for millions of women across the globe, including many in Australia. A World Bank report estimated that more women between the ages of 15 and 54 were at risk from rape and domestic violence than from cancer, car accidents, war and malaria combined. And a New York Times article points out that according to the United Nations and other sources more than 600 million women live in countries where domestic violence is not considered a crime, and more than three million girls are facing genital mutilation.


Women in all social, economic, ethnic and religious groups are affected. According to the World Health Organization, in Australia, Canada, Israel, South Africa and the United States 40 to 70 per cent of female murder victims were killed by their partners. And, at a recent UN women's breakfast for International Women's Day, Papua and New Guinea's chief magistrate, Rosie Johnson, shared her personal and professional experience of violence against women in that country, where there are regions where 100 per cent of women experience violence, including torture.


I therefore commend UN member countries for coming to agreement and signing up to commit to prevent all forms of violence against women and girls as part of the Commission on the Status of Women this year. As Sex Discrimination Commissioner Liz Broderick stated in a press release of 18 March 2013:


The recognition that custom, tradition or religious consideration should play no part in denying women equal rights or justifying violence against them is a major step forward.


There can be no cultural or other justification for violence against women. It is, simply stated, wrong. It is unacceptable both in Australia and around the world.


It is promising to see that member countries at this year's Commission on the Status of Women were able to negotiate this resolution after last year's disappointing result when no consensus was reached. I take this opportunity to congratulate Ms Michelle Bachelet on her leadership of UN women and on the legacy she will leave at that organisation following the announcement of her intention to stand down from her position as executive director.


I would also like to reiterate the coalition's bipartisan support of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. The Liberal Party has a proud history of implementing policies that will reduce violence against women. When it came to power in 1996, the coalition government implemented and funded the Partnerships Against Domestic Violence and the Women's Safety Agenda programs, which included funding for the Australian Bureau of Statistics Women's Safety Survey in 1996.


When in government, the coalition implemented a range of measures to assist women in the many roles they fulfil. During its 11 years in power the Howard government carried on the Liberal tradition of supporting and improving the position of women in Australia by recognising the many different roles that women may fulfil in their lives. The Howard government committed itself to an Australia where women were full and active participants in all spheres of public and private life across a wide range of decision making positions.


The safety of women was a top priority for the Howard government. It dedicated $75.7 million over four years to the Women's Safety Agenda, which addressed four broad themes of prevention, health, justice and services. The initiatives included the national 'Violence Against Women. Australia Says No' campaign and the national 24-hour helpline. The campaign was launched in 2004 and thousands of calls were subsequently fielded.


In relation to addressing violence against women in Indigenous communities, the former Howard government was again committed to reducing such violence. The coalition government convened the intergovernmental summit on violence and child abuse in Indigenous communities in June 2006. On 14 July 2006, COAG reaffirmed its commitment to adopt a collaborative approach to addressing family violence and child abuse in Indigenous communities, particularly in the areas of policing, justice, support and governance. 


In 2005, Pru Goward, the former federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner and currently the New South Wales Minister for Community Services and Women, said:


As Sex Discrimination Commissioner I am often asked what is the greatest challenge for women's human rights in Australia - the answer has to be violence against women. If women cannot expect to be safe in their own homes and communities, how can they expect equality in society?


We simply cannot be complacent about violence against women. As elected representatives, we have a duty to do everything that we can to prevent this violence occurring. 


In whatever setting, whether at home in Australia or overseas, I believe peer influence and male role modelling, within their families and through their workplaces and communities is effective. Men are able to effect attitudinal and cultural change that will work hand in hand with other strategies. In Australia, we had some great success with the Bsafe program run by the former Howard government. 


The Male Champions of Change program run by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Elizabeth Broderick, is an excellent example of a program working to change culture through workplaces, using the leadership of senior businessmen. The White Ribbon program, which has bipartisan support, works to change the culture around violence against women through men showing other men that this is simply not acceptable. 


We have come a long way in raising both the recognition and the profile of domestic violence over the past few decades, but there is still much work to be done in Australia and globally.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2013-03-19,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:07): by leave—I thank Minister Collins for reporting back on 57th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women in New York, particularly on the important issue of working to prevent violence against women both in Australia and internationally. Violence against women is endemic and should be a critical issue for governments. One shocking fact helps to spell out why: more women between the ages of 15 and 44 are killed by violence each year than by malaria, HIV, cancer, accidents and war combined. Another to illustrate the point: some 603 million women currently live in countries where there is no law against domestic violence.


I understand that the 17-page communique agreed upon in New York was particularly hard won in the face of opposition by conservative member states and groups such as Iran, Russia, Syria and the Vatican, with some taking issue with, for example, language suggesting a husband does not have the right to rape his wife. US pro-life groups set themselves against the statement because it claimed women have a right to their own bodies. Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood claimed:


The declaration, if ratified, would lead to complete disintegration of society…


This is a puzzling response considering the statement covers sharing of roles within families between men and women such as child care and home chores, and removing the need for a husband's consent to travel, work or use contraception. 


The communique involved months of lobbying and weeks of tough negotiations. The level of concern about the conservative push-back at what most rational people would see as no-brainer statements about women's rights is witnessed in the statement of feminists and women's organisations from around the world, issued on International Women's Day this year. The groups included Catholics for the Right to Decide Mexico and Women's Front Norway. These many groups reflected an alarming trend to try to negotiate away women's rights and freedoms during negotiation on the language in the outcome document.


In the face of such opposition, Minister Collins is correct to conclude that this year's UN Commission on the Status of Women produced a landmark agreement, particularly as the year before there was no outcome document agreed upon at all.


It is a breakthrough. The participants agreed that custom, tradition or religious consideration should play no part in denying women equal rights or justifying violence against them. The documents call for an end to harmful traditional practices, such as child marriage, and to ensure that governments do the hard yards in working to meet the needs of marginalised groups like female migrant workers, women with disabilities, older women and indigenous women, which is also important. Promoting gender equality, women's empowerment and women's reproductive rights and access to sexual and reproductive services are all goals of the agreement, a key to achieving equity for women across the globe. The challenge now is for nations to act to implement the resolutions, not leave them gathering dust in the bottom drawer.


Senator Collins's statement also discussed Australia's work on the women, peace and security agenda, which she says was a priority for Australia during our term on the UN Security Council. What Senator Collins omitted to note was the history behind Australia's national action plan for the implementation of UN Security Council resolution 1325, dealing with women, peace and security. Sadly, it seemed this resolution was never actually a priority for Australia, as the senator suggested. This is a very important resolution. It affirms the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts, peace negotiations, peace building, peacekeeping, humanitarian response and in post-conflict reconstruction. It stresses the importance of their equal participation and full involvement of all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security. Yet it took Australia 11 years to issue a draft action plan for consultation—yes, 11 years to come up with a draft action plan. What a failure by Labor and the coalition to act on women's rights.


At the last estimates hearings, in February, I asked the branch manager of the Office for Women to explain what actually happened and why we dragged our heels when producing Australia's plan. Ms Steele revealed that Australia was still in the early stages of the implementation. I found out that we are yet to develop or issue monitoring and evaluation criteria, so we are still a long way from knowing whether our fledging plan may in future make—or may have already made—a difference. Ms Steele did try to reassure me that there were measures in place prior to the plan being finalised: just because we did not have a plan did not mean that actions were not already being undertaken. But when I asked Ms Steele to explain what the measures were, what has been done and how far advanced things were, Ms Steele was forced to take my questions on notice.


The Greens are a little concerned that in reality not much has been achieved at a domestic level. We examined a number of government speeches on Australia's priorities for our term on the UN Security Council, and we were unable to even find any specific mention of resolution 1325, dealing with peace and security issues. I hope this does not reflect a general lack of commitment to Australia playing its part in ending violence against women around the globe, considering that around the world at least one woman in every three has been beaten, coerced into sex or otherwise abused in her lifetime—one in three.


We know there is a need to do much more internationally and domestically to end violence against women. On International Women's Day, just passed, leading feminist Ms Anne Summers publically called for governments to treat violence against women as a crime epidemic and devote to it the kinds of resources they would mobilise if this were, say, a terrorist attack. She also suggested proper labelling of crimes to ensure we know the extent of the epidemic and zero tolerance towards those individuals who are convicted of crimes of violence against women. Finally, she suggested never forgetting the women who have died in this epidemic.


An estimated 1.2 million women around Australia over the age of 15 have experienced domestic or family violence. The negative effects of violence against women—physical, emotional and economic—must be addressed through adequately funded, appropriate health and education programs. In recent times the Australian Greens have been campaigning to broaden discrimination laws, to introduce domestic and family violence as a separate form of discrimination, and to see the federal government inject funding to provide women across the nation to access Victoria's award-winning Bsafe program, which provides personal safety alarms to women and children at risk of domestic violence, linking them to emergency services and allowing them to remain in their homes. We all need to do more to help women and children to live lives free from violence, and support them to remain living where they are, to avoid homelessness that can result from domestic violence. 


Successive coalition and Labor governments for 11 years have dragged the chain on developing a national action plan in response to UN requirements. This is an international embarrassment. Now is the time for Australia to pick up its game on women's rights and work with other progressive governments to resist those countries blocking change to improve women's rights and in some cases attempting to turn back the clock to overturn women's rights. A key test of the worth of Australia's role on the Security Council will be our work for women's rights in Australia and globally. The Greens will be watching closely. Thank you.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (17:37):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This Bill implements a range of improvements to Australia's taxation laws.


Schedule 1 confirms that income tax is not payable on certain native title benefits or on certain capital gains tax (CGT) events involving native title rights. 


At present, when applying the ordinary rules of the income tax system based on traditional common law concepts, it is unclear what the tax implications are for Indigenous communities when a native title benefit is received and with respect to certain CGT events involving native title rights, due to the unique nature of a native title right. 


By confirming that there are no tax implications for these acts, this amendment provides Indigenous communities with much needed certainty and clarity which is important when they are negotiating native title agreements. 


Schedule 2 amends the list of deductible gift recipients (DGRs) identified by name in Division 30 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Donations made to organisations with DGR status are income tax deductible to the donor and therefore DGR status will assist the listed organisations in attracting public support for their activities. 


The Schedule adds two new organisations to the Act, namely, AE1 Incorporated and Teach for Australia, and extends the time period for listing of Australia for UNHCR, One Laptop per Child Australia, and the Yachad Accelerated Learning Project.


Schedule 3 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to extend the immediate deductibility of 'exploration and prospecting expenditure' to geothermal energy explorers.


Geothermal energy is an emerging clean and renewable energy source with the potential to be used for the generation of electrical power in a largely emissions-free manner. These amendments will assist the Government's objective of encouraging exploration for geothermal energy.


Geothermal energy explorers will be entitled to equivalent treatment for their exploration or prospecting expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 2012 as that afforded to mining and petroleum explorers. This includes an immediate tax deduction for the cost of depreciating assets first used for exploration or prospecting on or after 1 July 2012, provided certain criteria are met.


The amendments in this Schedule will include geothermal exploration rights and geothermal exploration information in the list of intangible assets included in the definition of 'depreciating assets'.


The changes will also extend the definition of 'exploration or prospecting' to include exploration or prospecting for geothermal energy resources. This will allow geothermal energy explorers to immediately deduct the cost of the tangible and intangible depreciating assets they acquire if they first use the assets for exploration or prospecting, provided certain criteria are met.


In addition, these amendments will allow geothermal energy explorers to deduct expenditure incurred on exploration or prospecting for geothermal energy resources in an equivalent manner to mining and petroleum explorers.


Finally, the changes will prevent geothermal energy explorers from incurring an unintended liability in circumstances where they stop holding an exploration right because they merely acquire an energy extraction right relating to the same area or an area that is not significantly different. This will provide for an outcome equivalent to that for mining and petroleum explorers.


These amendments will encourage exploration for geothermal energy resources, and ensure that geothermal energy is an important part of the renewable energy mix.


Schedule 4 to this Bill amends Schedule 2 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 5) Act 2011 to extend the exemption for managed investment trusts (MITs) from the interim streaming rules introduced by that Schedule until the 2013-14 income year.


The Government provided an optional exemption from the application of the interim streaming rules for MITs and certain trusts treated like MITs. This was in recognition that these trusts generally do not 'stream' income; instead, they distribute all of their trust income proportionally. Extending this exemption ensures that MITs can continue to use the current arrangements until the commencement of the new tax system for MITs on 1 July 2014.


Schedule 5 to this Bill implements the Government's 2012-13 Budget measure to better target the net medical expenses tax offset by means testing the threshold above which a taxpayer may claim the offset and the rate of reimbursement from 1 July 2012. 


Australian Government annual health expenditure is expected to reach around $100 billion by 2022. Means testing ensures this tax offset is appropriately targeted and is one of a number of measures the Government has identified to ensure a strong and sustainable health care system.


For taxpayers with adjusted taxable income above the Medicare Levy Surcharge thresholds ($84,000 for singles or $168,000 for couples or families in 2012-13), the threshold above which they may claim the net medical expenses tax offset will increase to $5,000 and the rate of reimbursement will be reduced to 10 per cent. The claim threshold will be indexed annually to the CPI.


People with adjusted taxable income below the surcharge thresholds will not be affected by this means test. 


These changes will provide an ongoing gain to revenue which is estimated to be $370 million over the forward estimates period. 


Introducing a means test will protect low and middle income earners, while helping to reduce the long term cost to the budget and ensure the ongoing sustainability of the net medical expenses tax offset. 


The Government continues to provide substantial support for health expenses, including around $27 billion in 2012-13 through the Medicare Benefits Schedule, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and related safety nets.


Schedule 6 amends the definition of limited recourse debt. The amendment is necessary to ensure that the limited recourse debt tax provisions achieve their policy objective.


The objective of these provisions is to reverse a taxpayer's deductions for unpaid capital expenditure, where the taxpayer has not been fully at risk in relation to the expenditure.


The amendments will achieve this objective by looking at the substance or effect of a loan arrangement to determine whether a debt is a limited recourse debt, not just the legal form. This will ensure that taxpayers cannot structure their arrangements to avoid the limited recourse debt provisions.


The amendments will apply to debt arrangements that are terminated at or after the announcement of this measure at 7.30 pm (AEST) on 8 May 2012.


Schedule 7 amends the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to implement the 2012-13 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook measure to remove the concessional treatment of 'in house' fringe benefits that are purchased through salary sacrificing. 


The current fringe benefits arrangements allow employees to receive concessional treatment for goods and services that an employer or an associate produces or sells in the ordinary course of its business. 


The Government recognises that it is not appropriate for the tax system to subsidise 'in-house benefits' for employees accessing them though salary sacrificing arrangements. This is why the Government is amending the Fringe Benefits Assessment Act 1986 to restore the concessional treatment of fringe benefits to its original policy intent. 


Employers will still be able to provide staff discounts that will continue to receive the concessional treatments as long as the employee purchases the goods and services out of after-tax income. 


The amendments in Schedule 7 mean that the concessional tax treatment is available for employers to reflect the true cost of providing the benefits and minimise the compliance costs, rather than as a means of employees reducing their income tax.


The amendments in Schedule 7 apply from 22 October 2012 (the date of announcement) for all new arrangements and from 1 April 2014 for all existing arrangements.


And finally, Schedule 8 includes several miscellaneous amendments to the taxation laws. 


These include making sure that the promoter penalty provisions in the tax laws are effective against conduct that takes place outside Australia.


Such amendments are regularly made to correct minor technical or drafting defects in the taxation laws, and to address unintended outcomes. The Government has a long-standing commitment to uphold the integrity of the taxation system, and advancing such amendments gives effect to this very important commitment.


Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

Senator McKENZIE

 (
Victoria
) (
17:39
):   It gives me great pleasure to continue my remarks on this landmark piece of legislation, the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013, on an issue that again has complete bipartisan support. When I was first elected and became a senator, a little over 18 months ago, one of the first people who came to see me in my new role was Millie Parker. Down in Victoria, she is a great local advocate for the NDIS. She was very passionate about ensuring its fruition. She got me on board very early. So I am very pleased to be here today speaking in support of this reform for those with disability.


It is a joint venture between governments state and federal—and obviously the territory governments, Senator Scullion. We want it to be a success. I would like to commend my own state government of Victoria, as the reforms that have been introduced in my home state by Minister Wooldridge in this area were highlighted right throughout the hearings as a way of moving forward and as a bit of a highlight in terms of how different states have gone about dealing with the issues of people with a disability. It is a joint venture between states. We want everyone to get on board and to ensure that their own communities are participating. We wish those who are hosting trial sites all the best in going forward.


One of the other issues that we had during the hearings was that, whilst this is the framework that outlines what we are going to do, there are a lot of draft rules that sit under this framework—on who is in, who is out, definitions, details et cetera—that will go to the functioning of this. For the committee to get a draft of those only on the final day of hearings, on Tuesday, 5 March, to have a bit of a look at prior to producing a report, was concerning. The government has indicated that potentially there is a lot more to come in terms of draft rules. It would have been nice, as a committee, to have been able to consider this issue as a whole. The coalition want the NDIS to be a success. We want the launch sites to go smoothly. We stand ready to work with the government in all jurisdictions to make the NDIS a reality. If we spend all this money, we need to be sure we end up with a better system.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2013-03-19,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:42):  I would like to start my contribution to the debate on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013by quoting from the Community Affairs Legislation Committee report into the bill:


The committee heard overwhelming support for the introduction of an NDIS. The committee did not hear from a single submitter, be that an organisation or an individual, that did not support the introduction of some form of structural and funding overhaul of the provision of disability services and support. … none thought the status quo provided adequate and equitable access to services.


I also would like to quote from the evidence provided by DANA, Disability Advocacy Network Australia, who said:


The significance of the NDIS cannot be overstated. It has the potential to be the most important change to the provision of support for people with disability to occur in any nation, at any time.


This is a historic day in the history of our nation. For the first time, we will see the establishment of a National Disability Insurance Scheme. As many in this debate have said, and as Senator McKenzie said in her contribution to the debate, this is a reform whose time has come. It is a reform the government is proud to be delivering. As has been commented on, and as Minister Macklin said in her contribution, it is rare that a proposed reform strikes such a chord with so many of us across party lines. The consensus in the parliament reflects the consensus in the Australian community. It is indeed a historic day. 


This is a scheme that will transform the lives of people with disability, their families and carers. The NDIS will provide people with the care and support they need when they need it by giving them greater control over the services they require to lead fulfilling lives. For too long disability support services have failed those who need them most, which is why we are implementing the NDIS. Many people are born with or acquire a disability; in fact, on average in Australia, every 30 minutes someone is diagnosed with a significant disability. In a modern Australian society it is beholden upon us to deliver care and support to someone with a disability that affords them the dignity and the opportunity to lead a full life. We want to provide support for people with a disability so that they can live in society and have the same opportunities as those without a disability.


Before I get into the detail of the bill we are debating today I want to take the Senate back to how we got to where we are today. The government, through the then Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, the Hon. Bill Shorten MP, asked the Productivity Commission to hold a public inquiry and report on a long-term disability care and support scheme. The Productivity Commission's report on disability care and support was released by the Prime Minister in August 2011, and all governments agreed with its recommendation to establish a national disability insurance scheme. In last year's budget the government set aside $1 billion over four years from 2012-13 to help roll out the launch sites in South Australia, Tasmania, the ACT, the Hunter region in New South Wales and the Barwon area in Victoria. All together, the launch sites will make real the NDIS for around 26,000 people.


From July 2013 in South Australia the NDIS will be launched focusing on children aged from birth to five who have significant and permanent disability. From 2014 the age limit will be extended to 13. In the third year of the launch, children up to the age of 14 will be included. It is expected around 5,000 children will be covered under the first stage of the scheme.


In my home state of Tasmania the first stage of the scheme will cover young people aged 15 to 24 from 1 July 2013. This is expected to cover around 1,000 Tasmanians. I look forward to seeing the Tasmanian government reaching an agreement with the federal government so that people with disability across Tasmania can be supported by a full scheme. That age group has been selected as it is a highly important time in a young person's life as they are transitioning from high school into work and/or further studies. The NDIS will offer this age group the opportunity to receive greater levels of support and assistance to lead fulfilling lives as they leave school and are faced with options of work or further study.



I have to say that in Tasmania the news of the state being named as a launch site was met with significant optimism and excitement.People genuinely feel this scheme will change lives by providing a new way to care and support people with a disability. While I have this opportunity I also want to acknowledge the passionate advocates in my home state for tirelessly advocating for a NDIS not just since the Productivity Commission's report but for many, many years.5I believe this passionate grassroots campaign, supported by the strong commitment and work of the state Labor government, played a key role in helping Tasmania secure one of the launch sites.




In the ACT from July 2013 the government will deliver enhanced services and commence preparations for a full launch
,


and 
in July 2014 the NDIS will fully commence in the ACT.


The NDIS launch site in the ACT is expected to cover up to 5,000 people
,
 an increase from the 1,400 who currently receive specialised disability services.


In N
ew 
S
outh 
W
ales
 the Hunter region will be used as the launch site
, and it w
ill be phased in over three years across the local government areas of Newcastle, Lake Macquarie and Maitland.


This is expected to benefit around 10,000 people with disability in N
ew 
S
outh 
W
ales
.
 I
n Victoria the NDIS will commence from July 2013 in the Barwon area
,
 covering the 
c
ity of Greater Geelong, the Colac


Otway 
s
hire, the Surf Coast 
s
hire and the 
b
orough of Queenscliff
e
.


These launch sites 
for the scheme are vital because th
ey will play a key role in identifying what works well on the ground in practice and what we may have to look at tweaking to ensure that we get this highly a
nticipated
 scheme working as it is intended.





The 
b
ill will have two key purposes
: to 
establish the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the associated framework for the 
s
cheme's operation
 and also to 
establish the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency, which will operated the first stage of the scheme 
through 
the launch sites that I have just spoken about.


The framework of the scheme will implement items such as eligibility, reasonable and necessary support
s
 and goal based plans for participants.





This framework is reflective of the principles agreed at COAG between the Prime Minister and the 
s
tates.
 It 
include
s: g
iving people with disability individual care and support
s
 based on their needs
; g
iving people real choice and control over these supports
, 
meaning more control over their lives
; e
nding a situation where people are
 not


told what support is available, or how to access that support
; 
and
 f
ostering innovative services that are delivered and coordinated locally.


The scheme is designed to move away from the crisis model where families only receive support if they are unable to continue in their caring role and there are no other options.


This scheme is designed to work with families before they reach this stage and make sure the valuable care they provide can be sustained by giving great
er
 government support.





The scheme will also look at taking a lifelong approach to supporting someone with a disability by focusing on early intervention, particularly when there is good evidence that it will substantially improve a person's functioning.


Of course
,
 significant consultation and work was undertaken with states and territories 
and with 
people with disability, their families, carers, disability workers, service providers and advocates on the design, funding and governance of the scheme.




As I mentioned, the 
b
ill also establishes the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency as a body that is independent from the government.


It will be the responsibility of the 
a
gency to deliver the scheme as well as performing a range of functions
,
 including managing the financial sustainability of the scheme, building community awareness about disability and undertaking research about disability and the social contributors to disability.

The agency will be overseen by a board that is made up of people with extensive experience in the provision or use of disability services and in financial management, governance and the operation of insurance schemes, as well as an advisory council made up of people who have lived with the experience of disability and caring.


As a member of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee I had the opportunity to be involved in the Senate inquiry into the NDIS Bill. The committee heard wide-ranging evidence on the benefits of the scheme and potential areas that required improvement. I am pleased that through this committee process and other means the government has made a number of amendments to improve the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill. I am pleased that the parliament has been able to come together, leave past partisanship at the door and deliver a piece of public policy that will improve the lives of so many Australians.


Before I finish I want to acknowledge the passionate community campaign that has been running for many years to see the implementation of the NDIS run by the disability and carer community, providers and unions. I believe that the momentum generated by the thousands of passionate advocates from around Australia ensured that governments from all levels worked together to see that the scheme was put in place and launched, because we know the current support system is underfunded and unfair. We are now faced with the launch sites and then proceeding to the full implementation of the scheme. This NDIS Bill, as Minister Macklin has stated, has the rights of people with disability, their families and carers at its heart and:


The bill will implement a nationwide, demand driven system of care tailored to the needs of each individual and established on a durable, long-term basis.


Failing is simply not an option. The eyes of people with a disability and their families and carers are upon us. It is now our job as elected representatives to ensure that this scheme improves the lives of people with a disability.


I also want to acknowledge in my contribution here today the significant work of the Minister for Disability Reform, Jenny Macklin MP, as well as the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers, Senator Jan McLucas. They have both done an extraordinary amount of work as the driving forces behind ensuring this legislation has come to fruition. I am sure that this is an extremely proud day for Minister Macklin and Senator McLucas as this bill is debated and we see it progress into law.


As the Prime Minister said in her speech in the House on the NDIS Bill:


The NDIS will stand alongside the minimum wage, the age pension, Medicare and universal superannuation as one of the great Labor pillars of social justice and opportunity for all Australians. It will change our society in profound and lasting ways, enabling those who live with disability to fulfil their potential as valued and valuable members of our society. 


I commend the National Disability Insurance Scheme to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,23,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2013-03-19,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:55):  I will start by joining Senator Brown in acknowledging the work that carers do in looking after their charges, those with disabilities, however they came by those disabilities. Indeed, those of us who do not have that duty and responsibility, I guess, can never quite fully understand the trials and tribulations—and, I guess, the joys—of those who spend their lifetimes looking after others. I want to acknowledge them.


I also want to pay tribute to Senator Mitch Fifield for the work that he has done over a long period of time with the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the way he has, in a quiet, non-political way, pushed to make sure that this bill—the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013—ended up where it is today. It is not a bill that we should be involving in the normal political discourse back and forward, and I was a bit disappointed in Senator Brown's speech—a good speech though it was right until the end, when she sought to make some political capital out of an issue which clearly has political support across the board.


I guess all of us in our lives have come across people who worry about their offspring who have a disability—people who worry about what will happen when they pass on. Indeed, some of the best friends of my wife and me had a disabled child. They were very good friends of ours and we were quite close to them, but at times—be it in sober moments or not so sober moments, and there were many of those—there was always this underlying concern in their otherwise quite happy lives about what would happen to the young fellow if something happened to them. It was something that I learnt in those days about the anguish that people, particularly parents, suffer. In fact, in my own family and my wife's family, there is a similar situation where people growing old wonder what will happen to the disabled people once they themselves pass on. I know that an uncle of Lesley's never quite knew exactly how to deal with that situation but left a lot of money to try and ensure that there was someone there to look after the disabled person when he passed on. So it has certainly been a traumatic issue for many families from time immemorial. In my practice as a country solicitor for many years before I came into this place, often people would come to me and talk about these issues when drawing up their wills; they would try to work out the best way to handle things. Indeed, you could again see the anguish and concern that they experienced in trying to work out what needed to be done.


The one good thing—in fact, the only good thing—that I can see that came out of the 2020 Summit in 2008 was this proposal for a national disability insurance scheme. You might recall that that was the summit that was to have all these great ideas for Australia but which turned into nothing more than a talkfest, it having faded into insignificance and into the backs of everyone's memory since 2008. But there was one proposal that came out of that and that was this proposal for a national disability insurance scheme. It was a concept that was conceived by Mr John Walsh and Mr Bruce Bonyhady, who talked about it at that 2020 Summit in 2008.


The introduction of the National Disability Insurance Scheme that we are dealing with today does have cross-party support at both federal and state level. Again, regrettably, some people have attempted to make some political capital out of it by accusing the states of not doing this or not doing that. That is regrettable, because I know that all of the state governments, be they of whatever political persuasion, support across the board an insurance scheme for the disabled that we are dealing with today. As my leader, Tony Abbott, said quite clearly and unequivocally: 'The NDIS is an idea whose time has come.'


The level of support that a person with a disability receives can depend on many factors. It might depend on where they live, whether that disability is congenital or whether it was acquired and, if acquired, that it was at the workplace or due a motor vehicle accident or in some other context. Workers compensation and motor vehicle accident insurance provides coverage in some states, but if you are born with a disability or acquire disability later in life, it can be a different story, and we can see long waiting lists and queues. The result is that many people with a disability are left without the assistance they need. As I said at the beginning of my speech, the instance of parents worrying about the assistance that will come to the disabled person when they pass on has also been a real issue.


The coalition has always enthusiastically supported every step along the road to the achievement of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. You will recall, Deputy President, that we supported the initial work of the Productivity Commission and we also supported the $1 billion that was set aside in last year's budget, although we queried whether this was the appropriate amount in view of what the Productivity Commission had said. Deputy President, you would also be aware that we in the coalition supported the five launch sites and we supported the agreement between the Commonwealth and New South Wales for a full statewide rollout of the proposal. Indeed, we also support this legislation.


If I have one hesitation about my leader, Mr Abbott, it is that he always seems to be so fit, riding around the country on a bicycle and doing things like surf swimmers, long-distance runs and long-distance bicycle rides. I just wonder if anyone who is that fit and spends so much time with that sort of extreme activity is an appropriate leader for me! But that is the only thing for which that I would ever hesitate in my support for Mr Abbott! I say that, for the written record, tongue in cheek. I also raise that to indicate that I was very proud when Tony Abbott—I am always very proud when he does all of his pollie pedals, as they are called. Over the years he has raised a great deal of money for charity through a pollie pedal which he initiated many years ago now. I am particularly pleased that he has made what can be seen as a personal commitment to Australians with a disability and particularly for those who care for them by dedicating some $540,000 raised by the 2012 Pollie Pedal charity bike ride to Carers Australia.


It was good to see news reports of that pollie pedal bike ride. It was 1,000 kilometres. Fortunately, he did not ask me to join him, but I know that some of my colleagues did. Along that 1,000 kilometre route Mr Abbott met with people with a disability, with carers and with disability organisations. I understand that the next two pollie pedals that he is involved in will also be in partnership with and help raise funds for Carers Australia.


We believe that a National Disability Insurance Scheme can be delivered within the timeframe recommended by the Productivity Commission and we think that a government acting responsibly and prudently—managing well the finances of the country—can do that.


We have tried to offer support to the current government through the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee, to be chaired by both sides of politics, to oversee the establishment and implementation of the NDIS. As I understand it, that has not actually been agreed to by the current government. I may be wrong in that and, if I am, I apologise. But if I am not wrong and they have not agreed to that then I would certainly urge those senators taking part in the debate to impose upon their leadership to agree to a joint parliamentary committee so that we can take the politics out of it and actually achieve a serious result—a bipartisan result—for something that is, without question, as Tony Abbott said, at its time now.


This is a once in a generation reform that will evolve over many parliaments of this country. It will not be the property of any particular party or group; it will be the property of the parliament as a whole, on behalf of the Australian people. I think that is very important. We need to get it right, and that requires a very high level of consultation and attention to detail not just now but from now until the full implementation.


I could say that this government has not been anywhere near the top of the class when it comes to consultation. Very often, things are done on the spur of the moment for the wrong reason and without proper thought being given to how things will be funded. I would hope that, in the instance of this particular initiative of many, many people, there is that appropriate very high level of consultation and attention to detail. That is why I thought the idea of a joint parliamentary oversight committee would be very, very useful.


I am pleased to see that a colleague of mine, my local federal member, Mr George Christensen, the member for Dawson, moved a motion in the House of Representatives to establish this non-partisan joint committee some time ago. Unfortunately, those who control the agenda in the House of Representatives have not seen fit to bring that motion to a vote at the present time. Again, I would urge those senators from the other side of the chamber taking part in this debate to impose upon their leaders to bring that motion forward for a vote in the other place so that the House can, in a bipartisan way, express support for that suggestion.


In our own chamber, Senator Fifield moved the same sort of motion to establish that oversight committee, and it is of some genuine regret to me that the Labor Party and the Greens political party combined together in the Senate to vote that down. That seemed to be contrary to the spirit of the way in which this legislation has been dealt with. I know that my leader, Mr Abbott, reiterated the offer at a recent Press Club speech when he said, and I quote:


The Coalition is so committed to the National Disability Insurance Scheme, for instance, that we’ve offered to co-chair a bi-partisan parliamentary committee so that support for it doesn’t flag across the three terms of parliament and among the nine different governments needed to make it work.


What Mr Abbott was very rightly saying and drawing attention to is that this is not something that one political party in one parliament can deal with in the time that they happen to be the government of the country. I do not make any comment on opinion polls but, should the government of Australia change later on this year, it will be important that the new government has been involved in this process from the very start and that the current government continues to be involved, and the same must be said right across the states of Australia.


The first stage of this scheme, as I understand, will benefit more than 20,000 people with disabilities, their families and their carers living in South Australia, the ACT, Tasmania, the Hunter in New South Wales and the Barwon area of Victoria—and it will indeed go on further than that. It is something that I very much support.


I note the remarks of my senate colleagues in the very detailed Community Affairs Legislation Committee report on this bill. I note the submissions that have been made to the committee during their presentation. I particularly note that the first hearing of the committee was held in my base city of Townsville. I was pleased to see so many people from the Townsville community—the Mental Illness Fellowship of North Queensland; the Townsville Independence Program for Adult Community Living; Community Connections; Supported Options in Lifestyle and Access Services Inc; Deaf Services Queensland; a very significant group in the North Queensland area simply called Cootharinga; the independent advisory Townsville service; the Ingham Disability Support Services group; and Inclusion Works—appear before the committee. They were just some of the ones from the north who made submissions, and they were the ones who were called before the committee to give their evidence in person. I thank them all for the evidence they gave. The suggestions and comments that they put forward have helped get us to where we are at the present time. I support the bill.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2013-03-19,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (18:14):  I rise to speak to this landmark legislation, the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013. There are times when the din of public debate recedes and the actions of members and senators of this place combine to bring into sharpest relief the role of government. We are reminded in those moments for what purpose Australians from one of the diverse and liberal populations of the world have wrought a society that understands itself as a single community, each part supported by the other. We have built our nation on a guarantee of fairness and a guarantee of egalitarianism, a society that acknowledges that together we built the conditions in which any one of us might make a prosperous life and that we owe to it each other to ensure that prosperity is shared.


This is a nation that acknowledges that, no matter the different circumstances into which our children are born, all Australians should have access to the best possible education system. We acknowledge that effort should be fairly rewarded with decent wages and conditions for those who labour at an honest day's work. And we acknowledge that our commitment to Australia can be honoured in a sincere exchange of customs and heritage so that culture is no barrier to success.


Yet every day many Australians are diagnosed with a significant disability, either congenital or acquired through accident or misfortune. For many, their disability will cause them to drop out of the Australia most of us experience. Instead of participating in a vibrant national life, their experience may be shaped by the constraints of isolation, poverty, stress and insecurity. Many struggle with the cost of care, with treatment and with equipment. Even more grapple with issues of dependence that make carers of family and friends and amplify the consequences of disability.


The approach most people living with disability have been forced to take has been ad hoc. It has sought to deal with issues as they arose and as finances, time and energy allowed, all too often without the level of control and choice that they need. So too has the government's approach to disability been characterised by inconsistency, with budget allocations failing to take account of the true cost of disability or plan for the longer term. 


While it has been clear for some time that this approach is not satisfactory, serious reform in this area has eluded successive governments—not even having found its way onto the agenda of the previous coalition government. I am pleased to say that the Gillard Labor government has placed disability reform firmly on the agenda for the nation and, encouraged by the strongest indications of community support through the Every Australian Counts campaign, has developed this new policy response from the ground up. 


The National Disability Insurance Scheme and the bill before the Senate right now are part of extending the Australian pledge of a fair go to all people, including those living with disability. It will replace the current funding model with an insurance-like scheme based on actuarial analysis and a philosophy that shares the costs of disability services across the community. Rather than simply funding central services, it will allow funding to be directed towards eligible individuals' ongoing support needs and enable people to exercise more choice and control in their lives through individualised funding. In doing so, it will give effect to the principles outlined in the international agreements to which Australia is party, especially the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, especially those articles that urge a sense of independence and self-determination. Similarly, it will help to deliver those principles under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in that it will enhance the expression of the fundamental human rights of people living with disabilities.


The principles underpinning the National Disability Insurance Scheme are expressed, as they should be, in terms of human rights and the ability of people living with disability to exercise choice. But the NDIS is not simply a statement of principles. It is more than a reprioritising or reshaping of disability support in this country. It is also significantly expanding the level of support for people who need assistance in taking control of their lives. This bill creates a new agency, the NDIS Launch Transition Agency, to provide for the first stage of the rollout of the NDIS and demonstrate the model by assisting more than 20,000 people living with disability, their families and their carers living in South Australia, Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory, the Hunter in New South Wales and the Barwon area of Victoria. These launch sites, funded with a $1 billion commitment from the Gillard Labor government, will begin the implementation of the NDIS from 1 July this year.


I am pleased and proud that Tasmania has been chosen as a launch site and I want to acknowledge the strength and energy of those campaigners in my home state of Tasmania who have fought long and hard for an NDIS—of course for their state, but also in recognition of the challenges faced by all Australians living with disability—people such as Margaret Reynolds, somebody from whom wise counsel is assured, whether as a former senator or in her previous role at National Disability Services Director; and also David Clements, the current state manager of NDS; and extraordinary organisations like Baptcare and the Brain Injury Association. Their work has meant that, from 1 July 2013, all eligible 15-24-year-olds in Tasmania—estimated at around 1,000 people—will be covered by the new National Disability Insurance Scheme. 


Tasmania is an ideal location for the initial implementation of this project. Not only is it by virtue of its size, geography and governance a relatively flexible place to be first mover on such a scheme; it is also in pressing need of enhanced disability support. Partly as a result of its demography, Tasmania has the highest prevalence of disability out of all states in our country. Subsequently, the effect of disability is most acutely felt in Tasmania and the principles of the NDIS more sorely needed. It is my sincere hope that the greater provision of tailored care, decided, directed and ultimately employed by those affected by disability, will ease its burden and allow the young Tasmanians who will be amongst the first users of the NDIS to shape their own destiny. 


It should never be that a young person suffering an acquired nerve injury from a bicycle accident is relegated to a nursing home because of lack of care or that a person should have to forgo the most routine conveniences because of a normally easily repaired home design issue. In a community as wealthy and as privileged as Australia we should never allow the vicissitudes of accident and luck to override the autonomy of our brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, neighbours and friends.


Like the grand architecture of Medicare, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, our public education system and our award wage system—the rest of our social safety net, most of which results from the efforts of community activists and Labor governments—we must make the legacy of our success a society in which we can all take part. We must make a promise to all Australians that we will never abandon them or leave them behind so long as we have the capacity to move forward together. The NDIS will take us forward together. I am proud to be part of a Labor government responsible for this new social compact, and I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2013-03-19,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (18:23):  I will leave the broader debate surrounding this bill to my colleagues, particularly the ever-eloquent Senator Fifield, and confine my remarks to just one issue: the protection of privacy of individuals under this act. I have spoken about this issue over the years in various different contexts and I do so because privacy reflects the great tension in our democratic life between the quest for individual autonomy on one hand and the impulse for community on the other—a great philosophical, moral, social and political battle. There is never any easy answer, but even here today on the National Disability Scheme Bill 2013 those issues are again alive. I will confine my remarks just to the issue.


I am concerned that in its current form the bill does not adequately protect the privacy concerns that scheme participants and service providers may have in relation to the handling of their data. First, section 60 of the bill allows any person to obtain, make a record of, disclose or otherwise use protected information held by the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency if it relates to the purposes of the bill. This potentially represents a broad infringement of privacy rights because the objects of the bill, set out in section 3, are highly generic. They include, for example:


… support the independence and social and economic participation of people with disability; and


…   …   …


raise community awareness of the issues that affect the social and economic participation of people with disability, and facilitate greater community inclusion of people with disability.


These are broad, highly generic terms.


In promoting these wide-ranging objectives, it is the privacy rights of scheme participants that are expected to give way. Moreover, according to subsection 60(3) of the bill, obtaining, recording, disclosing or using information will be taken to be for the purposes of the bill if the CEO of the agency believes on reasonable grounds that it is reasonably necessary to facilitate research or actuarial analysis into matters relevant to the scheme or, even more broadly, to facilitate policy development.


This provides an executive official with considerable discretion over the privacy rights of scheme participants. It is concerning that these rights, under the express terms of the bill, are subject to such generic matters as policy development. Surely, some thought should be given to the development of much clearer guidelines with respect to the exercise of this discretion. I note that such guidelines are not included in any of the draft NDIS rules released on 5 March.


Section 66 of the bill enables the CEO of the agency to disclose NDIS information if the CEO certifies that it is necessary to do so in the public interest. The CEO may also disclose information to the secretary, chief executive or head of a Commonwealth, state or territory department or authority for the purposes of that department or authority.


These provisions significantly expand the disclosure powers of the CEO and might further undermine the privacy rights of scheme participants. The draft NDIS Rules for the Protection and Disclosure of Information do not impose defined guidelines to limit the exercise of the CEO's discretion. For example, in considering whether to issue a public interest certificate, the CEO is required under clause 4.3 of the rules to consider whether:


… the person to whom the information will be disclosed has sufficient interest in the information. 


A person will have sufficient interest in NDIS information if the person has:


… a genuine and legitimate interest in the information …


These criteria hardly alleviate concerns about the abrogation of privacy rights under the bill. Indeed, the rules simply replace one set of broad criteria with another. The end result is that there is a threat to privacy rights under the NDIS bill and its accompanying rules as currently drafted.


At section 12.7 of its 2011 inquiry report entitled Disability Care and Support, the Productivity Commission argues that any national disability insurance scheme must preserve the confidentiality and privacy of data provided by scheme participants. The Productivity Commission recommends, among other things: de-identifying scheme data; imposing conditions on how data can be used by researchers, for example, through enforceable undertakings; and requiring researchers to comply with principles regarding responsible and ethical research conduct. These matters are not expressly dealt with in the bill or the draft NDIS rules.


Some protection is afforded under the newly-created Australian Privacy Principles set out in the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Actthat was passed late last year and is due to commence in March 2014. For example, clause 6.4 of the sixth Australian Privacy Principle requires the de-identification of data collected by an agency prior to disclosure to another entity.


However, while the Australian Privacy Principles will apply to the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency, as a Commonwealth public agency, it is unclear what privacy protections will apply to the handling of information by the wide range of other entities that are likely to be involved in the NDIS. In particular, I note that the 'small business exemption' applying to any business with an annual turnover of less than $3 million has been retained in the formulation of the new Australian Privacy Principles. Further, state public agencies are not covered by the Australian Privacy Principles and not all of the states—specifically Western Australia and South Australia—have in place similar privacy arrangements to the Commonwealth scheme.


In its submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry into the bill, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner said:


Given the amount of personal information that will be collected and used under the Scheme, it will be important to ensure appropriate and consistent coverage of all participating entities under privacy law.


It is crucial that a uniform approach to privacy protection is mandated under the bill.


I note that the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs will be conducting a privacy impact assessment in relation to the NDIS. While I welcome this development as a means of considering in further detail the privacy implications of the scheme, it is unfortunate that the Senate could not have had the benefit of this analysis before being called upon to pass the bill and to debate the issues.


It is also disappointing that the Senate standing committee's final report dealt with the privacy implications of the bill in less than two pages, and in those two pages did not really provide any substantive policy analysis. The standing committee's conclusion in relation to the privacy implications of the bill is simply that:


Department officials are scheduled to meet with the Australian Information Commissioner to discuss the concerns outlined in his submission. The Committee anticipates that if any amendment to the provisions that ensure consistency across jurisdictions was required, this would be considered by the Department.


Again, it would have been useful for privacy concerns in relation to the bill to have been properly assessed and brought to the attention of the Senate before the debate here this evening.


The protection of privacy rights is by no means a 'side-issue' that we can allow to slide under the radar. As we saw last week when the government announced its new media law package, Australians do not take the abrogation of privacy rights and freedom of speech lightly. Indeed, the protection of privacy and freedom of speech are foundations of the society that we live in today. It is important that any debate about privacy rights takes place in the public domain upon a consideration of all the relevant circumstances and implications. In the event that the privacy impact assessment finds that there are gaps with respect to privacy protection under the bill, the parliament must ensure that these gaps are remedied without delay by amending the NDIS legislation as passed.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2013-03-19,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (18:34):  I speak in support of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013. At the outset I would like to congratulate and thank all who have worked over many years and decades to make this bill and this scheme a reality. We are lucky in some respects that those who have worked to make this happen know a little bit about what overcoming adversity and succeeding against the odds is all about. I am of course referring to the more than 400,000 Australians that live every day with a significant or permanent disability. It is because of their determination, tenacity, energy and bravery that the NDIS is poised to make a real and lasting difference to the way this nation treats its disabled citizens, and I pay tribute to them and thank them for that.


The bill establishes the framework for the NDIS, a new program for funding care and support for people with a disability. It is intended to commence for full access across Australia from 2018. The bill also establishes the NDIS Launch Transition Agency, the body that will manage the first stage of the NDIS in five locations around Australia from July 2013.


For many years now Australians who suffer from a disability and their carers and their families have not been able to access adequate levels of financial support and care. By many accounts, the system in place charged with ensuring that these people can enjoy a full, rewarding life free of discrimination has in some respects failed them. Problems that have been identified with the system have ranged from the sheer complexity of the current system, the failure of funded services to meet demand and differential treatment depending on how someone acquires their disability. These are deficiencies that really should not be allowed to endure in modern-day Australia, particularly in the light of significant projections of increase in the number of people who will live in our society into the future with a severe or profound disability.


In 2009, the Australian government commissioned the Productivity Commission to investigate the feasibility of a national disability insurance scheme. The commission subsequently found that:


The current disability support system is underfunded, unfair, fragmented, and inefficient, which gives people with a disability little choice and no certainty of access to appropriate supports. The stresses on the system are growing with little costs.


As a solution, the commission proposed that the NDIS provide insurance to all Australians who acquire a significant disability, provide support through the provision of information and referral services and provide long-term care and support to the around 410,000 Australians living with significant and ongoing disability.


The scheme will be launched in five sites across Australia from July 2013. The first stage of the scheme will begin in South Australia, Tasmania, the ACT, the Hunter in New South Wales and the Barwon region in Victoria, and will benefit more than 20,000 people living with disability, their families and their carers. I am proud to say that in my state, the federal government has reached a long-term agreement with the New South Wales government to fund and deliver the National Disability Insurance Scheme in 2018. I offer credit and thanks to the New South Wales government for working with the federal government on a long-term delivery solution for this important scheme.


The framework of the NDIS will bring long-term certainty to the resourcing of disability care and support, so that people with disability can feel secure that they will get what they need over their lifetime. The scheme will respond to each individuals' goals and aspirations for their life, and will plan with each person to take account for their individual circumstances; this will include support for carers and other informal and community supports that are important to the person living with disability.


The scheme will work with families in their role as carers, ensuring they are not overwhelmed by the task and can continue to provide valuable informal care. The scheme will also focus on intensive early learning intervention, particularly where it is evident that it will substantially improve a person's predicament, or slow the progression of their disability over their lifetime.


In Australia, a person with a disability has a poverty risk around 2.7 times that of a person without a disability. This scheme recognises the importance, where possible, of helping people with a disability to get back into the workforce.


The government has heard the frustration and desperation of people with a disability, who are sick and tired of being, in many respects, second-class citizens, one of whom, Tricia Malowney, wrote a compelling article last year about her plight as an Australian with a disability. She said:


I am a 20 per cent-er - one of the approximately 20 per cent of Australians who have a disability. The majority of us are underfunded (or not funded at all) for the supports we need to participate fully as Australian citizens. Australians with disabilities cross all demographics. We come from all socio economic sectors, we live in the city and we live in rural locations. We come from CALD backgrounds and we are Indigenous and refugees. We are married, we are single, we are parents and carers. We are LGBTI and we are straight.


We do not have the same impairments, but we share the same social disadvantage.


…   …   …


So, we've had enough … - we need the NDIS and we need it now.


Well, to Tricia, and all of those who have been campaigning for many, many years for this invaluable and important reform, I am proud to say that—and proud to be part of—a Labor government has heard you and is delivering this important reform. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2013-03-19,"



Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales) (18:41):  Before I begin my remarks this evening, I want to indicate to the chamber and for the record, that I dedicate my speech tonight to my very good friend Liam Hitchen, who is a thirteen-year-old boy in Orchard Hills in Western Sydney, for whom this will make an extraordinary difference.


I want to begin by acknowledging the sentiments of my colleague Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, and say, as he did, 'The NDIS is an idea whose time has come.' The fact that Australians with disabilities deserve a better deal than they are getting is something that both sides of this chamber can agree about. The current system could best be described as a patchwork quilt. It is something that I have heard time and time again from disability advocates in Western Sydney in particular. That view was only reinforced by the 1,600 or so submissions that were made to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee.


It is clear that many people with disabilities and their families simply do not know where to go for help. Different states have different systems, and there are different conditions for those with congenital conditions and for those who acquire them during the course of their lives—at home, or on the road or at work. They have to navigate a maze of insurance forms, state departments, federal departments, and inevitably, queues wherever they turn. The process is enough to make some people just give up, and we do need to streamline the system to prevent this from happening.


We need to provide support on a needs basis rather than rationing, with the entitlement for support going to the individual. The individual needs to be able to pick the aids, the equipment and support services that they need, and this is at the heart of the Productivity Commission's report into support for people with disabilities, which, as my colleague Senator Fifield has indicated, the coalition strongly supports. The Productivity Commission approach provides the blueprint for how this scheme should operate. As well as supporting that Productivity Commission approach, we also supported the $1 billion provided by the government in the last budget. We supported the five launch sites, we supported the agreement between the Commonwealth and New South Wales for a full state-wide rollout following the Hunter launch and, importantly, we support this legislation.


At this point, I also want to acknowledge the leadership and commitment of the New South Wales Minister for Disability Services, the Hon. Andrew Constance, the member for Bega. His work in this area and his commitment to making sure that the NDIS happens, and happens for the people that he serves and cares for in New South Wales, is without parallel. He is an exceptional minister, and he is serving those people with a dedication that, some days, is stunning.


This scheme will complement the work of organisations that I have had a great deal to do with in recent years: organisations like the Nepean Area Disabilities Organisation in Penrith; Great Community Transport, which serves the Blue Mountains and the Nepean area; the Penrith Disabilities Resource Centre; the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children; the Thorndale Foundation; and Northcott Disability Services in Parramatta. I have met with representatives from those organisations on many occasions and even recently with Senator Fifield, who was in Western Sydney for a meeting with those organisations at a round table in Emu Plains. Top of their agenda is the NDIS. For people like Denise Heath from the Nepean Area Disabilities Organisation and Denise Roberts from the Penrith Disabilities Resource Centre this is a seminal moment in how they do their jobs and how their organisations operate. I must say that, although I knew them to be highly competent and efficient heads of their various organisations, the forethought and consideration they displayed on that day to both Senator Fifield and me of how their organisations may work within the NDIS was extremely impressive.


In implementing this agenda we will obviously continue to engage with disability advocates every step of the way to ensure that we have the best National Disability Insurance Scheme. We on the coalition side of the chamber believe the NDIS can be delivered within the Productivity Commission's time frame and we stand ready to work with the government to see the NDIS delivered as soon as possible.


We do perhaps disagree on one issue. A number of those on the other side of this chamber and elsewhere continue to say that the NDIS represents quintessentially Labor values. I think that is somewhat disappointing. This is not something that should represent the values that are synonymous with one political party. It should be above politics. This NDIS represents Australian values. It is about helping those who are less fortunate and face extra challenges that are beyond their control. We do not intend to and would not brand this as a Liberal scheme or a coalition scheme, and I am disappointed that some on the other side are trying to do the same.


The NDIS is a person-centred and self-directed funding model that aims to empower individuals, not governments, to reduce the red tape and the hassle that people face. This represents a real turning point for people with disabilities and their carers. We have to do everything possible to ensure that we get it right. This is a once-in-a-generation reform that will unfold over the life of several parliaments and it should be owned by the parliament as a whole and by the people the parliament represents, not any particular political party. To that end the coalition has called for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to be chaired by both sides of the political divide to oversee the implementation of the NDIS.


In a debate last week I spoke about the effectiveness of parliamentary joint committees. On that occasion I was discussing constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. These committees can be extremely effective bodies. A parliamentary oversight committee would unite all of the parties and would provide a non-partisan environment where the design and eligibility could be completed cooperatively. I think that is a very important concept in this discussion. My colleague from the other place Mr George Christensen, the member for Dawson, has had a motion in the House of Representatives to establish this committee for some time but, unfortunately, it has not yet been brought forward for a vote. My colleagues Senator Fifield and Senator Boyce moved in June last year a very similar motion to that to establish an oversight committee but it was voted down by the Labor Party and the Australian Greens.


So I renew the coalition's call today for the government to accept our offer of a non-partisan parliamentary oversight committee. We will be moving an amendment to this bill to establish such a committee. I heard Senator Thistlethwaite as he concluded his remarks this evening acknowledge the effective work done between the Liberal government in New South Wales and the federal government here in Canberra. There is no reason why we cannot extend that to make it even more constructive to establish such a parliamentary oversight committee.


Every government in Australia wants the National Disability Insurance Scheme, so it is disappointing when we see some people put politics above those wishes. The COAG meeting before last was a fairly good example of that. The persistence of the New South Wales and Victorian Liberal governments to withstand some pretty heated attacks that they received from the federal government meant that we did end up with agreement to host launch sites. We continue to ask the Prime Minister to adopt a more cooperative approach—something that has been missing in a number of instances from the Commonwealth's dealings with the states and territories up until now.

Senator McKENZIE

 (
Victoria
) (
17:39
):   It gives me great pleasure to continue my remarks on this landmark piece of legislation, the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013, on an issue that again has complete bipartisan support. When I was first elected and became a senator, a little over 18 months ago, one of the first people who came to see me in my new role was Millie Parker. Down in Victoria, she is a great local advocate for the NDIS. She was very passionate about ensuring its fruition. She got me on board very early. So I am very pleased to be here today speaking in support of this reform for those with disability.


It is a joint venture between governments state and federal—and obviously the territory governments, Senator Scullion. We want it to be a success. I would like to commend my own state government of Victoria, as the reforms that have been introduced in my home state by Minister Wooldridge in this area were highlighted right throughout the hearings as a way of moving forward and as a bit of a highlight in terms of how different states have gone about dealing with the issues of people with a disability. It is a joint venture between states. We want everyone to get on board and to ensure that their own communities are participating. We wish those who are hosting trial sites all the best in going forward.


One of the other issues that we had during the hearings was that, whilst this is the framework that outlines what we are going to do, there are a lot of draft rules that sit under this framework—on who is in, who is out, definitions, details et cetera—that will go to the functioning of this. For the committee to get a draft of those only on the final day of hearings, on Tuesday, 5 March, to have a bit of a look at prior to producing a report, was concerning. The government has indicated that potentially there is a lot more to come in terms of draft rules. It would have been nice, as a committee, to have been able to consider this issue as a whole. The coalition want the NDIS to be a success. We want the launch sites to go smoothly. We stand ready to work with the government in all jurisdictions to make the NDIS a reality. If we spend all this money, we need to be sure we end up with a better system.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:42):  I would like to start my contribution to the debate on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013by quoting from the Community Affairs Legislation Committee report into the bill:


The committee heard overwhelming support for the introduction of an NDIS. The committee did not hear from a single submitter, be that an organisation or an individual, that did not support the introduction of some form of structural and funding overhaul of the provision of disability services and support. … none thought the status quo provided adequate and equitable access to services.


I also would like to quote from the evidence provided by DANA, Disability Advocacy Network Australia, who said:


The significance of the NDIS cannot be overstated. It has the potential to be the most important change to the provision of support for people with disability to occur in any nation, at any time.


This is a historic day in the history of our nation. For the first time, we will see the establishment of a National Disability Insurance Scheme. As many in this debate have said, and as Senator McKenzie said in her contribution to the debate, this is a reform whose time has come. It is a reform the government is proud to be delivering. As has been commented on, and as Minister Macklin said in her contribution, it is rare that a proposed reform strikes such a chord with so many of us across party lines. The consensus in the parliament reflects the consensus in the Australian community. It is indeed a historic day. 


This is a scheme that will transform the lives of people with disability, their families and carers. The NDIS will provide people with the care and support they need when they need it by giving them greater control over the services they require to lead fulfilling lives. For too long disability support services have failed those who need them most, which is why we are implementing the NDIS. Many people are born with or acquire a disability; in fact, on average in Australia, every 30 minutes someone is diagnosed with a significant disability. In a modern Australian society it is beholden upon us to deliver care and support to someone with a disability that affords them the dignity and the opportunity to lead a full life. We want to provide support for people with a disability so that they can live in society and have the same opportunities as those without a disability.


Before I get into the detail of the bill we are debating today I want to take the Senate back to how we got to where we are today. The government, through the then Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, the Hon. Bill Shorten MP, asked the Productivity Commission to hold a public inquiry and report on a long-term disability care and support scheme. The Productivity Commission's report on disability care and support was released by the Prime Minister in August 2011, and all governments agreed with its recommendation to establish a national disability insurance scheme. In last year's budget the government set aside $1 billion over four years from 2012-13 to help roll out the launch sites in South Australia, Tasmania, the ACT, the Hunter region in New South Wales and the Barwon area in Victoria. All together, the launch sites will make real the NDIS for around 26,000 people.


From July 2013 in South Australia the NDIS will be launched focusing on children aged from birth to five who have significant and permanent disability. From 2014 the age limit will be extended to 13. In the third year of the launch, children up to the age of 14 will be included. It is expected around 5,000 children will be covered under the first stage of the scheme.


In my home state of Tasmania the first stage of the scheme will cover young people aged 15 to 24 from 1 July 2013. This is expected to cover around 1,000 Tasmanians. I look forward to seeing the Tasmanian government reaching an agreement with the federal government so that people with disability across Tasmania can be supported by a full scheme. That age group has been selected as it is a highly important time in a young person's life as they are transitioning from high school into work and/or further studies. The NDIS will offer this age group the opportunity to receive greater levels of support and assistance to lead fulfilling lives as they leave school and are faced with options of work or further study.



I have to say that in Tasmania the news of the state being named as a launch site was met with significant optimism and excitement.People genuinely feel this scheme will change lives by providing a new way to care and support people with a disability. While I have this opportunity I also want to acknowledge the passionate advocates in my home state for tirelessly advocating for a NDIS not just since the Productivity Commission's report but for many, many years.5I believe this passionate grassroots campaign, supported by the strong commitment and work of the state Labor government, played a key role in helping Tasmania secure one of the launch sites.




In the ACT from July 2013 the government will deliver enhanced services and commence preparations for a full launch
,


and 
in July 2014 the NDIS will fully commence in the ACT.


The NDIS launch site in the ACT is expected to cover up to 5,000 people
,
 an increase from the 1,400 who currently receive specialised disability services.


In N
ew 
S
outh 
W
ales
 the Hunter region will be used as the launch site
, and it w
ill be phased in over three years across the local government areas of Newcastle, Lake Macquarie and Maitland.


This is expected to benefit around 10,000 people with disability in N
ew 
S
outh 
W

.
 I
n Victoria the NDIS will commence from July 2013 in the Barwon area
,
 covering the 
c
ity of Greater Geelong, the Colac


Otway 
s
hire, the Surf Coast 
s
hire and the 
b
orough of Queenscliff
e
.


These launch sites 
for the scheme are vital because th
ey will play a key role in identifying what works well on the ground in practice and what we may have to look at tweaking to ensure that we get this highly a
nticipated
 scheme working as it is intended.





The 
b
ill will have two key purposes
: to 
establish the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the associated framework for the 
s
cheme's operation
 and also to 
establish the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency, which will operated the first stage of the scheme 
through 
the launch sites that I have just spoken about.


The framework of the scheme will implement items such as eligibility, reasonable and necessary support
s
 and goal based plans for participants.





This framework is reflective of the principles agreed at COAG between the Prime Minister and the 
s
tates.
 It 
include
s: g
iving people with disability individual care and support
s
 based on their needs
; g
iving people real choice and control over these supports
, 
meaning more control over their lives
; e
nding a situation where people are
 not


told what support is available, or how to access that support
; 
and
 f
ostering innovative services that are delivered and coordinated locally.


The scheme is designed to move away from the crisis model where families only receive support if they are unable to continue in their caring role and there are no other options.


This scheme is designed to work with families before they reach this stage and make sure the valuable care they provide can be sustained by giving great
er
 government support.





The scheme will also look at taking a lifelong approach to supporting someone with a disability by focusing on early intervention, particularly when there is good evidence that it will substantially improve a person's functioning.


Of course
,
 significant consultation and work was undertaken with states and territories 
and with 
people with disability, their families, carers, disability workers, service providers and advocates on the design, funding and governance of the scheme.




As I mentioned, the 
b
ill also establishes the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency as a body that is independent from the government.


It will be the responsibility of the 
a
gency to deliver the scheme as well as performing a range of functions
,
 including managing the financial sustainability of the scheme, building community awareness about disability and undertaking research about disability and the social contributors to disability.

The agency will be overseen by a board that is made up of people with extensive experience in the provision or use of disability services and in financial management, governance and the operation of insurance schemes, as well as an advisory council made up of people who have lived with the experience of disability and caring.


As a member of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee I had the opportunity to be involved in the Senate inquiry into the NDIS Bill. The committee heard wide-ranging evidence on the benefits of the scheme and potential areas that required improvement. I am pleased that through this committee process and other means the government has made a number of amendments to improve the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill. I am pleased that the parliament has been able to come together, leave past partisanship at the door and deliver a piece of public policy that will improve the lives of so many Australians.


Before I finish I want to acknowledge the passionate community campaign that has been running for many years to see the implementation of the NDIS run by the disability and carer community, providers and unions. I believe that the momentum generated by the thousands of passionate advocates from around Australia ensured that governments from all levels worked together to see that the scheme was put in place and launched, because we know the current support system is underfunded and unfair. We are now faced with the launch sites and then proceeding to the full implementation of the scheme. This NDIS Bill, as Minister Macklin has stated, has the rights of people with disability, their families and carers at its heart and:


The bill will implement a nationwide, demand driven system of care tailored to the needs of each individual and established on a durable, long-term basis.


Failing is simply not an option. The eyes of people with a disability and their families and carers are upon us. It is now our job as elected representatives to ensure that this scheme improves the lives of people with a disability.


I also want to acknowledge in my contribution here today the significant work of the Minister for Disability Reform, Jenny Macklin MP, as well as the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers, Senator Jan McLucas. They have both done an extraordinary amount of work as the driving forces behind ensuring this legislation has come to fruition. I am sure that this is an extremely proud day for Minister Macklin and Senator McLucas as this bill is debated and we see it progress into law.


As the Prime Minister said in her speech in the House on the NDIS Bill:


The NDIS will stand alongside the minimum wage, the age pension, Medicare and universal superannuation as one of the great Labor pillars of social justice and opportunity for all Australians. It will change our society in profound and lasting ways, enabling those who live with disability to fulfil their potential as valued and valuable members of our society. 


I commend the National Disability Insurance Scheme to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,23,2,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2013-03-19,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:55):  I will start by joining Senator Brown in acknowledging the work that carers do in looking after their charges, those with disabilities, however they came by those disabilities. Indeed, those of us who do not have that duty and responsibility, I guess, can never quite fully understand the trials and tribulations—and, I guess, the joys—of those who spend their lifetimes looking after others. I want to acknowledge them.


I also want to pay tribute to Senator Mitch Fifield for the work that he has done over a long period of time with the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the way he has, in a quiet, non-political way, pushed to make sure that this bill—the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013—ended up where it is today. It is not a bill that we should be involving in the normal political discourse back and forward, and I was a bit disappointed in Senator Brown's speech—a good speech though it was right until the end, when she sought to make some political capital out of an issue which clearly has political support across the board.


I guess all of us in our lives have come across people who worry about their offspring who have a disability—people who worry about what will happen when they pass on. Indeed, some of the best friends of my wife and me had a disabled child. They were very good friends of ours and we were quite close to them, but at times—be it in sober moments or not so sober moments, and there were many of those—there was always this underlying concern in their otherwise quite happy lives about what would happen to the young fellow if something happened to them. It was something that I learnt in those days about the anguish that people, particularly parents, suffer. In fact, in my own family and my wife's family, there is a similar situation where people growing old wonder what will happen to the disabled people once they themselves pass on. I know that an uncle of Lesley's never quite knew exactly how to deal with that situation but left a lot of money to try and ensure that there was someone there to look after the disabled person when he passed on. So it has certainly been a traumatic issue for many families from time immemorial. In my practice as a country solicitor for many years before I came into this place, often people would come to me and talk about these issues when drawing up their wills; they would try to work out the best way to handle things. Indeed, you could again see the anguish and concern that they experienced in trying to work out what needed to be done.


The one good thing—in fact, the only good thing—that I can see that came out of the 2020 Summit in 2008 was this proposal for a national disability insurance scheme. You might recall that that was the summit that was to have all these great ideas for Australia but which turned into nothing more than a talkfest, it having faded into insignificance and into the backs of everyone's memory since 2008. But there was one proposal that came out of that and that was this proposal for a national disability insurance scheme. It was a concept that was conceived by Mr John Walsh and Mr Bruce Bonyhady, who talked about it at that 2020 Summit in 2008.


The introduction of the National Disability Insurance Scheme that we are dealing with today does have cross-party support at both federal and state level. Again, regrettably, some people have attempted to make some political capital out of it by accusing the states of not doing this or not doing that. That is regrettable, because I know that all of the state governments, be they of whatever political persuasion, support across the board an insurance scheme for the disabled that we are dealing with today. As my leader, Tony Abbott, said quite clearly and unequivocally: 'The NDIS is an idea whose time has come.'


The level of support that a person with a disability receives can depend on many factors. It might depend on where they live, whether that disability is congenital or whether it was acquired and, if acquired, that it was at the workplace or due a motor vehicle accident or in some other context. Workers compensation and motor vehicle accident insurance provides coverage in some states, but if you are born with a disability or acquire disability later in life, it can be a different story, and we can see long waiting lists and queues. The result is that many people with a disability are left without the assistance they need. As I said at the beginning of my speech, the instance of parents worrying about the assistance that will come to the disabled person when they pass on has also been a real issue.


The coalition has always enthusiastically supported every step along the road to the achievement of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. You will recall, Deputy President, that we supported the initial work of the Productivity Commission and we also supported the $1 billion that was set aside in last year's budget, although we queried whether this was the appropriate amount in view of what the Productivity Commission had said. Deputy President, you would also be aware that we in the coalition supported the five launch sites and we supported the agreement between the Commonwealth and New South Wales for a full statewide rollout of the proposal. Indeed, we also support this legislation.


If I have one hesitation about my leader, Mr Abbott, it is that he always seems to be so fit, riding around the country on a bicycle and doing things like surf swimmers, long-distance runs and long-distance bicycle rides. I just wonder if anyone who is that fit and spends so much time with that sort of extreme activity is an appropriate leader for me! But that is the only thing for which that I would ever hesitate in my support for Mr Abbott! I say that, for the written record, tongue in cheek. I also raise that to indicate that I was very proud when Tony Abbott—I am always very proud when he does all of his pollie pedals, as they are called. Over the years he has raised a great deal of money for charity through a pollie pedal which he initiated many years ago now. I am particularly pleased that he has made what can be seen as a personal commitment to Australians with a disability and particularly for those who care for them by dedicating some $540,000 raised by the 2012 Pollie Pedal charity bike ride to Carers Australia.


It was good to see news reports of that pollie pedal bike ride. It was 1,000 kilometres. Fortunately, he did not ask me to join him, but I know that some of my colleagues did. Along that 1,000 kilometre route Mr Abbott met with people with a disability, with carers and with disability organisations. I understand that the next two pollie pedals that he is involved in will also be in partnership with and help raise funds for Carers Australia.


We believe that a National Disability Insurance Scheme can be delivered within the timeframe recommended by the Productivity Commission and we think that a government acting responsibly and prudently—managing well the finances of the country—can do that.


We have tried to offer support to the current government through the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee, to be chaired by both sides of politics, to oversee the establishment and implementation of the NDIS. As I understand it, that has not actually been agreed to by the current government. I may be wrong in that and, if I am, I apologise. But if I am not wrong and they have not agreed to that then I would certainly urge those senators taking part in the debate to impose upon their leadership to agree to a joint parliamentary committee so that we can take the politics out of it and actually achieve a serious result—a bipartisan result—for something that is, without question, as Tony Abbott said, at its time now.


This is a once in a generation reform that will evolve over many parliaments of this country. It will not be the property of any particular party or group; it will be the property of the parliament as a whole, on behalf of the Australian people. I think that is very important. We need to get it right, and that requires a very high level of consultation and attention to detail not just now but from now until the full implementation.


I could say that this government has not been anywhere near the top of the class when it comes to consultation. Very often, things are done on the spur of the moment for the wrong reason and without proper thought being given to how things will be funded. I would hope that, in the instance of this particular initiative of many, many people, there is that appropriate very high level of consultation and attention to detail. That is why I thought the idea of a joint parliamentary oversight committee would be very, very useful.


I am pleased to see that a colleague of mine, my local federal member, Mr George Christensen, the member for Dawson, moved a motion in the House of Representatives to establish this non-partisan joint committee some time ago. Unfortunately, those who control the agenda in the House of Representatives have not seen fit to bring that motion to a vote at the present time. Again, I would urge those senators from the other side of the chamber taking part in this debate to impose upon their leaders to bring that motion forward for a vote in the other place so that the House can, in a bipartisan way, express support for that suggestion.


In our own chamber, Senator Fifield moved the same sort of motion to establish that oversight committee, and it is of some genuine regret to me that the Labor Party and the Greens political party combined together in the Senate to vote that down. That seemed to be contrary to the spirit of the way in which this legislation has been dealt with. I know that my leader, Mr Abbott, reiterated the offer at a recent Press Club speech when he said, and I quote:


The Coalition is so committed to the National Disability Insurance Scheme, for instance, that we’ve offered to co-chair a bi-partisan parliamentary committee so that support for it doesn’t flag across the three terms of parliament and among the nine different governments needed to make it work.


What Mr Abbott was very rightly saying and drawing attention to is that this is not something that one political party in one parliament can deal with in the time that they happen to be the government of the country. I do not make any comment on opinion polls but, should the government of Australia change later on this year, it will be important that the new government has been involved in this process from the very start and that the current government continues to be involved, and the same must be said right across the states of Australia.


The first stage of this scheme, as I understand, will benefit more than 20,000 people with disabilities, their families and their carers living in South Australia, the ACT, Tasmania, the Hunter in New South Wales and the Barwon area of Victoria—and it will indeed go on further than that. It is something that I very much support.


I note the remarks of my senate colleagues in the very detailed Community Affairs Legislation Committee report on this bill. I note the submissions that have been made to the committee during their presentation. I particularly note that the first hearing of the committee was held in my base city of Townsville. I was pleased to see so many people from the Townsville community—the Mental Illness Fellowship of North Queensland; the Townsville Independence Program for Adult Community Living; Community Connections; Supported Options in Lifestyle and Access Services Inc; Deaf Services Queensland; a very significant group in the North Queensland area simply called Cootharinga; the independent advisory Townsville service; the Ingham Disability Support Services group; and Inclusion Works—appear before the committee. They were just some of the ones from the north who made submissions, and they were the ones who were called before the committee to give their evidence in person. I thank them all for the evidence they gave. The suggestions and comments that they put forward have helped get us to where we are at the present time. I support the bill.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2013-03-19,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (18:14):  I rise to speak to this landmark legislation, the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013. There are times when the din of public debate recedes and the actions of members and senators of this place combine to bring into sharpest relief the role of government. We are reminded in those moments for what purpose Australians from one of the diverse and liberal populations of the world have wrought a society that understands itself as a single community, each part supported by the other. We have built our nation on a guarantee of fairness and a guarantee of egalitarianism, a society that acknowledges that together we built the conditions in which any one of us might make a prosperous life and that we owe to it each other to ensure that prosperity is shared.


This is a nation that acknowledges that, no matter the different circumstances into which our children are born, all Australians should have access to the best possible education system. We acknowledge that effort should be fairly rewarded with decent wages and conditions for those who labour at an honest day's work. And we acknowledge that our commitment to Australia can be honoured in a sincere exchange of customs and heritage so that culture is no barrier to success.


Yet every day many Australians are diagnosed with a significant disability, either congenital or acquired through accident or misfortune. For many, their disability will cause them to drop out of the Australia most of us experience. Instead of participating in a vibrant national life, their experience may be shaped by the constraints of isolation, poverty, stress and insecurity. Many struggle with the cost of care, with treatment and with equipment. Even more grapple with issues of dependence that make carers of family and friends and amplify the consequences of disability.


The approach most people living with disability have been forced to take has been ad hoc. It has sought to deal with issues as they arose and as finances, time and energy allowed, all too often without the level of control and choice that they need. So too has the government's approach to disability been characterised by inconsistency, with budget allocations failing to take account of the true cost of disability or plan for the longer term. 


While it has been clear for some time that this approach is not satisfactory, serious reform in this area has eluded successive governments—not even having found its way onto the agenda of the previous coalition government. I am pleased to say that the Gillard Labor government has placed disability reform firmly on the agenda for the nation and, encouraged by the strongest indications of community support through the Every Australian Counts campaign, has developed this new policy response from the ground up. 


The National Disability Insurance Scheme and the bill before the Senate right now are part of extending the Australian pledge of a fair go to all people, including those living with disability. It will replace the current funding model with an insurance-like scheme based on actuarial analysis and a philosophy that shares the costs of disability services across the community. Rather than simply funding central services, it will allow funding to be directed towards eligible individuals' ongoing support needs and enable people to exercise more choice and control in their lives through individualised funding. In doing so, it will give effect to the principles outlined in the international agreements to which Australia is party, especially the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, especially those articles that urge a sense of independence and self-determination. Similarly, it will help to deliver those principles under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in that it will enhance the expression of the fundamental human rights of people living with disabilities.


The principles underpinning the National Disability Insurance Scheme are expressed, as they should be, in terms of human rights and the ability of people living with disability to exercise choice. But the NDIS is not simply a statement of principles. It is more than a reprioritising or reshaping of disability support in this country. It is also significantly expanding the level of support for people who need assistance in taking control of their lives. This bill creates a new agency, the NDIS Launch Transition Agency, to provide for the first stage of the rollout of the NDIS and demonstrate the model by assisting more than 20,000 people living with disability, their families and their carers living in South Australia, Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory, the Hunter in New South Wales and the Barwon area of Victoria. These launch sites, funded with a $1 billion commitment from the Gillard Labor government, will begin the implementation of the NDIS from 1 July this year.


I am pleased and proud that Tasmania has been chosen as a launch site and I want to acknowledge the strength and energy of those campaigners in my home state of Tasmania who have fought long and hard for an NDIS—of course for their state, but also in recognition of the challenges faced by all Australians living with disability—people such as Margaret Reynolds, somebody from whom wise counsel is assured, whether as a former senator or in her previous role at National Disability Services Director; and also David Clements, the current state manager of NDS; and extraordinary organisations like Baptcare and the Brain Injury Association. Their work has meant that, from 1 July 2013, all eligible 15-24-year-olds in Tasmania—estimated at around 1,000 people—will be covered by the new National Disability Insurance Scheme. 


Tasmania is an ideal location for the initial implementation of this project. Not only is it by virtue of its size, geography and governance a relatively flexible place to be first mover on such a scheme; it is also in pressing need of enhanced disability support. Partly as a result of its demography, Tasmania has the highest prevalence of disability out of all states in our country. Subsequently, the effect of disability is most acutely felt in Tasmania and the principles of the NDIS more sorely needed. It is my sincere hope that the greater provision of tailored care, decided, directed and ultimately employed by those affected by disability, will ease its burden and allow the young Tasmanians who will be amongst the first users of the NDIS to shape their own destiny. 


It should never be that a young person suffering an acquired nerve injury from a bicycle accident is relegated to a nursing home because of lack of care or that a person should have to forgo the most routine conveniences because of a normally easily repaired home design issue. In a community as wealthy and as privileged as Australia we should never allow the vicissitudes of accident and luck to override the autonomy of our brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, neighbours and friends.


Like the grand architecture of Medicare, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, our public education system and our award wage system—the rest of our social safety net, most of which results from the efforts of community activists and Labor governments—we must make the legacy of our success a society in which we can all take part. We must make a promise to all Australians that we will never abandon them or leave them behind so long as we have the capacity to move forward together. The NDIS will take us forward together. I am proud to be part of a Labor government responsible for this new social compact, and I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2013-03-19,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (18:23):  I will leave the broader debate surrounding this bill to my colleagues, particularly the ever-eloquent Senator Fifield, and confine my remarks to just one issue: the protection of privacy of individuals under this act. I have spoken about this issue over the years in various different contexts and I do so because privacy reflects the great tension in our democratic life between the quest for individual autonomy on one hand and the impulse for community on the other—a great philosophical, moral, social and political battle. There is never any easy answer, but even here today on the National Disability Scheme Bill 2013 those issues are again alive. I will confine my remarks just to the issue.


I am concerned that in its current form the bill does not adequately protect the privacy concerns that scheme participants and service providers may have in relation to the handling of their data. First, section 60 of the bill allows any person to obtain, make a record of, disclose or otherwise use protected information held by the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency if it relates to the purposes of the bill. This potentially represents a broad infringement of privacy rights because the objects of the bill, set out in section 3, are highly generic. They include, for example:


… support the independence and social and economic participation of people with disability; and


…   …   …


raise community awareness of the issues that affect the social and economic participation of people with disability, and facilitate greater community inclusion of people with disability.


These are broad, highly generic terms.


In promoting these wide-ranging objectives, it is the privacy rights of scheme participants that are expected to give way. Moreover, according to subsection 60(3) of the bill, obtaining, recording, disclosing or using information will be taken to be for the purposes of the bill if the CEO of the agency believes on reasonable grounds that it is reasonably necessary to facilitate research or actuarial analysis into matters relevant to the scheme or, even more broadly, to facilitate policy development.


This provides an executive official with considerable discretion over the privacy rights of scheme participants. It is concerning that these rights, under the express terms of the bill, are subject to such generic matters as policy development. Surely, some thought should be given to the development of much clearer guidelines with respect to the exercise of this discretion. I note that such guidelines are not included in any of the draft NDIS rules released on 5 March.


Section 66 of the bill enables the CEO of the agency to disclose NDIS information if the CEO certifies that it is necessary to do so in the public interest. The CEO may also disclose information to the secretary, chief executive or head of a Commonwealth, state or territory department or authority for the purposes of that department or authority.


These provisions significantly expand the disclosure powers of the CEO and might further undermine the privacy rights of scheme participants. The draft NDIS Rules for the Protection and Disclosure of Information do not impose defined guidelines to limit the exercise of the CEO's discretion. For example, in considering whether to issue a public interest certificate, the CEO is required under clause 4.3 of the rules to consider whether:


… the person to whom the information will be disclosed has sufficient interest in the information. 


A person will have sufficient interest in NDIS information if the person has:


… a genuine and legitimate interest in the information …


These criteria hardly alleviate concerns about the abrogation of privacy rights under the bill. Indeed, the rules simply replace one set of broad criteria with another. The end result is that there is a threat to privacy rights under the NDIS bill and its accompanying rules as currently drafted.


At section 12.7 of its 2011 inquiry report entitled Disability Care and Support, the Productivity Commission argues that any national disability insurance scheme must preserve the confidentiality and privacy of data provided by scheme participants. The Productivity Commission recommends, among other things: de-identifying scheme data; imposing conditions on how data can be used by researchers, for example, through enforceable undertakings; and requiring researchers to comply with principles regarding responsible and ethical research conduct. These matters are not expressly dealt with in the bill or the draft NDIS rules.


Some protection is afforded under the newly-created Australian Privacy Principles set out in the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Actthat was passed late last year and is due to commence in March 2014. For example, clause 6.4 of the sixth Australian Privacy Principle requires the de-identification of data collected by an agency prior to disclosure to another entity.


However, while the Australian Privacy Principles will apply to the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency, as a Commonwealth public agency, it is unclear what privacy protections will apply to the handling of information by the wide range of other entities that are likely to be involved in the NDIS. In particular, I note that the 'small business exemption' applying to any business with an annual turnover of less than $3 million has been retained in the formulation of the new Australian Privacy Principles. Further, state public agencies are not covered by the Australian Privacy Principles and not all of the states—specifically Western Australia and South Australia—have in place similar privacy arrangements to the Commonwealth scheme.


In its submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry into the bill, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner said:


Given the amount of personal information that will be collected and used under the Scheme, it will be important to ensure appropriate and consistent coverage of all participating entities under privacy law.


It is crucial that a uniform approach to privacy protection is mandated under the bill.


I note that the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs will be conducting a privacy impact assessment in relation to the NDIS. While I welcome this development as a means of considering in further detail the privacy implications of the scheme, it is unfortunate that the Senate could not have had the benefit of this analysis before being called upon to pass the bill and to debate the issues.


It is also disappointing that the Senate standing committee's final report dealt with the privacy implications of the bill in less than two pages, and in those two pages did not really provide any substantive policy analysis. The standing committee's conclusion in relation to the privacy implications of the bill is simply that:


Department officials are scheduled to meet with the Australian Information Commissioner to discuss the concerns outlined in his submission. The Committee anticipates that if any amendment to the provisions that ensure consistency across jurisdictions was required, this would be considered by the Department.


Again, it would have been useful for privacy concerns in relation to the bill to have been properly assessed and brought to the attention of the Senate before the debate here this evening.


The protection of privacy rights is by no means a 'side-issue' that we can allow to slide under the radar. As we saw last week when the government announced its new media law package, Australians do not take the abrogation of privacy rights and freedom of speech lightly. Indeed, the protection of privacy and freedom of speech are foundations of the society that we live in today. It is important that any debate about privacy rights takes place in the public domain upon a consideration of all the relevant circumstances and implications. In the event that the privacy impact assessment finds that there are gaps with respect to privacy protection under the bill, the parliament must ensure that these gaps are remedied without delay by amending the NDIS legislation as passed.

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (18:34):  I speak in support of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Bill 2013. At the outset I would like to congratulate and thank all who have worked over many years and decades to make this bill and this scheme a reality. We are lucky in some respects that those who have worked to make this happen know a little bit about what overcoming adversity and succeeding against the odds is all about. I am of course referring to the more than 400,000 Australians that live every day with a significant or permanent disability. It is because of their determination, tenacity, energy and bravery that the NDIS is poised to make a real and lasting difference to the way this nation treats its disabled citizens, and I pay tribute to them and thank them for that.


The bill establishes the framework for the NDIS, a new program for funding care and support for people with a disability. It is intended to commence for full access across Australia from 2018. The bill also establishes the NDIS Launch Transition Agency, the body that will manage the first stage of the NDIS in five locations around Australia from July 2013.


For many years now Australians who suffer from a disability and their carers and their families have not been able to access adequate levels of financial support and care. By many accounts, the system in place charged with ensuring that these people can enjoy a full, rewarding life free of discrimination has in some respects failed them. Problems that have been identified with the system have ranged from the sheer complexity of the current system, the failure of funded services to meet demand and differential treatment depending on how someone acquires their disability. These are deficiencies that really should not be allowed to endure in modern-day Australia, particularly in the light of significant projections of increase in the number of people who will live in our society into the future with a severe or profound disability.


In 2009, the Australian government commissioned the Productivity Commission to investigate the feasibility of a national disability insurance scheme. The commission subsequently found that:


The current disability support system is underfunded, unfair, fragmented, and inefficient, which gives people with a disability little choice and no certainty of access to appropriate supports. The stresses on the system are growing with little costs.


As a solution, the commission proposed that the NDIS provide insurance to all Australians who acquire a significant disability, provide support through the provision of information and referral services and provide long-term care and support to the around 410,000 Australians living with significant and ongoing disability.


The scheme will be launched in five sites across Australia from July 2013. The first stage of the scheme will begin in South Australia, Tasmania, the ACT, the Hunter in New South Wales and the Barwon region in Victoria, and will benefit more than 20,000 people living with disability, their families and their carers. I am proud to say that in my state, the federal government has reached a long-term agreement with the New South Wales government to fund and deliver the National Disability Insurance Scheme in 2018. I offer credit and thanks to the New South Wales government for working with the federal government on a long-term delivery solution for this important scheme.


The framework of the NDIS will bring long-term certainty to the resourcing of disability care and support, so that people with disability can feel secure that they will get what they need over their lifetime. The scheme will respond to each individuals' goals and aspirations for their life, and will plan with each person to take account for their individual circumstances; this will include support for carers and other informal and community supports that are important to the person living with disability.


The scheme will work with families in their role as carers, ensuring they are not overwhelmed by the task and can continue to provide valuable informal care. The scheme will also focus on intensive early learning intervention, particularly where it is evident that it will substantially improve a person's predicament, or slow the progression of their disability over their lifetime.


In Australia, a person with a disability has a poverty risk around 2.7 times that of a person without a disability. This scheme recognises the importance, where possible, of helping people with a disability to get back into the workforce.


The government has heard the frustration and desperation of people with a disability, who are sick and tired of being, in many respects, second-class citizens, one of whom, Tricia Malowney, wrote a compelling article last year about her plight as an Australian with a disability. She said:


I am a 20 per cent-er - one of the approximately 20 per cent of Australians who have a disability. The majority of us are underfunded (or not funded at all) for the supports we need to participate fully as Australian citizens. Australians with disabilities cross all demographics. We come from all socio economic sectors, we live in the city and we live in rural locations. We come from CALD backgrounds and we are Indigenous and refugees. We are married, we are single, we are parents and carers. We are LGBTI and we are straight.


We do not have the same impairments, but we share the same social disadvantage.


…   …   …


So, we've had enough … - we need the NDIS and we need it now.


Well, to Tricia, and all of those who have been campaigning for many, many years for this invaluable and important reform, I am proud to say that—and proud to be part of—a Labor government has heard you and is delivering this important reform. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2013-03-19,"



Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales) (18:41):  Before I begin my remarks this evening, I want to indicate to the chamber and for the record, that I dedicate my speech tonight to my very good friend Liam Hitchen, who is a thirteen-year-old boy in Orchard Hills in Western Sydney, for whom this will make an extraordinary difference.


I want to begin by acknowledging the sentiments of my colleague Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, and say, as he did, 'The NDIS is an idea whose time has come.' The fact that Australians with disabilities deserve a better deal than they are getting is something that both sides of this chamber can agree about. The current system could best be described as a patchwork quilt. It is something that I have heard time and time again from disability advocates in Western Sydney in particular. That view was only reinforced by the 1,600 or so submissions that were made to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee.


It is clear that many people with disabilities and their families simply do not know where to go for help. Different states have different systems, and there are different conditions for those with congenital conditions and for those who acquire them during the course of their lives—at home, or on the road or at work. They have to navigate a maze of insurance forms, state departments, federal departments, and inevitably, queues wherever they turn. The process is enough to make some people just give up, and we do need to streamline the system to prevent this from happening.


We need to provide support on a needs basis rather than rationing, with the entitlement for support going to the individual. The individual needs to be able to pick the aids, the equipment and support services that they need, and this is at the heart of the Productivity Commission's report into support for people with disabilities, which, as my colleague Senator Fifield has indicated, the coalition strongly supports. The Productivity Commission approach provides the blueprint for how this scheme should operate. As well as supporting that Productivity Commission approach, we also supported the $1 billion provided by the government in the last budget. We supported the five launch sites, we supported the agreement between the Commonwealth and New South Wales for a full state-wide rollout following the Hunter launch and, importantly, we support this legislation.


At this point, I also want to acknowledge the leadership and commitment of the New South Wales Minister for Disability Services, the Hon. Andrew Constance, the member for Bega. His work in this area and his commitment to making sure that the NDIS happens, and happens for the people that he serves and cares for in New South Wales, is without parallel. He is an exceptional minister, and he is serving those people with a dedication that, some days, is stunning.


This scheme will complement the work of organisations that I have had a great deal to do with in recent years: organisations like the Nepean Area Disabilities Organisation in Penrith; Great Community Transport, which serves the Blue Mountains and the Nepean area; the Penrith Disabilities Resource Centre; the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children; the Thorndale Foundation; and Northcott Disability Services in Parramatta. I have met with representatives from those organisations on many occasions and even recently with Senator Fifield, who was in Western Sydney for a meeting with those organisations at a round table in Emu Plains. Top of their agenda is the NDIS. For people like Denise Heath from the Nepean Area Disabilities Organisation and Denise Roberts from the Penrith Disabilities Resource Centre this is a seminal moment in how they do their jobs and how their organisations operate. I must say that, although I knew them to be highly competent and efficient heads of their various organisations, the forethought and consideration they displayed on that day to both Senator Fifield and me of how their organisations may work within the NDIS was extremely impressive.


In implementing this agenda we will obviously continue to engage with disability advocates every step of the way to ensure that we have the best National Disability Insurance Scheme. We on the coalition side of the chamber believe the NDIS can be delivered within the Productivity Commission's time frame and we stand ready to work with the government to see the NDIS delivered as soon as possible.


We do perhaps disagree on one issue. A number of those on the other side of this chamber and elsewhere continue to say that the NDIS represents quintessentially Labor values. I think that is somewhat disappointing. This is not something that should represent the values that are synonymous with one political party. It should be above politics. This NDIS represents Australian values. It is about helping those who are less fortunate and face extra challenges that are beyond their control. We do not intend to and would not brand this as a Liberal scheme or a coalition scheme, and I am disappointed that some on the other side are trying to do the same.


The NDIS is a person-centred and self-directed funding model that aims to empower individuals, not governments, to reduce the red tape and the hassle that people face. This represents a real turning point for people with disabilities and their carers. We have to do everything possible to ensure that we get it right. This is a once-in-a-generation reform that will unfold over the life of several parliaments and it should be owned by the parliament as a whole and by the people the parliament represents, not any particular political party. To that end the coalition has called for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to be chaired by both sides of the political divide to oversee the implementation of the NDIS.


In a debate last week I spoke about the effectiveness of parliamentary joint committees. On that occasion I was discussing constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. These committees can be extremely effective bodies. A parliamentary oversight committee would unite all of the parties and would provide a non-partisan environment where the design and eligibility could be completed cooperatively. I think that is a very important concept in this discussion. My colleague from the other place Mr George Christensen, the member for Dawson, has had a motion in the House of Representatives to establish this committee for some time but, unfortunately, it has not yet been brought forward for a vote. My colleagues Senator Fifield and Senator Boyce moved in June last year a very similar motion to that to establish an oversight committee but it was voted down by the Labor Party and the Australian Greens.


So I renew the coalition's call today for the government to accept our offer of a non-partisan parliamentary oversight committee. We will be moving an amendment to this bill to establish such a committee. I heard Senator Thistlethwaite as he concluded his remarks this evening acknowledge the effective work done between the Liberal government in New South Wales and the federal government here in Canberra. There is no reason why we cannot extend that to make it even more constructive to establish such a parliamentary oversight committee.


Every government in Australia wants the National Disability Insurance Scheme, so it is disappointing when we see some people put politics above those wishes. The COAG meeting before last was a fairly good example of that. The persistence of the New South Wales and Victorian Liberal governments to withstand some pretty heated attacks that they received from the federal government meant that we did end up with agreement to host launch sites. We continue to ask the Prime Minister to adopt a more cooperative approach—something that has been missing in a number of instances from the Commonwealth's dealings with the states and territories up until now.

Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Government Whip in the Senate) (18:50):  Today is a monumental day for South Australians and for the future of the Murray-Darling Basin. After years of disagreement and decades of overallocation and constant bickering amongst states today is the day when the plan is finally locked in. The disallowance period will expire at the end of this parliamentary sitting and after over a century of tug of war between the states we will be able to celebrate the fact that South Australians will once and for all see a permanent return of 3,200 billion litres of water to our river. The Murray-Darling Basin reforms are a major milestone in the health of the river.


When I say these changes to the river have been a long time coming I really mean it. Back in February I had the pleasure of meeting with Bev and John Lowe, a couple from Western Australia, who are relatives of former South Australian senator William Senior. He was a senator in the early years of the 20th century. I did a bit of research about Senator Senior before I met with Bev and John purely out of interest and so I could learn a little more about him. Reading his Governor-General's address-in-reply speech from 1914 I was shocked. Would you believe that back then, in May 1914, almost 99 years ago, there was heated debate in this place, which was down the road a bit then, about the future of the river? Senator Senior was concerned even back then about the plight, the future and the health of the river Murray. That was before we knew the scientific effects of climate change and before we knew how catastrophic global warming could be. Yet Senator Senior recognised that the state of the river Murray was one which should be of national concern.


Former Senator Senior came face to face with the same narrow-mindedness that has plagued the issue for more than a century. In retaliation to interjections during his address-in-reply speech, Senator Senior said:


I grant that the water may fall in Queensland, or in New South Wales, or by the mere veering of the wind, in Victoria; but after all, its' origin seems to me to indicate that we should regard it as a gift for Australia, and the object of our legislation should be to make the greatest use of it, not for NSW, or Victoria or South Australia, but for Australia as a whole.


The senator went on to say that the issue should be treated as an issue for the whole nation and not just for those states that are along the river. He said:


There has not been, as there should have been, a general appreciation of the fact that the waters belong as much to others to whom they are conveyed by the river as to the people on whose land the rain from heaven has fallen.


Senator Senior was not the first to voice his concerns in this place and he most certainly was not the last, as the debate over the allocation of the Murray-Darling continued for the rest of the 20th century and moved with us into the 21st century as well. But if it were not for local people voicing their concerns about the river, I doubt we would be celebrating the finalisation of the plan that we are celebrating today.


Today I had the pleasure of meeting Henry Jones, a water warrior, a Clayton resident and a man who has fought passionately to secure the river's health down in the Lower Lakes and Coorong region where he lives at Clayton. Henry and his wife, Gloria, travelled across from Adelaide last night to be here for this momentous day. A sixth generation commercial fisherman in the Lower Lakes and Coorong area, Henry became the face of The Advertiser's Save the Murray campaign. After spending much of his lifetime fighting for the river, fighting to secure the future of his livelihood and the livelihoods of others who depend on the river, he was extremely proud to see this day come. I would like to congratulate Henry on being awarded the River Murray Medal, an award made by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority last month. 


The best news to come out of today is that those communities that live along the river—the fishermen like Henry, who rely on a healthy river—can finally have a positive outlook on their futures. The Gillard Labor government, after a century or more of disagreements and conflict, has finally achieved what no other government has done before: success. Success not just for any one state but for the health and longevity of the Murray-Darling Basin, our greatest river system. 


I would like to congratulate everybody who campaigned for this day. I would especially like to make mention of Labor federal ministers, Penny Wong and Tony Burke—both water ministers, who gave their all to make sure that this day could come about. Thank you.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (20:13):  I also acknowledge this, and I wish to assure our former, distinguished Senator Barnett that I am still carrying the pedometer which he gave me, and as of this moment I have done 1.582 km around Parliament House today.


But that is not the reason for me rising this evening. What I do wish to speak to is the very lamentable widening gap now in education opportunities in Australia. Obviously we are all well aware of this gap and we focus often, as we should do, on the difference between those in low-socioeconomic areas and those in higher socioeconomic areas. But I want to focus, if I may, in my contribution this evening on those in rural areas of Australia. Only last week, in an inquiry by the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations References Committee into teaching and learning, did we learn these figures from the Isolated Children's Parents' Association in New South Wales, if I may explain them.


The NAPLAN New South Wales 2011 figures for year 9 students show for writing skills that 11 per cent of metro students failed to meet the standards, whereas in remote areas of New South Wales, it was 47 per cent, four times the number. And in the very remote areas, 50 per cent failed to meet the standards. The numeracy figures are better for metro New South Wales with only five per cent of year 9s failing to meet standards, but 25 per cent of remote students and 37 per cent of very remote students are failing to meet the required standards under NAPLAN.


I want to focus again tonight on the ever-widening gap that is occurring between urban Australia and rural Australia in so many areas, particularly at this moment in education. We hear quite often in this place, led by my colleague Senator Fiona Nash, of the tremendous and gross inequities that are now occurring, particularly in relation to financial support at the tertiary education level. I am an example, as many others are. I could not study veterinary science in Western Australia. My parents were in a low-socioeconomic sector and had it not been for either Commonwealth scholarships or, in my case, cadetships I would not have been able to study veterinary science at the University of Queensland, which is in your home state, Madam Acting Deputy President Moore.


We are seeing across the board now that there is a wide gap between those students who can reside at home to undertake tertiary and other postsecondary studies and those who must travel. There are serious inequities and they must be addressed. The government, of which you are a member, Madam Acting Deputy President Moore, quite rightly addresses the question of those who do not have access to higher education, tertiary education and VET skills education. It is those from rural and remote areas who are missing out.


I will give you another statistic. In 1984 four per cent of those residing in rural areas in Australia had tertiary qualifications whereas 10 per cent, two and a half times that number, of those residing in metropolitan communities had tertiary qualifications. Let me go from 1984 to 2007. By 2007 the number of people in the wider community with tertiary qualifications jumped two and a half times—the number went from 10 per cent up to 25 per cent. A quarter of the wider community had tertiary qualifications by 2007, but that lamentable figure of four per cent for people in rural communities who had tertiary qualifications had only risen to seven per cent. If time permitted I could give you the equivalent figures for those in the VET sector.


In June 2012 it was my privilege as the Chairman of the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations References Committee to present to the Senate a report and recommendations on higher education and skills training to support agriculture and agribusiness in this country. Tomorrow I hope a motion will be before the Senate that actually recognises that report and its recommendations. There were a number of recommendations that I will go through in the next few minutes. The regrettable point is that at this moment, nine months after that report was tabled and six months after the time when the government should have responded to the report and its recommendations, we still do not have a response from the government, although this was a report that had complete support across all sectors. The Greens political party supported the report and recommendations and my colleagues from the Labor Party did not oppose any of the recommendations in the report, although they did put in additional comments. So this was not a controversial report, and its recommendations were I thought resoundingly supported; and yet, six months after the required time for a response from the government, we do not have one. In the motion I gave notice of, which hopefully will be presented tomorrow, I want to address that in some more detail.


The report highlighted again that with the demise of interest in higher education in the agriculture and agribusiness sector in Australia we now have only some 700 graduates a year going into a market where there is demand for in excess of 4,000—I think it is estimated to be for 4,300 graduate positions per year. That is a good story. Graduates from school going into university and higher education would say that quite clearly there is demand in that sector.


The recommendations of that report went to issues like encouraging greater understanding by children and teachers in metropolitan and regional centres of the importance of agriculture in our community, the cost-effective delivery of postsecondary skills and higher education in this country and options for more effective collaboration between institutions and their relations between federal, state and other providers. As I think it is known in this chamber, I had the privilege of lecturing at an agricultural university in Western Australia in the 1970s and 1980s. At that time there were very proud agricultural and agribusiness organisations and colleges, but we find today that very few, if any, exist. Muresk in WA, about which I speak, is no longer there. Roseworthy in South Australia is now mainly a veterinary school. Glenormiston in Victoria has gone. Marcus Oldham, the privately owned agricultural institution, is looking at what its future might be—possibly associated with others. The Hawkesbury Agricultural College in New South Wales could not attract first year students last year. In your home state of Queensland, Madam Acting Deputy President Moore, the once Gatton Agricultural College is now principally a veterinary school. So this report and its recommendations went to the reasons, opportunities and options that the government should be looking at. I really do hope that, as a result of the debate that will go on, we do see some focus by government.


In my concluding remarks I wish to draw attention to the launch tomorrow of the Agribusiness Council of Australia that will take place in the main committee room here in Parliament House. People might say that agriculture is well represented—and of course it is—but the Agribusiness Council of Australia will be looking more at representing the interests from the farm gate to the consumers' plate. Most of the organisations associated with agriculture in this country are focusing on the production side of agriculture. But we know that probably 80 to 90 per cent of the entire agricultural budget is really beyond the farm gate. It is that area that the Agribusiness Council of Australia will come into existence to represent. If we look around the world, we will see that agribusiness is the largest industry in the world. It is the third largest industry in this country. We are talking, of course, about everyone associated with the supply chain, its logistics, the transport, the storage, the examination of foodstuffs, the placement of food and the retailing of food—all of those areas of immense importance to consumers. 


One of the objectives of the Agribusiness Council of Australia—in concert, I believe, with the recommendations that I have briefly outlined this evening of the report that we placed before the parliament—is to bridge that gap between urban Australia and rural Australia, to bring to the consumer the importance of all of those aspects associated, firstly, with production, and, secondly, with all of those aspects that take place beyond production to the point where the product reaches the consumer.
