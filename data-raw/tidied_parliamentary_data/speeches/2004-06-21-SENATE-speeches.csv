"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2004-06-21,"—On Friday, when we last dealt with the Aged Care Amendment Bill 2004, I was speaking about the working conditions of aged care workers in this sector. Carers enter the aged care sector because they believe they can make a difference in the lives of some of the most vulnerable members of our community. They are committed to, and passionate about, their work. But even if wages improve and extra aged care workers are trained, workers will not stay in the sector if their working conditions are unbearable. I have heard the horror stories, as I am sure many have, about the conditions that some workers face—aged care facilities where one registered nurse is responsible for 90 residents, or where there are sometimes no staff awake at night to care for residents.  
The government's own report, which was released in April of this year, is damning. It shows that less than 20 per cent of staff have enough time to properly care for residents and that one in four carers is expected to leave the sector in the next three years. I constantly find it astounding that there are no minimum staffing levels in this sector. The Greens call on the government to legislate, implement and enforce minimum staffing level standards as a matter of priority. Staff in the sector are overworked and underpaid and the risks to the health and safety of residents and carers as a consequence are not acceptable. The quality of care that can be made available to some of the most vulnerable members of our community is damaged because this government has not dealt with the industrial issues for workers in the aged care sector. As one Melbourne based care worker said:
We try to provide the best care we can but we are constantly rushing and not being able to give the quality of care that we would like.
Workers, no matter how committed they are, should not be expected to put up with these conditions, and residents and their families should be able to expect quality care in the aged care sector. The Greens recognise that this bill implements some of the Hogan report recommendations, and we acknowledge the extra funding provided in the budget that I spoke about previously when we were dealing with this bill. But the type of funding that is provided highlights once again that this government is emphasising giving money to business and neglecting the needs of workers, which ultimately means that residents suffer. Giving money to operators without obliging them to spend that money on improving the working conditions, training and wages of carers is a waste of taxpayers' money. To say that the money is being given to address wage parity in the area but to provide no conditions on its funding out of the budget shows the rhetoric of the government to be a lie. 
There are no conditions applied to this money to ensure that it is spent on dealing with the wages parity issue in the aged care sector, where workers are paid 20 per cent less than their public hospital colleagues. How can we expect people in the nursing profession to choose the aged care sector as their preferred area of work when, if they do so, they have to accept wages 20 per cent lower than those of their public hospital colleagues? We need to deal with the issue of wages parity so that we can ensure that quality care is provided. We need to set in place minimum staffing levels within aged care facilities so that quality care can be provided. 
The Australian Greens raise these issues because we believe that workers in the sector deserve a fair go and proper conditions, and also because we want to ensure that we have a quality aged care sector where quality care can be provided. Only by addressing these urgent industrial issues can we start to improve the quality of care available. 
The Greens are also concerned about another component of this legislation. Currently, accommodation charges paid by certain residents in high-level care are limited to a five-year period. This legislation removes that five-year cap so that new residents who enter high-care facilities on or after 1 July 2004 will pay the accommodation charge for the whole time that they are in the aged care facility. The Greens are concerned that the removal of this five-year cap will force residents to pay more for their care and will move the aged care sector further towards, and further within, a user pays system. 
These are our concerns with the bill. We believe that if the government were genuine in wanting to address the crisis that exists in the aged care sector the money it committed to the sector in the last budget would have been directed towards dealing with the issues of workers' conditions, wage parity and minimum staffing levels rather than simply having been handed to operators without conditions attaching to ensure that the money was spent on improving the quality of care available in the sector.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-21,"—Has the government a view on this, Minister? I cannot recall if you have expressed a view.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-06-21,"—The government does have a view. Currently the bill would only allow ASIC to publicise infringement notices when they have been complied with. The opposition is proposing to amend the bill to allow ASIC to publicise the issue of a statement of reasons—that is, publicity before the entity has had an opportunity to put its case and before the issue of an infringement notice and an opportunity to comply. The opposition amendment assumes that any situation in which ASIC issues a statement of reasons is one which should be disclosed to the market. This is not necessarily so. The opposition proposal also encourages the media and public to rush to judgment on the case. While publicity can be an important means of improving and promoting compliance with the continuous disclosure regime, it is inappropriate to name and shame an entity at the stage of a preliminary finding by an administrative body, which the opposition amendment would have us do. Publicity is only appropriate when an infringement notice has been complied with. In our view, publicity at the point proposed by the opposition is unacceptable.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-21,"—Minister, I rather like the point you are making except that the amendment from Senator Conroy for Labor says `ASIC may' not `ASIC must', so my understanding is that what they are doing is giving ASIC a discretion—and I would assume it is for exceptional reasons, not for regular reasons—to issue a statement of reasons where it is appropriate. I thought from your answer you thought it was a `must' rather than a `may'.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-06-21,"—I think the reality of this is that it is a new power for ASIC. The major concern of those who are very worried that the government has gone too far is that ASIC will become the judge and the jury and companies who strongly hold the view that they are in compliance with the law would suffer the effects of being proven guilty before they have even had a chance to put their case if you were allowed to have this sort of publicity before the event. So it is very much an equity thing. It is a matter of where you strike the balance. As the joint committee would have heard, a lot of people are very strongly opposed to the government doing what it is doing. It has probably been one of the most contentious areas of the government's CLERP 9 package. Having a balance between due process and equity, with companies being able to have the right to put their case before ASIC and before there is publicity associated with the infringement, is, in the government's view, the right way to strike that balance. As for ASIC having the power, whether it is a `may' or a `must' is only a subtle difference in this regard. Some might say that even giving them that flexibility would be potentially very unfair, but the government has, without any equivocation, gone forward to give ASIC this power. That has been very strongly opposed by most of the corporate community. That has been strongly opposed by much of the legal community as well. We believe that we have struck the right balance after a couple of years of intense negotiation and discussion. Those who would have argued the Commonwealth has gone too far would love to see this provision not get into the law at all, and I do not think we want to play into their hands.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-21,"—The minister would recognise that in my personal circumstances I have had the experience of being roughed around at law and named and shamed only to be found totally innocent afterwards. Sometimes you think: if that can happen to an ordinary citizen accused of whatever then why shouldn't it happen to corporations. Let them suffer what any citizen suffers every day when they are named as possibly breaking the law in an area. In my circumstances I ended up with a five-minute retiral of the jury and that was the end of it. Nevertheless, I will accept your reasons and we will vote now.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-21,"—by leave—I move Democrat amendments (1) and (9) on sheet 4256:
(1)	Schedule 1, item 14, page 6 (after line 32), after subsection 225(1), insert:
	(1A)	In fulfilling its functions the FRC shall:
	(a)	conduct its meetings in public, unless the sensitivity of a specific matter under consideration, as determined by an absolute majority members of the FRC, makes it appropriate to consider a matter in closed proceedings; and
	(b)	undertake public consultation on proposals within its functions and responsibilities which have a public interest element.
(9)	Schedule 1, item 28, page 17 (lines 28 and 29), omit paragraph 236E(3)(a).
We circulated Democrat amendments (1) to (5) and (8) and (9) on sheet 4256 late on Friday. They were our best effort to give some kind of flesh, if you like, to the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. The difficulty with this is that there have been some amendments already passed which went in a different direction and are of a different flavour to what we suggest. For instance, the revised running sheet, which I am sure both Senator Conroy and Senator Ian Campbell have before them, indicates that in this little section Democrat amendments (2) to (5) and (8) are in conflict with opposition amendments (1), (2), (4), (5) and (13) earlier considered and agreed to. I think it would get too messy for us to try to recommit those and then commit ours and see where we go with that. The government is now aware of what our views are; it knows the shape of the amendment. When this bill gets to the lower house, if the government were to reject Labor's amendment and substitute ours then we would obviously accept that view. For the moment, I think I should leave aside those of my amendments—that is, amendments (2), (3), (4), (5) and (8)—which are in conflict with opposition amendments which have already passed. Otherwise it will just get too messy.  
Amendment (1) is a direct reflection of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services recommendations. It takes into account the very strong views expressed by Professor Ramsay, who has a considerable influence and status in terms of his consideration of these matters. We think this is really good public policy. It does not mean that the FRC could not have in camera meetings, but it does tell them quite clearly that they must conduct their meetings in public unless the sensitivity is such that they cannot. Amendment (9) is a parallel kind of amendment.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I think one of Labor's amendments that we have already voted on does this. Opposition amendment (8) omitted subsection 225(8) and inserted a new subsection (8), which said:
	(8)	The FRC shall hold its meetings in public except to the extent that a meeting considers:
	(a)	matters relating to the appointment or retirement or performance of members of the FRC, AASB or AUASB; or
	(b)	matters which are of such a sensitive nature that a public meeting would be inappropriate.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-06-21,"—We have actually already achieved what your amendment seeks to achieve. The issue outstanding is the issue of consultation.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-06-21,"—I indicated last week that the government would like to see the legislation up and running in time for 1 July—and I think there is multipartisan support for this position. There are a number of mostly Labor amendments that we have indicated we will not be supporting. Senator Murray has diligently sought to incorporate much of the committee report's recommendations into amendments. I also undertook last week—as far as the government's processes can carry it bearing in mind that some changes would have to go to cabinet and so forth—that we would seek to see just what amendments could be agreed to by the government. If it is too difficult and too fast for the government with only three scheduled sitting days left to try to reach an agreement on the amendments and recommendations of the committee report, we would undertake to bring back the amendments in the next sitting period as a show of good faith. We will—and Senator Chapman, the committee chairman, is working very hard for us to do this—be seeing what amendments the government can agree to. We have the Labor amendments, obviously, and we have had some of them passed. We now have before us some detailed amendments from the Democrats and they can be considered by the government in that cooperative approach. ",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-21,"—I would take heed of that normally but I will not on this occasion for two reasons. Firstly, our offer was that if the government wanted to bang in a non-controversial bill on Thursday through the Senate we would certainly be very interested in that. But knowing that this bill has to be reconsidered by the House our view was that in that process—
—I agree with that.
—Yes. The government can look at these and then make a decision as to which ones they can accept immediately and which ones they cannot. We recognise that you will not be able to accept all of them but there must be some of these which are quite easy to process. That is why I am proceeding on this basis.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-06-21,"—I do understand that. I am saying that when the bill gets back to the House the government will have these amendments before it and, in terms of looking at the functions of the FRC and how it operates, we have a clear indication of what the Democrats would like to do and what the amendments would have the government do. We are in the situation whereby Labor have moved some amendments, which were passed, I think, in the Senate last week. The Democrat amendments that have arrived today are substantially the same, with some additions. In the event that Senator Murray withdraws some amendments today because of that, the government will still consider them in our consideration of the committee report. I stress that it would be very difficult to do that, with a cabinet meeting today and a party meeting tomorrow making the chance of actually getting decisions very hard. I give the Senate, and Senator Murray in particular, the undertaking that these will be considered by the government, but I cannot give you an assurance that the government is going to be in a position this week to agree to them.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1

(6)	Schedule 1, page 6 (after line 8), after item 13, insert:

Insert:
225AA Staffing and appropriations
	(1)	To assist the FRC in the performance of its functions, the FRC:
	(a)	shall engage such staff as the FRC considers necessary to establish and maintain a secretariat which will be solely responsible to the FRC; and
	(b)	shall determine the functions and responsibilities of that secretariat.

	(a)	after the establishment of a secretariat in accordance with section 225A; and
	(b)	where funds are appropriated for the functioning of the secretariat referred to in paragraph (a).

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I strongly support the sentiment that Senator Murray and the Democrats are seeking to achieve. I just seek some explanation of (2), firstly, which suggests funding `appropriated by Parliament for the purpose'. I am just wondering which part of parliament? Would it be from the Speaker's office, the President's office, the joint house? I am wondering whether the Democrats could clarify that proposition for us.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-21,"—That is a reasonable question. As both the minister and the shadow minister know well, the FRC's funding has been a matter of concern and dispute. This year the government in its budget has given much more secure funding to the FRC but there is no guarantee that that will be permanent in a forward sense. Whilst the government can propose funding, it is for the parliament to dispose. So whilst the wording might perhaps be a bit clumsy and might need a little better expression, that is the purpose of putting it that way. The fact is that, if we had said that it should be funded by money appropriated by the government, it would not work because it is the parliament that decides.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-06-21,"—Interestingly the very final meeting I had with stakeholders was the day before the ministerial reshuffle. It was a meeting in Sydney on the Friday. We were looking at the whole funding issue. It was the very last issue I dealt with before I lost the job. We are very keen in the government to see the FRC adequately resourced.
Senator Murray has referred to our own contributions from the parliamentary appropriations. We are keen to see it have a good and dedicated secretariat. I do not think anyone would criticise the secretariat support that the FRC has received. There was what I regarded as a very multipartisan-supported prescription for how the FRC and accounting standards setting should be funded in Australia. Back in 1998, as I recall, there was a very strong commitment from the business community and from preparers and users that we would have a UK style, City of London funded type, FRC. Of course all those business supporters of that concept said, `Yes, we'll all fund it.' When the FRC went around wanting to have a broad funding base with contributions from the corporate community, they were not quite as generous as when they first indicated, which is a shame. I do not know if Senator Conroy visited Mr Volcker when he went to America but if you look at the report of Mr Volcker's group you will find pages and pages of corporate supporters of the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation. We were seeking to replicate that model. It has not worked that well in Australia, but I hope there are enough people in the corporate community who see that having well-funded accounting standards setting and financial reporting oversight is in the interests of them and of the corporate community not to give up on that model. 
The problem we have with the Democrat amendment is that to move to the structure proposed by Senator Murray's amendment you would have to reconstitute the FRC as a body corporate. That is the change of status that would be needed to enable the FRC to employ its own staff, engage its own consultants and operate its own bank account. As it is currently drafted, the Democrat amendment does not achieve this and would create substantial confusion about the operational capacity of the FRC. That is not to say that this is not the body corporate model that at some stage you should or could move to, but it is in conflict with the architecture of the financial reporting oversight that we are seeking to create in the CLERP 9 framework.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-06-21,"—As I said, we passionately support the principles that Senator Murray is putting forward. I am probably in favour of funding by a slightly different mechanism. In the past the Stock Exchange has levied either transactions or participants to provide funding for work done very similar to what the FRC does. We put our hand up with Senator Campbell and indicated that we strongly support the business community and the funding model that is there. Like Senator Campbell, we are very disappointed that the business community talked the talk but when it came to putting their money where their mouth is they just went missing. I do not want for a moment to suggest that this is a hasty amendment—
—It is.
—I will take your interjection that it is a hasty amendment, Senator Murray. I have concerns about the issues that Senator Campbell has outlined and I would be interested in Senator Murray's response on whether the parliamentary effect would be as he hopes. But I also thinks it shuts off other possible avenues that I probably would be more supportive of than having taxpayers putting their hands in their pockets with this one. So I would be interested in the Democrats' response to the government's position.
—I think we should just move on.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-21,"—That was an easier way to do it. The running sheet indicates that the Democrats will, by leave, move amendments (10), (12) and (13) together, but I do not intend to do that. Firstly, I move amendment (10) on sheet 4256:
(10)	Schedule 1, item 95, page 50 (after line 29), at the end of section 324AF, add:
	(3)	A rotation obligation does not apply to a review auditor where:
	(a)	the review auditor performs a role in an audit which is exclusively technical; or
	(b)	the review auditor's contact with the audit client could not be regarded as material to the day-to-day conduct of the audit as a whole.
I regard this amendment as one that government could genuinely take on board. It is less controversial than amendment (12), where I think there might be some stronger feelings. Frankly, if amendment (12) were agreed to, amendment (10) would probably be less important. But, as the law is presently intended, there are review auditor situations where the rotation requirement would simply not only be unnecessary but might in fact have unintended consequences. In many cases, particularly with small or medium firms, the practice auditor on the job has a review auditor back office, if you like, reviewing anything up to 20 different audits being done with different firms. For such a review auditor doing a technical task to have to rotate could prove to be unnecessarily complicated. This is again a committee recommendation. It is one of those things where you either agree with the committee or you do not. I would like the support of the Senate, but I am certainly obliged to put it here. ",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-06-21,"—This is obviously a core part of CLERP 9. As I describe the history of CLERP 9, it really did commence when I received the report of Professor Ian Ramsay on audit independence. Audit rotation is one of the key things that the parliament is trying to get right. The Treasurer very frankly and very determinedly said that we would institute the recommendations of the HIH royal commission. The royal commissioner put a lot of effort into getting this right. We have had to strike an appropriate balance in a very small marketplace, compared with the rest of the world, where we have a very small handful of large companies, a mass of middle-sized companies and a hell of a lot of small ones. Seeking to put in place a one size fits all prescription for corporate governance and in relation to audit rotation is very hard.
I can see the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services ended up very much where the government ended up, because the committee was looking at the same issues. You have sought here to relieve something that could well be onerous for both smaller firms and smaller audit firms. I can see the logic in doing that, but here is an example of an amendment that is very clearly the subject of a cabinet decision. It goes directly to one of the HIH royal commission's well-considered judgments and recommendations. I believe, as the committee does, that it is an area that is appropriate to look at, but the cabinet, having first spent millions on the royal commission and then having looked at the commission closely, looked at this. Really, the heart and soul of CLERP 9 is: how do you get audit independence; how do you get the audit rotation right? Sarbanes-Oxley, for example, does require rotation of both the lead and the review auditors. You can, I presume, go to PCAOB—known as `peekaboo'—and get an exemption.
The way the government approached this problem was to give ASIC the power to defer the rotation requirement from five to seven years in cases where the provision is unnecessarily onerous on the company or the auditor, and that does seek to assist smaller and remote listed companies and auditors. It is a recognition of the fact that we are a small market and we are spread across eight capital cities and a number of regions. That is the way we have addressed it. That is not to say that the government should not and will not look at this recommendation, because it does go to an area which has caused real concern and clearly the committee have picked that up. I am not sure where the Labor Party senators went on this.
It is a cabinet decision. That is not to say that we will not have another look at it, but I am not in a position to agree to it. It is an example of the sort of amendment recommended by the committee where I think it would be unfair to the government to say, `Look, you should make a decision on that this week.' We have spent a lot of time looking at it. The cabinet have considered it carefully. We have all looked at the same issues. We have sought to find a way that sends a clear signal to the marketplace—and to the international marketplace—that, yes, just as I am sure PCAOB will be flexible in these sorts of cases in the US, we will be flexible but we will leave it in the hands of ASIC to make exemptions and we will not seek to define that.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I indicate that Senator Murray has long championed some of these issues and raised these concerns.

We believe there is a mechanism within this legislation that protects the people that Senator Murray is trying to protect, so we will not be supporting the amendment.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-21,"—I will not be moving Democrat amendment (12). I recognise that there will be a great deal of heat over that particular amendment. The Democrats do support the committee recommendations to restrict somewhat the number required to rotate, but it is a very considerable policy issue. I know it will be a cabinet consideration if they were to shift. If I recall correctly Labor's views, they were not keen on it, but Senator Conroy can speak for himself. I now move Democrat amendment (13) on sheet 4256:
(13)	Schedule 1, item 95, page 87 (after line 35), after section 324DC, insert:
324DCA Postponements of audit firm's rotation obligation
	(1)	Where an auditor, audit firm or an audit company makes an application to ASIC for a short-term postponement of the rotation obligation required by this Part, the Commission may approve such a postponement.
	(2)	A postponement provided for in subsection (1) may be granted only:
	(a)	where it is for a term of not more than six months; and
	(b)	the postponement is reasonable to complete active audit work under-way; and
	(c)	is reasonable in all the circum-stances.
This amendment intends to give a little more precision and leeway in terms of the intended postponement regime that already exists. The committee felt that ASIC's discretion, if you like, was insufficiently identified. Accordingly, the committee felt that a postponement of any rotation obligation should be granted in restricted and specific circumstances.

(11)	Schedule 1, item 95, page 82 (line 29) to page 83 (line 11), section 324CK TO BE OPPOSED.
This, too, is a fairly hefty policy decision. But right at the heart of the debate we had last week was the Democrats' constant restatement that a corporation is not only a shareholder democracy but also a democracy that should be increased and enhanced. We believe that, if you attend to weaknesses and deficiencies in the way in which company constitutions and direct election processes occur and if you attend to deficiencies in voting, you will restore power to the shareholders for them to decide who will be directors. We think forbidding multiple member directorships is unnecessary and unwise. Accordingly, we oppose that item in schedule 1.

I understand there has been a reasonable policy position put that if somebody used to work for a firm 15 years ago and if someone else wanted to move across after the requirement—and we always believed that should be four years rather than two, as we have put forward—then they would not clash if there were some lengthy period.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-06-21,"—The government's position is that the section as it stands in the bill is as recommended by the HIH royal commission. It is important to note that the royal commission concluded that one of the reasons there was a perception that Andersen's was not independent of HIH was the cumulative effect of the three former partners on the HIH board: there was the perception that Andersen's independence had been compromised more than it would have been with the presence of one former partner. The PJSC, I am informed, accepted the evidence that the restraint is too broadly framed. I am told that Senator Conroy, in his minority report, said that the ALP recommended that the provision be amended but, having said that, that the ALP would not want to delete the whole provision. The government's position is that it implements an important recommendation of the HIH royal commission. We will stand by the provision staying in the bill as it is.

Again this arises from the committee recommendations. The purpose is to clarify the way in which questions on the audit can be asked. The committee obviously did not design this specific amendment, so let us never try and give that impression. The committee was of the view that the way in which questions should be put to the auditor and at shareholder meetings should be amplified. So, again, these are an attempt to put into legislation the committee's views on how it should be readjusted.

We believe that it is unnecessary because the bill as it currently stands does require the chairman of an annual general meeting to allow a reasonable opportunity for shareholders to ask the auditor questions relevant to the conduct of the audit and to the preparation and the content of the auditor's report. The subject matter referred to in the proposed amendment would appear to be information relevant to the conduct of the audit and to the preparation and the content of the auditor's report.

Of course item (15) does specifically allow questions concerning the independence of the auditor.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-21,"—That is correct: it would not close off questions. The difficulty has been that chairs of meetings take, sometimes, an idiosyncratic and highly discretionary approach to the way in which questions are dealt with. It may mean that after a period they will say, `That's enough questions now,' and move on to something else when people may have legitimate questions which require detailed responses. Sometimes there are technical questions which are better provided in writing.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-06-21,"—Firstly, the issue of auditor independence which Senator Murray talks about is clearly a matter that is, to quote from the law, `relevant to the conduct of the audit and the preparation and content of the auditor's report'. The law will also require an annual statement declaring the auditor's independence. Under the new law proposed by CLERP 9, a chairman could not cut off questions because it would be against the law. The law will say that the chairman is required to allow a reasonable opportunity for shareholders to ask the auditor questions. If the chairman decided unilaterally to cut off questions then he would be in breach of the law. So we would say that the bill as it stands clearly enables all of this to occur without the amendments.

This is a really important issue. This refers to the `true and fair view' debate. It was a set of amendments which arose out of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit report No. 391. The committee took very extensive evidence from a wide variety of experts and came to a view. The government accepted that view in their draft bill and essentially had this sort of approach to the true and fair view issue and then dropped it in the final bill—I presume after lobbying, representations or consultation. Nevertheless, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services went again and had a look at the JCPAA's work, asked its own questions and came to the view that this is the way to go. It is quite explicit. If you look at amendment (18), for instance, it says:
In undertaking the assessment of a true and fair view, directors must—
not `may' but `must'—
consider the objectives contained in paragraph 224(a) of the ASIC Act and must include a statement in the financial report that they have done so.
A true and fair view, as a shorthand, is a very important statement for all users of financial statements. The minister and the shadow minister know as well as I do that the range, depth, sheer extent and technical complexity of accounting standards are such that where there is conflict you do need to end up with someone making a judgment. The JCPAA felt on the basis of expert evidence that that judgment should be made and should be very clear and apparent. As I say, it was in the government's draft exposure bill and the committee has said that it should be back in. We support that view, and accordingly, we have moved these amendments to assert that view. The question is whether the government would be prepared to accept that. We do not object, of course, to changing some words here and there in the lower house—that is up to you—but we certainly support the thrust of what has been put before you.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-06-21,"—Senator Murray is quite right; it was in the original bill. We were convinced through the consultation process on the draft to take it out for one good reason—on the advice of the Australian Accounting Standards Board—and that is that the accounting standard AASB 101, which we hope will have the force of law fairly shortly as international accounting standard No. 1, `The presentation of financial reports', will require disclosure of this information in the notes to the financial statements. As I understand it, most people who made submissions to the joint committee said that the financial statements were the best place to have this sort of information. It is a way of sending a signal to people who are reading those financial statements about that. It is on the advice of the AASB that we have removed it, basically because it could create confusion.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS (FEES) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-21,"—Even if that was right, and the minister does seem to indicate from his response that the government accept the philosophy but just want to go a different route, the problem we face is that that accounting standard is not law yet and has not been confirmed by parliament. If something went wrong, it was delayed or something happened, you would be left still with this area of concern. Our view is that this should be in the law. If it is in the law by the end of June, it will govern all the accounts which are established for this financial year, will be reported next financial year and will have immediate power and effect. I do not think that something which the government agree with in the broad, if I understand the minister, should be dropped in anticipation of some future legislative event which might not occur.

I wish you had had that view 12 months ago on fee disclosure, Senator Murray, when we had the opportunity to put into law some far stronger propositions than those that have, unfortunately, now been agreed to. I do encourage you to read the articles in the papers over the weekend—from Terry McCrann to Alan Wood and every other commentator who has any knowledge on this issue.

—As you would know, Senator Murray, I cannot claim responsibility for all of that. My office is always very well on top of these issues.

My most important point, of course, is that it will relate to the company reports and statements to be dealt with now. That is a key issue for me.

Whether or not these panels can make an interpretation of any sort that applies to anything will actually be a matter of some discussion. Ultimately only the International Accounting Standards Board can change an interpretation. I am not comfortable with that position and I do not know how the FRP is ultimately going to interact with the International Accounting Standards Board process. So at this stage I indicate nonsupport, but I think that one of the key areas for our committee to work on over the next 12 months is how we are going to deal with these disputes in Australia and how that will merge with the international process.

Frankly, we do not much mind if it stays as it is, but we have moved an amendment to modestly tighten it up because the government have not advanced on this. We think this would make things a little tighter. We are suggesting that the 100 members be defined as members who hold a minimum of 100 shares each and that the value of the shareholding per member is not less than $500.

Its lack of action on this has been disappointing. I would have hoped that if you were going to go down this economic interest path, which, as you know, I have advocated and supported, you would have been able to take into account a sliding scale. Depending on the size of a company, 100 is still a relatively small number for a large company but is a large number for a small shareholder based company. I do think this is a step forward; it does not go quite as far as I would want it to go. 
—We did not want it closed off.
—I appreciate the point you are making. I do think it is a small step and I do think it is worthy of support, even though it is only a small step and does not go as far as Labor would like; but it may go some way to assisting in what we are trying to solve.

	(2A)	The amendments made by item 14A of Schedule 8 to the amending Act apply to an AGM held on or after 1 October 2004.
These amendments are intended to empower shareholders. I have discussed these issues during the second reading debate and do not propose to go into depth now. However, I will briefly comment on them, as they are matters which should receive support from all parties. The first amendment relates to section 250A of the Corporations Act. Its purpose is to clarify the provision and to ensure that the voting intentions of shareholders are carried out in relation to their proxies. During the PJC inquiry this amendment was described as making proxy votes like postal votes. Once it is filled out, the intention of the proxy cannot be changed. This amendment has the support of the Company Secretaries Association and the Australian Shareholders Association, and ultimately I would hope that this is one of those amendments, Senator Campbell, that the government will find worth while and one that will resolve some issues that have arisen in recent years.
The amendment to section 251AA requires disclosure of resolutions which are withdrawn prior to the AGM. This matter was discussed during the PJC inquiry and is supported by Corporate Governance International and the ASA. Amendment (39) relates to section 300(10) and requires the disclosure of the qualifications and experience of company secretaries in the annual report. This was also a matter discussed during the PJC inquiry and is supported by the CSA and the ASA. Each of the three amendments I have discussed is based on disclosure. The purpose is to empower shareholders. These amendments are not controversial and should, and I hope will, receive the support of all parties. If the government fails to support these three amendments, it will become obvious to the corporate governance movement in Australia that the Howard government has chosen to vote, again, against empowering shareholders.
The final amendment in this block relates to multi chairs. Labor's amendment says that, where a director is to be appointed the chair of a company and the director is already the chair of another company at the date of the AGM, the company will be required to put a non-binding resolution to shareholders at the AGM in relation to the appointment of the director as the chair of the company. This vote would be non-binding and is intended to send a message to the company that shareholders do not support the appointment of a person as chair. This provision only applies where the chair is potentially the chair of two companies within the top 300 companies on the ASX. We have a situation where `the club' likes to appoint its own, and we have had a whole range of companies that have multiple chairs. It is not good enough. It is not good enough for shareholders in the modern day for a person to be chairing three or four companies. Their time and effort needs to be focused on their primary chair. I am not ruling them out from being directors of other companies but certainly shareholders are entitled to know and have their approval sought when chairs start doubling up or trebling up. This is just a non-binding vote that would give an indication from the floor about whether shareholders were comfortable with the situation or not.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for the Arts and Sport (Senator Kemp) to questions without notice asked by Senators Faulkner, Lundy and Ray today relating to drug use in cycling at the Australian Institute of Sport.
Senator Kemp said in answer to a question I asked in question time that I should front up with the secret `evidence' that, according to him, I apparently have. I want to say very clearly for the record that the speech that I gave in this chamber last Friday was based on the Court of Arbitration for Sport reasons for judgment, which would certainly be available to Senator Kemp if he bothered to ask for it. I also want to say that the minister is in a unique and privileged position to have access to masses of secret evidence, like the results of the entire investigation—it was not an independent investigation—that was carried out by the ASC appointed lawyer. So I think it is appropriate for me, in these circumstances, to call on Senator Kemp to front up with all that evidence that has not been made public. I ought to say that very concerned senior figures in the sports and sports administration area came to me late last week, as a former Australian sports minister, with serious concerns about a number of people in cycling and a number of events in cycling. I have said, essentially, that this flowed from the case heard by the Court of Arbitration for Sport which was decided on 8 June. Nothing has been done by anyone in authority since 8 June.
Of much greater concern, of course, is how this situation could have occurred. We have very serious allegations regarding more widespread use of banned drugs and we ought to place on record here that this represents a massive risk to Australia's sporting credentials and our standing in the international community. I took the view, and so do many others in the sports community, that this is a matter we must sort out before we go to march around that stadium on 13 August in the opening ceremony in Athens. It must be sorted out before the Olympic Games. It must be sorted out before the cycling team is chosen. We would run a massive risk if those allegations were to remain under cover until the Olympics and then blow up. That would be something that no reasonable person would want to see and certainly no Australian would want to see.
What is required here—it is absolutely necessary—is an independent inquiry into these matters. We must have a credible and independent inquiry investigating all the allegations that arise from the findings of the Court of Arbitration for Sport. That is what is necessary. Those allegations and those issues must be dealt with. There is no alternative; these issues are of such a serious nature. I am very concerned about the role played here by the Australian Sports Commission, and the Australian Institute of Sport in particular as one of the programs of the ASC, because of how potentially damaging these allegations are. The minister's responsibility is clear: a credible and independent inquiry is required. I am disappointed that the minister has not announced that today. I hope he will be able to announce such an inquiry in the near future. Many in sport and sports administration in this country know that that is the only appropriate action.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2004-06-21,"—Senator Faulkner makes a number of points. It is true that these matters must be dealt with promptly, expeditiously and in a way which ensures there is public confidence in the way these latest allegations have been handled. I hope to announce in the very near future—
—Good.
—an inquiry—I have already said that to you today. We would hope that these matters could be dealt with as promptly as possible. To have these slurs hanging over the heads of athletes is immensely damaging to the individuals in the cycling program and to Australian sport. This government has zero tolerance in relation to drug taking. This government, I believe, has taken very many important steps to continue the attack on drugs in sport. Senator Faulkner need have no worry about our determination to get to the bottom of this matter.
The way some of these matters have been raised is unfortunate. They have been raised in the sense that they are facts when they are not—they are allegations which have to be investigated. There are certain procedures that Senator Faulkner would know, as a former minister for sport, for accessing some of the confidential material that the Sports Commission can obtain from CAS. This does require, I am advised, in relation to certain material, approval of the parties involved through their lawyers. My view as sports minister is that the sooner this matter is resolved the better. It is very important that people have confidence in the way these matters are dealt with.
Perhaps a casual listener may be listening to this: there is an impression that nothing has been done. It is quite the contrary. There was an independent investigation at the start of this year. There was a case bought before CAS and, as I mentioned, three athletes have been dealt with. One has been suspended. In relation to the hearing before CAS, further allegations were made. I understand that some of these were quite specific in nature. These will have to be investigated as well. Senator Faulkner, it is rare that you and I are in agreement—it is very rare. But this matter has to be dealt with soon and in a way which ensures there is public confidence in the process so that we can find people who may be guilty or at least clear the innocent so they do not have to put up with these slurs that have been thrown around.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Sport: Drug Testing</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I would like to take this opportunity to refer to a number of statements that were made by Mr Mark Peters, the CEO of the Australian Sports Commission, in Senate estimates hearings in response to questions regarding investigations into the Mark French drugs case. In evidence, Mr Peters stated:
The recent delay is because CAS—
the Court of Arbitration for Sport—
has not been able to hold its hearing, and that is what we have been waiting for.
He also said:
CAS has informed us they cannot hear these issues.
He also said CAS:
... are stretched to the limit at the moment a la the French case. It has taken them some months to arrange a hearing.
I have here a letter from the Court of Arbitration for Sport in which they categorically state that they do not accept that there has been any delay on the part of CAS or the arbitrator, Malcolm Holmes QC, in the matter of French and that the assertion that CAS has informed the Australian Sports Commission that it cannot hear doping related matters is incorrect. 
This statement is supported by the following facts. The ASC and Cycling Australia first learned of the accusations against Mr French in early December 2003. However, it was not until 10 March, some 14 weeks later, that the application form was filed with the CAS registry. In this case, the parties were unable to agree on a choice of arbitrator within the time frame specified. As is normal practice, a directions hearing was held prior to the hearing of this matter. This was delayed due to the unavailability of one party's lawyers. The parties could not agree on an expedited time frame in which to file and serve submissions and hold the hearing of the matter, and CAS has never informed the Australian Sports Commission or Mr Mark Peters that it is unable to hear matters such as these. In fact, 35 doping relating matters have been filed with CAS in Australia between 1996 and 2004. In other words, CAS directly contradicts the evidence provided by Mr Peters.
Given that CAS was obviously not the party at fault in these delays, as Mr Peters claimed, I ask for a truthful explanation behind these delays. I also wish to draw the Senate's attention to a media statement from Steve Haynes AM, who was the inaugural head of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. In reference to Senator Faulkner's statement to the Senate last Friday, Mr Haynes said:
Anyone who suggests that Senator Faulkner's statement in the Senate was for any other reason than protecting the values of sport, particularly for future generations, should take the time to reflect on his numerous anti-doping achievements. During his time as Minister for Sport, Senator Faulkner did more to promote sport free from the scourge of drugs, both at a national and international level, than any other minister from any other country in the world. On more than one occasion he accused uncommitted sports administrators of robbing our athletes of the accolades they deserved but did not receive because of drug cheats.
It is always unpleasant to find any athlete guilty of a doping offence and it is always difficult to deal with these cases. However, dealing with these issues quickly and openly must always be the primary consideration. Getting tough on drugs in sport means that when required we face the difficulties associated with dealing with such issues rather than turn a blind eye. However, at best it is a blind eye that the Howard government has cast on this matter and at worst it has participated in an unforgivable cover-up, putting at risk the lives of athletes and Australia's reputation. This is not the behaviour of a government tough on drugs. That is why Labor continues to call upon the Howard government to immediately initiate a transparent investigation completely independent of Cycling Australia, the AIS, the Australian Sports Commission and the department.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Sport: Drug Testing</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2004-06-21,"—I do not think anybody in this chamber would for one instant wish to perpetuate the situation of a cloud hanging over Australian sport because of the allegations which have been aired in this chamber last week and again this week. Nobody would wish to see the kinds of problems which are obviously being faced by Cycling Australia being perpetuated in an environment in which Australian sportsmen and women are very shortly to travel to Athens to represent this nation at the Olympic Games. I am certain that every member of the house is equally of the view that Australia's reputation as a nation which does not tolerate or condone the use of drugs in sport should be maintained and enhanced. 
In these circumstances, it is extremely important that all of us cooperate to ensure that these allegations, having been raised, are properly, fully and fairly dealt with and that we take whatever steps we need to take to protect the reputation of Cycling Australia, Australian cyclists and Australian sport in general, particularly at the elite level, from the kind of damage which might be done if such allegations as those that have been raised were aired in any kind of irresponsible way. Obviously it is the right of members opposite to raise such allegations in these circumstances—
—And they have been raised in a responsible way—and you know it!
—and I accept that that is the case. I do want to make it clear, though, that we need to ensure that we do not sensationalise this issue, we do not jump to conclusions and we do not make assessments about the guilt or otherwise of parties involved in this exercise before the evidence is properly before us and the Australian community. Having noted the right of members opposite to raise such issues, I also think it is important for us to treat the processes for dealing with these issues, having been raised, with due respect and allow those processes to proceed.
The minister has made it clear already today in question time and subsequently that he expects to come back with an announcement about the appropriate way in which these matters should be investigated. I think that it behoves all of us to give those processes the chance to resolve the allegations that have been made to the satisfaction of all concerned. No-one would want to see a cover-up and no-one would want to see these allegations dealt with in anything less than a full and appropriate fashion, but none of us want to see the airing of such allegations detract from the efforts which not only cyclists but many other sportsmen and women are putting into their preparation for Athens. That is extremely important. It is important for us to support them in their preparation and not to undercut them.
Senator Faulkner said that this is a matter which we must sort out before the Olympics, and I fully agree. That means giving the inquiry process the clear air that it needs to do that. He also mentioned the massive risk which is faced by Australian sport, particularly Australian cycling, if this is not sorted out in that time frame. Nothing that the minister has said today suggests he is not completely aware of those circumstances and that risk. I heard Senator Lundy's comments about the comments made by the director of the Australian Institute of Sport in the estimates committee and I know Senator Lundy has had some disagreement with Mr Peters in the past about a range of matters. Whatever institutional view one might take about the AIS or Mr Peters, it is important, as I said before, to let these allegations be properly examined. I am confident based on what the minister has said that that is going to occur.
This government has a clearly defined and well-supported policy of support for rooting out the use of drugs in sport. Only a couple of years ago the Compliance with Commitments Project of the Anti-Doping Convention issued a report in which it said:
In many respects and areas, the measures introduced by the relevant Australian body have been groundbreaking innovations. In many fields, these and other measures are now regarded as amongst the best of their kind. Australia can certainly claim to have one of the most, if not the most, rigorous anti-doping policy and programmes in the world.
Against that background, we should let these allegations be checked and investigated and not jump to any conclusions before that process is complete. ",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Sport: Drug Testing</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2004-06-21,"—Today I asked Senator Kemp, the minister for sport, whether equine growth hormones were a schedule 4 poison. He could not tell me; he took it on notice. I then asked him whether the world anti-doping body had indicated over the weekend that this was the first time they thought there was an allegation that athletes had taken this particular performance enhancing drug. He did not know and had to take it on notice. Finally, I asked whether Cycling Australia, his own department or the Australian Sports Commission had referred this matter to the police—that is, the use of an illegal substance rather than the performance enhancing aspect of it. Again, he had to take it on notice.
He made reference today to making a statement but did not indicate to this chamber when it would be. We have got no idea. Is he going to do it later today, tomorrow, later in the week or in a month's time? We have no indication whatsoever. That is what worries me the most about this issue. It is not that Senator Kemp's intentions are bad; I would never make that particular accusation when it comes to drugs in sport. It is the indolence, the lack of effort. This is an issue that now requires the minister to intervene with maximum force, not to just sit back and wait for departmental advice and then put out a nice statement in a few days time. This needs the minister to roll his sleeves up and get into it, because the clock is ticking. We are less than two months away from the start of the games in Athens, and that is the crucial issue.
Why do we regard this issue as serious? We regard it as serious because of our general position, but I also regard it as absolutely keeping the faith with those Australian athletes who, over the years at world championships and Olympics, have been betrayed by other countries who have either sponsored or allowed the use of performance enhancing drugs to continue. Australian cyclists won three silver medals in Munich and four in Barcelona. I would like to think that in each one of those seven cases those people were second-best in the world and that they had not been dudded by people who had taken performance enhancing drugs. It would be a terrible thing to go through your life not knowing whether you were the best in the world or not, whether a gold medal should have been yours. On the whole and on balance, even though on occasions Australia has had to suspend people for taking performance enhancing drugs, we have much more often been the victim. Australian sport has traditionally been, drugs wise, far cleaner than many comparable countries.
I look at US athletics at the moment and the problems they have gone through in the last five years—the problems of cover-up, of people taking these things and going to the Sydney Olympics even though authorities knew they had been involved in unsavoury practices. We do not want to move into that area. I really wonder, firstly, why there was no independent investigation of the French matters when they first came to attention. That is when the independent inquiry should have occurred: straightaway. Secondly, when the matter was to go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, why was the non-urgent box ticked? Was it ticked because they did not think French was a prospect for the Olympic team? Surely, this should have been resolved urgently. Thirdly, when evidence came forth from French that other people had injected themselves with either legal or illegal substances—let us not have closed minds on that at this stage—why was there not an immediate, on-the-spot, independent investigation? Why did it have to wait until Friday night for Senator Faulkner to properly air these matters before we got some action on them? 
We have not had an indication from the minister as to whether he knew about this prior to Friday. He said today that we should pass over the names. There is no way this opposition is going to get into naming names on this, because that would be most unfair to the individuals. It is slightly unfair to the rest of the team now that they may be under suspicion. That can be remedied by an immediate investigation. In closing, I have listened to the weasel words coming from Cycling Australia and from the Australian Sports Commission. They should be condemned for their weakness on this and for trying to move the blame on to others, including Senator Faulkner. All I can say is thank heavens for Senator Faulkner and thank heavens for John Coates and the very positive role this great leader in world sport has taken. (Time expired)
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Sport: Drug Testing</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I seek leave to bring forward for debate general business notice of motion No. 907, which stands in my name and in the names of the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Bartlett, and Senator Brown. It is a motion to censure the Minister for Defence. I seek to do that to obviate the necessity for a motion to suspend standing orders. I understand that, while the censure motion may not be agreed on, the process is agreed.
Leave granted.
—Senator Faulkner, I understand that informal arrangements have been made to allocate specific times to each of the speakers in today's debate. With the concurrence of the Senate, I shall ask the clerks to set the clock accordingly.
—I move:
That the Senate censures the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) for his:
	(a)	failure to take seriously and respond adequately to the reports of abuse of Iraqi prisoners by United States of America personnel, including reports in June and July 2003 of concerns raised by Amnesty International;
	(b)	failure to acknowledge Australia's legal and moral obligations to Iraqi prisoners in general and those captured by Australian forces in particular, noting that it is a crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (to which Australia is a signatory) to commit out-rages upon the personal dignity of prisoners;
	(c)	failure to take his accountability responsibilities seriously; and
	(d)	failure to correct the serious com-munications problems within Defence and between Defence and his office, which were revealed by the `Children Overboard' affair. 
Senator Hill's handling of the prisoner abuse issue has been a disgrace. His handling deserves not just censure but sacking by the Prime Minister. He has failed consistently to take seriously and to respond adequately to the multiple reports of prisoner abuse going right back to June last year, when concerns raised by Amnesty International were first reported back to Canberra. He has failed to uphold or even acknowledge Australia's responsibilities not just to those Iraqis captured by Australian forces but to Iraqi detainees more generally. He has made a joke of the concept of ministerial responsibility and he has been just plain incompetent in failing to deal with the communication problems in Defence that he undertook to fix and rectify in the wake of the children overboard scandal. Not only have these failures occurred on Senator Hill's watch; he is still to offer a satisfactory explanation for them.
The only response we have had from Senator Hill and his colleagues is their vociferous and self-righteous defence of the Australian forces in Iraq, a defence against allegations that have never been made. We have never said or alleged that Australian forces have been involved in the abuse of prisoners in Iraq. There is nothing to justify such an allegation. The opposition do not and will not make any such accusation, but the reason I find it necessary to issue such a denial yet again is the government's persistent dishonesty in deliberately behaving as though we have made such an accusation. They insist on putting up this straw man again and again and knocking it down again and again, when it is clear to everyone that it is a complete fabrication. It is obvious that the Prime Minister and his minions have issued instructions that, whenever the prisoner abuse issue is raised, ministers are to react by expressing outrage that anyone has dared to smear the good name of Aussie troops. If you doubt this, I invite you to listen to Senator Hill's contribution when he takes the floor in a few minutes to speak on this censure motion. No doubt we will hear it again.
Throughout this prisoner abuse outrage Senator Hill has shown that he does not get it. He does not understand what all the fuss is about. There he was, on television yesterday morning, accepting responsibility—but responsibility for what? According to Senator Hill the government has made only one mistake throughout this whole saga—that is, that Senator Hill, the Prime Minister, the Chief of the Defence Force and the Secretary of Defence stated publicly that the reports of prisoner abuse had not come to Defence's attention before January of this year, when they had. The abuses were reported by Amnesty International in June and July last year. They were reported by the Red Cross in October and November last year, and again in February this year. And reports of prisoner abuse were referred to in at least 25 situation reports to Canberra from Australian officials in Iraq.
Of itself that is a very serious mistake. It is massively misleading. Normally when a prime minister and ministers mislead parliament and the public there are severe consequences—somebody has to take the rap for misleading—but under Mr Howard ministerial responsibility is not what it used to be. Ministers are no longer responsible for the mistakes of their departments. They are not even responsible now for their own mistakes. It is apparently sufficient to mutter through gritted teeth—as we have seen Senator Hill do—a few words of regret and then move on to the next issue. In the view of the opposition, the misleading of parliament and the public is a serious matter, as is the failure to accept responsibility. But just as serious is Senator Hill's and the government's attitude to prisoner abuse. Their response on this has been hopelessly inadequate. It is as if, deep down, they regard such treatment of prisoners as the inevitable consequence of the war they have so foolishly taken us into: something to be regretted, certainly—especially when it is exposed to the public eye—but something that, in normal circumstances, when it happens behind closed doors, one would turn a blind eye to. 
Was Piers Akerman speaking on behalf of the Howard government again yesterday, as he so often does, when he questioned why everyone was making such a fuss just because the interrogation of Iraqi prisoners was not up to, in his words, `boy scout standards'? If the interrogators had managed to extract useful intelligence then, according to Akerman, good luck to them. Such an attitude is outrageous. It is insidious and it is reprehensible. Let us just remind ourselves what we are dealing with. We are talking about torture. We are talking about turning dogs on naked, defenceless human beings. We are talking about brutal, inhuman, degrading treatment that flouts every relevant legal convention and standard—and we are talking about murder. These are heinous crimes and they were not confined to a couple of cell blocks at Abu Ghraib prison; similar abuses took place at Camp Cropper. 
In relation to Abu Ghraib the abuses appear to have flourished under the regime of Major General Miller. He was sent to Baghdad because the methods he had employed at his most recent posting were regarded as having been very successful. His last posting was to Guantanamo Bay, so not surprisingly that has raised concerns about the treatment of detainees there as well. We are not just dealing with a couple of isolated incidents of abuse that happen to have been recorded on camera. It is critically important that the inquiry that has been instituted by the United States government gets to the bottom of these abuses: their extent, their cause, those who were responsible for committing them and those responsible for condoning and encouraging them.
We have seen massive failures on the part of our government in this situation. You have to look at so many issues here. Look, for example, at Senator Hill's failure to take seriously and respond adequately to the Iraqi prisoner abuse revelations. The opposition believes there has been a gross failure by Senator Hill and the government to honour their obligations, under the Geneva conventions and the other relevant international instruments, towards Iraqi detainees in general and those captured by Australian forces in particular. That is the situation we face in relation to this censure motion. 
I also want to talk about Senator Hill's failure to discharge his accountability responsibilities. We have a situation where Senator Hill basically says, `The buck will never stop with me.' He says, as a minister, that he will never accept responsibility. But the fact is that the buck has not stopped anywhere. The minister has still not explained how he reconciles the Prime Minister's code of conduct with his failure, and that of his senior officials, over a period of 1½ days of questioning before a Senate estimates committee, to correct the record. 
The Prime Minister's code of conduct is clear. It requires that:
Ministers must be honest in their public dealings and should not intentionally mislead the Parliament or the public. Any misconception caused inadvertently should be corrected at the earliest opportunity.
That is Minister Hill's obligation under the Prime Minister's admittedly discredited code of ministerial responsibility. That is the minister's obligation. Yet we know from evidence provided by Senator Hill, by the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Mr Smith, and by General Cosgrove that by the evening of Sunday, 30 May they had all realised that Defence had indeed had access to reports of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib well before January this year. We know that Mr Smith and General Cosgrove had, in written briefs, informed the minister of these concerns. All three knew on Sunday, 30 May—this had been identified on that weekend. A formal brief had gone to Minister Hill and on that weekend all three knew, as did the Prime Minister, that the statement that had been issued the previous Friday in the name of Mr Smith and the name of General Cosgrove was incorrect in several particulars. That statement was wrong. So why then did Senator Hill ignore the very clear requirement in the ministerial code of conduct to correct the record `at the earliest opportunity'? Why did he ignore that responsibility? Why did he allow those mistakes and those misconceptions to stay on the public record at a time of intense public interest while the Senate estimates committee was in session for a day and a half? 
I think I know the answer to that question. It has become pretty obvious why Senator Hill did not correct the record at the earliest opportunity, as he is obligated to do. He just took the view that if the Senate committee wanted to get the truth they would have to work for it and that if the Senate committee wanted to get to the bottom of this they would have to ask the right questions. He was never going to front up with the information. He was never going to tell the whole truth about these issues. He put all the onus on non-government senators to ask the right questions at that Senate estimates committee and, hopefully, if the right questions were asked—and they were—the truth would be winkled out. There is no explanation for this except for a contempt of the parliament by Senator Hill, and I say that Senator Hill is deserving of censure for that alone.
Senator Hill is demonstrating this same attitude in his approach to the report of the Defence task force. Dozens of Defence officials were working 24 hours a day for two weeks to turn up every relevant record relating to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners and they pieced together, I think, a comprehensive picture of who knew what, when they knew it and what action, if any, was taken as a consequence. They also specifically dealt with issues arising from the Senate estimates hearings. They produced a report of at least 61 pages in length with annexures equivalent to the size of nine Sydney telephone directories. What did Senator Hill do? He withheld that report on the basis that it was classified, apparently, and in its place he and his staff—not the department or the Defence Force—drafted a 5½-page statement to the Senate with three attached tables. He believes this discharges his obligation to provide an explanation to the Senate. Again he is showing contempt for the parliament and he is showing contempt for the public. Again I say, as would any reasonable person, this warrants censure.
In my speech to the Senate last Wednesday in response to Senator Hill's so-called explanatory statement, I drew attention to his press release of 22 October 2002 claiming that confusion surrounding the `children overboard' incident led to inaccurate information being given to the government. He said he had instructed Defence:
to move quickly to ... ensure there is no repeat of the communication problems experienced ...
He claimed to have already ensured:
a clearer understanding of the incident reporting requirements through the chain of command and the passing of such information to the Minister's office.
I quote him again:
Ministers and decision makers within Defence must be confident that the information they are acting on is delivered in a timely and accurate manner ... 
He also accepted, and these are his words:
responsibility to ensure there are clear lines of communication between the Minister's office and Defence.
When he was asked yesterday to explain why after 20 months the same problems that he had identified as giving rise to the `children overboard' scandal were still evident, he did not have an answer—just a bit of dissembling; just one further communication failure. That is the sort of response you get from this minister. Here is a minister who undertook to fix those problems 20 months ago and who has quite patently failed in that task.
This case goes beyond a case for censure. If Minister Hill had a shred of decency and any respect at all for the conventions of ministerial responsibility, he would have resigned by now.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—But—of course, you are right—he has not got that sort of respect for the conventions of ministerial responsibility. We may not be able to force Senator Hill to resign, but we are able to censure him. I cannot think of a more warranted censure motion. I cannot think of a stronger case for censure in the 15 years that I have been in the Senate. Censure is not a strong enough sanction for Senator Hill. His resignation should follow. He should walk the walk to Mr Howard's office and resign as Minister for Defence. He has palpably failed. Censure is not enough; resignation is appropriate. I commend the motion to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR DEFENCE</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-06-21,"—One thing certain with censures in the Senate these days is that the government will lose, and probably just as certain in the House of Representatives is that the government will win. The formal nature of the process was demonstrated by the opposition and the Greens giving notice of this motion last Friday. Over the weekend, it was found that Senator Bartlett had forgotten to be involved, so the motion had to be redrawn for today. If it were urgent, it would have been brought on this morning or in question time or immediately after question time—it was not. 
I was first attacked on these issues on 11 May. It has taken until the last week of the sittings, 21 June, for Labor, the Greens and finally Senator Bartlett to get sufficiently enraged to move this motion. But I guess if the opposition abandons its opportunity to scrutinise a budget the size and complexity of Defence's in the estimates it needs to justify its tactics. Anyway, it is three months since I was last censured in the Senate, so I guess I should not complain. 
The tactics of Labor are interesting. Why pick an issue that was not Australia's issue—certainly not in any primary sense? Australians did not administer the prisons. Australians did not provide the guards, military police—civilian or any others. Australians did not provide the interrogators. Australians did not interrogate the prisoners that were abused. Australia was not an occupying power during the relevant periods, and Australia did not detain prisoners. Where Australia was associated with the capture of prisoners, my consistent advice has been that they were to be detained by the United States. That was sensible because the United States had the facilities to hold them—we did not. And, unlike Labor, we had and still have confidence in the values of the United States and of its military. It was a sensible, practical arrangement. 
Maybe it is the innate anti-Americanism of modern day Labor, taken to new heights by its leader, Mr Latham, that is driving these tactics. No Labor leader has been so personally offensive towards the leader of a great friend and ally of Australia's than has Mr Latham. Who will ever forget these words used by Mr Latham: 
Bush himself is the most incompetent and dangerous president in living memory. 
Imagine what it would be like if an American politician said that sort of thing about an Australian leader. You can also see the anti-Americanism in the first charge that is before us today: `failure to take seriously and respond adequately to the reports of abuse of Iraqi prisoners by United States of America personnel'. There are British forces on charge, but the Labor Party never attack Prime Minister Blair. Maybe it was the diversion they desired from a national security policy of isolation and retreat, which must appal all ordinary Australians. 
Labor opposed the removal by force of Saddam Hussein—one of the worst and most cruel of modern dictators. He is someone who ran real torture chambers as an apparatus of state; someone who is believed to be responsible for the deaths of maybe 300,000 innocent people; someone who bombed his own people with chemical weapons—men, women and children; someone who invaded his neighbours and butchered innocent Kuwaitis; someone who was a menace to international peace and security; and someone who failed to accept the obligation that he satisfy the international community and destroy his weapons of mass destruction. Even more amazing is a Labor Party that says that it is not our responsibility to help the Iraqis in stabilising and rebuilding the country, and transferring it to a sovereign government. 
Labor gives me a lecture on not taking the allegations against the United States seriously and in a second charge of my failing to acknowledge our moral obligations, but it will not accept the most basic responsibility itself—that is, to help someone in need. Whom does Labor expect to do this work—the heavy lifting to help the new government in Iraq in providing security so that ordinary Iraqis can have some hope for the future—presumably a coalition of others led by the United States of America?
The United States has led this coalition at great cost, with over 800 dead. Yet there has been no acknowledgment by Labor of the huge challenge and difficulties the United States has faced—no support and little sympathy, just criticism. And then there is the awful message that cut-and-run sends to terrorists targeting the United States, the British and those brave Iraqis trying to establish a new order of democracy, tolerance and respect for human rights. Insurgents do not blow themselves up; fanatics blow themselves up. For the same reasons that they attacked the United States on September 11 and they attacked Indonesians and Australians in Bali, they are attacking Iraq today. What would Labor do? They would have us turn our backs on our friends—old friends and new friends. If I were Labor and these were my policies I would be looking for a diversion. For a while Labor were determined to implicate the ADF in the prisoner abuse scandal: `Tut-tut,' said the journalists, `Labor would not do that.' But Senator Evans said it all on the ABC. Labor do not want it repeated, but I will remind the Senate what he said:
They—
that is, the Australian government—
weren't interested, so they did not get the answers that revealed the involvement of Australian legal officers in the abuse scandal.
It is absolutely clear-cut. `We would never say that,' said Senator Faulkner in the Senate today. Has Senator Evans ever corrected the record? Has he ever come in here and made a public explanation on that particular matter? Of course not. What was he doing? He was repeating the Sydney Morning Herald's guilty verdict—guilty until proven innocent. 
Now that Labor have backtracked on the loose language used by Senator Evans, what are they really alleging? They say now that no Australians took part in the abuses, but they continue to infer and insinuate that ADF officers and Australian public servants had knowledge of these abuses and failed to act to prevent them. They insinuate that the ADF knew how serious these abuses were and failed to alert the government to them. It is a clever strategy, but it is a grubby one. You cannot allege a cover-up without implying that some improper activity is being covered up. What is now being alleged is that the government failed to take seriously and respond adequately to the reports of abuses. And in that there is a lot of catch-up being played.
Amnesty issued their report—which, on Friday anyway, was the sole basis of Senator Brown's charge—in late July last year. They released it publicly with a press conference and a media release and they posted it on their web site. Yet Labor did not pursue it then and neither did Senator Brown. There was not one question to me in the second half of 2003. There were no media releases from Labor or Senator Brown and no outrage or even interest from the media at the time. Then, in January, the United States announced it was investigating the abuses that had occurred in Abu Ghraib. The parliament sat in February and March. Again there were no questions, no press releases and no demands. Where was the Labor Party's selective outrage then? Why wasn't Senator Brown—who, as we all know, is not shy of media stunts—making some mileage out of it then? What changed it all were the pictures at the end of April. Why did it change? Because Labor now had the pictures of abuse and it saw the opportunity to attack the United States. The fact that the United States had already launched its investigation in January, suspended or stood down a number of officers thought to be involved and laid the first charges in March was of no consequence to the ALP.
So now it was catch-up time. Labor and Senator Brown—and, as of today, Senator Bartlett—claimed something should have been done earlier. Alternatively, Labor could have commended the United States for their prompt actions and their determination to punish those responsible for criminal abuse. But, no, not this Labor Party. Interestingly, Labor has never said what the Australian government should have done as a result of the Amnesty report or the United States announcement in January. Senator Faulkner did not even say it today. The United States were already seriously embarrassed by the abuses. They were acting swiftly and appropriately on them. They certainly did not need us to be clever after the fact. That is the whole point: the United States did not need Australia or anyone else to tell them this sort of abuse was unacceptable. They knew it themselves and they were stamping it out. This takes us back to the Amnesty International report. Amnesty International issued a press release on 20 June 2003 headed: `Iraq: human rights must be the foundation for rebuilding'. This referred to its report entitled Human rights and the economic reconstruction process in Iraq. It argued: 
... the goal of reconstruction should be to ensure the effective protection and realisation of human rights for all Iraqis.
That was all very laudable, but it was not about prisoner abuse. On 30 June there was another press release headed: `Iraq: the United States must ensure humane treatment and access to justice for Iraqi detainees'. It was directed to Mr Paul Bremer, the head of the CPA. It was responded to by Mr Bremer. Amnesty International welcomed the exchange. This was reported back to Canberra. There were two Amnesty International documents—the ones which I have referred to—brought to the attention of my office. 
Senator Brown and sections of the media are happy to state that the situation updates refer to other comments by Amnesty International. They do not like mentioning the second part of the equation—that being that both situation updates highlighted positive actions being taken by the CPA to improve judicial processes. The second of these situation updates quotes the Amnesty International press release:
Amnesty International delegates however welcomed statements by lawyers from the US military and the CPA that they intended to rapidly improve conditions and would eventually ensure that every detainee had access to lawyers within 72 hours.
Have we heard that from Senator Brown? Of course not. It is hard to see how Senator Brown could even argue that these called for a response by Australia. They were not about prisoner abuses. They were predominantly about process. Then, on 23 July 2002, Amnesty International issued a `Memorandum on concerns relating to law and order'. This was the memorandum that Amnesty International sent to Australian ministers almost 12 months later. It was directed to the Coalition Provisional Authority and those in the field. It is true that, in a few lines on page 7 of a 17-page report, Amnesty did claim to have received a number of reports of abuse. The report noted:
Amnesty International welcomes the explicit prohibition on the use of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment contained in Section 9 of CPA Memorandum Number 7.
The report again called on the CPA to ensure that the prohibition was absolutely respected. The report also spent some time discussing the physical condition of the prisons, with detainees said to be suffering from heat and inadequate washing and toilet facilities. On the whole it was a balanced report, giving credit to the coalition authority for some areas of improvement. How can that report lead to a censure of the Australian government 12 months later? So what other reports are Labor talking about when they accuse me of failing to take seriously and to respond adequately to the reports of abuse of Iraqi prisoners by United States personnel? They do not say. They do not identify specific reports in the charge but presumably they are the February report of the ICRC and maybe its working paper of October. What we know is that the ICRC works differently. It seeks to work confidentially with the party or parties to whom the reports are directed. Neither the February report nor the working paper of October was directed to Australia. Neither was provided to Australia. The first was to the joint military command, and we did not have a senior ranking officer in that command. The February report was to the Coalition Provisional Authority, the de facto government in Iraq, and the occupying powers, the United States and the United Kingdom.
In the case of the working paper, it was responded to by the United States military. An Australian military lawyer helped to draft that response and he facilitated a follow-up visit by the ICRC. The October working paper was not brought to the attention of the Australian government at the time. In the case of the February report, again, another Australian military lawyer facilitated the presentation of the report to the proper authorities and reported that it was being responded to appropriately. The February report was not brought to the attention of ministers. Why? Labor is suggesting some form of cover-up. The better answer is because it was being responded to positively by the parties to which it was directed.
In any event, it is difficult to argue that presenting the February report of the ICRC to ministers in February this year could have in any way prevented abuses that occurred some four months before. As an aside, it is clear from the evidence that the small group of Australian lawyers working in dangerous and difficult circumstances did their best to improve the conditions for detainees, particularly in areas of overcrowding and access to families. The government thanks them for their service and their sensitivity to prisoners' issues in very demanding circumstances. So the first charge of Senator Faulkner, and the only charge of Senator Brown as of Friday, is a nonsense. 
In relation to the second charge, if Australia was not an occupying power and did not detain prisoners in terms of the Geneva convention then Australia was not subject to a legal obligation in relation to these specific allegations. We do accept an overall legal obligation to comply with the Geneva conventions and protocols to which we are a party. We also accept an overall obligation to treat humanely individuals who may not be protected by conventions. All the evidence before me—for example, in relation to our part in the capture of prisoners or to the transport of prisoners—is that the ADF complied with the laws of armed conflict and treated these individuals humanely, as I would expect.
On the wider moral issue, it is hard to accept a lecture on moral obligations from a Labor Party that wants to cut and run and leave the Iraqi people to the mercy of insurgents and terrorists. What I argued in the estimates committee hearings was that we all have a moral responsibility to help. The lives of Australian service personnel and officials are being put on the line to help and support the Iraqi people. The Australian government accepts the political responsibility for the service they provide. It is easy to moralise. The test is practice, not the rhetoric, and by its actions Australia and its service community can stand proud on this issue.
The third charge is a failure to take my accountability responsibilities seriously. I have answered questions in the Senate, I have answered dozens of questions on notice, I have fronted up to three full days of questioning on these issues in Defence estimates hearings and I have answered foreign affairs questions on the issues over another two days. I have responded in the Senate and I have tabled lists of Australian contacts with the issues. I have caused major searches to be made to ensure the best information is available. Mr President, if that is not accountability then I do not know what is. No-one is alleging, I am pleased to say, that I have misled the Senate. It is embarrassing enough to have made one public statement which turned out to be wrong, and I have expressed regrets in that regard.
I turn now to the fourth charge, which is that I have failed to correct serious communication problems in Defence. (Extension of time granted) Every time there is a perceived problem within government, the opposition simply churn out the old line, `It's the children overboard again.' They do so because they know it plays to the prejudices of some within the press gallery. The comparison in this case simply does not stand up. The `children overboard' issue highlighted two communication problems: firstly, that information was provided to ministers outside the chain of command; and, secondly, that when that information proved to be incorrect no correction was issued, because information which would have highlighted the error did not flow efficiently between Defence and the minister's office. These were the problems I sought to correct.
In the current case, information was sought by my office on my behalf and it was sourced through the appropriate chain of command. It is a matter of record that in this case the information was in parts incomplete and in other parts incorrect. But when that information was found to be incorrect, Defence was able to communicate that to my office and the record has been corrected through the estimates process. It is still a concern that incorrect information was supplied. There are clearly still shortcomings in this area that must and will be rectified. What Labor has failed to do is to show how the provision of incorrect advice in May of this year either could have prevented or is in any way related to incidents of abuse that occurred in Abu Ghraib in October and November of last year. 
One mistake is one too many but, whilst I do not expect fair play from Labor, I do think most people will balance one mistake against the huge successes of the Defence organisation in recent years. The flawless performance of the ADF in so many complex and demanding operations would not have been possible without the dedicated, competent and professional support of a mass of backroom people who make up the Defence organisation. They do not get the credit they deserve. They get no credit, just a bucketing from Labor. I believe that is grossly unfair.
In summary, this is a soft censure motion. It is not as if there are claims of conflict of interest or of misleading the parliament, or even a charge of incompetence. I can take it, but I regret that Labor cannot get behind the defence forces and the Defence organisation and give them the support they deserve as they continue to serve our national interests in the most demanding of circumstances.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR DEFENCE</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-21,"—The deceit of the government continues, and nowhere more offensively and continually than in the coward's approach of responding to legitimate attacks on their gross failures by suggesting that somehow they are attacks on the defence forces. Hiding behind the courage and integrity of our defence personnel is a very poor tactic and one which the Democrats strongly condemn. We will continue to criticise this government whenever they grossly misrepresent the Democrats, the Labor Party or anybody who is criticising them by turning it around and pretending that that criticism is an attack on our defence forces. It is clearly not.
If there is one thing the Senate and the Democrats have been very careful about, it is not to expand into attacks on the defence forces any attacks we make or criticisms we have about the government's approach on defence issues. We will continue to criticise the government's gross failures on defence policies, their gross failures in relation to Iraq and their gross deception of the Australian people without in any way attacking the integrity of our defence forces. They should remain free from being drawn into political debate in this country. It is a clear sign of the weakness of the government's position that they continue to try to inappropriately drag the defence forces into political debate, hide behind them and falsely accuse others of somehow criticising them.
Questions have been continually asked in recent weeks, and particularly in the last few days, about whether or not the Minister for Defence should resign. I know that others have called for that. My view is that there is no point in the defence minister resigning for the failures in this area, because the deceit and the failure of duty permeate this entire government and go right to the top—to the Prime Minister. It is really for the Australian people to determine whether or not the Prime Minister should pay for his failures in the area of security, defence and foreign affairs. Frankly, we will leave that choice to them in the near future.
Whoever the Australian people choose to be the government, the need for as strong as possible a Senate to keep a check on that government's failures and dishonesty is highlighted more than ever by this incident. It has clearly been the Senate that has exposed the government's failures in this area. I pay tribute to the efforts of Senator Faulkner, in particular, in exposing through the Senate estimates process their gross failures and continual deceit. The problem is that these failings go right back to the start. That is why it is not simply a matter of the defence minister's failures; it goes right back to the start of the Prime Minister's failed and disastrous adventure in Iraq. Minister Hill is right about one thing: people do make mistakes. We all make mistakes. The real problem is the failure to acknowledge those mistakes. The Prime Minister will not acknowledge any mistake, and that is why the real problem is that he is going to repeat the same mistakes again and again. 
We have here a government that has cut and run. It has cut and run from its basic obligation to tell the truth to the Australian people and from its simple obligation to maintain respect for international law. It has cut and run from its simple requirement to recognise that it is an occupying power. We see Mr Howard happily and enthusiastically charging into Iraq, trashing international law and the United Nations, as part of an invading force. The second he is there he pretends he is not an occupying force. How hopeless a position is that! What a classic example of cutting and running—charging in as part of the invading force and, as soon as you are in there, pretending that you are not an occupying force and using the worst sort of slippery, legalistic doublespeak to continue to pretend that you are not an occupying force. On top of that, we have the ridiculous situation of continuing to pretend that we are not arresting people. We have huge Australian SAS squads capturing Iraqis and, just because one or two US people are there with them, they are saying, `They were actually captured by the US; they're not our responsibility.'
Cutting and running from your responsibility is a pathetic approach and it is what this government has done. From day one it has set up a legal fiction to pretend that we have no obligation in Iraq to ensure that the occupying forces uphold international law and basic legal standards. The minister did it again in his contribution just now. He said Australia does not have any legal obligations because we are not an occupying force. He ignores the basic moral obligation. Of course we are an occupying force. We have this idea that you can just contract out—you can be part of an invading force, stay part of the coalition authority but say, `We're not really occupying.' It is cutting and running from your basic obligations and continuing to deliberately confuse the facts of the matter with extraneous arguments about other forces that have come in subsequently. 
We were one of the small number of nations that were part of the invading force and, under international law, that makes us an occupying force and that makes us obliged to stay there to uphold international law while we are there and to restore security and infrastructure for the people. That, frankly, is why the Democrats—and this is one area where we have in part agreed with the government—have continued to acknowledge that we do need to stay there. We do need to maintain a presence until security is restored and until the new authority takes over, because that is a legal obligation as an occupying force. That is why we have not followed the calls from some others saying that Australian troops should withdraw straightaway or should have withdrawn months ago—because we do have that obligation. We do not believe that we should cut and run from those obligations even though we did not support the invasion in the first place.
This continual pretence, this continual deceit, is the worst component of the government's approach to this and it is why we have a clear situation where the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence—all the ministers—saw no reason to explore or follow up any allegations. They were not interested and they were not looking when allegations came forward. `It is nothing to do with us,' according to the government. `Just because we invaded the place, just because we are still there and just because we are involved in the capture of people, does not mean how they are treated has anything to do with us.' How pathetic is that? What a total wiping of the slate of a most basic obligation.  
Because of that legal fiction that this government has convinced itself of, and continues to try to deceive the Australian people with, it has shown no interest in following up these allegations. The minister made this clear at estimates. Other allegations were widely made public through the media—not just the photographs but other allegations of gross mistreatment, including sexual assault and rape of female prisoners. Did the minister follow that up? No. `Nothing to do with us,' according to the minister, `why should we follow it up?' How appalling is that? There is no interest in verifying the accuracy of strong allegations which clearly damage Australia's reputation.
Just because Australian personnel are not involved in that mistreatment does not mean that our reputation is not damaged by these sorts of actions. Because we are an occupying power and because we are so clearly identified thanks to this Prime Minister as one of the strongest, if not the strongest, supporters of the invasion of Iraq, of course our nation's reputation is affected by the behaviour of the occupying forces. So of course it is our responsibility and it is in our national interest to follow up these sorts of allegations to see what the truth is behind them. But none of that has happened and continues not to happen because this government still thinks it is nothing to do with it—no responsibility, no care. It was part of the invasion but wants none of the responsibility afterwards. You complain about Labor wanting to cut and run. You will stay the presence there, you are happy to have the form and the pretence, but when it comes to the substance underneath—actually following through with solid obligations and doing the hard stuff, actually confronting our allies there about some of these things—you are not interested. That is the sort of deceit, unfortunately, that has been part and parcel of this government's approach.
They have pulled out the old anti-American criticism. When we quite clearly state a basic obvious fact, as I have just stated—this government has not taken seriously the reports of abuse by the United States—you get called anti-American. How pathetic a response is that? All they can do is come back with this sort of juvenile, undergraduate name-calling as a way to avoid the basic facts of the situation. It is a simple situation of acknowledging your responsibilities and all you get is schoolyard abuse and cheap schoolyard taunts of anti-Americanism while they hide behind the defence forces. 
It is continually mentioned that this somehow or other has nothing to do with Australia. The continual cheap retort when you criticise the government's approach is that you are a supporter of Saddam Hussein. And Minister Hill did it again, suggesting that critics of the government are actually apologists for Saddam Hussein, pretending after the fact that this government actually went into Iraq because of their great commitment to the Iraqi people to relieve them from Saddam's atrocities whilst they continue to turn a blind eye to many other regimes around the world that are committing atrocities. There is no suggestion from this government that they are going to suddenly be part of invading a whole range of other countries that commit atrocities, but of course supposedly those who criticise the government about this one are apologists for the atrocities of Saddam.  
It is an entire web of deceit that this government has constructed and it is no surprise that the minister has been caught in it. But it is the entire government that has been caught in it. Of course the minister should be censured. Of course it is an absolute disgrace that the clear failures of communication that arose from the `children overboard' debacle continue to appear and continue not to be addressed, and that is a matter of mismanagement. This government likes to pretend it is strong on defence and strong on security, but there is mismanagement of its own department—it has clear-cut expressions from intelligence officers within its own ranks saying there are major problems with the adequacy of intelligence gathering. All it can do is spout deceptive and dishonest rhetoric whilst ignoring the gross failures underneath its own regime. (Time expired)
 (Senator Lightfoot)—I call Senator Ferguson.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: the speakers list which has been circulated in the chamber shows that I am speaking next and Senator Ferguson is speaking after that. I ask you to abide by that speakers list.
—I am abiding by the speakers list that is in front of me at the moment, Senator Brown. 
—Mr Acting Deputy President—
—Is this another point of order? I have made a decision on the first point of order, Senator Brown. The list I have was revised at 3.15 p.m. and clearly has Senator Ferguson after Senator Bartlett and then you immediately after Senator Ferguson. Do you have a further point of order, Senator Brown?
—That list has not been circulated. Pursuant to contingent notice, I intend moving that so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me from moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate—namely, a motion to give precedence to the speakers list order as circulated in the Senate just after 2 p.m. This process cannot be dictated from the chair. This process must be in the hands of senators by agreement or it falls down. I am informed that Senator Hill moved the change in the speakers order. That is not his prerogative; it is solely the prerogative of the Senate by agreement.
—Senator Brown, let me call you to order before you take up any more of the Senate's time. You cannot move that motion halfway through a debate. My original ruling still stands that the list in front of the chair at 3.15 p.m. is the one which I will abide by.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I would like to comment on that point of order. A longstanding convention in this place has been that a speaker from that side of the chamber is followed by a speaker from this side of the chamber. After the call goes to that side of the chamber, it comes to this side. There have been occasions in the past where people on this side have ceded their right to speak to someone on that side. I do not intend to cede that right to Senator Brown, because I intend to speak now.
—That further augments the tradition of the Senate not to accept a motion of that type during the middle of a debate. Senator Brown, if you have anything to add by way of a further point of order, I am happy to listen to you. 
—My point of order is whether, my having got to my feet before the honourable senator had begun his speech, you would reconsider the ruling you have just made—because it is a very important one. I draw your attention to the fact that I will be moving the motion at the end of this debate if you refuse to allow me to move the motion now. I believe that, from the chair, you ought to be guided by the list that is before all senators, not by some list which appears on your desk and is not available to senators.
—I am guided by the standing orders of this chamber. I call Senator Ferguson.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR DEFENCE</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2004-06-21,"—That is evidence of another stunt by Senator Brown, when he knows the normal procedure in this place. When Senator Hill commenced his remarks in response to Senator Faulkner's censure motion today, he said that if there had been any urgency about this matter why did Senator Faulkner not move a motion to censure Senator Hill last Friday. After all the information that he gathered in estimates over a period of four or five days, Senator Faulkner could have moved a motion to censure—
—I gave notice on Friday. 
—Senator Faulkner, if you are going to interject, please at least take your seat.
—You could have suspended standing orders. Sit in your seat.
—You don't know anything about the standing orders.
—Order! Senator Faulkner, that is an outrage.
—When Senator Faulkner commenced his remarks today, he said that Senator Hill's handling of the prisoner abuse scandal had been a disgrace. Nothing could be further from the truth. If there is any disgrace in this chamber, it is the way that Senator Faulkner, Senator Brown, Senator Bartlett and others have handled the so-called prisoner abuse scandal. The way they have handled it in this place is a disgrace. They have talked long about Senator Hill, and I will go through some of the points that have been made in the motion. 
Senator Hill became the Minister for Defence shortly after the September 11 tragedy in New York. Since that time, our defence forces and this government have been constantly involved in the war against terrorism, in the conflict in Iraq and in the many other places around the world where our Australian Defence Force has served this country and the international community so well. Senator Hill has been at the helm all that time. Instead of censuring Senator Hill today, this motion ought to be congratulating Senator Hill on the leadership that he has shown over the past 2½ years as the Minister for Defence throughout these very difficult times. Senator Hill, the department and the defence forces under the CDF have done an outstanding job. All that has been said over the past month or so, particularly in Senate estimates, has done nothing for the standing of the defence forces in Australia because of the intense questioning that they have come under in hindsight. It is wonderful to have hindsight in these things. Part of the motion today to censure Senator Hill says: 
(a) failure to take seriously and respond adequately to the reports of abuse of Iraqi prisoners by United States of America personnel—
there is no mention of Australian personnel, of course—
including reports in June and July 2003 of concerns raised by Amnesty International; 
Amnesty International's reports were public documents. They were on the web site. Anybody could have seen them. Anybody could have read them. If senators on the other side were so concerned about what was happening in Abu Ghraib prison, why was it not raised? From the time of the Amnesty press release on 23 July 2003 until the publication of the photographs, Labor was silent on prison issues. Since that time Mr Rudd, who has been known to put out the odd press release, has put out 148 press releases—not one mentioned the Amnesty press release or anything to do with abuses in Abu Ghraib prison issue. Mr Rudd asked 26 questions without notice. Not one mentioned the Amnesty press release, any prisoner abuse or the Iraqi prisoner issue. 
The shadow defence minister, Senator Evans, put out 73 press releases—not one mentioned the Amnesty International press release. Senator Evans asked 21 questions without notice—not one mentioned the Amnesty press release. That is how important the issue of prisoner abuse was to the leaders of the Labor Party. I cannot remember—and I may be wrong—Senator Brown, from 23 July onwards, raising the issue endlessly. I cannot remember Senator Bartlett raising the issue endlessly. He did not raise it at estimates last November from what I can remember.
On top of that, Mr Rudd, with such heralded publicity as he is wont to invite, visited Baghdad in November last year and met, amongst other people, Paul Bremer, the United States official in charge. He did not mention prison issues in any of his media interviews or releases from that visit, although he quite clearly discussed law and order and security issues during the visit. At the end of the visit Mr Rudd wrote a letter to the Prime Minister summing up his five key concerns. In that letter to the Prime Minister not once did he mention anything to do with the state of prisons or prisoner abuse in Abu Ghraib prison or in any of the other prisons.
The minister was supposed to have taken note of all these things—a public document that was on a web site. The Labor Party took no notice of it and others in this place took no notice of it, yet Senator Hill was supposed to have acted on it immediately. We all know it was not until those photographs were released, on hearing about the prison abuse for the first time, that Senator Hill asked questions of his Defence representatives.
In his contribution, Senator Bartlett talked about the gross failures of our defence forces and the Australian government. He is the only person in this place—with the possible exception of Senator Brown—who thinks that our defence forces have had gross failures or that the government has had gross failures. He suggested we had cut and run. The Australian government is making sure that Australian forces stay in Iraq. It is supporting the rebuilding of Iraq not only by having some defence forces there but also by providing lots of other help to make it happen as soon as possible—and Senator Bartlett calls that cutting and running.
It is no wonder that Senator Bartlett was a bit of a tail-end Charlie when it came to this motion. Senator Faulkner and Senator Brown gave notice of it so that it had a weekend of publicity—the only publicity that it will probably get, I might tell you, after Senator Faulkner's lacklustre performance today—then Senator Bartlett decided that he wanted to be associated with it as well. This is the same Senator Bartlett who sat silently during most of estimates while somebody else did the work of asking the questions. We have got to a stage here of trying to make some political capital out of our defence forces by innuendo—and I can only repeat that Senator Evans will come in here and deny that he has ever accused the Australian forces of being involved. Senator Evans in his response in ALP News Statements said: 
The government has to accept responsibility for their actions. They have to accept responsibility for not asking the questions not seeking the information that would have revealed our lawyers' involvement not only in the investigation of but in terms of developing policy on interrogation techniques inside Abu Ghraib prison.
If that is not linking our defence forces to the abuses that took place in Iraq, I simply do not know what is.
I have nothing but the highest regard for the Australian Defence Force. They have performed above and beyond the call of duty in the last two or three years under enormous pressure in supplying Defence Force personnel for the continuation of our involvement in East Timor, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Bougainville and in the Solomon Islands. They have done an outstanding job and they have been put under pressure in the past month or so by senators opposite trying to somehow denigrate their performances by linking them to the fact that there were human rights abuses in a United States controlled prison.
The United States have signed onto the Geneva convention, and so have we and we uphold it all the way. Those criminals within the United States forces who perpetrated these abuses are being brought to trial and will be punished for their crimes if they are proven guilty. That proves the system works. It proves the United States believes in the Geneva convention as well. In their rules of interrogation it says, above all, that the rules of the Geneva convention must be observed. To attempt to censure a minister who has done an outstanding job over the past 2½ years stinks of politics just prior to an election when any sort of publicity, whether it is going to hurt our defence forces or not, is sought by the people opposite. This motion should be rejected.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR DEFENCE</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-06-21,"—It is rare to hear such a nasty and falsified account of debate in the Senate as we just heard from Senator Ferguson, particularly as he was trying to allude to the fact there is not the utmost faith and support in the Defence Force of Australia on this side of the parliament. It was this government that used the defence forces of this great country of ours for a political purpose when, at the service of George W. Bush and without reference to this parliament, Prime Minister Howard decided to send Australian men and women good and true—in the service of the White House but not the prime service of this country—to Iraq. Opposite we have people who are prepared to be twisters in the debate about our defence forces and to use them for political purposes not only in debate but in actual deployment overseas for the purposes of Prime Minister Howard.
That said, the Minister for Defence should resign or be sacked. Senator Hill has again said, `I have made one mistake, and one mistake is too many.' But that is not true. Senator Hill has serially misled the parliament and Senate committees about his knowledge and the government's knowledge of the egregious and—to use Senator Ferguson's own adjective—criminal behaviour that has occurred with regard to the prisoners in Iraq. Firstly, as Senator Faulkner has so clearly outlined, we had the minister effectively admitting that he and his department had misled the parliament and the people of Australia about knowledge of the abuses in Abu Ghraib. But since then and in the recent Senate estimates committees we have seen a repeat of this failure coming out of Senator Hill's studied ignorance of what is going on in Iraq. On 31 May I asked Senator Hill whether or not he knew about the Amnesty International report of torture and inhuman treatment in Iraq. The stage was set by an answer Mr Carmody gave to a question from Senator Hill. Senator Hill asked: 
Did the strategic and policy area of the department address the Amnesty report?
Mr Carmody replied:
To my knowledge, we did not. I have no knowledge of Defence actually receiving the Amnesty report. Given that we were not responsible for any prisoners, I am not certain that we had a reason to follow it up.
Here is the primary problem. There is a mistaken belief that you can simply assign prisoners to some other entity when you have been the capturing party—and the primary capturing party—and then you will be absolved of your responsibilities under the Geneva convention. This is not so. But this came from government right down to the people representing Australia and Iraq, and it has been at the core of the problem. This is a studied government decision not to accept responsibility for prisoners taken by Australian Defence Force personnel in Iraq and to therefore be able to say, `We're not responsible for what happens to those prisoners.' But the Geneva conventions make it absolutely clear that Australia—and this is the state of Australia; the Howard government—is responsible for the treatment of prisoners where Australians take them captive, and that has happened in Iraq. I then pointed out:
There is always that responsibility with the taking of prisoners.
The Amnesty International report says, amongst other things, that Amnesty had:
... received a number of reports of torture or ill-treatment by Coalition Forces not confined to criminal suspects. Reported methods include prolonged sleep deprivation; prolonged restraint in painful positions, sometimes combined with exposure to loud music; prolonged hooding; and exposure to bright lights. Such treatment would amount to “torture or inhuman treatment” prohibited by the Fourth Geneva Convention and by international human rights law.
That is the Amnesty International report that was available to this government in July 2003. I went on to say to Senator Hill:
Surely that was a significant report to be placed before the government and the defence forces engaged in Iraq.
Senator Hill's response on Monday, 31 May to the Senate inquiry was:
I think it is reasonable to assume that the joint command would have noted that report, as they have responsibility for the management of prison facilities, but I do not know whether they responded to it in any way.
I then asked Senator Hill:
I am asking specifically about when you or the government knew about it, what your response was to it and how you came to know about it?
Senator Hill replied:
My recollection is that the first time that I knew about it was when it was referred to on about 11 May—
that is, 11 May this year—
It might have even been you, Senator, who raised the Amnesty report.
There we have the responsible minister failing to recollect a report that flagged torture and inhuman treatment and breaches of the Geneva convention, which Australia maintains it upholds at all times. He could not recollect. Within a fortnight or so he did. We learnt last week that Senator Hill did know about it, because he had received ministerial situation reports from Iraq in June and July last year which flagged Amnesty's concern about the treatment of Iraqis in custody and—to quote Irene Khan, the Secretary-General of Amnesty International, who was in Baghdad—`the cruel and inhuman treatment of prisoners'. That was known to Senator Hill mid last year, and he claims he forgot about it. Are we meant to accept that? If we believe it, we have a minister who is not fit to be in office. You cannot forget about reports flagging torture and inhuman treatment and breaches of the Geneva convention when you are the Minister for Defence. The truth is that he knew about it, but he did not think it mattered. The government felt that it was in an alliance with America and that America would protect it from any odour coming from this abuse. 
But let it be made absolutely clear in this debate that, had the minister acted according to Australian standards—the standards of this nation, which upholds the Geneva convention—he would then have gone to his American counterpart and insisted that such behaviour stop then and there, that it not be repeated and that the US put in control management which would prevent further inhuman treatment and/or torture. We know that by that time it had included at least one death in the holding of Iraqis. But Defence Minister Hill did not act. Had he acted, Abu Ghraib might not have occurred. It is fair to say that, had a number of responsible people in the UK and US forces acted at that point, Abu Ghraib would not have occurred. But this does not lessen the responsibility of our Minister for Defence, who knows and has stated—as his defence chiefs have stated—that we uphold the Geneva convention at all times. Having not responded or having a memory close-down does not make him any less responsible. Having allowed his responsibility to uphold the Geneva convention to seize up because it was politically convenient for him does not make him any less responsible. This is concerning enough, but what is also clear is that the information about the Amnesty International reports last June and July also went to Prime Minister and Cabinet.
Here again we have the situation where, at first, it was declared to the committee asking questions that it was not known whether the Prime Minister would have been aware of it. In last week's estimates hearing, Senator Hill said:
We know the Prime Minister got sent the Amnesty report in May of this year.
I asked:
Was the Prime Minister's office alerted to the Amnesty report citing cruel and inhuman treatment in June-July last year?
Senator Hill responded:
I do not know that, except that it was a public document.
That is the old `try to slide away'. I asked:
Can you establish whether the Prime Minister's office or department was acquainted with that report in June-July last year, as you were?
Senator Hill responded:
I will take it on notice, if that is what you want me to do?
That is dismissiveness, trying to get out of answering and being responsible for answering the question. I said, `Yes, I do.' Of course, at a later hour on that day, we had General Cosgrove saying, `Can I offer a clarification?' to which I responded, `Please do.' General Cosgrove then said:
I said that we would not normally send these Operation Falconer situation updates to anyone other than the minister. We did during the war phase send the updates to a number of government departments. I have just had a look at the documents here. We sent them to a number of government departments, but not to the Prime Minister or his private office.
Note those words from General Cosgrove. I said thank you. Then, as Senator Evans will remember, he came in and asked the question I was next going to ask:
Which departments were they sent to?
General Cosgrove responded: 
I just had a quick glance. They were sent to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, foreign affairs, ONA—
So, yes, they went to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, even though, again, there had been a very serious effort to divert the Senate inquiry from getting an answer to that question. Here is the awful rub: Prime Minister and Cabinet knew in June-July last year about torture and inhuman treatment occurring in the prisons in Iraq. Are we meant to believe that the Prime Minister did not know that? Is it expected that this Senate, let alone the average Australian, is going to believe that Prime Minister and Cabinet knew about torture and inhuman treatment and breaches of the Geneva convention in July last year but the Prime Minister did not? I do not believe it. I simply do not believe that any department could be so irresponsible as to know about such an important and terrible fact as that in July last year and not report it to the Prime Minister. 
Of course, we have a Prime Minister who is so tactically used to the old dictum, `If you don't ask, you won't be told.' The implication that goes with that is that you imply to your department, `If there is something troubling there that I would be better off not knowing about, do not tell me.' This is a hallmark of Defence Minister Hill's way of working as well, but it is not acceptable in a democracy. It is not acceptable to allow this situation to arise where people in the bureaucracy, departments or offices know when not to tell their leaders about something because it may, further down the line, embarrass that leader. It is no excuse. I will tell you why it is no excuse: the Prime Minister ought to have made it clear, when he was preparing for war and preparing to send the defence forces of Australia into this war the year before last, that the Geneva conventions were to be upheld at all times, that he was to be told of any contrary outcome and that he was to be told whenever Australian standards were breached in the coalition of the willing so that he could act on it.
That is the other side of the bargain with George W. Bush. Our Prime Minister said, `I am going to come to your support, using the Australian defence forces'—against the huge protests across Australia—`and send our men and women to Iraq as part of the invasion and occupying forces.' That is bad enough but, when the Prime Minister says, `Then we will leave them. We will not pass down the lines that at all times I am to be informed if, in this coalition, Australian standards are not upheld.' We have a Prime Minister who is letting down the defence forces and letting down this country and, with him, the Minister for Defence.
Prime Minister John Howard and Minister for Defence Hill have let this nation down. They have, with knowledge, allowed the breaches of the Geneva convention by the senior partner in the coalition of the willing. They have looked at the ground, spun their feet, held their hands behind their back and tried to pretend that nothing was doing, when they should have responsibly stood for the rule of law for the right of our defence forces to report breaches of the Geneva convention. They should have absolutely, when their departments were informed by Amnesty International through a minute reporting on that, insisted that they be informed and they should have taken action. Prime Minister Howard has failed in his responsibility. Prime Minister Howard has let this country down, hand in hand with his Defence minister.
We have today a censure motion against the Minister for Defence, and that censure will be supported by the Greens, but the Prime Minister ought to be censured at this time as well. He has the numbers to defend himself from that, but he has let our democracy down. He has turned a blind eye to egregious breaches of international law. In so doing, he deserves the censure of this nation. It is very easy for senators opposite to get up and say that they back the defence forces of this country in a way that other people do not. They are so wrong. We would never have allowed our defence forces to be in this situation in Iraq. The government did that for political purposes and then it failed its responsibility to them, to the coalition of the willing and to international law. This minister deserves more than censure; he should resign. ",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR DEFENCE</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2004-06-21,"—I rise to support this censure motion. I know it is a very inadequate response to the seriousness of the behaviour of the government, particularly by the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, but it is the only response open to the Senate. The minister has described it as `political theatre', but I think Australians appreciate the seriousness of the issues involved here. They appreciate the fact that the government has not been honest with them, that it has not come clean about its knowledge of the issues to do with Abu Ghraib prison and the abuse of Iraqi prisoners, and that no-one in government has taken responsibility for that. The minister said he would take responsibility, but none has been taken. I think the minister has been responsible for an act of political cowardice in not taking responsibility for this. We called for his resignation following his failures in these matters. He has chosen not to take that course, so now the Senate is left with no option but to move a censure.
I know some people will say, `That's all very well, but what impact does it have?' It is the only course the Senate can take. We have to try to hold the government accountable; we have to try to make sure that someone does take responsibility for what has occurred. It is true that, after the Howard government lost five or six ministers in its first couple of years, standards of ministerial responsibility were abandoned. No-one takes responsibility for anything inside the Howard government. They took a policy decision after losing five or six ministers in 18 months that no more were to go. It does not matter what you do now, you will be held inside the cabinet because the Howard government does not have any standards of ministerial responsibility any longer. So the Senate has no option but to move a censure to try to hold the government accountable.
It is true that we have much more information now on these matters than we had a couple of weeks ago, but none of that has been volunteered. The government have not come clean willingly with any of this information. It had to be dragged out of them piece by piece, during hour after hour of estimates hearings, when they have had this information for a very long time. None has been volunteered, none has willingly been made available and, despite the minister's contribution today, there has been no attempt to come clean about what has occurred. We are now in a situation where the Senate does not have the ability to hear from Major O'Kane, or any of the other key witnesses involved—the key Australian legal officers who have knowledge of these matters.
We find that the 61-page fact finder report that the Prime Minister commissioned in order to clear the record has not been made available to the Senate or to the Australian people. What we have instead is a 5½-page summary, written in the minister's office, written with a political spin and abusing the Labor Party and the media, but without the 61 pages of fact finding that the defence department undertook. Why shouldn't we see that? If the government is happy to have the record cleared up, why shouldn't we see those 61 pages with the tables and the addendums that make up the full report as to what occurred inside Defence? If the government has nothing to hide, why didn't it table that report? Instead, we have the minister's own work. The reason we did not get the report on the Tuesday as promised was that the minister was in his office rewriting it, making sure that the 61 pages of fact were not presented. Instead, we got his 5½-page summary. 
What we also got were his own tables. The minister decided that he did not want to provide Defence's summary of all the information they found, that he would write his own report and that, in addition, he would draw up his own tables. So he was busy there, tabulating the information that he thought the Senate ought to have. One of the documents purports to be a summary of the reports coming back from Iraq about involvement with Abu Ghraib, prisoner abuse and the ICRC. It is supposed to be a table representing that, but it did not even include Major O'Kane's reports. The reports of the man who has been at the centre of the press coverage of all these issues, the man who was at the centre of the ICRC's responses, were not included in the tables that the minister produced. He did not think they were relevant enough or important enough to be included. That is how slippery the government has been as it has sought to deny full information on these matters. The tables did not even include references to Major O'Kane's reports.
Minister Hill decided to rewrite the 61-page report in his own hand and make it a 5½-page report with selected tables that were his idea of what he thought we should read. It was not what the fact finding report showed, not what the Prime Minister required, but what the minister thought we ought to see. Quite frankly, that is not good enough, and this will not go away until the government comes clean. His report did not include, for instance, the detailed situation report from Lieutenant Colonel Muggleton of 17 February, which expressed his concerns regarding the USA's detention practices and the differences between those detention practices and the Australian detention practices. 
The minister thought it was not appropriate for us to hear about Lieutenant Colonel Muggleton's report and about his concerns. I think the Australian people want to hear about those concerns and they want to know why Lieutenant Colonel Muggleton's report, in which he expressed his concerns back in February, has not been made available. What does the government have to hide? We are denied all these key documents, all these key witnesses and what we get is the minister's own version—a 5½-page version—and his chosen tables which leave out much of the key information.
I think there are three key stages to the development of this issue. The first stage is the pre 10 May stage. That was when the government was receiving report after report about the concerns of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, about the visits by Australian legal officers to Abu Ghraib, their liaison with the Red Cross, the drafting of Brigadier General Karpinski's response to Red Cross concerns, the sit reps coming in from our officers in the field and the O'Kane, Muggleton and Kelly reports—all this documentation that was coming into Defence, detailing the serious issues at stake about Abu Ghraib and prisoner abuse. We also had an Iraqi task force, consisting of officers from PM&C, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Defence and the Attorney-General's Department. 
All this information was coming in, but no-one was told—hear no evil, see no evil. Information did not reach any of the ministers. They were badly let down, it is claimed, by their departments. I guess you have to say, `Maybe that's right.' If you are being really charitable you might say, `Maybe it was just a stuff-up.' `Maybe,' as Defence have said, `it was just a stuff-up.' It has nothing to do with the dysfunctional nature of the minister's relationship with Defence; it is just the fact there was a stuff-up. It has nothing to do with the fact that maybe people thought they should not provide this information up the chain because the government does not like to hear news that does not suit its own political view of the world. But the reality is that the government argued that it was a stuff-up. 
I have serious concerns about that explanation. I am not sure that I accept that. But that was the explanation given pre 10 May. But if you do accept that, you cannot accept it after 10 May because we know that, from 10 May onwards, Senator Hill knew. After 10 May Senator Hill had all the relevant information at his fingertips. He was briefed. Why was he briefed? It was not because he was interested; it was not because he was concerned; it was not because he had any intention of doing anything about it, trying to insist that proper treatment occurred or getting to the bottom of why we failed to act to protect proper processes inside Iraq and meet our obligations under the Geneva convention. The reason he acted is that he had to come into parliament on 11 May and answer questions about it. And, in preparing for parliament, he was briefed on the Muggleton sit reps and he was briefed with a copy of the February International Committee of the Red Cross report. 
From 10 February onwards, Minister Hill knew what he needed to know. He knew that there were grave abuse allegations regarding the treatment of those prisoners, and that we had those since February. It was all in the February ICRC report. We know that he had access to the February ICRC report, which details its October 2003 visit to the Abu Ghraib correctional facility, which details the abuse of prisoners and which details them being held naked in cells and being treated appallingly. It is all in that report. The minister had all that information as at 10 May. He had the Australian officers' concerns about American practices of detention. He had the ICRC's reports and Mr Bremner's response to them and he had the description of the abuse at Abu Ghraib. I want to put on the record that the government have attempted to defend their inaction by saying, as the Prime Minister said to parliament on 27 May when he said that the ICRC report of October:
... covered general concerns about detainee conditions and treatment.
That is, the October report did not contain serious allegations of abuse. Minister Hill used terms like the Prime Minister did on 27 May in parliament, when he said the report:
... covered general concerns about detainee conditions and treatment.
That is just a lie; it is just not true. The February ICRC report reports on the October visit and it says things like:
... ICRC delegates directly witnessed and documented a variety of methods used to secure the cooperation of the persons deprived of their liberty with their interrogators. In particular they witnessed the practice of keeping persons deprived of their liberty completely naked in totally empty concrete cells and in total darkness, allegedly for several consecutive days. Upon witnessing such cases, the ICRC interrupted its visits and requested an explanation from the authorities.
That occurred back in October. The government knew in February at the latest about the standard of treatment. The report went on:
Several had been given women's underwear to wear under their jumpsuit (men's underwear was not distributed), which they felt to be humiliating ...
And further:
The ICRC documented other forms of ill-treatment, usually combined with those described above, including threats, insults, verbal violence, sleep deprivation caused by the playing of loud music or constant light in cells devoid of windows, tight handcuffing with flexi-cuffs causing lesions and wounds around the writs. Punishment included being made to walk in the corridors handcuffed and naked, or with women's underwear on the head, or being handcuffed either dressed or naked to the bed bars or the cell door. 
That statement appeared in the ICRC report in October. These sorts of abuses we later saw depicted in those horrible photos. But that was when the ICRC was actually doing its inspections. Of course, the worst of the abuses were not being perpetrated at that time because you had the Red Cross walking through the building. But, even while they were walking through the building in October, they were detailing that abuse. When the Prime Minister went into the parliament on 27 May and said, `The report covered general concerns about detainee conditions and treatment,' that was not true. The Prime Minister was not being honest. Now, I do not think he knew. I do not think he had been briefed. I think that, when he went into parliament, he was acting on information that Senator Hill and his department had provided him with.
From 10 May onwards, Senator Hill allowed the Prime Minister to mislead Australia, to mislead the parliament and to continue to perpetuate the myth that they did not know. Senator Hill knew on 10 May. He was briefed by his department, he was briefed about Lieutenant Colonel Muggleton's sit rep, which detailed the serious concerns, and he was briefed about the ICRC February report, which included a summary of its October visit and the abuse that I have just detailed. When Minister Hill came in here on 11 May he gave up the line that he had earlier run publicly on Lateline that he did not know anything and admitted that he took responsibility for knowing from February onwards. He said that he took responsibility for the government knowing from February onwards. What was that responsibility? It was nothing. He did not correct the record. He did not come clean and say, `We did know from February onwards.' He thought he would get away with it, so he sat tight.
He allowed the Prime Minister to continue to mislead the Australian people because he made no attempt to correct the record and come clean about the abuse. He allowed the Prime Minister to continue to peddle the myth that the ICRC complaints in October were somehow about some minor matters. They were about the very sort of abuse that was revealed in the photos released later in April. They were about the fundamental abuse of the Geneva conventions, about abuse of prisoners through torture, making them wear women's clothing, making them parade naked and chaining them to cell doors. It is all in there; it is all in the report that the minister had on 10 May. He had full knowledge of those issues from that date. What did he do? He did nothing. He did not attempt to correct the record. I think he hoped he would get away with it. He sat tight.
Then, of course, we had stage 3. We had the Sydney Morning Herald's articles, which revealed Major O'Kane's involvement. We had the Smith and Cosgrove press release, which turned out to be wrong. We had Senator Hill being briefed that in fact, despite the protestations to the contrary, the October Red Cross documents had been sitting in the R.G. Casey Building since Major O'Kane returned from Iraq earlier in the year. We had the PM again, on Sunday, 30 May, denying the fact that they had the October reports. Of course, by then, Senator Hill knew that they had them.
The Australian public continued to be misled when Senator Hill knew. I do not know what he thought. I think he thought he would just get away with it. He just sat on his hands while the PM continued to mislead. There was no correction and no admission. Then the estimates hearings started. Did they come clean then? No. On Monday, 31 May there was no correction and no admission. We see today that News Limited's Mr McPhedran says that the minister intervened to stop a proper explanation being given by General Cosgrove and Mr Smith. Certainly, none was given. Piece by piece at the estimates hearings, we had to drag the information out. There were no revelations; there was no owning up and no confession of mistakes. Piece by piece, we had to drag it out. 
What we do know is that, at some stage in all this, the PM had had enough. He was not going to allow his USA trip to be dogged by these allegations. He made it clear that he was going out at 1 p.m. on Tuesday before he went to the USA and he was going to come clean. He was going to go out and say he had been misled. We had the Prime Minister organise his press conference for the Tuesday before he jets off to America to see George Bush. So what happens? At 12.30 p.m., on the second day of estimates, General Cosgrove and Mr Smith made a humiliating apology and took the rap. Thirty minutes before the PM walked out to do his doorstop they said, `Game's up. We accept the fact that we've been misleading the Australian public month after month.'
What we now know is that Senator Hill had full knowledge of this from 10 May onwards, so for 22 days he refused to come clean. He refused to own up and he refused to take any responsibility. In the end, the PM dropped him in it because the PM said, `I'm not going to cop this any more. I've clearly been misled, I'm not going to wear it, I'm going to go out there and say “Sorry, I've been misled; I've been set up by Defence.”' But what we know now is that the department was made to take the rap. It was not Senator Hill. He sat there mute again. Smith and Cosgrove apologised. Senator Hill sat there: `Hear no evil, see no evil, nothing to do with me. I'm just the minister. It's just a terrible mistake. Those public servants, aren't they hopeless? Dear, oh dear, isn't it terrible? They are just so hopeless. What can I do? I just battle on.' That is not right.
What we know is that on 10 May Senator Hill had all the relevant information. He had been briefed. He knew the seriousness of the abuse. He knew that Australian Army officers had been sending back reports month after month expressing concerns and raising the issues, but he had been in denial. He had been hoping to get away with it. He thought that if he just sat there and the estimates did not go too well he would get away with it. In the end, the weight of evidence became too much and the Prime Minister said, `No, I'm out of this. I'm not copping this. You blokes have been feeding me a line that's not right. I've been out there misleading the Australian public; I'm going to come clean. I'm not wearing the rap for this.' He did not want to be dogged by that during his visit to the States. He went out and said `Game's up, lads. I've been misled. I'm not wearing it. Defence has to take the rap.' Thirty minutes before he did that Smith and Cosgrove read out a statement, an apology, which was not even typed. They had to apologise on the run, because they had to clear the air for the Prime Minister.
Where was Senator Hill in this? Senator Hill was missing in action. It was an act of gross political cowardice, because the responsibilities lay with him and he would not take them. He said he would take responsibility, but he has taken none. Even if you accept that it was a bungle at the start, he knew for 22 days and he did nothing to correct the record and nothing to bring the Australian public into the equation with an honest explanation. No wonder the Prime Minister is pretty dirty on him. He allowed the Prime Minister to hang out to dry for 22 days, hoping it would all go away. It did not. In the end the PM said, `The game's up. I'm out of here. You've got to cop this.' But has Senator Hill copped it? No way; it is nothing to do with him! (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR DEFENCE</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-06-21,"—Senator Hill deserves censure today for taking Australia into an illegal, pre-emptive strike on Iraq. He deserves censure for not taking responsibility for the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib. Most of all, he deserves censure for the announcement he made yesterday. Australia is to be led by the nose, yet again, into a much more dangerous and much more expensive war but one that is every bit as futile and destabilising as the war in Iraq and every bit as appalling as the treatment of prisoners there. Early next month, the minister will sign a memo of understanding committing Australia to 25 years of cooperation with the US on missile defence. This is Ronald Reagan's Star Wars. It is just as provocative, just as likely to promote the proliferation of nuclear weapons and just as dangerous to our relations with the rest of the world as the war in Iraq. 
President Reagan conceived of Star Wars, President Clinton reignited the program and the Bush administration funds it at $9 billion a year. Minister Hill was admittedly not the first defence minister to come on board. In 1995 the ALP government cooperated on Project Dundee at Woomera—a project for tracking rockets and a precursor to MD. Pine Gap contributes to missile defence—collecting intelligence from the Middle East, Russia, China, South-East Asia and the Pacific. For 29 years Nurrungar has been a ballistic missile early warning ground station.
But Senator Hill is taking Australia into even more dangerous territory. This MOU locks Australia into a dangerous alliance for 25 years, starting with development, testing and evaluation of technologies for the missile defence program in over-the-horizon radar technology and ballistic early missile warning through ship and ground based sensors. In case anyone should think this is about defence, the US Space Command says in its Vision 2020 document that missile defence is part of a `war fighting system'. It also says:
Space is critical to both military and economic instruments of power—the main sources of national strength ... Thus, protecting our freedom to use space and having an ability to deny an enemy's use of space will grow more important in the future.
This is a dangerous vision, a deadly vision. So far 8,000 nuclear physicists around the world have signed a commitment not to work on Star Wars research. But, to Mr Bush, space is the final frontier and the US has already spent $US95 billion on the project. Secret documents in the archives of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff are gradually being declassified and show that the US had planned to drop atomic bombs on Vietnam, North Korea, China and the Soviet Union in a first strike.
The US considered a surprise first strike on Russia with 737 nuclear bombs hitting simultaneously. The only reason they did not was that America had no defence against a retaliatory strike—but we are helping them to develop one. We are actively participating in a system that will allow the US to make a nuclear strike without fear of retaliation. In 1991 Newsweek magazine said that American generals had proposed to George Bush Sr an elaborate plan to use nuclear weapons against Iraq—a hydrogen bomb would be detonated over Baghdad to paralyse communications systems and then neutron bombs would be used against troop enforcements, followed by nuclear bunker busters.
It is said that the US did not use these so-called E-bombs in Iraq because China will soon have them, Russia already does have them and the US cannot protect itself against a retaliatory E-bomb attack. The US said it attacked Iraq because of its links with al-Qaeda—one of the many reasons for that first strike—but that turned out to be a lie. The US threatened to use nuclear bunker busters in Iraq, and Minister Hill admitted in answers to questions in this place and on notice that he did not even bother to ask President Bush if he was going to use these weapons or to urge him not to do so. 
We understand that the next generation of nuclear weapons for use in outer space are called Excalibur. If that happens—and no doubt Minister Hill will not ask for assurances in the MOU that it should not—we will be able to look into the sky and know that there are hydrogen bombs overhead, permanently stationed in orbit. The US project, Prometheus, was given the go-ahead some time ago. This is an atomic rocket designed to go into space. According to Dr Kaku, an American nuclear physicist committed to peace, Star Wars will depend on mini-nuclear power stations for the energy needed to keep them in space. We will have killer satellite technology that could well be hydrogen bombs.
Nuclear war has been contained for 50 years, but times are different now. Russia was bankrupted by the nuclear arms race, leaving the US with an unprecedented military might. There are new nuclear arms players in Pakistan and possibly Iran and North Korea. Israel has nuclear missiles. We are now on the edge of another nuclear proliferation crisis and a new arms race. What does Minister Hill do? He signs Australia up to this madness, just as we were signed up to an illegal attack on Iraq. Will this be another no-questions-asked exercise? Will Australia bother to ask about killer satellites or mini-nuclear power stations in space? Will Minister Hill seek assurances that there will be no nuclear rockets for outer space? 
Will Australia be part of Excalibur, or will we just turn a blind eye to the development of these weapons just as we have turned a blind eye to the abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib and to the reports that Iraq's WMD were already destroyed before we joined the attack? Will we claim that all we did was help out with over-the-horizon radar technology and put sensors on our destroyers, just as we have claimed that all we did was hand over Iraqi prisoners? Minister Hill denies responsibility for the fact that they were abused. He says that we were not in charge of the prison. Minister Hill deserves our censure for blindly taking Australia into the most dangerous realm of warfare ever known and for again not having the will or the strength to say `No' to President Bush.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR DEFENCE</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2004-06-21,"—We are talking about torture, brutal and degrading treatment and murder. It does not get much worse, according to Senator Faulkner. This motion to censure the Minister for Defence discloses that the public record raised these issues of torture, brutal and degrading treatment and murder back in June and July 2003. CNN raised these issues on 16 January this year, and it has taken until 11 May for this very poor excuse for an opposition to raise these issues. Yet this is about torture, brutal and degrading treatment and murder. Where were they? They were asleep as usual. The public record clearly raised these issues, but the opposition were asleep and now they are playing this game of catch-up. 
They set out to undermine the Australian Defence Force in Iraq, but now they say, `We never wanted to do that; this is not about the ADF.' They have no compunction—no problem at all—about bringing the ADF into the tawdry pool of political tricks and political point scoring. Senator Faulkner said today, and Senator Evans has said on numerous occasions recently, that this is not about the ADF. But, on 11 May, Senator Faulkner said: 
Foreign Minister Downer has said Australia has no legal responsibility for any of the POWs in Iraq, including those captured by Australia. This completely ignores the fact that Australia, as one of the occupying powers, has obligations towards Iraqi prisoners in general and those taken captive by Australian forces in particular. We know, from Senate estimates, that the SAS was successful in capturing prisoners. All up, Australian troops captured more than 100 Iraqis. Exactly how many we do not know. The obligations for the protection of prisoners are outlined in the third Geneva convention and in the 1977 first optional protocol to the fourth Geneva convention. Article 3 prohibits occupying powers from allowing acts which constitute `outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment'.
There is a sloppy, vague assertion that the SAS have a responsibility with respect to the treatment that was subsequently disclosed at Abu Ghraib. Senator Faulkner deliberately put on the record an aspersion against the ADF, and now he is saying, `No, we didn't intend to do that.' This is a very dangerous game for the opposition to play.
There is a clear inference in what Senator Faulkner said and the way he said it. We all know that Senator Faulkner has great skills in saying things. From the way he said that, the inference is clearly to be drawn that the SAS have some ongoing responsibility with respect to these prisoners. It is very clear that when Senator Faulkner used the words `particular responsibility' it was a very nasty inference against our ADF. Senator Evans has said on a number of occasions since that this is not about the ADF. On the AM program on the ABC, an accusation was put to him that he was implicating the ADF in the prisoner abuse scandal. He said:
... they weren't interested, so they didn't get the answers that revealed the involvement of Australian legal officers in the abuse scandal.
If they had found involvement in the abuse scandal, they would have been interested. They were looking to nail the Australian Defence Force lawyers in that instance. Senator Evans was caught red-handed when he said that. This is all about the Labor Party's anti-American fervour. We all know what Mr Latham has said about President Bush. We all know that, on 11 May, when talking about the motion on Iraqi prisoners, Senator Faulkner said:
Firstly, we would have liked to see the motion directed not only at the United States but at all the occupying powers. The United States is by no means the only country in the dock over the abuse of Iraqi prisoners. There are also allegations of abuse by British forces. Our own government also shares obligations as an occupying power in relation to the humane treatment of all prisoners in Iraq—obligations which, I might add, it is remarkably reluctant to acknowledge.
Senator Faulkner needs to come back into this place and clarify what he said. His sloppy, vague innuendos and this classic, inference mudslinging need to be clarified. He needs to come back in here and say, `I was not accusing the Australian government or the Australian Defence Force of being involved in these matters.'
It is clear that these American service men and women on duty at night in Abu Ghraib were on a frolic of their own, conducting criminal activities for which they will be and have been prosecuted. I make the point also that, throughout all of this, there has not been anything said against the British Prime Minister and his forces. He appears to be the darling of the Labor Party. The facts are that Australia did not and does not administer any prisons in Iraq, Australia did not provide any guards and the detainees in Abu Ghraib were not Australian prisoners. That is to the best of our knowledge. Notwithstanding what Senator Faulkner wants, it is a question of law. Australia is not an occupying power.
This is a kangaroo court. This is about an opposition that set out to attack what we are doing in Iraq in the context of the Leader of the Opposition saying that everything we have done in Iraq is symbolic. While there are terrorist activities and suicide bombings, we are participating in the reconstruction of social infrastructure, education, hospitals and transport, but the Leader of the Opposition says it is only symbolic. What is it? Senator Faulkner says we are in it up to our eyeballs, and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Latham, says it is symbolic. They are making it up as they go along. This kangaroo court against the minister is a classic, desperate act by a very desperate group of people who now know that their cut-and-run strategy is coming back to bite them, as any reasonable student of politics would know. It is a plan devised on the run, with no consultation with opposition cabinet colleagues or senior members of the party. 
What we have here is an opposition that now say that these are extremely serious acts of torture, brutal and degrading treatment and murder, yet throughout the parliamentary sittings in February there was no mention of it. We have the Amnesty International report dating back to June and July, but throughout the parliamentary sittings in March we heard not a mention. Then we come to the half-baked allegations in May. Now we can see that, once the photos were seen and the public's attention was drawn to what had been going on, the opposition suddenly wanted to know about it. They have been asleep at the wheel. The fact is that they could have found out had they watched CNN from 16 January. It is just not enough that they want to capitalise on the photographs. As I have said, the opposition were simply asleep. This whole beat-up, this crazy attack on the minister, is a political stunt. (Time expired)
—Before I put the question I want to clarify a couple of matters that happened during the debate. My attention has been drawn to statements by the Acting Deputy President at the time relating to a call to speak from Senator Brown, I believe, during the censure debate. I point out that the speakers list that is circulated in the chamber really has no status other than as a guide to the chair. The procedure of the chair has always been, under Odgers' Australian Senate Practice, that the chair allocates the call to speak in debate from one side to the other, unless it is the senator in charge of a bill or other matter or the leader of a party who stands to speak. I point out that the Acting Deputy President at the time was therefore correct in the way he allocated the call. He was also correct in holding that Senator Brown could not move a suspension of standing orders pursuant to contingent notice in the course of the debate. That can only be done between matters of business. I hope that clarifies those two rulings of the Acting Deputy President at the time.
Question put:
That the motion be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>MINISTER FOR DEFENCE</title>,<title>Censure Motion</title>,Miscellaneous,11,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2004-06-21,"—by leave—During the adjournment debate last Friday Senator Faulkner made a number of serious allegations relating to the cycling program at the Australian Institute of Sport. I indicated that I would respond early this week. The Australian government are tough on drugs in sport. We have a zero tolerance policy on doping in sport and are proud that our antidoping programs have helped set the standard for the world sporting community. The Australian Sports Commission, the Australian Sports Drug Agency, national sporting organisations and peak bodies like the Australian Olympic Committee and the Australian Commonwealth Games Association combine to ensure that Australia has the best drug education and testing program in the world.
We have been a driving force behind the establishment of the World Anti-Doping Agency and the development of the World Anti-Doping Code, which will, for the first time, ensure there are uniform best practice standards around the world in antidoping. This government has ensured that Australia is a recognised leader in the world fight against drugs in sport. For example, the Council of Europe concluded in 2001, `Australia can certainly claim to have one of the most, if not the most, rigorous antidoping policies and programs in the world.' WADA has acknowledged Australia's active role in the creation and acceptance of the World Anti-Doping Code and the Copenhagen declaration, through which governments signalled their acceptance of the code: Play True issue 1, 2004. In a letter to me dated 19 March 2003, Mr Richard Pound, the President of WADA , said, `We believe we owe a significant debt of gratitude to Australia for having demonstrated a level of confidence and comfort that made it possible for 51 countries to sign the Copenhagen declaration and accept the code,' and, `We were fortunate to have Australia's leadership setting the tone for the other continents.'
Let me briefly set out the facts of the French case. On 2 December material was discovered at the AIS Del Monte facility in Adelaide that implicated an AIS scholarship holder and member of Cycling Australia in a possible doping offence and a possible breach of the AIS scholarship-athlete agreement. This material was discovered by AIS staff who, I am advised, acted immediately and appropriately by notifying management at the facility who then notified the ASC executive, including the head of the AIS. Immediately the ASC, with the support of Cycling Australia, instituted a preliminary internal investigation in accordance with standard practice to establish whether a doping offence may have occurred. The report of the preliminary investigation, which was finalised by 18 December, recommended that an independent investigator be appointed.
The following day Mr Justin Stanwix, a senior lawyer experienced in antidoping matters, was appointed with the agreement of Cycling Australia. Mr Stanwix commenced work immediately before Christmas. He completed his investigation and reported his findings to the ASC and Cycling Australia on 29 January 2004. His report indicated that there was evidence that the cyclist Mark French had a case to answer for breaches of both the ASC and Cycling Australia's antidoping policies. During the investigations Mr French made allegations of a broader culture of injecting vitamins at the AIS cycling program but repeatedly refused to identify the athletes allegedly involved. After reinterviewing athletes, coaches and staff, Mr Stanwix found no evidence to suggest a breach of antidoping policies by other athletes. However, he did find that two athletes had admitted to injecting vitamins on a small number of occasions, actions which do not breach antidoping policies but which are in breach of the AIS's code of conduct.
I am advised that the two cyclists were reprimanded and that any further breach of the code of conduct could result in the termination of the scholarships. In addition to this, all AIS cycling program athletes were counselled about compliance with the AIS supplements policy by AIS staff. I am also advised that for privacy reasons it is not the practice of the AIS to release the names of athletes found to have breached an internal AIS code of conduct. After examining the report thoroughly and seeking legal advice, doping infraction notices were issued to Mr French on 9 February.
The matter then went to the Court of Arbitration for Sport for formal hearing. Mr French was found guilty of antidoping breaches and CAS imposed a ban of two years and a fine of $1,000. The athlete was given 21 days from the date of the award to lodge an appeal. In his submission to CAS the athlete for the first time made specific doping allegations against other named cyclists. This is the issue that is now the subject of public debate and I shall return to this matter later in my statement.
I have received a briefing on the report and have been assured that the report covered thoroughly the discovery of doping substances and materials at the AIS Del Monte establishment on 2 December 2003 and the possibility of more than one athlete being involved in doping activities. Further, I have been assured that actions taken by the ASC and Cycling Australia in response to the report were taken in accordance with their appropriate processes and doping policies. Charges, once laid, were heard by the independent Court of Arbitration for Sport, as required of Cycling Australia by AOC bylaws.
I would now like to deal with some of the claims made by Senator Faulkner in the Senate last week. Senator Faulkner stated as a matter of fact that there is a completely inappropriate culture at the AIS facility Del Monte in Adelaide and that supervision and management was clearly inadequate. He implies that this is a finding from the CAS award when in fact they are allegations made by Mr French. Let me state the facts. A full-time manager and house parents are on call 24 hours a day. The AIS cycling program based at Del Monte includes the AIS Head Coach, Cycling Australia High Performance Manager and AIS Cycling Administrator. In addition, all AIS athletes, including those based at Del Monte, have access to qualified medical staff and psychologists throughout the duration of their AIS scholarship. Senator Faulkner also stated as a matter of fact:  
... it is now known that at least four other cyclists used his room for the injection of both legal and prohibited substances, the latter including Testicomp and equine growth hormone.
This is not a proven fact but another allegation. Senator Faulkner asked whether I had been briefed on the progress of the case. I received regular updates from the ASC Chief Executive Officer, Mr Mark Peters. I am also advised the ASC Chairman, Mr Peter Bartels, was briefed on all developments. Cycling Australia, having jointly appointed the independent investigator and legal representative for the CAS hearing, has also been kept aware of all developments. It is not appropriate, however, for a minister to become involved in the day-to-day management of doping cases. This is best carried out at arm's length from the government of the day.
Senator Faulkner has also said that, despite the considerable evidence, there have been no charges brought against any other athletes. As I have already made clear, Mr French has repeatedly refused to provide specific information that might allow charges to be laid. He failed to provide specific information at any time when the matter was first raised, during the preliminary investigation or during the subsequent independent investigation. It was only a week before the CAS hearing that Mr French submitted a statement to CAS containing the specific allegations. However, under the rules of CAS, the ASC cannot use the information without the approval of all parties involved in the case. Immediately after the conclusion of the CAS hearing, the ASC instructed its solicitors to write to Mr French seeking his permission to use this information for the purposes of a further investigation. Mr French gave his permission late this afternoon.
In question time today, Senator Ray asked for confirmation that equine growth hormone is a schedule 4 poison available for limited use and whether the matter had been referred to the appropriate authorities. I am advised that equine growth hormone is a schedule 4 poison. I am also advised that the ASC, after consultation with the Australian Federal Police, referred the matter formally to the head of the Drug and Organised Crime Investigative Branch of the South Australian Police on 11 March 2004. A copy of the independent investigator's report was provided to the South Australia Police on 7 April 2004 at their request. In addition, on 2 March the ASC approached the Australian Customs Service to initiate a process for Customs to investigate any breach of their legislation. Senator Ray also asked whether I was aware that the World Anti-Doping Agency has described the current problems as the first occasion on which this highly dangerous drug has been used to dope an athlete or athletes. In this context, I note that the CAS arbitrator did not establish that Mr French had used equine growth hormone.
What is to be done? Senator Faulkner said in a speech last week: 
... it is now known that at least four other cyclists used his room for the injection of both legal and prohibited substances ...
Later in his speech, he states: 
... these activities involved up to six athletes locked in French's room on several nights a week for a period of months.
The allegations relating to other athletes are of enormous concern and are being treated seriously, not least because they may have implications for the composition of Australia's Olympic team. These allegations will be investigated without delay. 
I can inform the Senate that, mindful of the Olympic selection issues raised, the ASC this morning convened a teleconference with Cycling Australia, the AOC and the Australian Commonwealth Games Association to discuss the terms of reference and timing constraints for an independent investigation. Specifically, the investigation will inquire into and provide recommendations on the allegations made by Mr French in his evidence given to CAS. I have asked that the investigation also examine and provide recommendations on whether there was any failure of management, systems or supervision at the Del Monte facility and whether the processes put in place by the ASC and other organisations in dealing with this matter were appropriate and effective. The investigator will report to the boards of the Australian Sports Commission and Cycling Australia and his report will be made public, subject to privacy or other legal requirements. However, I would remind the Senate that athletes, like all other Australians, are entitled to be considered innocent until proven guilty. I am pleased to announce that the Hon. Robert Anderson QC, a retired Justice of the Supreme Court of Western Australia, has agreed to conduct the investigation. Mr Anderson is an outstanding jurist and I am sure his appointment will be widely welcomed. I will announce the full terms of reference and the reporting date in the next few days. 
In conclusion, I reiterate that the government is committed to its zero tolerance policy against doping in sport. A thorough investigation of these allegations will be undertaken to ensure that all of our athletes have a level playing field in all aspects of drug-free sport.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Sport: Drug Testing</title>,Ministerial Statements,12,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-06-21,"—by leave—I think the Senate is aware, but let me say again for the record in case it is not understood, that the number of serious allegations that the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Kemp, has referred to contained in my speech last Friday are of course based on the reasons for judgment of the Court of Arbitration for Sport in this particular case. I have also indicated that that judgment is available. A range of other material, certainly not available to me, is accessible to the minister, the Sports Commission, the Australian Institute of Sport and Cycling Australia. I believe—and I have said this before—that there ought to have been action on this earlier. However, it is appropriate that an independent investigation be established into these matters. There is no other course of action to take when these sorts of allegations are contained in a judgment of the Court of Arbitration for Sport. That is appropriate. 
The detail of the independent inquiry remains to be seen. It is not clear what the formal terms of reference are, although the minister has given a broad indication to the Senate of some of the issues that this particular inquiry will deal with. Of course, any such inquiry needs to be credible and independent. That is the key. It will report, as I understand it, to the boards of the Australian Sports Commission and Cycling Australia. This is obviously a decision that the minister has made. I believe that, whilst it is not inappropriate that copies of such a report go to both boards, it would not be inappropriate for such an inquiry to report directly to the minister, but Senator Kemp has indicated that such a report will be made public. That is appropriate. He has caveated his commitment in relation to certain privacy issues, and I do not think that is inappropriate in these circumstances. I assume it is the minister who set the terms of reference for this report. Is that right, Minister?
—I have outlined the broad terms and will be discussing the precise terms in the next couple of days.
—I thank the minister. As I have indicated, the broad terms have been outlined in the minister's speech and the precise terms of reference will be provided at a later stage—the minister has said within a couple of days. It is essential that this matter be dealt with and finalised as soon as possible. I hope that the minister shares that sentiment. He says, `Absolutely,' and I accept that he means that. I could not imagine anything worse than for these issues to become public on the eve of the Olympic Games. These issues have to be investigated and the outcomes have to be finalised prior to the Olympics, because no-one would want to see a situation where any such allegations had an impact on either our Olympic standing or our international standing. We cannot afford to have anything impact on our international standing as a country which has had a drug-free sporting environment. I do not think any reasonable person would disagree with that. Most would understand that any allegations that potentially damage Australian sport, and our reputation as a clean nation in sport, are of the most serious nature.  
We need to see the terms of reference, and I hope they will be provided by the minister as soon as possible. It would be useful for the minister to indicate what powers of compulsion will apply to this particular inquiry. It will be interesting to see what powers to protect witnesses will be provided. It is important that other bodies be included in such a comprehensive process. The issues that my colleague Senator Ray asked about in question time today in relation to possible supply, possession and use of a schedule 4 drug are obviously matters which require the closest and most serious attention in any such inquiry. 
There is, of course, a massive interest in the broad issue of duty of care to athletes. I cannot think of anything more important for those who have these very, very important responsibilities than the duty of care to athletes. I for one do not shy away from this for one moment. I would be very concerned if any culture or practice of drug-taking could flourish at a facility like the Del Monte facility of the AIS. When I read the judgment of the Court of Arbitration for Sport, I found what was occurring at that particular facility incredible. And I am not talking about allegations; I am talking about matters that have been admitted by Mr French, the athlete who was before the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
I think it is important for the minister to indicate to the Senate whether the inquiry will be concluded prior to the deadline for the nomination of the Australian cycling squad for the Athens Olympics. As I understand it, that deadline is 9 July 2004. I hope, Minister, that you will be able to give that assurance to the Senate and to the public because that is what is necessary in this circumstance. It is absolutely essential in this circumstance. I will be looking forward to an inquiry process that is completely open and transparent so that all sport and all Australians can see that this matter has been properly investigated and so that full confidence can again be afforded to the clean status of Australian sport. I know that I am not alone in that sentiment. It is held very broadly in the sporting community. The people who have come to me as a former minister for sport and informed me of the judgment of the Court of Arbitration for Sport obviously strongly share that sentiment, and they are senior people in sport and the administration of sport in this country.
I do not think it was anything other than appropriate to involve the Australian Olympic Committee in this. When these serious allegations were made the first port of call for me was the Australian Olympic Committee and its president, Mr Coates. That is because we could not have a situation like this raised on the eve of or during the Olympic Games. I do not see that as a partisan sentiment in any sense. I would think that all Australians would want to ensure that there are no clouds hanging over any member of our Olympic team. I would hope that that would be—and I believe it would be—a bipartisan sentiment in this parliament as well. 
There is obviously a major task to be done here. Serious allegations have been made. In my speech to the Senate on Friday I very faithfully reported some of the allegations that have been made via the partial judgment of the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The minister has not yet indicated to the Senate whether he is proposing to give leave to allow the tabling of that particular document. I do not know, Minister, whether you have given consideration to that.
—Yes.
—The minister has indicated that it can now be tabled. I do note that it appears to be a document that has received quite wide circulation in at least the media—not as a result, I might say, of my actions or actions from my office. It is a document that is broadly available because a number of people have raised serious concerns about its content with me. I am pleased that an independent inquiry has been launched into these matters. I hope that the minister will be able to report further and very quickly on the issues that I have outlined. I certainly hope that it can conclude its work quickly. I hope as a result of this that Australia's standing will be strengthened before the Olympic Games in Athens.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Sport: Drug Testing</title>,Ministerial Statements,12,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-21,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This is a report on the management of the detention centre contracts under the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. It is worth noting, as you have just said yourself, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it was tabled after the Senate adjourned at about 4.30 p.m. on Friday. It is a fairly typical but nonetheless inexcusable attempt by this government to hide what is clearly a disgraceful and damning report by the Auditor-General into the management of Australia's immigration detention centres. A typical longstanding government practice—I think the phrase used in The West Wing `is taking out the trash'—is to put the report out late on Friday afternoon after the parliament has risen so nobody can speak to it and hope that people do not notice. Thankfully, some people in the press gallery did notice and have reported on it, and many people who follow what this government does in the area of immigration detention also noticed. 
I will briefly touch on some of the conclusions of the Auditor-General's report and its overall findings. The report said:
The ANAO concluded that DIMIA's management of its contract with ACM—
that is, Australasian Correctional Management, which was the company running detention centres—
suffered from a lack of clearly identified and articulated requirements. Through the life of the contract, considerable time and resources were expended ... managing the emerging issues from an increasing workload. However, DIMIA did not take the initiative and clarify its objectives. DIMIA decided not to amend the contract to establish clear expectations of the services to be delivered, or refine the standards it used to monitor and report on ACM's performance. These shortcomings adversely affected DIMIA's ability to: assess overall service delivery; determine the quality of service required and delivered in key areas; manage shared responsibilities; and establish priorities for improvement. 
We are talking about an immigration detention centre here. It is to all intents and purposes a jail, except that it is for people who have not been convicted of any crime and, indeed, have not been charged with any offence. To have such failings in assessing overall service delivery and the quality of that service in key areas means that the detainees—very vulnerable people; asylum seekers—were in a situation where the performance of their jailors was not being properly monitored. The report states:
DIMIA's overall objectives in contracting out detention services were not clearly, or consistently, articulated over the life of the contract.
	...	...	...
DIMIA did not identify and document the risks associated with the private provision of detention services.
The private provision of jails or jail-like environments is very controversial. It has a pretty poor history. To go down this path without setting in place the associated risks is completely unacceptable. The report goes on to say:
... the contractual requirements lacked sufficient specificity to enable DIMIA to adequately monitor the quality and nature of the services provided by ACM.
Again, let us remember that these so-called services are the detention of asylum seekers. The report continued:
The ANAO concluded that there was a low level of assurance that the financial aspects of the contract operated as intended. Although there have been improvements in recent times, for the most part, financial performance measures and reporting in respect of the detention contract were limited. As well, DIMIA did not actively manage the savings share arrangements to protect the interests of the Commonwealth—
that is, the taxpayer. The report continued:
The costs of the contract itself, and contract administration increased over the life of the contract, and not always in proportion to the level of contracting activity. The ANAO notes that, over the life of the contract, the human resources used by DIMIA to manage the detention function, including contract monitoring, increased from a section in DIMIA with 15 staff to a division with 150.
This is taxpayers' money that is being expended on a detention regime that the Democrats believe is not necessary. Think of the costs of 150 staff simply to manage the detention function alone. This is not to run the centres; this is just to oversee the operation of the contract. Also, the Audit Office report said:
While the contract provided a basis for infrastructure management, it lacked clarity about DIMIA and ACM responsibilities.
I suspect that that is not accidental. People who sought to raise concerns about specific instances in detention centres met with the continual frustration of being bounced backwards and forwards between the department and ACM about who was responsible for what issue. It is a bit like the finger-pointing between state and federal governments. You can never get anywhere, because it is always someone else's responsibility. I suggest that it is probably no coincidence that that was the way it panned out in this case. I should mention that ACM is no longer running detention centres. They are now run by a different company. Whether or not the situation has improved is another question.
Let us not forget that these are facilities—and I have visited all of the detention centres that are currently open in Australia—that in certain circumstances authorise strip-searching, effective solitary confinement or isolation, and the use of handcuffs and flexicuffs. This is a private company authorised under the Migration Act to operate what are supposedly—and what are still often called—processing and reception centres where people are put in isolation as a management technique. It is not even as punishment. If you tried to do it as punishment it would be illegal. There is no proper process for people to find out why they are being put in so-called management or isolation or to appeal against such decisions. It is completely outside any administrative overview mechanism. I have used the term `prison' and drawn comparisons with the contracting out or privatising of the running of prisons, but with detention centres the contractors are actually far less accountable. Our prisons are established under state law. They are at least overseen by a consistent legal regime. There are proper procedures. If prison officers do not follow procedure—if they inappropriately discipline somebody or use punishment without following procedure—then there is legal recourse. There is no such luck for detainees under our detention regime. 
I have been to the Nauru detention centre, which is not run by this company. It is run by the International Organization for Migration, which is an international non-government organisation. It was still contracted by DIMIA, but the big difference that I saw, having been to the Nauru centre twice, was not the facilities—though there were certainly differences there—but the attitude of the management. Certainly, there are some who criticise the management there. But I would say that their whole attitude is not of security and detention but of caring for the people that they have a responsibility to look after while a migration outcome is found for them. It is a very different attitude and it reflects very differently in the end result. It does not mean that there are not problems there. There are inevitably problems because there are still people who are locked away for years at a time, outside the legal process, with no understanding or hope about what their future holds. But this clearly shows why it is such a problem to have a correctional company—a security or prisons company—with a detention and security mindset running what are still called immigration reception and processing centres.
This Audit Office report highlights why that is a problem. These are places that have extremely ill people—traumatised people. Just last weekend in Baxter detention centre in Port Augusta a man overdosed. He had to be taken to Adelaide hospital in a very serious condition following that overdose. That is the sort of despair and desperation people are driven to as their only way out of these places. Many of these people have asked to return and are still not able to. There is no prospect of them returning and no avenue out into the Australian community. They are just trapped. The only way out is through complete psychological breakdown. Those sorts of people need a caring environment, not something that is run like a jail and not something that is set up in the appalling way this Audit Office report demonstrates.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-21,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This is a report on the management of the detention centre contracts under the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. It is worth noting, as you have just said yourself, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it was tabled after the Senate adjourned at about 4.30 p.m. on Friday. It is a fairly typical but nonetheless inexcusable attempt by this government to hide what is clearly a disgraceful and damning report by the Auditor-General into the management of Australia's immigration detention centres. A typical longstanding government practice—I think the phrase used in The West Wing `is taking out the trash'—is to put the report out late on Friday afternoon after the parliament has risen so nobody can speak to it and hope that people do not notice. Thankfully, some people in the press gallery did notice and have reported on it, and many people who follow what this government does in the area of immigration detention also noticed. 
I will briefly touch on some of the conclusions of the Auditor-General's report and its overall findings. The report said:
The ANAO concluded that DIMIA's management of its contract with ACM—
that is, Australasian Correctional Management, which was the company running detention centres—
suffered from a lack of clearly identified and articulated requirements. Through the life of the contract, considerable time and resources were expended ... managing the emerging issues from an increasing workload. However, DIMIA did not take the initiative and clarify its objectives. DIMIA decided not to amend the contract to establish clear expectations of the services to be delivered, or refine the standards it used to monitor and report on ACM's performance. These shortcomings adversely affected DIMIA's ability to: assess overall service delivery; determine the quality of service required and delivered in key areas; manage shared responsibilities; and establish priorities for improvement. 
We are talking about an immigration detention centre here. It is to all intents and purposes a jail, except that it is for people who have not been convicted of any crime and, indeed, have not been charged with any offence. To have such failings in assessing overall service delivery and the quality of that service in key areas means that the detainees—very vulnerable people; asylum seekers—were in a situation where the performance of their jailors was not being properly monitored. The report states:
DIMIA's overall objectives in contracting out detention services were not clearly, or consistently, articulated over the life of the contract.
	...	...	...
DIMIA did not identify and document the risks associated with the private provision of detention services.
The private provision of jails or jail-like environments is very controversial. It has a pretty poor history. To go down this path without setting in place the associated risks is completely unacceptable. The report goes on to say:
... the contractual requirements lacked sufficient specificity to enable DIMIA to adequately monitor the quality and nature of the services provided by ACM.
Again, let us remember that these so-called services are the detention of asylum seekers. The report continued:
The ANAO concluded that there was a low level of assurance that the financial aspects of the contract operated as intended. Although there have been improvements in recent times, for the most part, financial performance measures and reporting in respect of the detention contract were limited. As well, DIMIA did not actively manage the savings share arrangements to protect the interests of the Commonwealth—
that is, the taxpayer. The report continued:
The costs of the contract itself, and contract administration increased over the life of the contract, and not always in proportion to the level of contracting activity. The ANAO notes that, over the life of the contract, the human resources used by DIMIA to manage the detention function, including contract monitoring, increased from a section in DIMIA with 15 staff to a division with 150.
This is taxpayers' money that is being expended on a detention regime that the Democrats believe is not necessary. Think of the costs of 150 staff simply to manage the detention function alone. This is not to run the centres; this is just to oversee the operation of the contract. Also, the Audit Office report said:
While the contract provided a basis for infrastructure management, it lacked clarity about DIMIA and ACM responsibilities.
I suspect that that is not accidental. People who sought to raise concerns about specific instances in detention centres met with the continual frustration of being bounced backwards and forwards between the department and ACM about who was responsible for what issue. It is a bit like the finger-pointing between state and federal governments. You can never get anywhere, because it is always someone else's responsibility. I suggest that it is probably no coincidence that that was the way it panned out in this case. I should mention that ACM is no longer running detention centres. They are now run by a different company. Whether or not the situation has improved is another question.
Let us not forget that these are facilities—and I have visited all of the detention centres that are currently open in Australia—that in certain circumstances authorise strip-searching, effective solitary confinement or isolation, and the use of handcuffs and flexicuffs. This is a private company authorised under the Migration Act to operate what are supposedly—and what are still often called—processing and reception centres where people are put in isolation as a management technique. It is not even as punishment. If you tried to do it as punishment it would be illegal. There is no proper process for people to find out why they are being put in so-called management or isolation or to appeal against such decisions. It is completely outside any administrative overview mechanism. I have used the term `prison' and drawn comparisons with the contracting out or privatising of the running of prisons, but with detention centres the contractors are actually far less accountable. Our prisons are established under state law. They are at least overseen by a consistent legal regime. There are proper procedures. If prison officers do not follow procedure—if they inappropriately discipline somebody or use punishment without following procedure—then there is legal recourse.

That the Senate take note of the report.
Tonight I table the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee's report Beyond Cole—The future of the construction industry: confrontation or co-operation? This report represents Australia's first federal parliamentary committee inquiry into the building and construction industry. It is written in the context of looking at radical legislation proposed by the government to create a separate industrial relations regime for construction workers. It chronicles one of the most biased, poorly drafted and downright simplistic pieces of legislation that has ever been brought to the attention of the Senate.
This legislation is a recipe for disaster. It threatens the stability of the industry and represents an intolerable assault on the rights of construction workers and the principle of employment equity. It is the natural successor to the politically motivated Cole royal commission, which saw the government attempt to use a royal commission in order to corrupt the public mind. For this reason, the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 has been roundly rejected by the committee majority.
This legislation represents a cynical attempt by the government to reincarnate numerous provisions and clauses from previously rejected legislation. It maintains the tradition of workplace relations ministers applying Orwellian titles to their bills. Unfortunately, though, this bill will do nothing to improve the lives of the employers, employees and customers of the building and construction industry. The inquiry elicited 125 submissions, with 141 people appearing as witnesses around the country at 14 public hearings. Submissions came from individuals and organisations on both sides of the industrial fence. The committee sought in vain for direct evidence from builders and developers in support of the proposed legislation. However, the vast majority broadly opposed aspects of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 and many opposed the bill in its entirety.
The committee noted that evidence from industry bodies supporting the principles of the bill were highly critical of its details. This suggests widespread scepticism of the practicalities of the legislation. For instance, the submission received from the largest construction company, Multiplex, avoided endorsing the bill and proposed its own solution to industrial dispute resolution in the industry. In fact, developers and builders have been conspicuously quiet or unenthusiastic about the government's legislation because this bill will do nothing to improve productivity or solve any of the problems that currently exist in the building industry. The report does not just comment on the bill, however; it also provides a thorough critique of the procedures and outcomes of the Cole royal commission from which this legislation was spawned. The report attempts to cover the spectrum of industry related matters that will be affected by the bill if it is passed. The government seems to be taking a `try and try again' attitude and approach to this area of policy. 
At the heart of the bill is the notion that this industry is so troubled, unproductive and tainted with illegality that it requires the creation of a quarantined industrial relations regime. The whole industry, employers and employees alike—making up around seven per cent of the work force—will be fenced off from the rest of the working population and work, as in a gulag, under a much more exacting and proscriptive structure. Numerous submissions, not to mention evidence given before the committee, show that no-one in the industry is sure exactly where the fence is.
The committee majority found no compelling evidence that the situation in the building industry is so dire, either in terms of productivity or industrial relations, as to justify such extreme measures. The inquiry showed that the conclusions of the Cole royal commission, which underpin this bill, were not just incorrect; they were diametrically opposed to the true problems facing the industry. 
Commissioner Cole concluded that occupational health and safety disputes were being used by unions for spurious or intimidatory reasons. However, witness after witness told us about dangerous working conditions and a lack of occupational health and safety inspectors in some states and territories. Commissioner Cole recommended an expansion of the powers of royal commissions. The committee heard numerous witnesses call into question Commissioner Cole's adherence to standards of procedural fairness and natural justice. Indeed, instead of recommending an expansion of the power of royal commissions, as Commissioner Cole did, we are directing that the Senate investigate the possibility of amending the Royal Commissions Act to ensure some measure of protection for the civil rights of witnesses called before such commissions.
Commissioner Cole warned against practices such as pattern bargaining and project agreements, whereas the committee found that these agreements bring certainty to parties on both sides and ensure industrial harmony and fairness in tendering. Commissioner Cole alleged a culture of lawlessness in the building industry—which is so entrenched as to require that it be regulated separately under the supervision of a powerful building industry task force—whereas the committee was presented with evidence that in 2000-01 an average building worker engaged in industrial action for less than half a day per year.
The committee majority found that most players in the industry are pragmatic and practical people who just want to get on with their jobs. This bill, instead of getting rid of any industrial difficulties, is likely to provoke major industrial confrontation that will cause considerable damage to the industry and the economy. Commissioner Cole largely ignored some of the more pressing issues in the industry, such as skills shortages, workers compensation and entitlements, tax avoidance schemes and phoenix companies.
In short, evidence presented to the committee contradicted almost every conclusion made by Commissioner Cole. If Commissioner Cole's conclusions are wrong then this bill, if passed, would be wrong also. Instead of simplifying the process, this bill would make the laws governing the industry unnecessarily complex. The only people who would benefit would be industrial relations lawyers. Our inquiry was never able to find out who actually called for a royal commission into this industry. No witness we heard from asked for it and very few people were consulted before it was established. 
In its report the committee was forced to rely on speculation because it was not able to put government assumptions about the effects of its proposed legislation through the appropriate inquiry processes. As a consequence of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations declining the committee's invitation to appear before it, we were unable to question him on policy details of the bill and the likely consequences of certain provisions of the bill. Departmental officers who appeared for the government could not be expected to answer questions that go to the heart of policy, explaining the reasons behind ministerial policy, let alone speculate on the likely effects of the bill's passage on the state of the industry. 
In essence, the government has escaped effective scrutiny by both houses in the consideration of this bill. The result has been a failure in political processes and a textbook example of how not to make public policy. The future of the building and construction industry will not be secured by an ideological agenda, driven by a government intent on confrontation with the labour movement at any cost; rather, the future of the industry will depend on a cooperative arrangement between capital and labour. 
Finally, I must reluctantly comment on the unacceptable and disappointing behaviour of at least one government senator during the course of the inquiry. He made a number of baseless claims, accusing the unions of intimidating witnesses who wished to appear before the hearings. Allegations were also made that I, as the committee's chair and, indirectly, the secretariat, unduly influenced the choosing of witnesses and the allocation of days for committee hearings. These accusations were made without any evidence and signified the desperation of the government at the fact that the vast majority of witnesses who appeared before the committee were highly critical of the proposed legislation. The government did not like the outcome, so they smeared the process. 
Finally, I would like to thank the secretariat of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee, particularly its secretary, John Carter, and research officer, Vanessa Horton, for their hard work and dedication during this inquiry.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2004-06-21,"—I wish to speak to the report of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee entitled Beyond Cole—The future of the construction industry: confrontation or co-operation?I also wish to speak to the government senators' report contained within the printed volume. The majority report of the references committee is of course an extremely conservative document. It is immersed in the ways of old Labor and the reluctance of the affiliates of the trade union movement, particularly the building and construction industry unions, to embrace the sort of reform that almost every other industry in Australia has embraced. The situation is that the opposition party is affiliated with the unions, and this affiliation was extraordinarily evident throughout the committee's hearings. 
We know that the Cole royal commission was called due largely to the response of a Mr Sutton, who is the New South Wales secretary of the CFMEU. He indicated that there was an involvement in his union of a certain Mr Domican, who is a renowned and well-known, may I say, underworld figure. Of course, the minister responded to this by saying, `All right, if I have a senior union official raising the involvement of a renowned underworld figure in the building and construction industry, we'll have a royal commission.' That is what we did. Of course, the thing about the royal commission is that it was the first time that anybody had taken any great time or trouble to look at the conduct of these building unions on commercial building and construction sites, principally in CBDs, in each of the capital cities in Australia.  
What were we on about with the Cole royal commission? In Victoria last year two union officers of the CFMEU were confronted in their office when shots were fired and every window in the building in Carlton was broken and blown out. Further shots were fired at the Swanston Street headquarters of the CFMEU in Melbourne and bullets were fired throughout the building. I also draw your attention to the fact that the secretary of the New South Wales AMU, Mr Doug Cameron, has been twice assaulted at his home over the past two years. I put it to Mr Cameron, who gave evidence, that this was not a matter of him parking on his neighbour's verge or a tree hanging over an adjoining fence; this was about industrial muscle, industrial power and the exertion of nefarious industrial activity against him. He refused to engage with this: `I don't know; I've reported it to the police and I don't want to be drawn on what the reason is.' Everybody knows what is going on in this industry and the Labor senators in this place covered it up.
Let us talk about Mr Paddy McCrudden, a Victorian member of the CEPU, who suffered severe injuries and spent nine hours in the emergency department of Geelong Hospital after being viciously bashed during a union strategy meeting in Victoria. I ask you: is this the conduct that we can expect in a reputable industry? Let me talk about Mr Peter Harries, member of the CFMEU, who required several stitches to a severe facial cut as a result of a union related assault in Newcastle last year. These are the sorts of activities that confronted the committee. No matter how hard you try, you will not find them reported in the majority report of this committee. These are the sorts of things that the affiliated party to these unions does not want you to know about. It does not want Australia to know about them. It is absolutely outrageous conduct and indicative of a wider malaise of lawlessness in this industry costing the Australian taxpayer, investors and builders millions and billions of dollars.
The government's determination to confront the issue of union lawlessness in the construction industry has provoked mild fury in the Labor movement. I can tell you we saw union member after union member to the point where I said to three commercial witnesses: `How is it that the state secretary of the CFMEU has your submission? Which of you gave your submission to the state secretary of the CFMEU? Come on, put your hands up.' And the three of them very gingerly put their hands up. I said: `Why would you do such a thing? Why would you disclose your submission to our committee to the state secretary when you are in private business?' The reply was: `We don't really have an answer for that.' Vague and uncertain, they were the classic victims of stand-over tactics. Witness after witness was put before us through the CFMEU. It was a parade; it was a charade.
The mild fury in the Labor movement is certainly the result of touching a tender nerve because of the strains and pressures it exerts on the affiliation ties. Labor senators have devoted much energy on this committee to affirming and reinforcing ties with the CFMEU, CEPU and other unions affected by this legislation. In other words, the jig is up and they do not like it. The tactics of intimidation in this industry, which are impossible to paper over, are not stories that the Labor Party likes to hear. Inevitably, they would rather not know, or be seen not to know, about these things and there is no alternative to assuming an attitude of denial. 
Ten minutes does not do justice to what I have seen over the course of the last six months. But, as an example of union power, I was questioning the state secretary of the CFMEU in Western Australia and he was telling us how one of the state members of parliament, who is a minister, was a person who had not done his bidding. Her name was Alannah MacTiernan. I said to him, `What had she done to lose your support on state executive?' He was just about to tell me and—guess what—the chair ruled my question out of order. We were just getting to the length and breadth, the extent, of the power of a union in Western Australia to control elected representatives of the public—her seat is Armadale—and the question was ruled out of order, because I tell you it is a tender nerve and we were getting far too close to the bone. This is the flavour of this inquiry. 
This problem has been around for a very long time. Let me quote Senator Peter Cook from 1990:
Friends, this industry is going to have to bite the bullet at last. If this country wants to be efficient and productive, everybody has to undergo the reform process—and most especially an industry which has such pressuring and demonstrable need for it.
Nothing has changed. Senator Cook acknowledged the need to reform this industry way back in 1990 but did nothing about it, and this government has been confronted with the difficult task of doing it. This legislation is very sound and solid legislation with which to do it.
A careful reading of the majority report reveals what a conservative document it is. Opposition senators are more comfortable living with the certainties of the past than embracing changes to secure future needs of the construction industry. Thus no solution is offered in the opposition report for the chronic problems faced by builders and contractors to deal with trade union extortion and intimidation. Let me say that we heard legions of it. Witness after witness came along and said: `We can't get contractors to come to your committee because they will be intimidated. They will be victimised.' 
It would be extremely difficult for the opposition to agree on how the reform of the building industry could be done; therefore, it is better to say that the problem does not exist. Indeed, the majority report says precisely that: the Cole royal commission was just a fantasy. The intimidation and brutalisation of people in the building and construction industry by the CFMEU in particular does not occur, according to senators opposite. I have to say that that is an insult to intelligence. The last point I want to make is that the ILO conventions were put to us many times.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-21,"—I rise to take note of the tabling of the report entitled Beyond Cole—The future of the construction industry: confrontation or co-operation? I commence by thanking the secretariat in particular for their hard work in what was a very complex, emotive and difficult task. I also want to acknowledge my appreciation to the chair of the committee. I thought he handled the inquiry rather well, given the tensions that surround this issue. 
The Cole royal commission in both origin and conduct increased the temperature and allegations surrounding the building and construction industry. Political tension between the coalition government and the Labor Party concerning building unions and their conduct has been high both before and since the commission. Although these political tensions have been clearly apparent in the committee's work, looked at objectively the committee has done a considerable service to the BCI—the building and construction industry—not just in putting some balance into the assessment of Cole but in addressing issues and perspectives insufficiently covered by Commissioner Cole.  
My impression is of a diverse range of reactions to the proposed Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003. As a generalisation, peak employer groups strongly support the proposed legislation and Cole, present union officials in a devilish light and are louder about stronger workplace relations law than about OHS, entitlements, rorts and tax avoidance. Key unions in the ACTU are strongly opposed to the bill and Cole, present union officials in an angelic light but share Cole's concerns about OHS, entitlements, rorts and tax avoidance. Some companies are convinced that the bill is in their interest, some are not and most are silent onlookers. Many who have seen me privately would not appear before the committee but are adamant that the Workplace Relations Act is not curbing unacceptable behaviour in the industry. Other observers, such as academics and law firms, have strongly criticised the bill. Much media commentary has focused on an anti-union bias in Cole and the bill. 
There was much criticism about the Cole royal commission and, therefore, the legitimacy of the bill in dealing with the problems of the BCI. However legitimate the criticism may be of the motivations for directions taken and selectivity of the Cole royal commission, the Cole report properly drew attention to unacceptable industrial practice that challenged the rule of law, undermined the intent of the Workplace Relations Act and adversely affected productivity, efficiency and competition.
The Democrats strongly support the need for greater compliance with the law and more effective law enforcement. The royal commission identified weaknesses in the current mechanisms of enforcing law of general application, including criminal law, industrial relations law, civil law, tax law and state law. Therefore another question we considered during this inquiry was: if one of the key findings of the commission was a weakness in current enforcement mechanisms, how will creating new workplace relations laws solve a problem that has been identified as failure of the market regulators across these fields of law? The committee heard evidence from witness after witness, whether they were industry or union, that regulatory failure was a critical issue, if not the critical issue, facing the BCI. 
The Democrats support a system where all Australians—employers and employees alike—would have the same industrial relations rights and obligations regardless of where they lived. Supporting industry specific regulators would fly in the face of the Democrats' beliefs. We are philosophically, practically and politically antagonistic to the idea of an industry specific regulator. In addition, we believe that it would be a waste of resources to establish an industry specific regulator if better regulation enforcement of the law meant that after a few years they were no longer needed. 
The Democrats support one of the central propositions behind the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2003—that is, greater regulation and enforcement of workplace relations law is necessary. We do not support the second central proposition behind the bills that industry specific legislation and sweeping new workplace relations law provisions are necessary to achieve this aim. The building and construction industry improvement bills will be opposed outright by the Australian Democrats. They cannot be salvaged or amended. The problems in the industry and in other industries would be far better addressed by enforcement of existing law and the creation of a well-resourced, independent, national workplace relations regulator.  
We are of the opinion that, as for other sectors of the economy such as ACCC, APRA, ASIC, ATO, greater regulation and enforcement of workplace relations law is desirable of itself as a market mechanism and as a social service mechanism and that folding ineffective departmental inspectorates, the Employment Advocate and so on into a standard regulatory body would considerably advance regulatory practice in industrial relations in Australia. We believe that workplace relations law is only as strong as its enforcement and that its enforcement is weak in the BCI. The lack of a well-resourced, active regulator with standard regulatory powers, plus inadequate penalties, is the prime cause of ineffective application and observance of existing law. The Senate inquiry reinforced the fact that better enforcement mechanisms and not new wide-ranging industrial laws were needed. The Democrats believe that there has been enough evidence before the Senate to support the need for an independent national workplace relations regulator. 
Lawlessness might not be the best way to describe non-compliance with the law. The laws do exist, but whether it is tax or workers compensation avoidance or blatant disregard for the Corporations Law, the problem is weak enforcement. While it is quite wrong to characterise the BCI as an industry where the rule of law does not apply, criminality, corruption and thuggery have to be addressed where they exist.
The Senate inquiry also highlighted the problems of having different industrial relations jurisdictions for the industry as well as the desire for a unitary system. The Democrats have consistently argued for years now that we need one industrial relations system, not six. We have a small population, yet we have nine governments and a ridiculous overlap of laws and regulations. There are areas of policy and jurisdiction that the states no longer have sensible involvement in. Like finance, corporations and trade practices law, labour law is one of those areas. The Democrats believe that a unitary system does not have to be achieved with an all or nothing outcome. We strongly urge whichever party is in power in the next term to seriously consider the efficiencies and benefits that can be derived from a unitary industrial relations system.
Having highlighted the Democrats' preference for addressing general mechanisms, the Democrats are not against targeting a problem in the short term. We supported the extension of the life of the interim national building industry task force and would not be opposed to increasing its information gathering powers on a temporary basis while the government worked towards establishing a national workplace relations regulator. We would also support providing additional resources to bodies such as the ACCC, ATO, AIRC, and probably ASIC, to focus on BCI hotspots.
We support the committee's majority recommendation No. 1 and its other recommendations either in full or, in the case of recommendation No. 2, by assessing any legislation on its merits. Our key recommendations are: to oppose the building and construction industry improvement bills; to establish an independent national workplace relations regulator; to include merit based appointments provisions in any legislation created to establish a national workplace relations regulator; to increase penalty provisions under the Workplace Relations Act for all industries; to include whistleblower protection provisions in the WRA; to increase the powers and capacity of the Industrial Relations Commission to make good faith bargaining orders, to resolve disputes on their merits and to make more determinations; and to amend the Workplace Relations Act to enable genuine project agreements to be reached and certified for major projects. Further, we recommend that the government consider legislating a definition of `employee' into the Workplace Relations Act 1996; that the building industry task force play a more active role in pursuing the underpayment of employee entitlements; that the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Workplace Relations Act be amended to ensure that democratic control of donations remains with members of registered organisations and shareholders; that donations are capped; that donations with strings attached are prohibited; and, that there be better disclosure requirements. 
We believe the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Workplace Relations Act should be amended as appropriate to ensure democratic control remains vested in the members of political parties and not in the hands of unions or of business. We believe a national unitary industrial relations system should be introduced. In conclusion, we have today announced that we reject the building and construction industry bills. We have offered the remedy of a national regulator and, in the interim, we have agreed to make a number of amendments to the Workplace Relations Act to fulfil our recommendations or some of those.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,20,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-21,"—I rise to speak on the Senate Employment and Workplace Relations Committee's report entitled Beyond Cole—The future of the construction industry: confrontation or co-operation?It raises a significant issue.

That the Senate take note of the report.
Tonight I table the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee's report Beyond Cole—The future of the construction industry: confrontation or co-operation? This report represents Australia's first federal parliamentary committee inquiry into the building and construction industry. It is written in the context of looking at radical legislation proposed by the government to create a separate industrial relations regime for construction workers. It chronicles one of the most biased, poorly drafted and downright simplistic pieces of legislation that has ever been brought to the attention of the Senate.
This legislation is a recipe for disaster. It threatens the stability of the industry and represents an intolerable assault on the rights of construction workers and the principle of employment equity. It is the natural successor to the politically motivated Cole royal commission, which saw the government attempt to use a royal commission in order to corrupt the public mind. For this reason, the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 has been roundly rejected by the committee majority.
This legislation represents a cynical attempt by the government to reincarnate numerous provisions and clauses from previously rejected legislation. It maintains the tradition of workplace relations ministers applying Orwellian titles to their bills. Unfortunately, though, this bill will do nothing to improve the lives of the employers, employees and customers of the building and construction industry. The inquiry elicited 125 submissions, with 141 people appearing as witnesses around the country at 14 public hearings. Submissions came from individuals and organisations on both sides of the industrial fence. The committee sought in vain for direct evidence from builders and developers in support of the proposed legislation. However, the vast majority broadly opposed aspects of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 and many opposed the bill in its entirety.
The committee noted that evidence from industry bodies supporting the principles of the bill were highly critical of its details. This suggests widespread scepticism of the practicalities of the legislation. For instance, the submission received from the largest construction company, Multiplex, avoided endorsing the bill and proposed its own solution to industrial dispute resolution in the industry. In fact, developers and builders have been conspicuously quiet or unenthusiastic about the government's legislation because this bill will do nothing to improve productivity or solve any of the problems that currently exist in the building industry. The report does not just comment on the bill, however; it also provides a thorough critique of the procedures and outcomes of the Cole royal commission from which this legislation was spawned. The report attempts to cover the spectrum of industry related matters that will be affected by the bill if it is passed. The government seems to be taking a `try and try again' attitude and approach to this area of policy. 
At the heart of the bill is the notion that this industry is so troubled, unproductive and tainted with illegality that it requires the creation of a quarantined industrial relations regime. The whole industry, employers and employees alike—making up around seven per cent of the work force—will be fenced off from the rest of the working population and work, as in a gulag, under a much more exacting and proscriptive structure. Numerous submissions, not to mention evidence given before the committee, show that no-one in the industry is sure exactly where the fence is.
The committee majority found no compelling evidence that the situation in the building industry is so dire, either in terms of productivity or industrial relations, as to justify such extreme measures. The inquiry showed that the conclusions of the Cole royal commission, which underpin this bill, were not just incorrect; they were diametrically opposed to the true problems facing the industry. 
Commissioner Cole concluded that occupational health and safety disputes were being used by unions for spurious or intimidatory reasons. However, witness after witness told us about dangerous working conditions and a lack of occupational health and safety inspectors in some states and territories. Commissioner Cole recommended an expansion of the powers of royal commissions. The committee heard numerous witnesses call into question Commissioner Cole's adherence to standards of procedural fairness and natural justice. Indeed, instead of recommending an expansion of the power of royal commissions, as Commissioner Cole did, we are directing that the Senate investigate the possibility of amending the Royal Commissions Act to ensure some measure of protection for the civil rights of witnesses called before such commissions.
Commissioner Cole warned against practices such as pattern bargaining and project agreements, whereas the committee found that these agreements bring certainty to parties on both sides and ensure industrial harmony and fairness in tendering. Commissioner Cole alleged a culture of lawlessness in the building industry—which is so entrenched as to require that it be regulated separately under the supervision of a powerful building industry task force—whereas the committee was presented with evidence that in 2000-01 an average building worker engaged in industrial action for less than half a day per year.
The committee majority found that most players in the industry are pragmatic and practical people who just want to get on with their jobs. This bill, instead of getting rid of any industrial difficulties, is likely to provoke major industrial confrontation that will cause considerable damage to the industry and the economy. Commissioner Cole largely ignored some of the more pressing issues in the industry, such as skills shortages, workers compensation and entitlements, tax avoidance schemes and phoenix companies.
In short, evidence presented to the committee contradicted almost every conclusion made by Commissioner Cole. If Commissioner Cole's conclusions are wrong then this bill, if passed, would be wrong also. Instead of simplifying the process, this bill would make the laws governing the industry unnecessarily complex. The only people who would benefit would be industrial relations lawyers. Our inquiry was never able to find out who actually called for a royal commission into this industry. No witness we heard from asked for it and very few people were consulted before it was established. 
In its report the committee was forced to rely on speculation because it was not able to put government assumptions about the effects of its proposed legislation through the appropriate inquiry processes. As a consequence of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations declining the committee's invitation to appear before it, we were unable to question him on policy details of the bill and the likely consequences of certain provisions of the bill. Departmental officers who appeared for the government could not be expected to answer questions that go to the heart of policy, explaining the reasons behind ministerial policy, let alone speculate on the likely effects of the bill's passage on the state of the industry. 
In essence, the government has escaped effective scrutiny by both houses in the consideration of this bill. The result has been a failure in political processes and a textbook example of how not to make public policy. The future of the building and construction industry will not be secured by an ideological agenda, driven by a government intent on confrontation with the labour movement at any cost; rather, the future of the industry will depend on a cooperative arrangement between capital and labour. 
Finally, I must reluctantly comment on the unacceptable and disappointing behaviour of at least one government senator during the course of the inquiry. He made a number of baseless claims, accusing the unions of intimidating witnesses who wished to appear before the hearings. Allegations were also made that I, as the committee's chair and, indirectly, the secretariat, unduly influenced the choosing of witnesses and the allocation of days for committee hearings. These accusations were made without any evidence and signified the desperation of the government at the fact that the vast majority of witnesses who appeared before the committee were highly critical of the proposed legislation. The government did not like the outcome, so they smeared the process. 
Finally, I would like to thank the secretariat of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee, particularly its secretary, John Carter, and research officer, Vanessa Horton, for their hard work and dedication during this inquiry. As always, their professionalism is beyond reproach.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,20,2
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2004-06-21,"—I wish to speak to the report of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee entitled Beyond Cole—The future of the construction industry: confrontation or co-operation?I also wish to speak to the government senators' report contained within the printed volume. The majority report of the references committee is of course an extremely conservative document. It is immersed in the ways of old Labor and the reluctance of the affiliates of the trade union movement, particularly the building and construction industry unions, to embrace the sort of reform that almost every other industry in Australia has embraced. The situation is that the opposition party is affiliated with the unions, and this affiliation was extraordinarily evident throughout the committee's hearings. 
We know that the Cole royal commission was called due largely to the response of a Mr Sutton, who is the New South Wales secretary of the CFMEU. He indicated that there was an involvement in his union of a certain Mr Domican, who is a renowned and well-known, may I say, underworld figure. Of course, the minister responded to this by saying, `All right, if I have a senior union official raising the involvement of a renowned underworld figure in the building and construction industry, we'll have a royal commission.' That is what we did. Of course, the thing about the royal commission is that it was the first time that anybody had taken any great time or trouble to look at the conduct of these building unions on commercial building and construction sites, principally in CBDs, in each of the capital cities in Australia.  
What were we on about with the Cole royal commission? In Victoria last year two union officers of the CFMEU were confronted in their office when shots were fired and every window in the building in Carlton was broken and blown out. Further shots were fired at the Swanston Street headquarters of the CFMEU in Melbourne and bullets were fired throughout the building. I also draw your attention to the fact that the secretary of the New South Wales AMU, Mr Doug Cameron, has been twice assaulted at his home over the past two years. I put it to Mr Cameron, who gave evidence, that this was not a matter of him parking on his neighbour's verge or a tree hanging over an adjoining fence; this was about industrial muscle, industrial power and the exertion of nefarious industrial activity against him. He refused to engage with this: `I don't know; I've reported it to the police and I don't want to be drawn on what the reason is.' Everybody knows what is going on in this industry and the Labor senators in this place covered it up.
Let us talk about Mr Paddy McCrudden, a Victorian member of the CEPU, who suffered severe injuries and spent nine hours in the emergency department of Geelong Hospital after being viciously bashed during a union strategy meeting in Victoria. I ask you: is this the conduct that we can expect in a reputable industry? Let me talk about Mr Peter Harries, member of the CFMEU, who required several stitches to a severe facial cut as a result of a union related assault in Newcastle last year. These are the sorts of activities that confronted the committee. No matter how hard you try, you will not find them reported in the majority report of this committee. These are the sorts of things that the affiliated party to these unions does not want you to know about. It does not want Australia to know about them. It is absolutely outrageous conduct and indicative of a wider malaise of lawlessness in this industry costing the Australian taxpayer, investors and builders millions and billions of dollars.
The government's determination to confront the issue of union lawlessness in the construction industry has provoked mild fury in the Labor movement. I can tell you we saw union member after union member to the point where I said to three commercial witnesses: `How is it that the state secretary of the CFMEU has your submission? Which of you gave your submission to the state secretary of the CFMEU? Come on, put your hands up.' And the three of them very gingerly put their hands up. I said: `Why would you do such a thing? Why would you disclose your submission to our committee to the state secretary when you are in private business?' The reply was: `We don't really have an answer for that.' Vague and uncertain, they were the classic victims of stand-over tactics. Witness after witness was put before us through the CFMEU. It was a parade; it was a charade.
The mild fury in the Labor movement is certainly the result of touching a tender nerve because of the strains and pressures it exerts on the affiliation ties. Labor senators have devoted much energy on this committee to affirming and reinforcing ties with the CFMEU, CEPU and other unions affected by this legislation. In other words, the jig is up and they do not like it. The tactics of intimidation in this industry, which are impossible to paper over, are not stories that the Labor Party likes to hear. Inevitably, they would rather not know, or be seen not to know, about these things and there is no alternative to assuming an attitude of denial. 
Ten minutes does not do justice to what I have seen over the course of the last six months. But, as an example of union power, I was questioning the state secretary of the CFMEU in Western Australia and he was telling us how one of the state members of parliament, who is a minister, was a person who had not done his bidding. Her name was Alannah MacTiernan. I said to him, `What had she done to lose your support on state executive?' He was just about to tell me and—guess what—the chair ruled my question out of order. We were just getting to the length and breadth, the extent, of the power of a union in Western Australia to control elected representatives of the public—her seat is Armadale—and the question was ruled out of order, because I tell you it is a tender nerve and we were getting far too close to the bone. This is the flavour of this inquiry. 
This problem has been around for a very long time. Let me quote Senator Peter Cook from 1990:
Friends, this industry is going to have to bite the bullet at last. If this country wants to be efficient and productive, everybody has to undergo the reform process—and most especially an industry which has such pressuring and demonstrable need for it.
Nothing has changed. Senator Cook acknowledged the need to reform this industry way back in 1990 but did nothing about it, and this government has been confronted with the difficult task of doing it. This legislation is very sound and solid legislation with which to do it.
A careful reading of the majority report reveals what a conservative document it is. Opposition senators are more comfortable living with the certainties of the past than embracing changes to secure future needs of the construction industry. Thus no solution is offered in the opposition report for the chronic problems faced by builders and contractors to deal with trade union extortion and intimidation. Let me say that we heard legions of it. Witness after witness came along and said: `We can't get contractors to come to your committee because they will be intimidated. They will be victimised.' 
It would be extremely difficult for the opposition to agree on how the reform of the building industry could be done; therefore, it is better to say that the problem does not exist. Indeed, the majority report says precisely that: the Cole royal commission was just a fantasy. The intimidation and brutalisation of people in the building and construction industry by the CFMEU in particular does not occur, according to senators opposite. I have to say that that is an insult to intelligence. The last point I want to make is that the ILO conventions were put to us many times.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-21,"—I rise to take note of the tabling of the report entitled Beyond Cole—The future of the construction industry: confrontation or co-operation? I commence by thanking the secretariat in particular for their hard work in what was a very complex, emotive and difficult task. I also want to acknowledge my appreciation to the chair of the committee. I thought he handled the inquiry rather well, given the tensions that surround this issue. 
The Cole royal commission in both origin and conduct increased the temperature and allegations surrounding the building and construction industry. Political tension between the coalition government and the Labor Party concerning building unions and their conduct has been high both before and since the commission. Although these political tensions have been clearly apparent in the committee's work, looked at objectively the committee has done a considerable service to the BCI—the building and construction industry—not just in putting some balance into the assessment of Cole but in addressing issues and perspectives insufficiently covered by Commissioner Cole.  
My impression is of a diverse range of reactions to the proposed Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003. As a generalisation, peak employer groups strongly support the proposed legislation and Cole, present union officials in a devilish light and are louder about stronger workplace relations law than about OHS, entitlements, rorts and tax avoidance. Key unions in the ACTU are strongly opposed to the bill and Cole, present union officials in an angelic light but share Cole's concerns about OHS, entitlements, rorts and tax avoidance. Some companies are convinced that the bill is in their interest, some are not and most are silent onlookers. Many who have seen me privately would not appear before the committee but are adamant that the Workplace Relations Act is not curbing unacceptable behaviour in the industry. Other observers, such as academics and law firms, have strongly criticised the bill. Much media commentary has focused on an anti-union bias in Cole and the bill. 
There was much criticism about the Cole royal commission and, therefore, the legitimacy of the bill in dealing with the problems of the BCI. However legitimate the criticism may be of the motivations for directions taken and selectivity of the Cole royal commission, the Cole report properly drew attention to unacceptable industrial practice that challenged the rule of law, undermined the intent of the Workplace Relations Act and adversely affected productivity, efficiency and competition.
The Democrats strongly support the need for greater compliance with the law and more effective law enforcement. The royal commission identified weaknesses in the current mechanisms of enforcing law of general application, including criminal law, industrial relations law, civil law, tax law and state law. Therefore another question we considered during this inquiry was: if one of the key findings of the commission was a weakness in current enforcement mechanisms, how will creating new workplace relations laws solve a problem that has been identified as failure of the market regulators across these fields of law? The committee heard evidence from witness after witness, whether they were industry or union, that regulatory failure was a critical issue, if not the critical issue, facing the BCI. 
The Democrats support a system where all Australians—employers and employees alike—would have the same industrial relations rights and obligations regardless of where they lived. Supporting industry specific regulators would fly in the face of the Democrats' beliefs. We are philosophically, practically and politically antagonistic to the idea of an industry specific regulator. In addition, we believe that it would be a waste of resources to establish an industry specific regulator if better regulation enforcement of the law meant that after a few years they were no longer needed. 
The Democrats support one of the central propositions behind the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2003—that is, greater regulation and enforcement of workplace relations law is necessary. We do not support the second central proposition behind the bills that industry specific legislation and sweeping new workplace relations law provisions are necessary to achieve this aim. The building and construction industry improvement bills will be opposed outright by the Australian Democrats. They cannot be salvaged or amended. The problems in the industry and in other industries would be far better addressed by enforcement of existing law and the creation of a well-resourced, independent, national workplace relations regulator.  
We are of the opinion that, as for other sectors of the economy such as ACCC, APRA, ASIC, ATO, greater regulation and enforcement of workplace relations law is desirable of itself as a market mechanism and as a social service mechanism and that folding ineffective departmental inspectorates, the Employment Advocate and so on into a standard regulatory body would considerably advance regulatory practice in industrial relations in Australia. We believe that workplace relations law is only as strong as its enforcement and that its enforcement is weak in the BCI. The lack of a well-resourced, active regulator with standard regulatory powers, plus inadequate penalties, is the prime cause of ineffective application and observance of existing law. The Senate inquiry reinforced the fact that better enforcement mechanisms and not new wide-ranging industrial laws were needed. The Democrats believe that there has been enough evidence before the Senate to support the need for an independent national workplace relations regulator. 
Lawlessness might not be the best way to describe non-compliance with the law. The laws do exist, but whether it is tax or workers compensation avoidance or blatant disregard for the Corporations Law, the problem is weak enforcement. While it is quite wrong to characterise the BCI as an industry where the rule of law does not apply, criminality, corruption and thuggery have to be addressed where they exist.
The Senate inquiry also highlighted the problems of having different industrial relations jurisdictions for the industry as well as the desire for a unitary system. The Democrats have consistently argued for years now that we need one industrial relations system, not six. We have a small population, yet we have nine governments and a ridiculous overlap of laws and regulations. There are areas of policy and jurisdiction that the states no longer have sensible involvement in. Like finance, corporations and trade practices law, labour law is one of those areas. The Democrats believe that a unitary system does not have to be achieved with an all or nothing outcome. We strongly urge whichever party is in power in the next term to seriously consider the efficiencies and benefits that can be derived from a unitary industrial relations system.
Having highlighted the Democrats' preference for addressing general mechanisms, the Democrats are not against targeting a problem in the short term. We supported the extension of the life of the interim national building industry task force and would not be opposed to increasing its information gathering powers on a temporary basis while the government worked towards establishing a national workplace relations regulator. We would also support providing additional resources to bodies such as the ACCC, ATO, AIRC, and probably ASIC, to focus on BCI hotspots.
We support the committee's majority recommendation No. 1 and its other recommendations either in full or, in the case of recommendation No. 2, by assessing any legislation on its merits. Our key recommendations are: to oppose the building and construction industry improvement bills; to establish an independent national workplace relations regulator; to include merit based appointments provisions in any legislation created to establish a national workplace relations regulator; to increase penalty provisions under the Workplace Relations Act for all industries; to include whistleblower protection provisions in the WRA; to increase the powers and capacity of the Industrial Relations Commission to make good faith bargaining orders, to resolve disputes on their merits and to make more determinations; and to amend the Workplace Relations Act to enable genuine project agreements to be reached and certified for major projects. Further, we recommend that the government consider legislating a definition of `employee' into the Workplace Relations Act 1996; that the building industry task force play a more active role in pursuing the underpayment of employee entitlements; that the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Workplace Relations Act be amended to ensure that democratic control of donations remains with members of registered organisations and shareholders; that donations are capped; that donations with strings attached are prohibited; and, that there be better disclosure requirements. 
We believe the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Workplace Relations Act should be amended as appropriate to ensure democratic control remains vested in the members of political parties and not in the hands of unions or of business. We believe a national unitary industrial relations system should be introduced. In conclusion, we have today announced that we reject the building and construction industry bills.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2004-06-21,"—The purpose of the Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004 is to implement the government's response to the review of veterans' entitlements conducted by the committee chaired by Mr Justice Clarke. This review had its genesis as an election policy of the government in 2001. The review commenced in 2002, reported back in February 2003 and, thereafter, languished in the government's pigeonhole for 12 months until April this year. At that time, the government's backbench revolted over the mean and tricky response and the Prime Minister was humiliated, and rightly so. A second response was made a fortnight later, which was far more generous than the originally agreed package.
I do not want to go through all of this sorry saga again, except to say that the whole Clarke review was unnecessary. It was nothing but a stalling device to avoid three years of pressure from the veteran community for reform to policy. As we can now see, the government's response has also been strung out to the eve of the next election. Effectively this government of seven years, which should have known all of the detail in one of the oldest and most stable of portfolios, chose to stall. More deviously, though, the government also misled and deceived the veteran community. In short, the veteran community were conned into believing that they were being genuinely consulted. They believed that good things would flow and they participated in their thousands. But they were duped. There was not the slightest intention to do anything, hence the government's first, minimal response.
As we know, the proof of this pudding was in the eating. Half of Justice Clarke's 109 recommendations were for no change so, clearly, reviewing those issues was a waste of time. The government and its advisers knew that before they started. Of the remainder, the government was dragged, screaming, to accept fewer than 10, and none of these recommendations is novel in any way. The government could have acted at any time during its seven-year reign to accept all of them. But, no, veterans had to be subjected to this elaborate process to keep them quiet until the next election eve.
Let me now deal with the specifics of this bill. Firstly, the provision of rent assistance to war widows on the income support supplement is fully supported. To be frank, had the government not accepted this recommendation, Labor would have. It was our top election priority simply because it addressed perhaps one of the most needy groups in the veteran community. This was a very overdue reform. Next, the bill will extend the $25,000 grant to ex-prisoners of war of Korea, and their widows. We support that simply on the grounds of equity. It can only be wondered why, given the modest cost, this was not done at the same time as the original grant to prisoners of war of Japan. As many have pointed out, this leaves POWs of the Germans out in the cold. So the government, having decided on this discriminatory approach, will remain under pressure to extend the grants.
The increase in the funeral benefit is, of course, a token gesture. Increasing the benefit from $574 to $1,000 barely bridges the gap in the cost of a funeral. Of course, this benefit is enjoyed by only a minority of veterans so it is of no great cost; nevertheless, we support the increase because it is better than nothing. We also support the minor extensions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act to cover the RAAF crews who served in the Berlin airlift and on the Thai-Malay border, as well as a few mine-sweeping and bomb disposal personnel. In doing so, it must be said that the retrospective reviews of service for the purpose of extending veterans' benefits has now become a farce. This is tragic in a way because hundreds of thousands of Australians who genuinely risked their lives overseas have always enjoyed a few privileges not available to others and that tradition has now been destroyed. The irrefutable evidence is that the dilution of qualifying service as a policy is quite deliberate. That evidence is contained elsewhere in this bill, and I will come to that issue shortly. 
The final elements provided for in this bill concern the indexation of the TPI special rate and the so-called exemption of the disability pension from the means test at Centrelink. As the Senate will be aware, the TPI federation has been campaigning for five years at least to have their special rate pension indexed by male average total weekly earnings as well as by the CPI, which is the current index used. The reason is that they believe the special rate ought to keep pace with the standard of living rather than with the cost of living. They claim that this would bring some consistency with other pensions of income support, such as the age pension, the service pension and the widows pension. That is logical, assuming that the special rate is defined in full as an income support pension.
The government's view is that only two-thirds of the special rate is income support—that is, the above general rate, which is that part which the government asserts is paid for not being able to work, hence the description of income support or economic compensation that is used by the government. The other one-third is called the general rate and is considered by the government to be non-economic compensation. It is not income but compensation for pain, suffering and loss of lifestyle. This benefit is paid to over 100,000 veterans and ex-service people, of whom only 29,000 are TPI. That is the government's construction, hence the indexation only of the above general rate. That is not a novel rationale because it was also identified by Justice Toose as a policy issue in June 1975. Professor Baume was also attracted by the principles, as was Justice Clarke. Nevertheless the TPI community is incensed, and understandably so.
If this redefinition were logical, it would apply across the board. At least, that would be a reasonable expectation. But, no, it does not. In the exemption of the special rate from the means test at Centrelink, the whole of the special rate is treated as income. So TPIs logically ask, `If it is all defined as income for that purpose, then why not for indexation as well?' That is a very good question and one that DVA will not answer. Their answer at estimates on 1 June this year was that it was their priority to get rid of the differential flowing from qualifying service. The government's view is that TPIs should get the same whether they are veterans or not—that is, TPIs paid an income support pension by Centrelink because they are not veterans with qualifying service should be paid the same as veterans with qualifying service paid the service pension by DVA. At least we have the real policy explanation, but it means that effectively the government has a contradiction in the definition of income.
Obviously there is no policy. What is asserted as policy with respect to indexation is simply a convenience to save money; yet if it had been applied to the exemption of the disability pension from the means test it would have saved even more money. If veterans are confused, they are in very good company. This simply shows how determined the government has been to get rid of the qualifying service differential between the two groups of TPIs. Given that there is no policy with respect to the definition of income for the TPI special rate, one can only conclude that, to be consistent, the full special rate should be indexed by MTAWE, as the TPIs claim. It is for that reason that Labor will support the Democrats' proposed second reading amendment. We are appalled at the lack of policy rigour. It is clear why veterans policy under this government is such a shambles. It is no wonder veterans do not understand it, because there is simply no consistency. If it is to be a policy free-for-all, we should all forget this pretence. That is obviously the government's view. 
That brings me to the final item in this bill, which is simply the greatest administrative mess and disaster I have ever seen. When Labor and the Democrats began urging in this place, without success, that the disability pension be exempted from the means test at Centrelink, we simply intended that it be made an exclusion under section 8(8) of the Social Security Act. Effectively, this would have been one line of text. It would simply have provided that any disability pension paid by DVA to any ex-serviceperson would be disregarded as income. What we have instead is the continuation of its inclusion as income in the means test but the payment of a refund by DVA to all the people affected. This refund, paid every fortnight, will be adjusted as any other payment would be to changing levels of income from other sources. Instead of taking one line of text, this provision to pay Defence Force income support allowance—DFISA—takes 14 A4 pages of typed text. The irony is that this new DFISA has to be excluded from the means test under the Social Security Act, which will be done by an amendment to section 8(8). So effectively the whole issue returns to where it started. The DFISA—that is, the value of the deduction for disability pension—still needs to be exempted from the Social Security Act. It is without doubt one of the most complicated and unnecessary pieces of legislation I have ever seen.
I raise this matter in some detail not just because it is appalling policy and administration but because it needs to be put on the record. This is administrative bungling and incompetence, across portfolios, of the very worst kind. The complexity of the legislation is frightening, and I suggest that there are very few in the bureaucracy who have much of an understanding of it at all. This is evidenced by the fact that the bill as passed by the House of Representatives contained none of these provisions. No-one knew how to do it. Only in the last week have we received 19 pages of amendments. There can be little doubt that the sheer complexity will mean that there will be many oversights and subsequent amendments.
Whatever petty bureaucratic infighting may have gone on between the smokestacks of DVA and Family and Community Services, the end result is that DVA gets to implement another system of payments. This will cost over $8 million over four years, just to start with. No doubt many struggling families of veterans could have been helped with that money. It would, for example, be enough to provide 1,330 new long-term bursaries. It would pay for the restoration of home care to its proper level. It would pay for 660 gold cards. No doubt it would also pay for many aids and appliances that are now being refused by DVA as part of its clampdown.
I will explain to the Senate, which has been asked to agree to this monstrosity, and to ex-service people how this mess is intended to work. In short, anyone in receipt of a disability pension paid by DVA who also receives any benefit from Centrelink will receive a DFISA payment, as will anyone on a Centrelink benefit with a partner whose disability pension is included in combined income. Anybody, including students whose parental income is used in the means test, could be affected. People who are currently means tested out of a Centrelink benefit may also now find themselves eligible for a part-pension at least. The benefits from this vary. For some TPIs, because the whole of the special rate is currently counted as income, the DFISA refund will be over $250 per fortnight. For others with lower level disability pensions it could be more modest. That, at least, is the good news from this proposal. 
I also emphasise that all Centrelink payments may be affected. These include the age pension, disability support pension, wives pension, carer payment, bereavement allowance, the widows B pension, parenting payment, youth allowance, Austudy, Newstart, mature age allowance, sickness allowance, special benefit payment, partner allowance and the special needs pension. Both family tax benefit A and B will be affected. Also affected will be those who, from time to time, receive one-off allowances such as drought assistance. Then there are knock-on effects to the pension bonus scheme, remote area allowance, widows on income support supplement and rent assistance. For some of these, especially widows on income support supplements paid by DVA, the Veterans' Entitlements Act is to be amended as well.
Many war widows will also be affected. There are implications for portability rules and the new provisions for deductibility. Yes, believe it or not, people will be able to pay their bills by direct deduction from their DFISA. Then there are the tax implications. The original bill proposed that DFISA be taxable. This amendment sensibly provides that its tax status will be aligned with the benefit being paid. Fortunately, most pensioners are protected and will not be affected because of the tax rebate to pensioners. Nevertheless, some will be affected. However, the majority of Centrelink benefits I listed earlier are not taxed. The age pension is, though. So those ex-servicepeople with high levels of income do need to be careful.
In conclusion, it should be obvious from what I have just said that this is just about the most complex piece of legislation many of us have had to deal with, particularly in this portfolio area. Just imagine how veterans are supposed to understand it. How will they possibly know whether their payments are correct? How can they be sure that the calculations are right and that the DVA and Centrelink systems are properly coordinated and integrated? I think the best advice for the DVA is to clear the decks over the next six months and get ready for a broadside of complaints and inquiries. I end my comments here but note that I will return to some of these themes in more detail when we come to the government amendments in committee.",SENATE,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS (CLARKE REVIEW) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-21,"—I speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats to this Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004. This bill seeks to implement some of the recommendations of the Clarke review. The Clarke review committee was asked to consider perceived anomalies in access to veterans entitlements and the level of benefits and support provided to veteran disability pensioners. The Democrats supported the review because we have long recognised, and indeed have long called upon the government to redress, anomalies in access to veterans entitlements and the level of benefits and support provided to veterans.
The Clarke report was released in January 2003. It is a disgrace that it has taken the government well over a year, close to 18 months now, to respond to its recommendations and bring this bill on for debate in the Senate—and we now have a significant number of amendments, 19 pages of amendments, before us this evening. Regrettably, this seems to be the pattern of this government. The Clarke review itself was a long time coming, let alone the government's response. We are still waiting for the 1991 Gulf War health study, and the new military compensation scheme, which was promised in 1996, was only passed in this place a month or so ago. A more cynical mind might conclude that the Prime Minister has repeatedly exploited service men and women for political gain—being quick to send young Australians to war but slow to recognise the debt this incurs on behalf of the nation, and even slower in addressing the legitimate concerns of veterans. 
The Australian Democrats did not support the Prime Minister's sending of Australian troops to Iraq without the endorsement of the Australian parliament, but we do wholeheartedly support the right of those troops to be properly compensated and treated fairly upon their return when they can no longer serve. We continue to do so. This bill, as far as it represents that, is welcome. I am sure we would all like wars to cease so that we no longer need to have veterans—and I am sure veterans themselves, or potential veterans, would welcome that more than anybody so they do not have to pay the price that they do. Whilst ever we have troops who put themselves on the line to fight for our country, we have a special obligation to ensure that we do not just pat them on the back when they come back, give them a nice medal and let the Prime Minister or other ministers stand next to them to get their photo taken. We recognise our responsibility to continue to support them in the many years ahead—where, often times, they will have direct consequences to deal with as a result of their service.
After years of ignoring the calls from veterans and their families, and 16 or more months after the Clarke report was released—and potentially on the eve of an election—we finally have the government committing themselves to addressing some veterans' needs and ironically calling on the Senate for swift passage of these amendments. Swift is not the word that comes to mind when contemplating the years it has taken the government to come this far. The payment of compensation for veteran prisoners of war interned by North Korea, or to their widows, is welcome. Our involvement in the Korean War first commenced in 1950, meaning these veterans have waited more than half a century for this compensation. The Korean War was dangerous for Australian troops. The North Koreans had no organised prisoner of war system. During 1950 the North Korean People's Army simply moved POWs into primitive living conditions in camps or caves if they survived the death marches.
Later, from April 1951 through to the end of the war, the Chinese communist forces took control of almost all POWs. Unfortunately, these forces did not accept the Geneva convention and many POWs were physically abused and subjected to brainwashing techniques. Whilst a one-off payment of $25,000 does not take away the suffering these veterans and their families have endured, it recognises their having endured numerous violations—inadequate food, clothing and shelter; poor medical treatment; loss of life; and the terror and pain of interrogation—whilst wounded and separated from their comrades and families. It is also ironic that we should compensate victims of the failure of occupying forces to abide by the Geneva convention at a time when we have become painfully aware of failures by occupying forces in Iraq to similarly abide by that convention.
For many years now the Democrats have been calling for the erosion in the value of veterans compensation to be reversed and for the TPI to be benchmarked to try and turn around this decline in its value. Regrettably, while this bill addresses the erosion, it only does so by half. The TPI has long been known as the special rate pension, and this is what TPI recipients believe they are receiving. It was never commonly referred to as `general rate plus above general rate', but this is what the government have now decided to rely upon in indexing only the above general rate to both the consumer price index and the 25 per cent male total average weekly earnings benchmark. 
The Democrats believe that special rate is aptly named. It is paid to a veteran whose employability is affected by their war or defence caused disabilities alone and where the veteran is further assessed as unable to undertake remunerative work for more than eight hours a week as a result of their service related incapacity alone. TPI veterans did not all return safely and they certainly paid a very high price, a direct personal price, to the cost of their health and their ability to work, entirely due to their service to our country. This bill does not link the special TPI rates to male total average weekly earnings and CPI as veterans were led to believe it would. This bill provides that only the rate paid above general rate TPI will be linked to MTAWE and CPI. The general rate remains indexed only to CPI and will continue to erode as it has for years. 
In short, I believe TPI veterans have been short-changed, because the government has decided that only 62 per cent of the TPI will be linked to MTAWE. The Democrats have listened to the government's arguments that only income support has any merit to be MTAWE linked. We believe that these are not meritorious arguments. Even less meritorious is that the general disability pension, not being a primary income support, must be limited to the CPI. This is insulting to veterans. We are talking about Australian men and women who entered the forces fit, healthy and able to work long, productive lives. They left in a far different state, and now the government is quibbling about small increases.
In June last year I attended a rally being held out the front of this Parliament House of hundreds of totally and permanently incapacitated, or TPI, veterans and their partners and supporters from around Australia. The rally was organised by the TPI Federation as a result of this government taking no heed of the plight of TPI veterans in last year's budget. Twelve months later they are still seeking a fair deal, which this bill does not fully provide. 
To make it worse, just over a year ago, on 15 May, I heard the Prime Minister on Perth radio say about TPI benefits that somebody with eligible service on average got between 90 per cent and 115 per cent of male average weekly earnings, which is somewhere in the order of $44,000 a year. This was simply not true. It is another example of the Prime Minister and the government misleading the Australian people into thinking that the average TPI veteran got around $44,000 a year when they get less than half of that. That is simply unacceptable. TPI is currently about 45 per cent of the average weekly wage, and this proportion has been reducing for many years. We should not be giving the false impression that somehow TPI veterans are rolling in clover and doing very well when clearly that is not the case. As a further slap in the face to TPI veterans and their families, what the government is now doing will only rectify half the wrong and half the erosion of the value of the TPI. In the words of one TPI organisation: 
War veteran TPIs have been thrown a bone. It is, however, a bone pretty much devoid of meat. 
The Democrats' policy, which is reflected in our second reading amendment, is that the whole TPI should be indexed to MTAWE and CPI—whichever is the greater. 
It is pleasing to welcome the government's finally correcting the longstanding and very frustrating anomaly whereby a war disability pension is included as income in assessing social security payments to veterans. Its effect on the rate of social security payments has been a longstanding concern to the veteran community. This was never fair as it discriminated veterans from those who received the service pension. The Democrats have long called for this anomaly to be addressed. Indeed, we even proposed the very simple one-line amendment to the Social Security Act that was required to fix the anomaly. At least on one occasion, possibly more, amendments seeking to address that anomaly were passed by the Senate but not accepted by the government and, therefore, have not passed into legislation. It is only now, through the very long overdue action of the government, that it is finally being addressed.
But again, as Senator Bishop was just explaining, whereas a very minor amendment to section 8 of the Social Security Act would exempt the war disability pension and achieve the aim of fair payment to veterans who receive social security payments, this government have decided that keeping it simple is not the way to go and instead have devised a complicated, convoluted and error-fraught method of payment for an area of payments from Centrelink which is already facing lots of problems with complexity and people receiving incorrect payments and having to go through a lot of difficulty and distress to sort out their entitlements. To introduce a totally unnecessary level of complexity is quite astonishing.
Compare a simple one-line amendment to one act with the proposal that for each veteran Centrelink must manually calculate the difference between the primary payment of social security the veteran receives under social security law and the social security payment the veteran would receive if the disability pension were not counted as income in the assessment of their social security payment and if the disability pension income test for rent assistance were applicable. Centrelink then tells the Department of Veterans' Affairs how much it has calculated the veteran should receive. The Department of Veterans' Affairs then pays the veteran through the Defence Force income support allowance. Where the veteran is not on social security payments because they have been previously excluded by the income test but would now be eligible, Centrelink must create a phantom record for the above purpose of calculation. I think I need to read through that a few times myself to make sure that I understand it, and that is represented in close to 20 pages of amendments in contrast to what could have been one single line.
A simple alternative has been disregarded for complex arrangements which will leave veterans confused—and I must add, many other people—and have most of us struggling to manually calculate correct entitlement, and the whole process being fraught with danger of underpayment and overpayment with veterans utterly reliant on two government agencies paying them the correct rate. It creates yet a further supplement to the already complicated veterans' payment system. Why the government have chosen this method of administration is beyond belief. We do not want to hold up this amendment because we know how long veterans have been waiting for this issue to be addressed, but we call on the government to be realistic and to simplify the process. These veterans without qualifying service already receive their social security income support. How much simpler it would be to just pay them the correct rate via that system.
The Australian Democrats welcome the remainder of this bill, including the provision that rent assistance will now be payable in addition to the ceiling rate of service pension or income support supplement that is payable to a war widow or widower. Many veterans already struggle to meet their private rent commitments, and this will mean that their rent assistance will not be subjected to the income support ceiling and will more realistically address the financial burden of paying rent. We further welcome the increase in the maximum amount of funeral benefit from $572 to $1,000, which will ease the burden of funeral costs to families of certain veterans. Both this and the removal of the ceiling on rent assistance are measures called for by the Democrats for some time and which are long overdue. 
Of course not all dependants of veterans will benefit from any of these changes. Partners of many veterans will continue to be excluded from benefits rightly due to them because the definition of dependant does not include same-sex partners. The Democrats have before moved amendments to insert into the Veterans' Entitlements Act a definition of wholly dependent partner. The legislation provides that a partner can only be of the opposite sex, and our amendments have aimed to remove that discrimination and requirement. The Democrats remain concerned that, notwithstanding that gay and lesbian personnel have legally served in the Australian armed forces since 1992—and many gay and lesbian people served in the Australian armed forces prior to that date—there are no entitlements for, or even recognition of, their partners. Our position is simple: all defence personnel have the right to have their partner of choice recognised. The continual discrimination against people purely on the basis of who they happen to fall in love with is utterly unacceptable. It is an issue that is not necessarily front and centre of every single veterans organisation but it is certainly one that is starting to be raised by some organisations in some of the submissions to Senate committee inquiries and hearings that we have been having into various veterans entitlements issues.
I close today by noting that not all the recommendations of the Clarke report have been accepted by this government. We are not unused to seeing the government cherry pick from reports and reviews relating to veterans and reject worthwhile recommendations of reports they have commissioned. The Democrats give notice that the Clarke report is not a closed story. We will continue to agitate the government and future governments for greater health care measures, gold card entitlement and definition of service. I move the Democrat second reading amendment in my name:
At the end of the motion add:
“but the Senate 
	(a)	is of the view that the harsh and unsatisfactory indexation arrange-ments for totally and permanently incapa-citated veterans require immediate adjustment so that these veterans obtain the full benefits of indexation to all components of their pension; and 
	(b)	condemns the Government for missing this opportunity of settling fair index arrangements for those veterans who are totally and permanently incapacitated.”
Through that we call on the government and future governments to address that failure.
I would like to also pay tribute to, and note the contribution and efforts of, many veterans service organisations who have fought long and hard for many of these measures to be implemented. Whilst I have focused on some of the failings in relation to these areas before us this evening and areas where there is still work to be done, it must be acknowledged that significant advances are being made via this legislation. A lot of the credit for that must go to the tireless work of many veterans and their representative organisations. Being a member of parliament and of the Senate, I have no doubt that, without the tireless, continual and many times frustrating advocacy of many of those groups, the achievements that have been gained through this legislation tonight would not be there. It is a tribute to all of their work and efforts. They will continue with many other issues, and I am sure all of us will continue to hear from them about their areas of concern. The vast majority of these people work for no pay, out of recognition of the contribution not just of their colleagues that they served with but of war veterans stretching back through our nation's history. This contribution on top of the contribution they have already made as serving personnel is something that should be acknowledged. 
I also make the point that these areas being addressed tonight are ones that the Democrats and others in the opposition in the Senate in some cases have long pressured the government for. They are also I believe as a result of the role and the work of the Senate in continually shining the spotlight on failures of the government and areas of need in the community. This once again illustrates the fact that, whomever people choose to be in government, they also need to ensure that they have a Senate operating strongly and effectively to keep the pressure on the government to provide the opportunity for the veterans organisations to have a voice.
I reaffirm the Democrats' commitments to ensure that veterans groups continue to have a voice, that their concerns are expressed through Senate committee inquiries and that some of their views are reflected through questions, statements and the work of our party in the Senate. I believe it is an area where the Democrats' record should be noted, particularly in relation to the work of the potential alternatives on the crossbenches. It is important that all of the issues that need to be addressed are examined by the Senate. Whilst the deployment of troops often gets a lot of media, the focus on what happens to veterans once they have returned does not always get the public attention it deserves. It is up to institutions like the Senate to ensure that the spotlight is kept on these issues, where it deserves to be. I note the benefits of this bill. Once again it is a tribute and a due reward or recognition of the work of so many veterans and their organisations over a long period of time.",SENATE,<title>VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS (CLARKE REVIEW) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-06-21,"—It is a great pleasure to sum up tonight on the Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004. I agree with Senator Bartlett that a great deal of effort has gone into bringing the concerns of veterans to the government's attention. The people responsible are to be commended in many respects for the way in which they have conducted themselves in relation to the Clarke review bill. So it is a particular pleasure to now sum up this bill and to eventually get it passed. The bill will give effect to the changes announced on 2 March 2004 in response to the Clarke review of veterans entitlements. The bill will grant a $25,000 payment to all surviving prisoners of war of the Korean forces and to their widows or widowers who were alive on 1 July 2003. This payment is in recognition of the extremely inhuman conditions that they experienced—similar to the harsh conditions experienced by prisoners of war of the Japanese during World War II.
The bill implements two significant measures to address key issues for persons in receipt of the disability pension. The new indexation arrangements will mean that those most disabled will have that portion of their disability pension that is paid above 100 per cent of the general rate indexed by the same proportion as the service pension and the war widows and widowers pension. This new indexation arrangement will take into consideration both the consumer price index and male total average weekly earnings. The resultant increase in pensions will be backdated to 20 March 2004. 
The government certainly does not support the second reading amendment moved by Senator Bartlett. The special rate for TPI pension consists of two components. The larger amount is the above the general rate component, which reflects a veteran's inability to work for more than eight hours a week. It is this economic loss component that has now been linked to the male total average weekly earnings when indexation adjustments are being calculated. The second component is the general rate, which is compensation for the medical impairment and loss of lifestyle that may be paid without reference to a veteran's ability to undertake remunerative work. As there is no economic loss element it is not appropriate to index this component by a wage index. As such, it will continue to be indexed by movements in the consumer price index.
All disability pensions are tax free and payable for life, together with health care benefits that may include the gold card. From 20 September 2004 the government will introduce the Defence Force income support supplement or DFISA. This measure will address the concern regarding the inclusion of disability pension as income for pensions and benefits paid to recipients and their partners under social security law. The new allowance will be equal to the difference between the amount of income support a person receives under social security law and the amount that person would receive if the disability pension were not counted as income in the assessment of their social security payment and a disability pension income test for rent assistance were applicable. It is expected that more than 19,000 disability pensioners and their partners will benefit from this measure.
During the debate it was raised that it may be seen that by supplementing social security payments to compensate for the inclusion of the Veterans' Entitlements Act disability pension as income the government is diminishing the value of qualifying service for service pensioners. However, veterans with qualifying service and their partners do sometimes need to access social security payments if they do not meet the requirements for service pension. DFISA will mean that all veterans with and without qualifying service can receive income support entitlements without VEADP impacting on their payment. Veterans with qualifying service will continue to have access to the age service pension five years earlier than those without qualifying service. Their partners will continue to have access to partner service pensions from 50 years of age, or earlier in some cases. Veterans with qualifying service will continue to enjoy the benefit of Veterans' Entitlements Act disability pension exemptions for aged care fees. Extended eligibility to the gold card is another benefit available to veterans with qualifying service.
In the course of the second reading debate the government was asked why it decided against a straight exemption of the VEADP from social security law. DFISA is a supplement for veterans and their partners and as such is delivered by the DVA payment systems, as are all veterans payments. The payment of DFISA under the Veterans' Entitlements Act also ensures that a precedent is not set in social security law that will enable other groups to have their compensation payments excluded from the assessment of social security payments. War widows and widowers will benefit from the measure to pay rent assistance in addition to the ceiling rate of income support supplement or service pension. This measure will assist those war widows and widowers who are renting privately. War widows and widowers will be able to benefit from this measure from as early as 1 January 2005. The maximum amount of funeral benefit will be increased from $572 to $1,000 with effect from 1 July 2004. This increase will assist families with the cost of the funeral for their late veteran relative. 
Finally, this bill will extend operational service to personnel involved in minesweeping and bomb clearance operations after World War II who have qualifying service. This addresses an anomaly where a small number of personnel received the medal necessary to be eligible for qualifying service but were not veterans, because their service fell outside the operational service periods specified in the Veterans' Entitlements Act. As Senator Bartlett has mentioned, the government has some amendments, which I will speak to in the committee stage. In conclusion, in the government's view this bill delivers a generous and responsible package of measures that will enhance the benefits and support available to veterans, war widows and war widowers. I thank Senators Bishop and Bartlett for their contributions and I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-06-21,"—I move:
That the committee does not insist on its amendments to which the House of Representatives has disagreed.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 7) 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,26,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2004-06-21,"—On behalf of the Labor Party, I indicate at the outset that we will insist on the message to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2003. My colleague Senator Ludwig has circulated a further amendment, which I will move at a later stage, which is to remove an organisation known as the Constitution Education Fund. I will address my remarks to both issues before we move to further discussion. Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) is a general tax bill dealing with 11 sets of issues. Many of these issues are important, including the provision of exemption from income tax and capital gains tax for payments relating to persecution, loss or damage to property, illness and injury resulting from persecution or involvement in resistance during World War II. In addition, the bill provides important transitional arrangements for foreign entities with a large amount of accumulated losses going into consolidation. However, both the Labor Party and the Democrats—I want to indicate their steadfast support on this issue—have indicated they will not support the proposal in the bill to prescribe specifically listed deductible gift recipients by regulation rather than through legislation. 
The chamber removed these provisions, but these amendments have not been accepted by the government in the House, hence the message. Rather than accept the view of this chamber, the government has dug in its heels and refused to negotiate. This is to the detriment of all those individuals and groups that would benefit from the other measures in the bill. It shows again a level of arrogance by this government that has become all too obvious in recent times in a whole range of areas. Schedule 3 provides arrangements for specifically listed organisations by regulation that will be eligible deductible gift recipients—DGRs. DGRs are able to receive donations that provide an income tax deduction for the donor. Organisations are specifically listed as DGRs when they do not meet the general criteria under the tax law. This would replace existing arrangements whereby DGRs are listed through legislation.
As I said earlier, the government claims that this is to allow more timely listings and adjustments. Under the terms of this bill, DGR status would take effect from the day immediately after the last day for disallowance of the regulation, which would ensure there is no revenue effect when parliament does not accept the executive's view of an organisation's suitability for DGR status. The regulation could specify the date from or period during which deductibility would apply or the purpose to which the donation must be put or other conditions. In determining deductibility, retrospectively the amending regulation would give effect to a public announcement by the Treasurer or a minister 60 days or less before the day on which the amending regulation was made, with the announcement having been published on the Internet. This bill contemplates explicit use of the Internet as an element of the process of legislation by press release, which is an interesting development apparently occurring in other areas.
Labor's primary concern is that, unlike other legislation, this place cannot amend regulations. It must either support or reject them. This could create a difficult situation in which the parliament may support the listing of organisation but not the conditions placed on it by the government—for example, restrictions on the ability of DGRs to speak publicly about policy issues. Whilst the government has in the past put conditions on the purpose for which deductible gift recipient status has been given, that has been done through legislation, giving parliament the opportunity to amend those conditions. In addition, listing by regulation would remove the ability of non-government senators to propose the listing of an organisation. This would remove an important vehicle for the Senate to highlight and place pressure on the government of the day to provide DGR status to certain organisations. Also, there is generally less scrutiny of regulations than of legislation.
There is also a concern that the government could slip through the listing of a questionable organisation. For example, this bill includes the listing of the Constitution Education Fund, which I referred to in our further amendment. This is a fund that is directly linked to Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, which is headed up by none other than Professor David Flint, and the executive director of the fund is a Ms Kerry Jones. The Constitution Education Fund's address is the same as that of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy. The Australians for Constitutional Monarchy web site includes information about the activities of the fund and that Professor David Flint is a trustee of the fund and chair of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy. The links are clear, but this was not made clear to parliament. According to the explanatory memorandum to the bill, this organisation's primary purpose is to educate students of all ages about the Australian Constitution and the workings of all levels of government. We are expected to believe that, with all its links to Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, it will be used for genuine constitutional education. At no time was it revealed to the Senate by the government that this organisation had direct links to Australians for Constitutional Monarchy. It was only through the assiduous in-depth research and work by my colleague the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr David Cox, that these links were discovered. 
Whilst such an organisation may be performing worthwhile work, reflected by the Governor-General's patronage, it does not fit with normal concepts of the types of organisations that should be granted DGR status. DGR status effectively means that the government—that is, the Australian taxpayers—pays on average 30c in every dollar donated to an organisation. This is significant support and should be treated as if the government is giving direct funding to these organisations. It is a poor precedent to provide tax concessions to an organisation of this type of activity which are greater than those provided to political parties. Let us understand that: this is greater assistance than is given to political parties. I think not. For that reason Labor has moved an amendment to this bill to remove the Constitution Education Fund, having discovered its political associations, and it does not consider that it is appropriate to provide such an organisation with DGR status. The Senate has made it clear in the past that it will not accept amendments to the law that give the government the ability to prescribe specifically listed DGRs through regulation. The government should accept this and allow the rest of the bill to pass.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 7) 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,26,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-06-21,"—I will speak firstly to the motion that the Senate not insist on the amendments. It is the Democrats' opinion that we should insist on those amendments and, therefore, we will oppose the government's motion. The second matter is that of the proposed amendment in the name of Senator Ludwig, which Senator Sherry spoke about, which seeks to delete the Constitution Education Fund from the list of deductible gift recipients. Because this was foreshadowed, I thought that in preparation I should have a bit of a chat with the Constitution Education Fund. On three grounds I felt a little negative towards them. Surprisingly, the first ground was not that I am one of the foremost direct electionists in the parliament. That was not one of my grounds.
—I have an interjection from Senator Cherry, who says that I am the humblest as well. The issue of Professor Flint is one that has concerned us of late, but he has moved on, so I am less concerned about that. So that was not the issue either. The two issues that caught my attention that bothered me were that in the two letters I received from them they constantly referred to bipartisanship. If there is anything that gets somebody from the crossbenches annoyed, it is the idea of bipartisanship and that there are only two points of view in this world. I would have described them as nonpartisan. I think that is the correct way in which you should pronounce yourself, but if they insist on being political I hope that in the future they will address themselves as being cross-party. 
The other small area of concern was that when I read the list of the foundation council it looked as though they had all come from the order of stuffed shirts: it was just packed with professors, sirs, dames, doctors and major-generals. It sounded like one of those Gilbert and Sullivan kind of outfits. And there were honourables; there was not an ordinary Australian name or title in there that I could discern. But I am in the process of jesting. I have read their letters and I think they have a good case to remain deductible gift recipients. We will oppose the opposition's proposed amendment.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 7) 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,26,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-06-21,"—I will address very briefly the two matters currently under consideration: firstly, the motion moved by the government that the Senate not insist on the amendments. The amendments propose to remove an important measure from the bill which specifically lists deductible gift recipients by way of regulation rather than by way of the present, slow and administratively cumbersome requirement of amending the principal legislation every time. This proposal is of obvious benefit to the organisations that are granted DGR status as well as to the donors who generously contribute to these worthy organisations. Streamlining the listing process will improve the timeliness within which they will get certainty over the tax treatment of those donations.
While I believe the proposal is of obvious benefit, I regret that apparently I have not been able to persuade either Labor or the Democrats that this is the case. However, I think I recall Senator Murray being disposed to at least consider this proposition if I could show that some real harm or detriment would result from his stance. I remain hopeful that I can be convincing about the practical need for this measure by illustrating some of the current difficulties caused by the current arrangements. Take, for example, the Dunn and Lewis Youth Development Foundation, which has established a youth memorial centre to ensure that two young victims of the Bali tragedy from the Ulladulla community will be remembered—a very worthy aim, I am sure you will agree. The centre will serve as both a memorial and a vocational training centre for Ulladulla's youth, with traineeships and other employment opportunities. The centre will be invaluable to the community, as it will also offer a recreational outlet for the whole of Ulladulla.
The government announced the foundation as a DGR and subsequently introduced a bill to specifically list it as a DGR. As the bill was referred to a Senate committee, the government was unable to secure passage of the bill through both houses until very recently. The bill now awaits royal assent, some seven months after the announcement. The status of an organisation as a DGR is notified on the Australian Business Register. This notification makes it clear to the Australian community that they can make deductible gifts to the organisation. However, that organisation cannot be added to the ABR until the bill becomes law. So you can see the disconnect. Naturally a delay in adding an organisation to the ABR detracts from its ability to draw donations from the general public and endowments from the large philanthropic organisations.
This was certainly the experience of the Dunn and Lewis Youth Development Foundation which, whilst attracting interest from several significant donors, found that that interest was jeopardised by delays in parliament's consideration of the bill. My office received many calls from people trying to find out the current status of the Dunn and Lewis Youth Development Foundation and whether they could make donations. I make it clear that I am not suggesting that Labor or the Democrats do not the support the Dunn and Lewis Youth Development Foundation. Indeed, Hansard records their support. My point is simply that the current process let the Bali memorial down. 
The government believes that the reasonable alternative to the current process which would significantly reduce these delays and doubts and the problems they cause would be to list DGRs by regulation rather than requiring an amendment to the principal legislation. Allowing organisations to be specifically named as DGRs by regulation rather than requiring an amendment to the primary act would allow continued scrutiny by parliament—which is surely what is being contended for by the Democrats at least—particularly by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, and would undoubtedly make the process more timely and efficient.
The process of qualifying for specific listing will not change as a result of this bill. Organisations will be expected to demonstrate special circumstances that warrant their specific inclusion as DGRs. Each organisation seeking specifically listed DGR status will still be considered by the government on a case by case basis. Specific listing of an organisation as a DGR will still require a change in the tax law rather than the exercise of any ministerial discretion provided under that law. Ultimately it will be open to either house to disallow any of those regulations, and that is as it should be.
This measure is, in my view, a sensible proposal by the government; it is not some grab or overreaching. There is nothing unusual in maintaining detailed lists within regulations rather than in principal legislation. Successive governments have followed this approach in recognition that it is the most appropriate way to deal with frequent changes to subordinate details of the law. There is no change in the policy connected with the entities that will be eligible to be listed; this is simply a change to make the process—it is all about process—of listing those organisations more efficient and timely. I record my disappointment that the chamber appears intent on insisting on these amendments.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2004-06-21,"—My attention was recently drawn to the existence of the Single Desk Network, an organisation which was created in March this year by a group of grain growers who claimed they wanted to lobby on the issue of the single desk for wheat. The Single Desk Network has its own well-presented and detailed home page, which contains a welcome message that includes these words:
We are a rapidly growing group of wheat farmers from across Australia who think that the Single Desk is something worth fighting for ... so that's what we are doing ... we are going to be writing letters, making submissions and bringing you as much information as we can get our hands on.
`Sounds like another lobby group,' you might say—and it is. The Single Desk Network appears to be a well-organised and well--run organisation that is active in the media. The Single Desk Network web site is sophisticated, well written and professionally presented. Despite all of this, the membership fee for the Single Desk Network is just $10 per person.
In May 2004 the Single Desk Network issued a press release entitled `Grain Growers Association's attack on the Single Desk rejected by Grower Network'. This media release was distributed to the rural media and widely reported in The Land and the Weekly Times. It read: 
The Single Desk Network of grain growers has rejected a proposal by the Board of the Grain Growers' Association (GGA) to break-up the wheat Single Desk.
It went on to quote Single Desk Network spokesman Jock Munro from Rankins Springs as saying:
`The Single Desk Network believes that any system that requires the tendering of key services currently provided by AWB, such as supply chain management, international sales and marketing, quality assurance and crop-shaping, would ultimately see the benefits of the Single Desk system transferred from growers to middlemen.'
`Make no mistake,' said Mr Munro, `Growers will be the losers if the GGA's proposal is adopted.'
What is wrong with that? It is just another lobby group making its independent voice heard on an issue of concern to rural Australia. All this, of course, would be quite normal for an organised group of individuals who intend to lobby on a certain issue. But all is not as it seems with the Single Desk Network. An analysis of the electronic pathway that reveals where this particular media statement was generated takes us to a murky corner of a very large organisation involved in the sale of our grain. In fact, the home base of this pathway from the Single Desk Network is none other than the Australian Wheat Board Ltd, the monopoly holder of the single desk. And the original author of this so-called independent document—according to Mr Jock Munro of Rankins Springs—was none other than Mr Jarrod Doyle, from AWB Ltd's grower and government relations department in Sydney.
—What an amazing coincidence!
—Fancy that, Senator Payne: an independent lobby group defending the single desk which gives birth to its press releases in the government relations department of the very organisation that will most benefit from them. Mr Jock Munro of Rankins Springs, who claims that the organisation is independent, clearly has a very good friend at court—right inside the Australian Wheat Board Ltd. Further analysis of the document's email path shows that it travelled between AWB Ltd and Jock Munro several times—presumably to make sure that the Wheat Board was entirely happy before it was given to the media.
How curious, you might say. And just how many of those growers who paid $10 to join this so-called independent organisation were made aware of the duplicitous nature of this group and the fact that Big Brother—the old duchess, Australian Wheat Board Ltd—was just behind the door guiding the hand that was guiding the pen. More importantly, was the fact that the media release was written by Jarrod Doyle of the Australian Wheat Board Ltd disclosed to the public? Was this fact disclosed to the journalists who then, in good faith, wrote stories on the back of this media statement?
Other documents distributed by the Single Desk Network reveal that—surprise, surprise!—they were also co-authored by the Australian Wheat Board Ltd. One such document supportive, surprisingly, of the current single desk management structure was circulated among growers by the Single Desk Network and held out as written by a `concerned person'. However, again an analysis of the electronic pathway of this document shows that one its authors was in fact Mr Marc Cooney, who is AWB's Manager of Stakeholder Relations (Central). Goodness me! How could such high-quality assistance be made available at such a low price from this independent grower group? 
The Single Desk Network has been encouraging growers to make submissions to the 2004 Wheat Marketing Review Panel established by the Australian parliament. I understand that the Single Desk Network itself has made a submission to the panel but that it has not yet been made public. So, unfortunately, I am not able to avail the Senate of the very important electronic pathway to see whether it leads back to the duchess behind the door. All of this raises very serious questions about the operation of the Single Desk Network and its apparently undisclosed—and duplicitous—relationship with Australian Wheat Board Ltd, the principal beneficiary of the propaganda being peddled by the Single Desk Network. I call on the Australian Wheat Board tonight to immediately disclose who is funding and promoting the Single Desk Network. Who is writing its press releases, who wrote its submission to the inquiry and are they employees of Australian Wheat Board Ltd?
I have said many times in this place that I am not opposed to the single desk—and I never have been. My concern has always been the need for transparency in this debate. I have been representing farmers in Australia for 20 years—who are, interestingly enough, tonight celebrating 25 years of the National Farmers Federation, an organisation of which I was very proud to be a staff member. I am celebrating with them tonight, but I am also asking questions of the Australian Wheat Board Ltd and the Single Desk Network because I want to make sure that those farmers out there in rural and regional Australia, who work at growing crops and producing income for Australia, know that when an outspoken organisation is established, supposedly independent and, curiously, in support of the single desk, it is actually the independent, free-thinking, courageous organisation that it claims to be and that it is not funded by the Australian Wheat Board using another trolley, another label, to push the same old story—that is, the 77 goods and services that the growers pay for through the pool and for which there is absolutely no transparency.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Single Desk Network</title>,Adjournment,27,1
