"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2009-06-18,"—On behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that 15 sitting days after today I shall move:
That the Aviation Transport Security Amendment Regulations 2009 (No. 1), as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2009 No. 24 and made under the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004, be disallowed. [F2009L00695]
I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the matter raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—
Aviation Transport Security Amendment Regulations 2009 (No. 1), Select Legislative Instrument 2009 No. 24
These Amendment Regulations amend provisions in the principal Regulations to restrict the class of persons who are allowed to enter and remain in the cockpit of an aircraft fitted with a cockpit door, during flight and clarify cockpit offences on aircraft. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking further information on the consultation undertaken during the development of these Regulations.

Senator Abetz to move on the next day of sitting:
That the Senate—
notes:
the bipartisan commitment to an unconditional reduction in CO2 emissions of 5 per cent from 2000 levels by 2020, and a reduction of up to 25 per cent in the event of a comprehensive global agreement,
the importance of ensuring that the Obama Administration’s intentions on an emissions trading scheme are clarified before Australia implements any emissions trading scheme including the Government’s proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS), and
the importance of awaiting the outcomes of the United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in relation to targets before any scheme is legislated in Australia;
calls on the Government to refer the proposed CPRS to the Productivity Commission so that it may conduct a 6-month review, and make public its findings, before the legislation is finalised to:
assess the national, regional and industry sectoral impact of the CPRS in light of the global financial crisis,
assess the economic impact of the CPRS in light of other countries either not imposing a price on carbon comparable to that proposed in Australia or imposing such a price after different assumed periods of delay, and
conceptually and empirically examine the relative costs and benefits (including emissions reductions) of the key alternative scheme designs against the CPRS; and
therefore, calls on the Government to defer further consideration of the following bills until after the conclusion of the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen:
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009
Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority Bill 2009
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Charges—Customs) Bill 2009
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Charges—Excise) Bill 2009
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Charges—General) Bill 2009
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS Fuel Credits) Bill 2009
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS Fuel Credits) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009
Excise Tariff Amendment (Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme) Bill 2009
Customs Tariff Amendment (Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme) Bill 2009
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Amendment (Household Assistance) Bill 2009
or any other related bill or bills to implement the proposed CPRS.

Senator Bob Brown to move on the next day of sitting:
That the Government furnish the Senate with a considered response to reports in The Age that firms associated with the Reserve Bank of Australia may have been involved in corrupt practices by 25 June 2009.

Senator Fielding to move on the next day of sitting:
That the following bill be introduced: A Bill for an Act to amend the Banking Act 1959 to keep banks accountable in setting mortgage interest rates, and for related purposes. Banking Amendment (Keeping Banks Accountable) Bill 2009.

Senator Hanson-Young to move on the next day of sitting:
That the Senate—
supports the call by the Deputy Prime Minister (Ms Gillard) on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation program Lateline, 16 June 2009, to support:
a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, and
a halt to Israel’s settlement activity in contested areas; and
calls on the Australian Government to endorse the speech by the United States President, Mr Barack Obama, given in Cairo on 4 June 2009, specifically:
rejecting the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements, and
affirming that continued Israeli settlements in contested areas violate previous agreements and undermine efforts to achieve peace.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,0,1,speech

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-06-18,"—I wish to move an amendment to the motion for adoption of the Selection of Bills Committee report. I move:
At the end of the motion, add: “but in respect of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2009 and the Renewable Energy (Electricity) (Charge) Amendment Bill 2009, the provision of the bills be referred to the Economics Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 12 August 2009”.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-06-18,"—I rise to say that I oppose a delay in dealing with this legislation. I support the Selection of Bills Committee report as it currently stands. I would like an indication from you, Mr President, as to whether I have a few minutes to speak on this matter.
—Five minutes.
—The issue here is the renewable energy target. The government went to the 2007 election with a promise to increase the renewable energy target in order to drive the expansion of renewable energy in Australia. It is something that the Greens have campaigned on for a long time, and we would certainly want the government to go further than the 20 per cent renewable energy target that is proposed.
The industry has been calling for this legislation since the day the government was elected at the end of 2007, and the delay in getting it to the parliament has been such that earlier this year I introduced a private member’s bill to bring on the renewable energy target because the government was dithering in getting this legislation to the parliament. Now that it is here, the only reason that people are pushing for delay is that the government played politics with this by linking the renewable energy target legislation with its Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation.
Interestingly, the focus here is not on helping the renewable energy industry; the focus here is on the energy-intensive trade-exposed industries. The way the government has linked these bills means that, if the RET were to pass next week and the CPRS did not, the energy-intensive trade-exposed industries would not get their exemptions, and they are the ones putting pressure on here for the delay. Meanwhile, the people who will suffer will be the renewable energy businesses. Even in today’s papers there is a report of a business in Victoria saying that it is going to have to put people off unless this legislation is passed because the rebate has disappeared. As we know, the government moved on that before 30 June. These businesses are desperately waiting. In one of today’s papers it says:
SOLAR panel retailers are preparing to cut jobs and halt expansion plans because of uncertainty over the Government’s solar credit program.
That, of course, is the multiplier in the RET.
If we do not deal with this by the end of next week people are going to lose their jobs. Businesses are going to go to the wall—and they are the renewable energy businesses. The people who are pushing for this delay are the big emitters. I am not going to support this being held off over the winter simply because it does not suit the coalition to deal with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation in the next week or so.
I want to see this legislation through. I want to give certainty to the renewable energy industry that they have got their target. I would be prepared to have an inquiry tomorrow or on Monday, but I am not prepared to see this last over the winter, because we are going to see the renewable energy industry further undermined by this kind of delay. The people who vote for delay are people voting for losing jobs and losing businesses in one of the industries that we need to build for a low-carbon or zero-carbon future. There can be no excuse for this kind of delay. It is just more political manoeuvring for the benefit of the big end of town to the detriment of those industries where the jobs-rich growth is.
We have seen the report in the last couple of weeks saying that it is the renewable energy target that will drive jobs. It is not the CPRS; it is the renewable energy target. There was a report saying that some 28,000 jobs can be created. Every month’s delay is not only jobs not created; it is jobs lost from existing businesses. So I think we should bring this on, get this legislation through by the end of next week and be pleased to see people putting more people on rather than putting people off.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1,speech
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-06-18,"—I wish to place on the record that the opposition will be supporting Senator Fielding in his amendment to the motion for the adoption of the Selection of Bills Committee report. We believe that the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill deserves proper scrutiny. Senator Milne just indicated that this is a deferral. That is totally incorrect. This is proper scrutiny of a very complex bill. This bill was introduced into the House of Representatives yesterday. There was no examination available until the bill was introduced. The bill is intrinsically linked with the CPRS suite of legislation, and we wish this to be examined in the same way as that was. That was examined by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which had a reasonable amount of time to deal with that. We wish this bill to proceed to that committee to be examined, with the committee reporting back by 12 August, which is not an unreasonable period of time considering the serious implications of this proposed legislation.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2009-06-18,"—I totally disagree with the Greens here.
—That’s a first!
—Well, it is. We were actually coming together on lot of issues, but I suppose we have to part. I support Senator Fielding’s proposition. Once the government linked the RET with the CPRS, the game was over. I will tell you why it was over. It was over because the CPRS legislation starts on 1 July, if it gets through, and the RET starts immediately, so that would mean that the really big EITE employers, the aluminium industry, the cement industry, the paper industry, the zinc industry, the steel industry—just about every industry in Australia that would be given permits—would have no permits and would be subject to being out there with no permits at all. The Greens senators have agreed with this. They believe that tying the two bills together was blackmail. What are we expected to do—just roll over and take this? Senator Milne is. She talks about job creation, but I want to talk about job destruction.
The other reason that you cannot go ahead with this without a full Senate inquiry is that the regulations that underpin the EITE industries’ targets or certificates are not known. Unless you know what the regulations are going to be, you are flying right in the face of a disaster without knowing where you are going. There are ongoing discussions between the industries now on what EITE activities are and what certificates are going to be given—whether they are 66 per cent or 94 per cent—and even the activities have not been defined. The agenda is whether they are on all the products or only part of the product or only part of the way that they are manufactured. This has not been decided yet. The activities have not been decided. How can you establish a regulation unless you know what the EITE activities are going to be? You cannot. Without establishing what the activities will be, what the regulations will be and whether they will be 60 per cent or 90 per cent or 55 per cent, it is just impossible to move this legislation through. Senator Milne has been in the paper saying that, totally disagreeing—

Senator Milne interjecting—

—Senator Milne says you can split them. You cannot split them if you do not know what the regulations are going to be. The regulations have not been determined because the EITE issue has not been agreed with the high-end electricity users. They were promised certificates. They were promised that they would get some form of relief. The industries are still in negotiations with the government. The cement industry are not aware of what certificates they are going to get. They know they are going to get some certificates; they do not know whether it is on just part of the manufacturing process or the total manufacturing process—and that is just the cement industry. All the other industries are in the same boat.
If the regulations were there, I would say you could go ahead with it, but the regulations are not there and they cannot be there for the reason that the negotiations are still going on with the high-end users of electricity. So I do not know what the rush is, Senator Milne, because you—

Senator Milne interjecting—

—People are going to lose their jobs all right; you are totally correct about that. But if this goes ahead without protection in the EITE industry part they are going to lose their jobs and they are going to lose— (Time expired)

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-06-18,"—I indicate that, with reluctance, I support Senator Fielding’s amendment. I say that because I take on board the arguments of Senator Milne that there needs to be certainty for the renewable energy sector. But I do see there is a point in what Senator Boswell is saying in the sense that if we decouple the RET legislation from the CPRS, which appears to be likely, then that poses some policy challenges. I agree with Senator Milne that the way of the future is with jobs in the renewable energy sector. In the absence of knowing what will occur in terms of the links between the RET and the CPRS, we need to look at this closely.
Until now the two schemes have been interlinked and Senator Milne is right to say that they can be decoupled. I think it is mischievous of the government to say that they cannot be, but there are policy challenges and consequences flowing from that which will need to be the subject of an inquiry to see how that can be done. I think that the policy objective here is: how can we further expand our renewable energy sector? Is this target ambitious enough? How can we have triggers there for the renewable energy sector to expand even further?
There is no doubt in my mind that Australia’s future is to go from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy and that can only be done in part with a strong renewable energy target and having the mechanisms in place for the structural adjustment that is necessary. I think we need this time, some seven weeks, in order to do this. I am reluctant to support it, but I think there is no choice given that it is likely that the CPRS legislation in its current form will not pass or will be substantially amended. Certainly, it will not go through in its current form, given what the coalition, Senator Fielding, the Greens and I have said. Therefore, we need a stand-alone RET scheme that will do the job to transform Australia from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy. I want to make it clear right now that the RET legislation must be dealt with soon after the committee reports on 12 August, if that is the will of the Senate, and then we need to get on with it. We need to deal with the policy challenges arising out of a decoupling of the two. That is my position and I hope that we get the answers that we need as a result of a Senate inquiry into the RET scheme.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,1,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-06-18,"—The government does not support delay. The government does not support the amendment moved by Senator Fielding. The referral of the renewable energy target legislation to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee to report on 12 August is delay. There is time within the program over the next fortnight to deal with this bill. It is in the interests of the renewable energy industry to deal with this matter and not to have the consideration of the bill deferred.
The government does believe that an inquiry could be held and report by 24 June. That would allow—and I think Senator Milne mentioned it as well—a committee to be held on Friday and/or Monday and to report by Wednesday. It would ensure that the RET bill could be considered in the Senate in the following week. The government would then list the RET bill for consideration in the Senate next week on the basis of that. However, it is a matter that we now are in the hands of the Senate to deal with. A quick summary of the numbers does look like Senator Fielding’s amendment will be agreed to. This is of concern to the government. It would be preferable for the amendment not to be supported by the Senate. I do ask the Senate to think carefully about this. It is an important bill. I think Senator Milne has outlined the issues around the bill itself.
It is worth saying in brief: this debate is not about the mechanics or the content of the bill. This debate is about whether we have delay in relation to this issue. The government does not support delay. The Selection of Bills Committee could not reach an agreement in respect of this bill. On that basis it does come here for consideration. The government believes that proper consideration and scrutiny could be achieved, even within the short time that is available, with the cooperation of all parties. However, it does not look like that is going to happen. With regret, I will conclude.

That is my position and I hope that we get the answers that we need as a result of a Senate inquiry into the RET scheme.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,1,2,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-06-18,"—The government does not support delay. The government does not support the amendment moved by Senator Fielding. The referral of the renewable energy target legislation to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee to report on 12 August is delay. There is time within the program over the next fortnight to deal with this bill. It is in the interests of the renewable energy industry to deal with this matter and not to have the consideration of the bill deferred.
The government does believe that an inquiry could be held and report by 24 June. That would allow—and I think Senator Milne mentioned it as well—a committee to be held on Friday and/or Monday and to report by Wednesday. It would ensure that the RET bill could be considered in the Senate in the following week. The government would then list the RET bill for consideration in the Senate next week on the basis of that. However, it is a matter that we now are in the hands of the Senate to deal with. A quick summary of the numbers does look like Senator Fielding’s amendment will be agreed to. This is of concern to the government. It would be preferable for the amendment not to be supported by the Senate. I do ask the Senate to think carefully about this. It is an important bill. I think Senator Milne has outlined the issues around the bill itself.
It is worth saying in brief: this debate is not about the mechanics or the content of the bill. This debate is about whether we have delay in relation to this issue. The government does not support delay. The Selection of Bills Committee could not reach an agreement in respect of this bill. On that basis it does come here for consideration. The government believes that proper consideration and scrutiny could be achieved, even within the short time that is available, with the cooperation of all parties. However, it does not look like that is going to happen. With regret, I will conclude.

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2009-06-18,"—I present the interim report of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Related Industries on food production in Australia.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—This matter came to our attention from a company called Cuthbertson Brothers in Tasmania, which I am sure Senator O’Brien is familiar with. The committee concluded that, on the evidence presented to us, Cuthbertsons were being unfairly treated by Swift Australia, the takeover company of the abattoir operation on King Island. It appeared on the evidence given to us that the sheepskins from the abattoirs where the service kills had been cancelled—so there was a sole operator—were being tendered through a process through a gentleman in Melbourne who accepted the bids that were made by the various people that needed the skins in a tender system which allowed Swifts, after the tenders were opened, to then top the price of the tender, which I have to say is a unique way of having a tender system, wouldn’t you agree, Senator O’Brien?
On the evidence presented we thought that this was unfairly treating Cuthbertsons, an iconic Tasmanian company, and the resultant economic impact and the loss of jobs on the local communities had quite serious implications. Unfortunately and sadly, Swifts declined the invitation to come and give their version of events. So I can only say that on the version of events that were presented to us and on the evidence by both people who have sheepskins to sell and Cuthbertsons it was, as I say, a unique tender system which has been taken up by the ACCC. We will leave it for them to gather evidence. I can say that it was a worthwhile exploration and quite an important report that we dropped today because, if this conduct were allowed to continue, it would be a serious abuse of market power with a very flawed, as it appears on the evidence, tender system which would then set a precedent for other parts of the industry. I commend the report to the Senate. Obviously, the committee will be keeping a watching brief on the progress of the discussions between the ACCC and the affected parties. Thank you very much.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2009-06-18,"—I rise today to speak to the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2009. The bill has three components: one budget measure and two non-budget measures. The opposition will be supporting all three measures.
Firstly, the bill introduces the budget measure designed to streamline the administration of the payment of a family tax package. From 1 July 2009 it will no longer be possible to claim family tax benefit through the tax office. Currently some Australian families elect to receive their family tax benefit in the form of a reduction in pay-as-you-go tax instalments. While only a small number of people are affected, some seven per cent of all FTB eligible recipients, this preferred method of receiving the payment will no longer be available. While generally supporting choice, in this instance the opposition will support this measure due to the small number of individuals involved and the efficiency savings realised due to the overall simplification of the FTB payment system. The choice of payment options of fortnightly, yearly and annual adjustments where necessary will remain with no changes to be made to payment rates as a result of the provisions contained within this bill.
Secondly, the bill provides amendments to the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to enable the Social Security Appeals Tribunal to review decisions made under part 3B of that act relating to a person who is subject to the Northern Territory income management regime. As most people in this place will recall, the original Northern Territory intervention legislation did not allow appeals of decisions to apply to income management. Ideally and personally I would like to see that situation be continued for all new determinations.
We have a lot of difficulty in understanding exactly how this is going to be pursued. On the basis that it appears to affect such a small demographic, we are not going to die in a ditch about it, but we will be watching that area very, very closely. It just seems very difficult to me in a community where much of the feedback is: ‘I’m living in the community. Because I’ve got to shop with my BasicsCard, I feel stigmatised.’ When you are starting to say to people, ‘Well, you can come up with specific reasons why you don’t think your particular circumstances are such that you would need assistance with your budget,’ I think we are getting into a very, very difficult area, where people are having to make highly subjective decisions. But, given the very small numbers, we would certainly be supporting that.
We are certainly seeing more money spent on food, clothing and essentials and obviously much less spent on alcohol. Life in the community seems to be a world away from some of the despair and dysfunction endured up until about 18 months ago. I acknowledge there is much work to be done. I would certainly hate to think that this measure has been inserted in the bill as part of the signal that there is going to be a slow unwinding of any of the intervention measures. I certainly would not like to see a return to the dark days before the intervention. I understand that the measures that I have indicated affect a few new applicants. I am unaware of how many that will be, as it will not affect the 17,000-odd individuals currently on income management.
Thirdly, this bill will mean that new CDEP program—that is, Community Development Employment Program—participants from or after 1 July 2009 will receive income support payments instead of CDEP wages from CDEP providers. Existing CDEP participants will continue to receive CDEP wages until 30 June 2011, at which time they will also transfer to income support. The coalition wanted CDEP jobs turned into real jobs. CDEP was only ever designed to be a training and development program but unfortunately has evolved into a long-term job program. It also supported the state and territory governments by paying participants to do effectively what the state should have been responsible for. For a number of years the Commonwealth also, particularly in the area of child care in communities, enjoyed not paying people who should have been paid by accessing the CDEP inappropriately.
It was a great tragedy that, when I spoke to young people in many communities over that period of time, I found that their aspiration was to get onto the CDEP. It was certainly seen as an end game; it was a job forever. It was seen as an end rather than a process of training to prepare them for a job that would be paid as we would all understand that term. So we must continue to build on the platform that has been set up by the previous government to provide jobs with career and advancement opportunities for those in remote communities who seek advancement. There are presently not a whole heap of opportunities out there, but there are never going to be real jobs if the government sits back and relies on the CDEP and the Work for the Dole program alone. As I said, the opposition support this bill. We do so with the full intention to continue to monitor progress of government measures in the Northern Territory to ensure community life has improved, opportunities for work are created and community members are trained and equipped to take advantage of those opportunities as they arrive.
I will now turn briefly to the second bill being debated, the Family Assistance Amendment (Further 2008 Budget Measures) Bill 2009. This legislation implements three measures that are designed to reduce family social security debt. The first measure will allow Centrelink to adjust the rate of family tax benefit paid fortnightly as an individual’s income changes. For the majority of family tax benefit recipients in stable full-time work there is not a problem of potential social security debt. But, for those either in casual work or who are self-employed, obviously the income fluctuations make it very difficult to determine exactly what payment should be made, because you are effectively unaware of it until the determination is made at the end of the financial year. The opposition supports this measure and will monitor with interest its effect on reducing social security debt.
The second measure contained within this legislation will assist in reducing a debt arising from the overpayment of FTB by ceasing payments if an individual fails to lodge a tax return within 18 months of the end of the relevant financial year. As the rate of FTB is linked to income and a tax return is a method to accurately report income, if a return is not lodged then no FTB will be paid. This will ensure that an overpayment is not made and therefore a debt is not accrued if an individual’s income exceeds the threshold once it is reported through a tax return. Of course, we welcome the provision that, if a tax return is lodged within two years, the full entitled rate of FTB will be paid. Again, it is a measure that the opposition will monitor closely as it is implemented to ensure that the social security debt that we intend to avoid is avoided without causing any financial strain upon families.
The third measure makes some minor changes to the provisions surrounding the time in which the Australian Taxation Office can provide details of a customer’s details for the purposes of family assistance law. The opposition support this measure, as we support the bill in anticipation that this will achieve the government’s stated objectives of ensuring that all eligible families receive the family tax benefit and minimising the incidence of social security debt.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2008 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-06-18,"—I will largely focus my comments on the Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment (2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2009 and then touch very briefly on the Family Assistance Amendment (Further 2008 Budget Measures) Bill 2009. As Senator Scullion articulated, this bill has three schedules. I have little comment on the first schedule other than to say that I agree that very few people will be affected by these measures, and the Greens have no objections to them. Schedule 2 relates to the provision of some appeal mechanisms which, quite frankly, make it look as if the government are doing something but in reality do not really affect the lives of people in the NT because most of the decisions that affect people in the NT under the NT intervention are not appealable under this provision. So, while it looks as if the government are providing a mechanism and responding to people’s needs in the Northern Territory, they in fact are not. Under the intervention, one of the areas that people are particularly concerned with and would want to appeal is compulsory income quarantining. The two avenues about which people are concerned and may want to appeal are in fact not appealable.
One of them is the declaration of prescribed areas. Under the act, nobody can appeal that. The minister has to take into account certain factors but, regardless of that, if an area is declared, people in that area cannot appeal it. The second area is about being in a prescribed area and being subject to the income quarantine measures. Again, people are not able to appeal that decision. There are a very small amount of exemptions if you were in an area when it was a prescribed area, but if you do not meet one of those exemptions, you cannot appeal. In other words, this is essentially meaningless to people on the ground, and that was certainly the evidence that we received in the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry into the bill. We would support even a small window of opportunity to allow people the right of appeal. This does not cause any further disadvantage to anybody in those prescribed communities or in the Northern Territory who are subject to the income quarantining, so the Greens will not object to this particular amendment, but we very clearly point out that it does not in any way meet the needs of those people who are opposed to income quarantining in the Northern Territory.
There have been many claims made about the success of income quarantining, but to date there is no satisfactory data to prove it one way or the other. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence, and I agree with Senator Scullion that there are people in the Northern Territory saying that they are glad to have income quarantining—I acknowledge that. There are also a large number of people who do not like income quarantining, which is why the Greens have maintained all along that income quarantining should be done on a voluntary basis. We believe that the reason it was exempted from the Racial Discrimination Act is that it is racially discriminatory. It picks on one group of people and subjects them to compulsory income quarantining.
There are, as I acknowledged earlier, some people who do not mind compulsory income quarantining, but there is a large group of people who do not like compulsory income quarantining, and I think the people who do like it, if a voluntary mechanism had been available throughout the Northern Territory, would probably have used that. There were 800 people using voluntary income quarantining under the Tangentyere Council system when the intervention was introduced in the Northern Territory and there were 2,000 people on the books. If there had been discussions with the community, the government may well have been able to come up with a system of voluntary income quarantining that could have been expanded throughout the Northern Territory that did not require the measure to be exempt from the RDA but helped people manage their finances.
If the object of the exercise was to ensure that people had access to fresh fruit and vegetables and spent their money on the wellbeing of the children, which is what the government claimed it was, they could have introduced a much better support and education system with that measure. As I touched on earlier, there are claims that this has increased the sales of fresh fruit and vegetables and other things to the benefit of children. For a start, those claims are based on surveys from the stores that of course are going to want to show that they have been increasing sales of fresh fruit and vegetables.
I have acknowledged there have been some positive elements to the intervention, but they could have been brought in without being exempted from the Racial Discrimination Act. One of those is the better provisioning of stores. Licensing of the stores, in general, has been better. There are still some issues there, but stores have been forced to bring in fresh fruit and vegetables and a better supply of food. If you supply it, people will buy it. If you make sure the stores are providing what the communities want, the people will access those stores. If you look on the website, there are a number of evaluations, but there has not been that level of independent assessment of the provisioning of those stores. Nor has there been a look at what happens when you improve the supplies of these stores, regardless of the intervention. What happens when you tighten up the stores act to ensure that they do supply provisions—and, I have to say, at a reasonable price?
The other point that was brought up during the committee inquiry was the fact that some communities do not have a licensed store. People are having to spend a lot of money to travel to licensed stores. The Senate Select Committee on Regional and Remote Indigenous Communities heard this yet again when we were in Darwin in May. We heard from the homelands association and from Arnhem Land that people are having to travel great distances to get access to a licensed store and it is costing people a great deal of money. Therefore, when this measure was introduced it caused great hardship to those communities, and those people, under the provisions of schedule 2 of this act, are not able to appeal because they are in a prescribed community.
So the government look as if they are doing something good, but they are not really, because they are not allowing people to appeal against compulsory income quarantining in itself. So, as I said, while the Greens oppose compulsory income quarantining—we have concerns that the government look as if they are doing something or not doing something—we are not going to oppose that particular schedule.
The schedule that we are particularly concerned about is schedule 3, which deals with CDEP. There has been much discussion about CDEP. In fact, there has been much mud slung at CDEP in that it is ‘sit-down money’, whereas a lot of the facts do not actually justify calling it sit-down money. Yes, there are problems with CDEP—I will absolutely acknowledge that. I do not think you could have a debate about CDEP without acknowledging some of the past issues with it. But, instead of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, why don’t we fix CDEP so it can function in the manner in which it was originally envisaged? The government will say, ‘We’re not throwing the baby out with the bathwater,’ that CDEP is continuing and transitioning. Well, it is not doing that properly.
What the government are doing—and let’s be quite clear about this—is trying to move away from CDEP so that they accomplish the same thing that the Howard government wanted to accomplish when they brought in the Northern Territory intervention, which was to cut CDEP completely so they could move people off wages, which it could not quarantine, and onto income support, which can be quarantined. The ALP government then came in and reintroduced CDEP. Now they are changing CDEP. In non-remote areas people will be moving off CDEP as of 1 July, and I will go into the numbers in a minute. In remote areas there is a transition period, but any new people who go onto CDEP will go onto income support rather than wages, because the government can quarantine income support. That is in the Northern Territory. You can quarantine income support; you cannot quarantine wages. So they are essentially now doing what the previous government was doing—that is, subjecting those people to income quarantining.
CDEP, as I indicated, is very important particularly to regional and remote communities where it does provide jobs. I acknowledge that there are anecdotal stories that it is sit-down money and that there are issues, but we should be fixing those issues rather than getting rid of the whole scheme. We think there needs to be a much stronger emphasis in the CDEP scheme on training and skills development to address what is a significant gap between the low levels of education and work experience in a number of communities and actually genuinely meeting people’s needs. Studies of the program have found that a high proportion of CDEP residents work much more than the standard 15 hours per week and are much less likely to drink or be arrested. They have higher rates of participation in community and cultural activities than those who are unemployed. There are higher rates of full-time employment in communities that have CDEP schemes, and participants are much more likely to move into paid employment. We believe the most recent focus on CDEP as a labour market program has overlooked the most important community development role that the program has played in the past in developing community infrastructure and delivering community services.
CDEP has unfortunately also been used by federal governments, territory governments and local governments to essentially cost shift around the need to provide wages and support for properly funded jobs. I divert for a minute, as people keep talking about proper jobs and real jobs. Many people who work on CDEP have real jobs; they are just not paid properly. Saying that we are shifting people to real jobs I think is being really rude to the people working in those jobs. The people who are working in art centres, the people who are working in child care—I will come back to child care in a minute—are doing proper and real jobs; it is just that the federal, territory and local governments—I am talking about the NT here but it does apply to states as well—have used that funding to subsidise what they should be paying for. That is not Aboriginal people’s fault; it is government’s fault for not actually paying real money, stumping up the money, for the work that needs to be done. When we were in Alice Springs we were talking to a health organisation that was running child care. Senator Scullion was there, and so was Senator Adams. This organisation was running childcare services but was still operating on CDEP money. They had not been transferred to real jobs—and I use that label only because that is what the government has been calling them—but were still on CDEP jobs. They had not been converted to properly funded childcare jobs. That is one of the areas that the federal government had said it would fix, but it has not been fixed.
In the NT at the time of the intervention there were just over 8,000 people on CDEP, and there was a big move at the time, which we supported, to provide funding to convert CDEP jobs to fully paid jobs. But, at the time, they highlighted the fact that there was money for only around 2,000 fully funded positions. In questioning at the inquiry into this bill, and recently at Senate estimates, we found that the latest figure for fully funded positions, in respect of Australian government and local service delivery in the Northern Territory alone, was 2,014—2,014 jobs. There are 6,000 people still on CDEP in the Northern Territory. So, of 8,000 or so positions that were CDEP, only 2,000 have been converted to jobs. There were 8,000 people employed in CDEP, and a quarter of those have now been provided with properly funded jobs, if I can call them that. Most of the positions in the NT will not be transitioning out of CDEP in June, I acknowledge that, but the figure we got from estimates two weeks ago was that there were a total of 16,291 CDEP positions around Australia. I will not go to the detail now; people can find the breakdown of that in estimates answers in Hansard. It is broken down by people in each state, but the figure that is important for this debate right now is that there are about 4,000 people who will be coming out of CDEP and going into mainstream job service providers, although I do acknowledge there will be some specific Indigenous job service providers. At the time of estimates, unfortunately, the department was not able to tell me how many of those 25 Indigenous job service providers would be able to support the 4,000 people who are coming out of CDEP. At the moment it is not clear whether those 4,000 will be able to access the 25 specialised service providers or not.
The point here is that these people are coming out of CDEP and, in most circumstances, going onto income support. In a study done by the Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research at ANU, they were able to identify, although there is a lot of churn, that of the 16,000 people who had previously come out of CDEP around 40 per cent went onto income support. However they think that, because there has not been too much study done on this, as many as 70 per cent of those people could be going onto income support. When I asked the department during the inquiry about how many of the people that are coming out of CDEP are going onto income support, the department was not able to tell me because that information is not collected. So we actually do not know how many of the 4,000 people who are coming out of CDEP as of two weeks time will be going into jobs or going onto income support. As to the future people who will be transitioned out of CDEP through the transition process, we do not know, again, how many people will be going onto income support or into the properly funded positions.
We do not believe that this is an appropriate approach to dealing with the huge problems that Aboriginal people face in being work ready. It has been acknowledged, and I know the government and the coalition acknowledge this, that there are huge hurdles that need to be overcome to enable Aboriginal people, particularly in rural and remote areas, to be job ready. We also have to look at the type of jobs that we traditionally have seen as being available in rural and remote communities. That is where we need to be looking more broadly, and it is where CAEPR also argues that we need to be looking at funding alternative economic development mechanisms and we need to be putting real money into the sort of land management that is absolutely essential in regional communities.
We need to be providing more funding—and here I will acknowledge that the government has been putting more funding into land and sea rangers and into Caring for Country projects, but it is not enough to provide the level of management that is needed. Very significant natural resource management is required in Australia and it is underfunded. Our biodiversity loss continues at a very alarming rate. The management of Aboriginal land and the contribution to carbon offsetting is huge. Aboriginal understanding of land management is unparalleled. There is all the expertise there and we need to value it properly and we need to put more money into supporting development and training.
Another issue that the committee identified during the inquiry, when we travelled to local communities to talk to them, is adult education. In all areas in South Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland, where the committee travelled quite extensively, one of the overriding issues that we encountered is the lack of access to adult education. When we talk about adult education we are not talking about people aged 20, 25 and above. We are talking about, in some communities, ages over 13. Once a young man has gone through men’s business, he is regarded as an adult. He cannot go back to school with boys and certainly not with girls. Those young men need another avenue of access to education, and it is not being provided. (Time expired)

These are very important bills, which are being handled cognately, and the government is highly committed to them. I must say that it is a great pleasure for me to be involved, because one of the only good things about being in opposition for many years is that, as opposition spokesman, you get to do most jobs. Two of the jobs I got to do were family services and Indigenous affairs. It is good to see many of the things that we advocated and supported being reflected in government legislation. This obviously picks up the very vexed problem of family tax benefit debt, which has been a huge concern and is something that I had a lot to do with, and the reform of the CDEP, which is also a long overdue and important measure to assist Indigenous people into, if you like, mainstream, fully paid employment. I thank senators for their contributions and for the general support around the chamber. Obviously we will deal with Senator Siewert’s amendment in the committee stage.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2009-06-18,"—I rise to speak on behalf of the opposition in response to the Guarantee of State and Territory Borrowing Appropriation Bill 2009. I will indicate at the outset our support for the legislation but also indicate that I will at an appropriate time be moving an amendment which I will get to a little bit later. The Guarantee of State and Territory Borrowing Appropriation Bill provides for a standing appropriation to pay for any future claims should any state or territory government default on loans that are guaranteed by the Australian government’s guarantee of state and territory borrowing. Money is to be appropriated from the consolidated fund and, if there is insufficient money in the fund, the bill provides for authority of the Commonwealth to borrow money to pay claims to creditors.
We are obviously hoping that the prospect of any default would be a very, very unlikely circumstance. In those circumstances, we do appreciate that this bill is more procedural in that it provides substance to the guarantee which has already been announced by the government and which the market is pricing into the issuance of government bonds. Even though state governments have declared that they will access the government guarantee, with the way in which events have unfolded, it may not in fact occur. I think New South Wales may have said that they will access the guarantee. But, quite understandably and appropriately, the market is already pricing into the cost of semi-government issuance the federal government guarantee.
It is estimated that the states will increase their borrowings from the existing $100 billion outstanding to about $160 billion in the next three years. I think one of the reasons is that, when you start to actually delve through the detail of state budgets, you can see the pressures that are already evident, and the windfall payments from the federal government are at the moment, I think, propping up state budgets. The net impact is that the states are in fact in some cases reducing and replacing their own capital expenditure with the money that is provided by the Commonwealth. That, I think, should certainly be looked at. If it is correct, it is alarming, but it also devalues the stimulatory impact of the Commonwealth government’s expenditure because it simply substitutes state government expenditure with Commonwealth expenditure.
The thing about this is that the states have traditionally carried—and still do carry—the great bulk of infrastructure expenditure in Australia, as is appropriate. Roads, public transport, schools and hospitals are all, in the main, run by state governments, and not only new capital work programs and the integration of those capital programs into existing infrastructure but also, significantly, the maintenance of those capital works programs are very much the domain of state governments. But obviously that in turn puts pressure on their capacity to actually raise finance.
This bill obviously addresses where there is insufficient funding in the Consolidated Revenue Fund to pay a claim. The bill also allows the minister to borrow money to top up the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the purpose of paying the claim. The borrowing must not be for a period exceeding 24 months and includes raising money or obtaining credit whether by dealing in securities or otherwise. The provision of this guarantee will only cover securities which the states choose to make subject to the proposed guarantee, as I said. Due to the recent economic conditions, and the deterioration in those conditions, we do note that state governments are finding themselves in a position where they are increasingly borrowing more money.
It does appear pretty obvious that state governments have found it increasingly difficult to compete against the federal government when it comes to the issuance of bonds. This is in part due to the attractiveness of the Commonwealth government’s AAA credit rating—which, mercifully, we still have—and the lower comparative risk associated with Commonwealth government bonds. It is also worth noting that ratings agencies generally do not allow subordinate governments or companies a credit rating above that of the sovereign. So a downgrading of the national government would likely raise costs for all Australian borrowers. As I have said, thankfully, that does not appear to be the case.
During the inquiry the point was highlighted about the states’ attitudes towards debt and the impact of their credit rating on their borrowing capacity. The states are looking to increase their massive amount of borrowings and, when added to the current government mountain of debt, which will peak at about $315 billion in 2013-14, it must give us all pause for thought as to the appropriateness of this guarantee. But, having said that, I do reiterate that the coalition will not be opposing this bill. We will, however, be moving an amendment at the committee stage. The amendment will allow for the establishment of a register of government borrowings. There are a number of reasons for this, and they were outlined by the shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey, in the House. He referred to the fact that it may not have been necessary to have a register of government borrowings when $55 billion—which is about the average from the Australian government over the last 10 years—was at issue. But as we are now going down the path of some $315 billion on issue, obviously different considerations apply. It is clear that with semigovernment debt involved—that is, the state governments’ issuance—it could, as I said, be looking at least at another extra $160 billion. In our view Australia should follow the lead of other countries, particularly the United States, and have a full disclosure of who the major lenders to the Australian people are.
We realise that this can be a very complex issue. It might sound pretty complicated because these bonds are traded all the time. But, indeed, so are shares. As Mr Hockey also mentioned in the House, even in parliament we are expected to have full disclosure and we agree with that. There are registers of their shareholders that are run by companies, and the general public can go and check who the shareholders are. There is full disclosure in relation to millions of shareholders who own shares in Australia. On the other hand there are hundreds, and perhaps even thousands, of major entities that own Australian government bonds and that are not currently required to have their details disclosed. Questions were put in the recent estimates to the Australian Office of Financial Management about that and about how feasible it would be to have greater disclosure or to maintain a register. It is a fair summary, I think, to say that they said they obviously did not know who the ultimate owners of the bonds were but they did have a suspicion about who owned Australian government bonds. They referred those of us sitting on the Senate Economics Legislation Committee to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, saying that it does, in fact, collect data about share ownership. It goes to the custodians, of which there appear to be just six, and it conducts a survey.
Inquiries have been made of the deputy chief statistician as to why the Australian Bureau of Statistics could not disclose the domicile of the ultimate holders. My understanding is that the statistician was to get back to my colleague Mr Hockey but that the matter as to why it might be difficult to collect the data to at least reveal the domicile of the ultimate holders has not yet been resolved. It was put to the chief statistician that certainly there could be disclosure by regions but, as I said, that matter has not yet been resolved. The Australian Bureau of Statistics is obviously an independent entity and we in the coalition certainly hold them in high regard. We do think that it is not beyond their wit and will, if required to do so, to be prepared to work out ways that would allow much more information relating to the ultimate buyers of bonds and perhaps the regions from which they come to be put on a public register. So that is really the thrust of the amendment. There will no doubt be an opportunity to address it when I move it. As to the substance of the bill that we are addressing here, we indicate our support for the legislation.",SENATE,<title>GUARANTEE OF STATE AND TERRITORY BORROWING APPROPRIATION BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-06-18,"—As Senator Coonan has just outlined, the Guarantee of State and Territory Borrowing Appropriation Bill 2009 has the purpose of enabling the Treasurer to provide a guarantee to the states upon request for bonds or debt and if there is a need for it to borrow money for that purpose. The bill is about guaranteeing funding to the states for infrastructure spending. Bond markets have experienced liquidity problems in the last year or two but data from the Reserve Bank indicates that this is slowly recovering. As with the so-called Ruddbank legislation, we are being asked here to support another major spending program—and this could potentially be a huge spending program—by the Commonwealth on issues where the urgency of the matter seems to have retreated somewhat.
An example of my concerns is over the infrastructure spending by the New South Wales, Queensland and Victorian governments that indicates, in the case of the first two, they may be accessing the loan guarantee scheme. That could lead to Commonwealth guarantees of quite massive loans for such things as coal transport and port infrastructure for increasing export of coal to the rest of the world. Australia is already far and away the world’s biggest coal exporter in an age of dangerous climate change. The latest UN reports say that 300,000 people died in the last year as a result of climate change. So here we have the federal government using taxpayers’ money to support old, polluting industries but passing up this great opportunity to ensure that there are green bonds that will be supported through this loan mechanism and a green new deal for the economy.
It is notable that the need for this guarantee arises from the guarantee provided to the private sector banks, because the imposition of the bank guarantee certainly made it harder for state governments to obtain debt funding. I foreshadow an amendment from the Greens in the committee stage. I will be asking the government about what guarantees it can give to the Senate and whether indeed there is any limit whatever on the Commonwealth guarantee being offered through this legislation to the states. The government has stated that this bill will create an unquantifiable liability on the budget, on the basis that it is unlikely that a state government will default on its outstanding loans. One could wonder immediately whether we ought not to be ready to deal with such an exigency when it occurs rather than in the general way in which this legislation offers to back up state governments before any such event of default or potential default has even come into focus.
If called into use, this guarantee could lead to billions of dollars more debt for the Commonwealth. The coalition has been consistently critical of that potential growing government indebtedness yet is apparently going to support the legislation. In that circumstance, the Greens amendment becomes very important. We will be seeking to ensure that any guarantee provided to a state government is supporting projects for infrastructure which is responsible and socially valuable. By ‘responsible’ I mean environmentally responsible. Our proposed amendment follows on from the concerns I mentioned earlier that the money could be used to fund coal ports, more tollways or more climate-change-unfriendly projects from state governments, which do not have the national responsibility that we have, as we approach Copenhagen, to ensure that this country is on a green trajectory to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and is not potentially, through the mechanism we have in this bill, putting billions into fostering greenhouse gas emissions in this country when there are better alternatives.
We can only speculate on the projects. Another one that would be of great concern to the Greens would be the seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant proposed for the Bass Coast in Victoria. As you may know, Acting Deputy President, the funding model chosen there is a public-private partnership—it was chosen by the Labor government in Victoria—which is creating a necessity to profit from water. Veolia, which runs Melbourne’s rail network, or another French company, Degremont Suez, will lead a consortium to implement and profit from this plant, I am informed. An internet search reveals that both of these companies have questionable corporate ethical and human rights records—and, indeed, environmental records, although the environmental projection may be something that quite a lot of money has gone into. Internationally, these companies have recently lost sizeable chunks of their business as a result of adverse publicity and boycott campaigns. The Victorian government is about to hand over a third of the water supply in Melbourne to one or the other of those consortia, in effect.
Certainly the Senate and the national parliament ought to be very careful indeed that, if we are going to be offering state governments, including the Brumby government in Victoria, guarantees for potentially billions of dollars for polluting, disruptive, job-losing projects like the desalination project on the Bass Coast—where there are much more prudent and feasible alternatives for the supply of that water through proper use, for example, of the rainfall over the metropolitan area of Melbourne—we should have a debate about that in this parliament. The proposed Greens amendment is aimed at ensuring that there is some environmental record of the projects that the government is proposing to guarantee with billions of dollars of Australian taxpayers’ money. I foreshadow an amendment in the committee stage to page 3 of the bill to add clause 7, a schemes rules requirements clause, which will say:
Scheme Rules must include provisions that limit the Deed of Guarantee so that it cannot be applied to borrowings relating to projects that will have a significant negative environmental impact or result in significant greenhouse gas emissions locally or internationally, and for which there are … prudent or feasible alternatives.",SENATE,<title>GUARANTEE OF STATE AND TERRITORY BORROWING APPROPRIATION BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-06-18,"—Firstly, I thank senators who participated in the debate on the Guarantee of State and Territory Borrowing Appropriation Bill 2009. As I have said on many occasions in this chamber, the global financial crisis and the ensuing economic impact—that is, a world recession of a very deep and substantial nature, the worst in 75 years—continue to wreak havoc on economies around the world. Almost every advanced economy is either in recession or recorded a decline in GDP late last year, and the world economy is expected to contract in 2009. Despite all of this, of course, Australia is well placed when compared with economies around the world. However, Australia is not immune from this impact. Whilst Australia’s financial markets are strong, they have been affected by the global financial crisis.
The market for state and territory bonds has also been affected, and liquidity in semigovernment bonds has been severely constricted. This threatens the capacity of state and territory governments to deliver critical infrastructure projects that will support jobs in the face of this global recession. Again, Australia is not unique. From general observation, I am certainly aware of the impact on state governments in the US, for example, where a number of states are in extraordinarily dire circumstances. California is one that comes to mind.
It is crucial that states and territories are able to access the credit markets, and this guarantee of state and territory borrowing recognises that. Indeed, supporting semigovernment bond markets is critical to maintaining the capacity of state and territory governments to deliver nation-building infrastructure. Reducing such investment would hamper recovery from the global recession. That would, in turn, cause slower growth and higher unemployment. That is why the government is putting in place this guarantee. It is an initiative that will complement the government’s other wide-ranging and decisive initiatives to support the economy and protect jobs. The government’s actions have helped maintain confidence in domestic financial markets and enabled lending to continue to provide further support for economic activity.
As well as this guarantee, the government’s early and decisive action has provided certainty that bank deposits are safe. This has enabled banks to continue lending to households and businesses, providing vital support to our economy. State and territory government infrastructure spending, as supported by the guarantee, will work hand-in-hand with the government’s own infrastructure investment to build a stronger Australia and provide employment opportunities in the short term while providing economy-supporting capacity in the longer term. In particular, the government’s Nation Building and Jobs Plan includes a direct investment of $29.9 billion in schools, housing, energy efficiency, community infrastructure and roads as well as support for small business. This represents the largest annual increase in public investment on record and is very appropriate in the current serious world economic circumstances.
The assistance to states and territories through the provision of the guarantee and the recent reforms of the federal financial relations framework, agreed to by COAG in November 2008, have been vital in enabling the Australian government to work collaboratively with the states and territories to respond to the global financial crisis. Starting from 1 January 2009, the new framework has considerably improved Commonwealth, state and territory government collaboration by increasing flexibility to direct funding at the state and territory level. It clarifies roles and responsibilities and improves accountability.
Turning to the details of the guarantee, the bill is essential to providing investors with the assurance that state and territory borrowing will be supported by an Australian government guarantee and that potential claims under the guarantee would be paid in a timely manner. To do this, the bill provides a standing appropriation so that, in the very unlikely event that claims were made under the guarantee, they could be paid in a timely manner. A standing appropriation is also put in place to allow any borrowings made under the bill to be repaid. A borrowing power is also provided to allow timely payment of claims should there be insufficient funds in the Consolidated Revenue Fund in the very unlikely event that a claim would need to be paid.
The government is working closely with the states and territories to finalise the guarantee so as to have it in place as soon as possible. I will clarify one thing. My advice is that all states and territories support this approach. I say ‘all’ because the Western Australian Liberal state government also supports this approach.
With those remarks, I further thank senators for their contributions and urge that the Senate support the legislation.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-18,"—There are two aspects to the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2009 which are worthy of brief mention. The first concerns the payment of compensation to those who suffer unintended collateral damage and loss as a result of action against enemy forces, especially where those affected are local people whose support is so important in areas of engagement by Australian forces. Discussions on the merits of such a policy as provided by the Parliamentary Library are quite useful in this context and it is not worthy at this stage of further comment on my part. Suffice to say that the government’s preference to pay compensation as recognition that the loss caused should not have to fall on innocents is a most serious stricture in modern warfare. But where winning hearts and minds is so important, history tells us that it is vital in stemming the shifting allegiance to the insurgents. If Vietnam taught us anything, it taught us at least that much.
The point here though is not about the policy but about the technicalities of how the compensation is paid. Clearly, the system of act of grace payments is designed for ad hoc losses, losses that are not anticipated, but where it is considered that there is some public responsibility in the absence of any other means of compensation for innocent victims. In situations such as our military engagement in Iraq and where we are currently involved in Afghanistan there is some certainty, indeed it is almost forecast, that these circumstances will arise. We therefore need a more ready response than the cumbersome procedures in the act of grace scheme. This is simply a pragmatic amendment worthy of support.
With respect to the amendments to the home loan subsidy scheme it is of course natural that upon implementation some matters would arise which were not foreseen at the time of drafting and which require attention to make sure that the intention of the act remains consistent. Clearly, with this bill there have been some unintended consequences, especially in relation to eligibility where there has been a break in service and, naturally, ADF members have been quite confused. The act has not been clear enough and some windfalls have occurred which were not foreseen. These amendments close those loopholes and therefore are also quite worthy of support.
However, this particular program retains some problematic characteristics. As we know the scheme had its origins in the previous government as it sought to introduce additional incentives to retain ADF members in service. I should note, however, that the cost of the original subsidy, which stood at a maximum of $705 per month for those with over 12 years of service on the maximum loan, is now, as a result of the cut in interest rates, much reduced, indeed dramatically reduced, at that level by in excess of $300 per month. The subsidy remains valuable in relative terms but at a much reduced cost to the taxpayer.
I make one comment on this particular scheme—that is, while the ADF personnel should be assisted in homeownership like any other Australian and we accept initiatives such as this are important in retaining experienced people in the ADF, there is still a sense of a lack of equity in the totality of the design of the scheme. The reason for that is simply that a large portion of ADF personnel are not in a position to take advantage of the scheme as currently designed. This is not just because of the four-year qualifying period but also because the opportunity to purchase a home might not exist, particularly of course in the remote areas of our large continent. This then begs the question of the fairness and equity of defence housing support programs and allowances, particularly between those who have a rental subsidy and those who opt to buy their own home.
This is in fact a serious question for ADF personnel who must find themselves faced with exactly this choice. On the one hand, if you buy, there is a subsidy available and, on the other hand, if you choose to rent because purchase is not an option, there is no subsidy. I am not sure how they are advised on the financial implications of such a choice nor am I aware of any modelling done on which that advice can be given. Perhaps we might find out in due course along with an analysis which shows the taxpayer in the long term which is the preferred model having due regard to considerations of equity. Moreover, it is important for serving ADF personnel to know as well and hence my particular interest. With those comments, clearly, the bill is worthy of support.",SENATE,"<title>

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2009-06-18,"—From the outset the opposition does support these two very important measures for ADF personnel in the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2009. Firstly, there is the tactical payments scheme in schedule 1, which I will come back to in a moment, and, secondly, there is the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme and the amendments to deal with unintended anomalies arising from the scheme. I do to some extent adopt the words and detail of the speech which Senator Bishop just made.
The most important part of the bill is the introduction of the tactical payments scheme. These provisions provide a mechanism for making expeditious no-liability payments to persons adversely affected by Australian Defence Force operations outside of Australia. The scheme acknowledges that in many areas in which the ADF operates financial compensation for collateral damage to property, for injury and for loss of life is often a common expectation of local cultures. Indeed our allies in both Iraq and Afghanistan have for some long time been availed of a capability of being able to settle such matters virtually instantaneously. This legislation will be a great boon to our soldiers, who will similarly now be able to settle such issues of damage to property, injury, loss of life and other matters related thereto at the time of the incident as opposed to relying upon the act of grace mechanism which is often cumbersome, very lengthy in its time to resolve issues and essentially, at the end of the day, has its effectiveness eroded by the effluxion of time between the payment and the occurrence of the event.
The tactical payment scheme is a defence-specific discretionary mechanism. It will still be possible for defence to have recourse to act of grace provisions in the Financial Management and Accountability Act. Guidance for TPS payments for each operation will take into account the cultural and socioeconomic circumstances of the local people and will be benchmarked against similar policies, as I have already mentioned, applied by coalition partners in theatre. In special circumstances where such claims exceed the financial delegation or fall outside the guidelines, such cases may be referred to the secretary, the CDF or the minister for approval.
The opposition did have some concerns as to the reporting of such matters. Can I say that those concerns have been satisfied. Whilst there is no specific mention in the legislation of the accountability and reporting provisions, the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 sets out that there is an obligation to report in the defence annual report. This is similar to other equivalent schemes such as the act of grace payments and special circumstances payments made pursuant to section 73 of the Public Service Act 1999. Specifically, section 48 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act, together with the finance minister’s orders, mandate that such tactical payments must be reported in the defence annual report. Tactical payments paid pursuant to this scheme will be subject to audit by the Australian National Audit Office.
I am very pleased to say, with the assistance of the former minister, that the opposition’s concerns regarding accountability and reporting of these payments have been met, and I commend the legislation to the Senate.",SENATE,"<title>

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2009-06-18,"—I rise today to speak on the government’s Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care) Bill 2009, and to indicate to the chamber the coalition’s general support for the bill. The bill makes a range of amendments. Some of those appear to be in response to problems which arose as a result of the recent and disturbing collapse of ABC Learning, and a number are what would be described as general housekeeping amendments to the existing legislation in the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999.
The bill makes changes to allow the final quarterly payment of the childcare tax rebate to be withheld until a parent’s taxable income is determined for that financial year. It will align the operation of the childcare rebate provisions with the childcare benefits provisions in the case of a deceased individual. This will mean that where an individual who has received childcare rebate payments dies, but their child in that instance continues to attend approved care, the childcare rebate payments for that child can continue to be received by another approved adult who takes over guardianship of the child in question. It will also allow for those people who have been assessed at a zero rate for the childcare benefit to request a review of their entitlements within two years of the year that they received the zero rating. Where a variation to the childcare benefit is made as a result of the review, an automatic review will be done in relation to the childcare rebate payments as well. The bill will also rename the childcare tax rebate as the childcare rebate, to reflect the fact that payment is now actually made as a quarterly payment through family assistance legislation rather than as a tax offset under taxation legislation.
Finally, the bill will impose civil penalties on childcare operators who breach their obligations in relation to when and how they notify their intention to cease operations. That is when childcare operators breach the rule that requires 30 days notice to be given before a centre can close. I want to spend a moment to focus on that amendment in particular. It was clear from the uncertainty and distress that was experienced by thousands of parents, carers, children and staff following the collapse of ABC Learning just how important this amendment is. The sudden closure of a childcare centre is more than just a business decision; it can mean unemployment for the centre’s workers, stress and work difficulties for both parents and carers, and of course instability for the children, who are disrupted in that process. All of that is made worse by ongoing uncertainty.
In the case of ABC Learning, for months many of the centres have been standing on the brink of closure with parents, carers and staff waiting for information—any information, in fact—that might tell them once and for all what was going to happen. After months of waiting, it is unacceptable for people in those circumstances to be told that a centre will close within days. A recent case of exactly this circumstance has been highlighted by my colleague the shadow minister for early childhood education, child care, women and youth, Mrs Mirabella, and I explored it myself in estimates. Mrs Mirabella was contacted by parents from the ABC Learning centre at Altona North in Victoria, which was one of those deemed unviable under the ABC Learning business model. It was also one of the centres controlled by the government appointed receivers, PPB, for which a buyer was being sought. The chronology is that on 15 April this year, the receivers announced that Altona North was one of the 210 former ABC Learning centres for which a buyer had been found. Then on 5 May, the Sydenham Preschool Trust was announced as the new operator. Three days later, on 8 May, a new announcement informed parents that the centre would close as of 15 May, which gave them just seven days notice to make alternative care arrangements for their children. I explored this matter at estimates. Notwithstanding the explanations that were given, for parents placed in those circumstances it was really an unacceptable situation. Some families were quite clearly in a great degree of difficulty as a result of this decision.
In fact, in the wake of the collapse of ABC Learning, the Minister for Education, Ms Gillard, has repeatedly said that childcare centres could not just close down overnight, leaving parents stranded and without any care for their children, precisely because the law requires centres to provide 30 days notice to the government that they will close. Clearly, in a circumstance such as this, this is a provision which has failed. The current bill will, we hope, strengthen it by imposing these civil penalties on centres that do not comply with the 30-day notice requirement.
As I have indicated, the coalition supports this amendment. But there is another area which we also believe deserves attention, and that is the need for a provision to ensure that childcare operators also provide 30 days notice to parents of children attending a centre which, for whatever reason, will cease to operate. A provision of that nature would go a long way to easing the burden on families affected by childcare centre closures.
I note that, in the discussions of such an amendment between the shadow minister and the then Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Development and Child Care, Ms McKew, the parliamentary secretary provided assurances that the department already had the power to specify the form and manner in which childcare service providers must give notification that they are ceasing operations. The then parliamentary secretary in fact said: ‘The department has a standardised notice of cessation form which will ensure parents receive at least 30 days notice.’ As a result of those assurances given by the parliamentary secretary, we do not intend to move an amendment on this matter, and we hope that the new minister in this area, Ms Kate Ellis, honours the commitment that has been made.
There are a number of other issues in the childcare area where much was promised but in reality little has been delivered to date. The lack of enforcement of the requirement that childcare services provide at least 30 days notice before they close is an example for starters. In 2007, we had the much-vaunted announcement of the plan for a Labor government to build an additional 260 childcare centres around Australia. Notwithstanding extensive discussions at estimates in the last 18 months, not one has been completed. We have half-a-dozen or so in the planning stage, but, really, given the strength of the promise, we had expected to see more and better by now.
Of course, we had partial clarification on budget night in the ministerial statement on education, which said that the remaining—up to 222—early learning and childcare centres will be considered when the childcare market has settled and based on the experience of the priority centres. But—notwithstanding efforts to discern what it really means, in discussions with the minister and in estimates—that does not give us a great deal of clarity about where the commitment is going. We have also been pursuing questions about a lack of childcare vacancy data, and those questions are on the record in estimates as well.
So, despite these gaps, these holes, if you like, in the childcare policy area, we do support these amendments in the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care) Bill 2009, and we do hope that it foreshadows a more effective and responsible approach by the government to child care in Australia. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHILD CARE) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2009-06-18,"—I thank Senator Payne for her contribution and the support for the legislation. In reply I would only make one point: I think there has been enormous turmoil in the sector as a result of the collapse of ABC childcare services, and that has had a huge impact, I think, on planning in and management of the sector. I think that highlights the foolishness of allowing one provider to get such a share of the market over the last 10 years. An argument I used to have with Senator Newman when she was the minister and I was the shadow minister for this area was that allowing that market domination meant that when that company collapsed the impact on the industry would be huge. Particularly given that child care is almost wholly subsidised by Commonwealth government revenues in one form or another, I think it is important that that market structure be closely measured. But I do appreciate Senator Payne’s contribution and the support of the chamber for the bill.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2009-06-18,"—I rise today to speak on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Australian Apprentices) Bill 2009 and indicate that the opposition will be supporting this legislation. This bill seeks to exempt apprenticeship incentives paid to apprentices from treatment as assessable income for taxation, social security and veterans affairs purposes. These amendments ensure that apprentices retain the entire amount of the financial incentives paid to them, and this brings these new payments into line with the taxation treatment afforded to previous incentives, which we support.
The first of these payments is the Skills for Sustainability for Australian Apprentices. This is a pilot program which is welcomed by the opposition. It is aimed at encouraging apprentices to undertake sustainability related training. At the completion of a required level of training, a payment of $1,000 will be granted. As a pilot program touching on an area of training that has been discussed for some time, its introduction is welcomed by the opposition. We are very keen to see how it develops.
The second payment is the Tools for Your Trade incentive. This is not a new incentive as such; it simply combines three existing incentives into one. There may be some merit, indeed, in combining the three incentives. However, these particular payments under this new incentive are not set to be payable until 1 January 2010. What happens to apprentices who commence between 12 May 2009 and 1 January 2010? Will they be eligible for the new Tools for Your Trade incentive? Or will they simply fall through the gaps and miss out? We have had no clarification from the government; they have indeed failed to provide certainty for apprenticeship incentives over this period of time.
We need to be encouraging and supporting apprentices to remain in their apprenticeships, and to be encouraging and supporting employers in that. The opposition has been vocal in its support for small business and apprentices during this time of economic downturn. The opposition leader in his budget-in-reply speech put a proposal to bring forward the incentives for employers for traditional trades into the first two years of the apprenticeship—a move that would help cash flows at a time when employers need that assistance most. But unfortunately the government has made the situation for businesses and apprentices even more uncertain by abolishing the apprenticeship training vouchers—vouchers worth up to $1,000; vouchers the coalition government introduced in the 2007 federal budget to help apprentices pay for their training. Clearly the Rudd government has broken its 2007 election policy commitment to retain all existing subsidies and payments to apprentices.
Whilst the coalition supports this bill and the exemption of these payments from assessable income for taxation purposes, not commencing the Tools for Your Trade incentive until 1 January 2010 is potentially excluding a large group of apprentices. The situation of this group of apprentices is a concern for the coalition. Across the board we have seen this year’s federal budget do little to directly support employers and their apprentices. There is no extra money for apprentices. The merger of current incentives is, we believe, just an attempt to make people believe there is a new incentive. At a time of unemployment uncertainty and economic downturn, the opposition are disappointed that the government has taken $197 million from the pockets of apprentices. The government is giving with one hand and taking back with the other. Although the opposition do have a number of concerns, we will be supporting this legislation.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2009-06-18,"—Sorry, Mr Acting Deputy President. I was actually trying to get an answer to Senator Fifield’s main question—putting aside the rhetorical contribution at the end. I am pleased to inform the Senate that there are transitional arrangements being put in place that will not disadvantage those persons who come on between May and the start of the new combined system in January. I am advised that those transitional arrangements will take care of their interests and ensure that they get the advantage of the new arrangements. With that, I thank Senator Fifield and the Senate for their support for the bill and express my thanks for the contributions to this debate.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2009-06-18,"—I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 3) Bill 2009. This bill was introduced on 14 May and contains various technical aspects amending the tax law. It consists of four schedules. The opposition will be supporting its passage through the Senate. I will briefly mention the schedules.
Schedule 1 will set the GST adjustment factor for the 2009-10 income year at two per cent. Earlier this year the government legislated for a reduction of that factor in light of the global financial crisis. The schedule we are looking at today merely continues this reduction for the 2009-10 income year. Under the PAYG instalment system certain taxpayers calculate the PAYG instalment amounts according to the GDP adjustment factor. The factor is determined using the nominal rate of GDP growth between the last two years. It would have been nine per cent for the 2009-10 income year. That means taxpayers would be required to pay PAYG amounts that are nine per cent above their income from the previous year. So this schedule sets the GDP adjustment factor for income year 2009-10 at two per cent, reflecting the forecast increase in the CPI. Of course we welcome this schedule but do believe that much more can be done to help small businesses.
Schedule 2 will allow entities that voluntarily register for GST to align their reporting of PAYG with their GST reporting. This measure was announced by the previous coalition government to reduce compliance costs for eligible taxpayers, so I am very pleased that the government has decided to legislate this measure. It will reduce the compliance burden on entities that voluntarily register for GST by allowing them to report GST and PAYG together on an annual basis, which will allow for greater administrative efficiency.
Schedule 3 makes some technical amendments to the petroleum resource rent tax regime. The measures in schedule 3 were announced by the previous coalition government in 2007-08. In last year’s budget the current government announced that it would proceed with the measures, with an effective date of 1 July 2008. So, technically speaking, schedule 3 will introduce a functional currency rule into the petroleum resource rent tax regime along similar lines to the functional currency rule used for income tax.
Schedule 4 is similar to those seen in many tax laws amendment bills. It amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to update the deductible gift recipient list to include three new entities: the Royal Institution of Australia, Diplomacy Training Program Ltd and the Leeuwin Ocean Adventure Foundation Ltd. We are very pleased to support efficiencies and amendments to the tax system that deal with the administration of tax. It assists taxpayers and it assists the administration of the tax system more broadly. With those words I commend this bill to the Senate.",SENATE,"<title>

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2009-06-18,"—I do not propose to speak for all that long on the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 3) Bill 2009, but I would like to address a couple of comments to schedule 3 of the bill, which deals with petroleum oil and gas resources, which obviously have quite a degree of significance in Western Australia and for the nation as a whole. The amendments that I wish to address are the ones that are specifically targeted at giving oil and gas explorers tax concessions, enabling them to get into deeper water and to get into smaller and more marginal oil and gas deposits, which is essentially what it is starting to look like in the North West Shelf and certainly in the Browse Basin. The explorers have proved up most of the large gas resources in that part of the world and are now essentially heading into deep water to look for the smaller and more marginal oil and gas reservoirs.
The comments that I want to make really go to why exactly these amendments are being proposed. I should say at the outset that the Greens will be supporting this bill but want to put some comments very clearly on the record as to what the bill indicates is actually going on, because it is the tip of a pretty serious iceberg. Why would we want to encourage, through tax concessions—which have impacts on the broader economy—getting into deeper water to explore for smaller and more marginal oil and gas reserves? The reason is that we are running out of those resources not just in the North West Shelf, not just in Australia or Bass Strait but around the world. These reserves are running out. We have had a pretty good idea since the 1950s and 1960s of the planet’s oil reserves, and we are starting to get a much clearer idea now of the finite nature of gas reserves as well. It is not that we are getting down to the last barrel or the last drop of oil and gas, but we are reaching the point where growth will be unable to continue and we will need to deal with depletion, with less every year instead of more every year. We have built the kind of economy that does not handle that sort of thing very well.
What we are seeing here and what this bill reflects is really a symptom of the worldwide scramble to chase ever-smaller and more marginal oil and gas fields. There are two separate issues here that arise from the same cause but that are about to catch Australia in a very serious vice. They both rest on the economic model that dominates thinking on this issue, which is that we must liquidate our hydrocarbon assets as rapidly as possible as cheaply as possible, that we must get them out of the ground, sold and dumped into the sky just as rapidly as technology and tax breaks will allow and essentially that we must liquidate or asset-strip Australia’s reservoirs of hydrocarbons as quickly as we can.
There are two consequences that flow from this; most obviously, the first one is climate change. My dear friend and colleague in the Western Australian parliament, Robin Chapple, in his inaugural speech about a fortnight ago, totalled up the consequences for Western Australia of the scramble for gas resources in the North West Shelf and across to the Browse Basin off the Kimberley. He said:
If we tabulated the projected—
greenhouse gas—
emissions from the two new Woodside Pluto trains, the Woodside Browse Basin project, the Dyno Nobel explosives plant, the current Gorgon two-train proposal, the Yarra Holdings explosive plant, the Apache Reindeer proposal and the BHP Scarborough gas development … emissions would rise by at least a further 21.5 million tonnes per annum, lifting Western Australian emissions to around 110.5 million tonnes per annum. This—
just on the rough calculations, based on publicly reported data by the companies themselves—
would increase WA’s greenhouse gas emissions to 90 per cent of our 1990 emissions.
This is while the country is meant to be trending down. He continues:
This does not include any of the proposed expansions articulated by Don Voelte, chief executive officer of Woodside, in yesterday’s Western Australian Business News.
So Australia is committing to a maximum increase under Kyoto, which was very strongly fought at those negotiations, of eight per cent above our 1990 levels, but apparently this does not seem to apply to Western Australia. The scramble to get the gas out of the ground and burn it as rapidly as we possibly can is leading to those very steep projections of greenhouse gas emissions. Apart from trying to undermine and weaken the government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme as radically as they can before it is put to a vote, I do not think the oil and gas companies have any idea at all how to address those emissions. So that is the first greenhouse gas consequence of this rather innocuous looking amendment, which seeks to enable and further push the boundaries of what is going on around the country.
The second consequence of course is peak oil, which was debated briefly on Tuesday and again by Senator Milne yesterday. We are starting to run out of these reserves. There are some very interesting corporate tactics going on in Western Australia at the moment about where the gas plants will be located, which reservoirs they will tap and where the pipelines will go. This really is part of the end game, because I think the companies have realised that this resource is not going to last for ever.
It is arguable at least that the parliament is starting to come to grips with climate change—20 years too late and with a mixture of genuine intent, reluctance, compromise and outright denial, but at least the parliament has begun that work of grappling with climate change. But I do not think we are even at first base with fossil fuel depletion. A debate that we had in here on Tuesday was around a fairly simple amendment—and I am glad Senator Conroy has joined us in the chamber—to just put in a little bit of scrutiny by the minister when signing off on large-scale national infrastructure projects that would have bearing on oil vulnerability, on fossil fuel vulnerability. Of course, that was defeated. I think we went down six votes against the rest of the chamber. I think that is something that we will probably come to regret, and I hope we do not see too many more of those votes in the near future. We are simply not facing up to and addressing this issue yet in this parliament.
There was a degree of interest in Western Australia, partly because of the hard work, again, that my Western Australian Greens colleagues have put in in state parliament over many years. We also had a planning minister, Alannah McTiernan, who was awake to the issues of peak oil and who did quite a bit of work within the Western Australian government in trying to shift the priorities—the spending priorities and the planning priorities—to at least begin to address the issue that fossil fuels, on which our economies are based, are finite and will eventually and perhaps in the very short term become extraordinarily expensive. So we did see some moves in Western Australia, but effectively they have been snuffed out, and there has been no such work done in the Australian parliament, as far as I am aware. A couple of years ago the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport handed down a very good report, with strong involvement by Senators Milne and Siewert, but nothing has arisen from that as far as I have been able to tell.
The Australian Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas, which is an offshoot of a large and reputable international organisation based in Sweden, points out that a growing number of estimates of the date of peak oil—that is, the halfway point where the economy needs to deal with less every year rather than more—cluster around 2010 to 2015, and there are actually estimates that say that the age of global cheap oil reserves has in fact passed already and that the only thing that is masking that price signal is what is going on in the world economy at the moment; those things, I suspect we all hope, will pass.
There are a couple of pretty sensible recommendations in the paper that I am reading from here, which is an appendix to a study that was done by Bruce Robinson and Sherry Mayo for the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas. They made several pretty common-sense recommendations about what governments could be doing, and I would ask any people in here today whether they can identify whether the government is doing any of these things at all:
Issue repeated credible warnings that oil shortages are approaching us. Advise the community openly of the various estimates of the timing and—
probable—
impacts of peak oil.
If that has been going on, I have clearly missed it.
Engage the community, through participatory democracy, to create practical, equitable options and countermeasures, and to select preferred steps.
None of that is occurring.
Dismantle the many “perverse polices” that subsidise heavy car use …
We are embedding these perverse policies—or, at least, the government is seeking to embed or entrench some of these policies—in the CPRS, which will favour private motor transport over public transport for three years.
Instigate policies, taxes and pricing regimes that encourage frugal use of fuel …
There is not a great deal of that going on either.
… Smart-Card personal fuel allocation system.
That is not under any kind of active consideration.
… nationwide “individualised marketing” travel demand management campaigns—
for both urban and rural regions. I would like to point out that TravelSmart, which originated in Western Australia, has been rolled out to a limited extent around the country, but it is getting by on the smell of an oily rag. It is doing incredibly important work to complement the work that non-government organisations do, but it is the kind of thing that would need to be scaled up quite rapidly.
Divert infrastructure funding to less oil-dependent urban structure and transport options.
I think the government would probably argue that we saw the first hint of that in the last budget, where we have started to see some Commonwealth investment in public transport options, which we have obviously been pushing for for a long time, and we saw investment in the stimulus package owing to negotiations with the Greens on cycle paths and public transport, so there are the beginnings of some of these turning points, but it is not systematic. It is haphazard and it is driven, I think, more by the media cycle than by any deep understanding of just how vulnerable we are to an oil shock.
One of the other points Bruce Robinson and Sherry Mayo raise is about prioritising access to remaining oil and gas supplies and quarantining them, because our food at the moment is entirely dependent on cheap fossil fuel. So they suggest:
Priority access to remaining oil and gas supplies must—
be—
provided for food production and distribution and other essential services.
People working in priority jobs where public transport is impractical, such as night shifts at hospitals and crucial infrastructure roles, should receive special consideration. If the Commonwealth government is undertaking this sort of analysis of priority access to remaining oil and gas supplies, I would be delighted to hear about it, but I suspect that this work is not really going on. I asked Defence about this in estimates hearings in February, and they told us that they are an enormous consumer of oil and gas but that they were not actually aware of whether they will have any special call on these resources in the event of an oil shock, which I thought was interesting. The paper says:
Remote indigenous communities will have special needs.
Reviewing the oil vulnerability of our communities, sector by sector and industry by industry, is not occurring. The last point that Bruce Robinson and Sherry Mayo raise is the idea of an oil depletion protocol, and I do not know that that has had a great deal of debate in here. Unless the Greens raise it, it just seems to be falling on deaf ears. An oil depletion protocol would establish a small levy, which would escalate, to account for the transition away from fossil fuel dependence as oil depletion hits.
I do not think we are seeing any of these sorts of things. The lead minister on this issue, I was told earlier in the week, is Minister Martin Ferguson. I think it is really high time that we heard from this minister what exactly the Commonwealth government’s strategy for oil depletion and vulnerability to oil shocks actually is. It is very easy to come to the conclusion that we are flying blind and that there is nobody really paying close attention to this issue in such a way that you could at least argue that climate change is now being dealt with.
We will be supporting the bill with those comments on the record, but just with an eye to the fact that what we are doing here is enabling the brief extension of the age of cheap fossil fuels. One day, I suggest, we will be looking back and wondering why we did not have our eyes open to this issue, which has been pretty clearly coming down the line for a long period now.",SENATE,"<title>

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2009-06-18,"—I thank all of those who have contributed to debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 3) Bill 2009. A number of issues have been raised by Senator Ludlam, and I would like to address them as best I can. The policy rationale for the offshore exploration incentive is to encourage firms to explore in high-cost, high-risk frontier areas. Without this incentive, firms will place even greater emphasis on exploring around existing discoveries or more accessible areas. The offshore exploration incentive is a modest concession for two reasons. First, the incentive is confined to the petroleum resource rent tax. This means that firms only benefit from the incentive if they have an existing offshore petroleum project paying PRRT or develop a new petroleum project which is subject to PRRT sometime in the future. Second, the exploration permit areas eligible for the incentive may only constitute a maximum of 20 per cent of exploration permit areas released in a year. For the 2009 offshore acreage release, the proposed number of exploration permits eligible for the incentive is six, compared with the total number of permits released, 33. I hope that answers many of your questions, Senator Ludlam. I thank the chamber for its indulgence.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2009-06-18,"—The coalition supports this amendment to the Social Security Act to assist with the transition to digital television for households eligible for assistance. The measure was announced as part of the recent budget in a package of measures targeted at regional areas in Victoria, South Australia and Queensland. These of course will be the first regions where the analog signal will be switched off under the government switch-over timetable, commencing in Mildura in the first six months of next year.
The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Digital Television Switch-over) Bill 2009 amends the Social Security Act to allow for eligible households to be identified for the purposes of the proposed assistance measures. These households include those where one or more residents are in receipt of the maximum rate of the age pension, disability support pension, carer payment, DVA service pension or income support supplement. The assistance is described as ‘practical, in-home assistance’.
Though no detail is provided in the bill, the department confirmed during budget estimates that the assistance would include a high-definition digital set-top box, delivered and installed; any necessary cabling in the home; and some instruction on how to use the set-top box. During questioning at Senate estimates, the department advised that they are currently putting together tender documents for the rollout of the assistance in Mildura, the first place for the switch-off, where they estimate that there are approximately 3½ thousand eligible households. They anticipate one tenderer to source the boxes, contact eligible households and arrange installation of the equipment. We trust that the department will ensure that the successful tenderer or tenderers approach the task with what will need to be the appropriate sensitivities in relation to these social security recipients.
Discussion at estimates also—and properly—touched on how any potential to abuse this assistance package is minimised, and we encourage the government to ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in place to protect the integrity of the package and ensure it successfully reaches its target audience. The coalition supports the government’s commitment to protecting personal information, particularly in relation to the arrangements with contractors delivering this assistance.
The coalition has long been calling for the government to provide certainty for viewers as this switch-over deadline rapidly approaches. For eligible households in Mildura, such as pensioners, this measure will provide some certainty about their capacity to access and utilise the equipment needed to view a digital picture. I note and draw to the Senate’s attention that, if the eligible viewer does not own the establishment, they will not receive assistance in relation to cabling and the antenna. While I understand the motive behind that decision, I think it is something that the government will have to monitor to ensure that eligible social security recipients are not inadvertently denied the opportunity to access a digital signal when the analog is switched off.
That is, of course, only one of many aspects required for certainty for all regions as they approach the switch-over. There is still some significant uncertainty in these regional communities, particularly in my state of South Australia but also in Victoria and Queensland, about their ability to receive a digital signal and the steps they need to take to ensure that they are not left behind in relation to the switch-over. While supporting this bill, we continue to encourage the government to provide further detail to regional communities in these states, the first to be affected by the switch-over, about their ability to receive a digital signal.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION SWITCH-OVER) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2009-06-18,"—The opposition will not oppose the Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009, subject to the Senate agreeing to an amendment that we have circulated in the chamber. Essentially, while there is broad support in the health community for the establishment of Health Workforce Australia, there is serious concern about the lack of quality of this piece of legislation. It does not contain any detail—and, as we all know, the devil very often is in the detail. It is not based on a sufficient degree of consultation—yet again, here is the issue of a lack of consultation. There is a serious concern that, in the way the legislation is currently drafted, it is unclear as to whether its purpose is for Health Workforce Australia to cut across the roles and responsibilities of professional colleges and other organisations responsible for the accreditation of clinical education and training for health professionals. There are no supporting regulations in place yet. There is a deliberate lack of involvement by the government of medical and health professionals in the proposed governance of Health Workforce Australia.
Even government senators share many of those concerns. There is a very insightful report by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, and I commend in particular the comments made by Senators Boyce and Adams. They are very, very insightful comments indeed. Even in the chair’s draft of the report, a number of concerns are raised, and I draw them to the attention of the Senate. The report said:
… many still expressed some concerns relating to the Bill, especially the composition of the Board and committees that would ensure that the views of a broad cross-section of stakeholders are heard; and the possibility for the HWA—
Health Workforce Australia—
to interfere with independently accredited education and training standards.
Incidentally, the opposition will move an amendment to deal with that second issue to remove doubt and make absolutely sure that that is not going to happen as a result of this bill.
The chair of the committee, in her report, put the proposition that if the consultations offered by the department were undertaken then there would be no real issue with proceeding with the legislation. But that is a big ‘if’. It is really saying: ‘Trust us; we’re from the government. We’re going to fix this in consultations.’ Why was it not fixed before this legislation came to the Senate? Why are we presented with a piece of legislation that does not have any of the detail and about which there is significant concern out there in the health community and then just told: ‘Take us on trust. All of the things that are wrong with this bill we’re going to fix afterwards?’ To be honest, I do not think that is good enough. The government ought to seriously reflect on whether that is an appropriate way of going about it.
In the amendment that we will be moving in the committee stage, we will ask for the Senate to agree with the proposition that it needs to be made absolutely clear that the functions of Health Workforce Australia do not include responsibility for accreditation of clinical education and training—for example, accreditation of individual health professional courses—and that the regulations when they come, as they have not been provided yet, must not confer on Health Workforce Australia responsibility for accreditation of clinical education and training.
From the opposition’s point of view, it is absolutely essential that we include that particular provision in the bill that is passed by the Senate to ensure that there is no doubt as to what our intentions are in passing this legislation. We would be very concerned if a very obscure piece of legislation without much detail could then be used as a vehicle to do things that we never envisaged would happen when we were debating the legislation.
I draw your attention to the evidence provided during the inquiry, for example by Ms Magarry of Universities Australia, who noted:
Our concern is that the bill does not currently provide any substantive detail on the powers and responsibilities of Health Workforce Australia  …
Professor White of the Clinical Placements Advisory Group of Universities Australia said:
… it is the lack of clarity in the bill, the lack of information and detail in the bill, that is of concern in relation to governance but also in relation to the structure and the way in which the organisation will interact with clinical placements per se.
The Australian Medical Council said:
We are not sure what the relationship will be between the bodies that currently fulfil a function related to clinical training and something like Health Workforce Australia.
I am quoting quite extensively from the minority report of Senators Boyce and Adams, a very high quality report, which said:
This uncertainty made many of the professional organisations concerned that, because of its relative size and dominance by Government representatives, HWA would seek to replace the sector’s existing and highly respected clinical training and accreditation standards. …
This clearly is a move towards centralisation, with the inherent risk of a one-size-fits-all approach. When you move towards centralisation from where there currently is a very diversified approach there is a serious risk that important issues will fall between the cracks. I do not think the government has seriously thought through all of these issues. We hope that the chair of the community affairs committee is justified in her confidence and the quality of consultation after the legislation has been considered by parliament is going to be better than the quality of consultation that took place before this legislation was considered by parliament.
As a general point, I think it is absolutely incredible that anybody would believe that, once this legislation is passed and the government is off the hook as far as support from parliament is concerned, the government will be more engaging and constructive in its approach to consultation than it has been while still seeking the support of the parliament. With those few remarks, I flag that the opposition will be moving an amendment and that our support is contingent on this amendment being passed by the Senate today.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH WORKFORCE AUSTRALIA BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-06-18,"—The Australian Greens believe that an effective healthcare system is dependent upon a skilled and well-resourced workforce. We believe in health funding that supports preventive care and health promotion, multidisciplinary teams and networks, and co-located services. We have championed the need for increases in student places, be they in the medical, dental or nursing schools. We have also called for allied health courses, to address the shortage of health professionals, and commensurate funding for staffing. We believe it is important that we see improvements in facilities to ensure high-quality teaching and mentorship programs. We are also keen to see matters addressed around the planning for Australia’s health workforce and we are concerned that this has been hampered by little or no coordination or leadership, which has created a desperate shortage of appropriately skilled and qualified health practitioners.
Given these circumstances, the Greens pay tribute to the hard work and dedication of all those who have participated and continue to participate in the delivery of health care in this country. Our healthcare workforce provide us with an excellent health service, under extremely difficult circumstances in many cases, and we believe they should be commended. In November 2008 the Council of Australian Governments signed off on what the government calls the ‘historic’ $1.6 billion health workforce package. With $1.1 billion of Commonwealth funding and $539.2 million from states and territories, it does in fact represent a substantial investment in the health workforce. This investment should improve health workforce capacity, efficiency and productivity. We hope it will do this by improving clinical training arrangements, increasing postgraduate training places for medical graduates, improving health workforce planning across Australia and enhancing training infrastructure, particularly in regional and rural areas.
A significant part of the COAG package is the establishment of Health Workforce Australia to produce more effective, streamlined and integrated clinical training arrangements and to support workforce planning and policy. The Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009 establishes Health Workforce Australia and implements the majority of the COAG health workforce initiatives. This bill specifies the functions, governance and structure of Health Workforce Australia. It is proposed that it will enable the health ministers to provide directions to Health Workforce Australia and should require Health Workforce Australia to report to the health ministers. We understand that Health Workforce Australia will be responsible for funding, planning and coordinating undergraduate clinical training across all health disciplines, and we expect it should also support clinical training supervision and health workforce research and planning—planning being a very important role. It should also provide funding for simulation training and provide advice to health ministers on relevant national workforce issues.
Under the governance of Health Workforce Australia we hope to see a greater capacity to ensure better value for money for these workforce initiatives and a more rapid and substantive progression of the necessary policy and planning initiatives. These are critical pathways to an improved health workforce and we welcome them. We think it is important in the process of establishing Health Workforce Australia that the role of existing health professions and educational institutions should be acknowledged. We have received assurances from the Minister for Health and Ageing that the invaluable knowledge of existing stakeholders will not be lost amid the expected broad changes to workforce planning structures and authority. We agree with the Australian Nursing Federation that ‘cutting out those who both professionally and industrially have the best interests of their professions and their consumers at the forefront of our minds’ would be a mistake. We note concerns raised by key stakeholders during the committee inquiry that this agency should not usurp the functions of accredited agencies or universities in relation to clinical training accreditation. Again we have received assurances from the minister that further clarification about the extent of the remit of Health Workforce Australia in accreditation will become evident when we get to see the draft of the regulations.
We want to see greater consistency around matters of data collection within the health system. We are all aware of the difficulties experienced in data collection. Historically, it has been a spasmodic and unreliable area of health management. We hope that Health Workforce Australia will create a new culture of timely and uniform information gathering. Every issue that is related to health that we talk about in this place has had problems with access to and collection of data, so this is particularly important. Health Workforce Australia provides a national focus to the provision of health care, and with this come significant changes to authority, hierarchies and power. We have received assurances from the minister that these definitions and the impact they have on engagement with existing stakeholders will again be clarified in the regulations. With the promise of $1.6 billion in funding, it is not hard to envisage that, as the AMA has stated, Health Workforce Australia ‘will be able to significantly impact on the standards of medical education in Australia’. A comprehensive strategy to address workforce shortages has been much needed, and we hope that this will be just a part of a significant commitment to the delivery of health care in this country.
The issue in this legislation, as in many bits of legislation we see pass through this place, is that a lot of it is delivered through the regulations. It is imperative that those regulations be right. Of course, regulations are a disallowable instrument. I understand the regulations will be going to COAG. We will seek assurances from government, hopefully in the minister’s summing-up speech, that in fact stakeholders will get to be engaged and will be consulted in the generation and development of the regulations before it goes to COAG. I am sick of regulations coming into this place and us being told that we cannot alter them because they have already been to COAG. It is necessary for the government to ensure that stakeholders are consulted before the regulations go to COAG, because I do not want to see disallowable instruments come in here and be rejected. If the proper consultation does not happen, that is what will happen in this place. We seek assurance from government during this debate that there will be consultation with all stakeholders around those key regulations. Once those assurances have been given, the Greens will be supporting this legislation.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH WORKFORCE AUSTRALIA BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2009-06-18,"—The coalition takes the view on the Health Workforce Australia Bill 2009 that we have been assured by the minister, by the department and by all governmental witnesses that there is no intention whatsoever for the developing Health Workforce Australia to take over the accreditation roles of the various health professional and medical organisations in Australia. In our view, if that is the case then there is no reason why this cannot be spelt out very clearly in the bill. Our greatest concern is that, given the size of this organisation and given that the majority of its representatives will come from federal and state health departments, there is a strong likelihood that over time this organisation will not only want to look at the training and education that is necessary for health professionals but also start having views about what that actually should look like—what sort of training it would be and what sort of accreditation it would finally have. There will be a strong push for this organisation to start to set all the rules, to decide how long a course should be and to decide what constitutes a reasonable level of skills in profession after profession. The AMA, all of the universities, the deans of the medical colleges and numerous other groups have given us evidence about their very strong concerns about the centralising tendency that this legislation could ultimately lead to.
In our view, this is the most flawed aspect of this bill. We certainly need some national health workforce planing; the states have not proved capable of doing that. But to give over to those same states the power to decide what constitutes a reasonable level of education and training before people can practise as doctors, surgeons, nurses and many other health professionals is in our view a very poor way of attempting to cope with the very serious workforce issues in this area. I believe that we need the assurance of this amendment to go into the legislation so that we can confidently say to our health professionals that the current very high and respected standard of Australia’s health workforce will be maintained and will not be overrun by state health departments and state public hospitals seeking to cut corners and save money. This tendency is quite possible and certainly must be resisted.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2009-06-18,"—My question is to the Minister for Employment Participation, Senator Arbib. Now that a spokesperson for the former Minister for Employment Participation has confirmed that there were a series of phone calls between one tenderer and the former minister’s office in the lead-up to the decision on the $4.9 billion tender for employment services, will the minister urgently establish a full and independent inquiry into this most serious matter?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Employment</title>,Questions Without Notice,24,1,question

Has the probity adviser examined the documentation of the details of the approaches of tenderers to the former Minister for Employment Participation?

"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-18,"—Let me point out once more to Senator Fifield that the independent external probity adviser was satisfied that at all stages the assessment process that was followed by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations met all requirements. As the opposition well knows, the process was conducted at arm’s length from government at all times. The communication referred to in the question was sent to the minister’s office well after the process had been conducted. Any other communication prior to the outcome of the tender had nothing to do—I repeat: nothing to do—with the purchasing exercise. Mission Australia have every right to feel deeply aggrieved by any suggestion to the contrary, Senator Fifield.
The independent external probity adviser said that in all stages its involvement took the form of: advice to the department on the development of appropriate processes supporting the implementation of the tender process arrangements, in particular advice on best practice; advice on preparation and release of the exposure draft and request for tender in August; signing off on all guidelines used in the evaluation and assessment of the tender responses process; briefings and advice on probity and communication matters related to the tender; delivery of probity briefings and/or participation in meetings as a probity representative; and attendance at all meetings where the department was considering business allocations.

—I rise on a point of order on relevance, Mr President. The question specifically asked about advice in the last 24 hours. The documents to which the minister is referring were produced before the latest revelation. The question is in relation to advice received in the last 24 hours.
—Mr President, on the point of order: the difficulty we always get into is that the minister is answering the question and is relevant to the question by dealing in the answer with the advice that he has in respect of the matter. It is not the case that if you do not like the answer being given to the question then you can object to it, or if the answer that they are being given is not the one they want. That is not a point of order. I respectfully submit, Mr President, there is no point of order in respect of this. The minister is answering in relation to the question on the matter of advice.

This is Senator Fifield on an absolute fishing expedition. There is no case for the former minister to answer whatsoever.

Can I inform the Senate that I am advised the school has been granted $250,000 in Primary Schools for the 21st Century for a multipurpose hall, not for a ‘shed’. In Queensland, the standard hall size for a small school such as Mulgildie is 69 square metres and is a fully enclosed structure with a 22 square metre covered veranda. If the school has funds left over after the multipurpose hall is built, those funds can be used for associated works within the Building the Education Revolution guidelines. It is also important to remember that the project cost quoted is not just for the four walls to lock-up stage. It also includes things like landscaping and the fitting out of the hall.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Building the Education Revolution Program</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,26,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2009-06-18,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment Participation (Senator Arbib) and the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Senator Carr) to questions without notice asked by Senator Fifield and Senator Mason today relating to employment services and to funding for schools’ infrastructure.
You would think that if a government was spending $14.3 billion on schools, the school communities would be happy. But they are not. In fact they are outraged. The people that really matter here—the parents, teachers and indeed even the education unions—say the Building the Education Revolution program is fast unravelling. The government thought they could spend $14.3 billion and the next election would come to them. They thought that the stakeholders would be docile and no-one would care. The stakeholders do care. The kids, their parents, teachers and even the unions think this project is a waste of money. That is the problem.
I very, very rarely quote the Australian Education Union but today they called for a review:
The Australian Education Union today called for a transparent review of the implementation of the Building the Education Revolution (BER) program to examine issues that have arisen with the first rounds of implementation.
The AEU Federal President, Mr Gavrielatos, said the review should investigate, among other things, whether state and territory governments are maintaining their own effort in school maintenance and capital and the extent to which they are charging administration costs and if costs are being inflated.
“It is about ensuring that in the interests of our students and school communities, we realise the full potential of this significant investment in school infrastructure and the full economic stimulus benefit,” he said.
Even the union movement is not happy. Even they know this is not a good spend.
Who is happy? The federal government are happy because there are some photo opportunities. They are really happy. Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard put on the hard hats and the high-visibility vests and ran around with bulldozers. The federal government is pretty happy because it makes for great photo opportunities. I understand that even state governments are pretty happy because they are creaming off the largesse. They are thinking, ‘Great. We will not have to look after state schools because the Commonwealth government is going to foot the bill.’ The only people happy here are the federal government and the state government. The kids, their parents, the teachers and even the education union think this whole project is a dog.
It is a strange thing. There were two principal aims of the Building the Education Revolution program that the government put forward. Firstly, it was to create jobs. And yet they did not even ask how many jobs would be created by each individual project. That was not one of the conditions of attendance. Secondly, it was to enhance educational outcomes. But what have we learned over the last few days? We have learned that there is insufficient flexibility in Building the Education Revolution. This is not about schools getting what they want; this is about state bureaucrats giving to schools what they think they should have. And do not believe me; believe Mr Harry Grossek, the principal of Berwick Lodge Primary School. On page 2 of the Australian today he says:
Our option was a gymnasium complex, I was told. It didn’t matter that we already had a perfectly suitable gymnasium.
—It gets better.
—No, it gets worse; it gets much worse. He goes on to call them the ‘notorious templates’—that lovely whiff of central planning that I know Senator Carr loves—designed by state governments. So, in fact, there is insufficient flexibility in this scheme and, worse, there is overcharging. This is much more expensive than it should be. Mr Grossek goes on to say:
Furthermore, never have we been able to access any real cost figures for the now notorious templates. Independent valuations we obtained made a mockery of the—
department of education’s—
claims about the value of the templates. All could be built for embarrassingly lower costs than the notional figures.
What have we got here? We have a waste of money. We do not have the best spend at all. We do not even have a good spend; we have a shocking spend. This is the worst possible way to spend $14.7 billion. The Building the Education Revolution program is a shambles.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Building the Education Revolution Program</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,27,1,speech
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2009-06-18,"—I also rise to take note of the answers. I listened to the rhetoric from the other side of the chamber and I am absolutely gobsmacked that the senators on that side have the audacity to scream at government senators. I am referring to Senator Fisher from South Australia. All I could hear from her was the rant, ‘Jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs.’ I think that is absolutely wonderful, because it is a four-letter word that that side of the chamber really find offensive. We have been talking about that since November 2007; we are all about jobs. I wonder if Senator Fisher had the same passion for that four-letter word and ‘Jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs’ when she worked for former industrial relations minister Peter Reith.
I want to take this opportunity to quote a very fine example of the education revolution—the part about the government building infrastructure in schools. I must say that, of the electorates in Perth, I have not had one school, whether it be primary school, high school, religious school, private school or any other school, ring me and say that they are not happy with the government’s Building the Education Revolution. In fact, at every school I have gone to, whether to watch children working on their new computers or to open a new building, I was thanked profusely by not only the principals and the teachers but also the parents and citizens associations.
Here is an example. The Sunday Telegraph on 5 April this year had an article in relation to a quote obtained by Bobs Farm Public School in New South Wales for a building. The department provided Bobs Farm Public School with a quote. The school was told they could have the new classroom built for whatever amount of money it was that the department was quoting but, lo and behold, the school got another quote which came in substantially lower. I think it is important to note that the New South Wales Department of Education and Training looked into this quote to check it out. One must adhere to the basic business principle that you must always check the fine print.
When the education department went through the contract there were number of, I would say, important things that were missing from the quote. I will list what they are—and I notice the other side have all of a sudden gone quiet for some reason. The quote did not include any carpet. It did not include any foundations. It did not include a ceiling and—I hear the laughs coming but this next one is absolutely fair dinkum—the quote did not include any furniture. Not only that; it did not include connection to a sewerage system, stormwater drains or electricity. As part of the quote, there was absolutely no mention of site preparation. I am not a builder—and I am being serious about this; this did actually happen—but I have worked out that there are a few important things that you need if you are going to build a building. And there was no quote for demolition and sloping work. The quote did not include a railing on the balcony to stop children from falling off.
—In a school!
—Yes, in a school.
—Order! Senator Collins, you are in breach of standing orders, as you well know, standing over there. So I ask you to either take a seat or leave the chamber.
—I can concur with Senator Collins because it does sound unbelievable, but this is fair dinkum.

Senator Cash interjecting—

—The quote finished with a statement that the company—

Senator Cormann interjecting—

—It is important that everyone hears this, and I hope the senators opposite from Western Australia—
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I am not one who is sensitive to interjections, but Senator Cormann could do us the courtesy of taking his seat in the chamber if he is going to interject.
—I do uphold that point of order. I am sorry I did not hear the interjection; otherwise I would have made the comment myself.
—I hope that Senator Cormann and Senator Cash, the Liberal senators from Western Australia, listen very carefully to this. The quote finished with this, Mr Deputy President—and I am keeping a straight face as I am looking at you and quoting this: the building company recommended that the completed building be tied down. I kid you not! It needs to be tied down because it has no ceiling and has no foundations. It actually said that it should be tied down. Wonderful! A great place for children! The only building I know of that would need tying down is a tent—and I am quite happy to be corrected if Senator Cash or Senator Cormann can tell me of another building that you need to tie down.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2009-06-18,"—I also rise to take note of answers by Senator Arbib. The opposition’s concerns in relation to the Jobs Australia tender initially related to its design and efficacy, as Senator Arbib accurately quoted from the Senate hearing into the tender arrangements. Senator Arbib and I keep an eye on what each other says, and he was accurate in saying that that was my concern a week or so back. Our initial concern was principally that 100 per cent of provider services were put to tender, that the weighting for past performance was only 30 per cent, that many providers with great track records had lost contracts and that 47 per cent of job seekers have to find new providers and new case managers. They were our main concerns. The Minister for Employment Participation assured the Senate that all was well, that job seekers would be fine and that providers who lost work would be looked after. The minister cited in particular the Agency Adjustment Fund to assist those who had lost their tenders.
There is one problem with that: there was only ever funding for 34 organisations. Of that $3.5 million of funding allocated, there was funding for only 34 organisations. But we discovered in estimates that at that time 110 applications had already been received. The department has emailed the providers, helpfully telling them:
Dear Provider
Thank you for your application for funding …
The department received many more applications than anticipated. The assessment process is quite complex …
… This has meant that the original time line … is unable to be met.
It has been oversubscribed. There are far more providers than there are dollars to assist. So the minister’s assurance on that front was completely worthless.
But a greater concern was unearthed yesterday by Dr Southcott in the other place. He discovered that phone calls were placed between a tenderer and the former minister’s office during the probity period—during the tender process itself. Why is this of concern? You might think it is quite reasonable for a tenderer to make a few harmless inquiries of a minister’s office during a tender process. There is a document called the Communication protocol for dealing with existing service providers and tenderers, which states very specifically that there are:
Those who may be in positions that the public could perceive as having the power to influence the operation of the purchasing process …
The people identified in that position include ministers and their staff. This document is very clear. It says:
The website, Hotline and email address are the primary mechanisms for communications relating to purchasing matters. All persons, and in particular those who have been identified as being in positions of potential influence, are required to refer or direct any purchasing related enquiries to the Hotline, website or email address.
It goes further. It requires that:
details of any approaches by or on behalf of an individual Tenderer or Tenderers will be fully documented—
that is, fully documented by the person who receives the approach—and that:
communications or conduct suspected of involving a breach of the probity of the purchasing process or involving illegality will be investigated.
So it is quite clear from the communication protocol that the minister’s office was in breach.
The minister’s office put out a statement yesterday saying that the contact was ‘logistical in nature’ and therefore was not required to be referred to the department. Well, the protocol does not have an exemption for discussions of a logistical nature. The protocol says that if there is communication from a tenderer to a minister or to a minister’s office it needs to be documented; more than that, it needs to be advised to the probity adviser. It also says that any tenderer who approaches a minister or the minister’s office should be referred immediately to the hotline or the website. This was entirely inappropriate.
When the minister was asked today whether he had received any advice from the probity adviser in relation to this communication he refused to answer. There is only one thing to do in this situation, which is to call for a full, complete public inquiry, and Minister Arbib should do that today.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Building the Education Revolution Program</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,27,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2009-06-18,"—The Rudd government took a clear plan to the Australian people to reform the outdated, one-size-fits-all Job Network system. Those opposite are not interested in providing appropriate services for job seekers. The minister today in question time indicated that the independent external probity adviser gave an unqualified sign-off on the tender process. He said that on a number of occasions. But those opposite just do not get it.
The legacy of those opposite was a system bogged down with red tape and incapable of dealing with Australia’s chronic skills shortage, yet those opposite are happy to sit over there and take pot shots at the government over the new Job Services Australia, basically playing politics for politics’ sake. It is worth noting that at the end of the day it is those opposite who presided over a failing system for over 10 years and took the politically easy decision to roll over 95 per cent of business in the last tender of the Job Network in 2006, initiating no improvements. That is right—those opposite were too busy revelling in the resources boom, focusing on short-term, populist spending to help them get re-elected, to worry about making the tough decisions for the future prosperity of Australia.
On the other hand, on this side of the chamber we have a clear plan to reform the nation’s employment services by moving seven separate employment service programs into a one-stop shop which will more effectively assist job seekers to find work and keep work. The Rudd government is making a $4.9 billion investment in the new Job Services Australia program. That is a $1 billion increase which will offer job seekers a range of integrated services. The new integrated Job Services Australia will deliver more comprehensive and personalised assistance for job seekers, allowing them to gain new skills and become more job ready. In the current economic climate we are experiencing the greatest economic challenges since the Great Depression and, as we continue to see labour markets contract, it is imperative that we have a job services system that is adequately equipped to assist job seekers with training and development and, ultimately, finding work. After all, we have seen those opposite preside over 10 years of laziness and playing populist politics.
We have seen a chronic skills shortage develop in the Australian labour market. This has severely hampered the productivity of the Australian economy and has affected our ability to drive new growth. In fact, the former Minister for Employment Participation, the Hon. Brendan O’Connor, highlighted that unless something is done in the area of qualified workers we could be looking at a shortfall of up to 240,000 workers by 2016. Indeed, the legacy of those opposite is a bogged down employment service which helps neither businesses which require skilled workers nor job seekers themselves trying to gain the skills necessary for employment. That is why we have acted and from 1 July the Rudd Labor government will introduce more than 2,000 Job Services Australia sites across Australia. It is worth noting that that is up from the 1,800 which exist under the current system—200 more sites. These sites will provide more resources dedicated to the most disadvantaged job seekers, including those who are homeless. The new services will also develop the Employment Pathway Plan, which details the services tailored to a job seeker to better help them secure employment. In conjunction, we will also operate an Employment Pathway Fund, which will allow employment service providers to purchase goods and services a job seeker may need to help them tackle barriers to employment.
This government is committed to providing people with the appropriate skills; that is why the new Job Services Australia will have a renewed focus on work experience programs such as the Work for the Dole and Green Corps schemes, which provide job seekers with skills and experience to help them get jobs. We will also offer up to 18,900 small business training places under the Productivity Places Program to help address the skills shortage problem by ensuring job seekers are better trained and ready to work, as well as a $41 million Innovation Fund for projects that address barriers to employment for groups of highly disadvantaged job seekers. With a new, integrated one-stop shop for job seekers, Job Services Australia will provide better and more specialised services. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2009-06-18,"—I rise to take note of answers given by Senators Carr and Arbib in this chamber this afternoon, which related respectively to the school building program of some $14.7 billion and the employment services tender of some $4.9 billion, and to comment regretfully at the gross mismanagement of the expenditure of Australian taxpayer funds in both of these programs. Only today have we read of a very senior principal of one of Australia’s schools—one obviously towards the end of his career—who out of severe frustration has come out and drawn our attention to the bungling, bullying and dubious accounting practices of this school building program. One can only imagine his courage in so doing and in requesting so many of his colleagues to join him. He has drawn attention to the fact that the state authorities are hiving off vast sums of money. He draws attention to the fact that the funding of school capital programs in Australia is a state program and not a federal program.
Senator Carr drew attention to the question of educators. Why will this government not listen to educators who are pleading that these funds be spent on educational outcomes, not on gymnasiums and buildings upon which the Deputy Prime Minister can see a photograph or statue of herself? I draw the chamber’s attention to three such programs that I think these educators are calling on the government to fund. I can tell you the outcomes: they are programs that are being or have been cut. The first is a hearing and learning program. The cost? $2,000 per classroom throughout the north of Australia. Educators tell us one of the primary reasons why young kids do not learn is that they do not hear. Indigenous children are believed to have hearing problems of up to 70 per cent because of health problems. So we immediately see that this program of a very humble $2,000 per room—less than $1 million across the north of Australia—has been cut, and those seeking this funding heard that from the mouth of the Deputy Prime Minister herself.
We secondly hear of a program called Future Footprints, about which I sought information in Senate estimates hearings recently. It is a program that supports 160 Indigenous children in boarding schools in Perth. These are Western Australian and Northern Territory schoolkids heavily subsidised by the boarding schools.
—What’s this got to do with anything in question time?
—It is to do with the point that your colleague drew attention to expenditure and to educators, and I am drawing attention to what educators are saying they want this money to be spent on. This program, with $400,000 of expenditure per annum, is to be cut. It supports 160 students. Last year, 19 out of 19 participated at year 12. They all graduated. They have all gone on to higher education, training, employment or, in one case, an overseas Rotary exchange. The interesting thing about these two programs, of course, is that they allow—almost force—me to draw attention to the speech given by the Prime Minister in February last year, in which he made a plea for the closing of the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, said that we would try to halve the education gap, the numeracy gap and the employment gap and said that we would work together across the parliament to achieve these outcomes. He said that it was the time for a new approach to enduring problems. It certainly has been. The approach to these problems has been no funding.
In the few minutes left, I draw attention to the responses from Senator Arbib today, in which he told us that major changes were necessary because surveys indicated that the system was not working. Last week in the committee, I asked if any surveys of job seekers were conducted. The answer was no. Were any surveys of employers conducted? It would appear to me a very interesting scenario if in fact we do not know where this information came from. The tender committee, of course, had no employers, no service providers and no past job seekers.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2009-06-18,"—I present two government responses to committee reports, as listed at item 13 on today’s Order of Business. In accordance with the usual practice, I seek leave to have the documents incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The documents read as follows—

Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs


Personal Property Securities Bill 2008


Government Response


Recommendation 1

4.19         The committee strongly recommends that the Department reconsiders the balance between certainty of the law and the accessibility of the provisions with a view to:
simplifying the language of the exposure draft bill – for example, wording provisions clearly and limiting them to deal only with common circumstances;
simplifying the structure of the exposure draft bill – to minimise the cross‑referencing needed;
simplifying the terms used - for example instead of ‘tangible goods’ use the term ‘goods’ appropriately defined to ensure the full meaning needed for the reform is ascribed to the term; and
using overseas provisions as often as possible to allow overseas experience to provide guidance for the Australian model.

Government response:


Accepted. The Government will review the structure and language of the Bill.

Recommendation 2

4.27         The committee recommends that the commencement date for the scheme be extended by at least 12 months to May 2011 for the committee’s recommendations to be implemented and for advice from stakeholders to be taken into account before the content of the bill is finalised.

Government response:


Consider further. The Government will consider revising the timeframe for commencement of the PPS scheme in consultation with the States and Territories and, following these consultations, make an announcement about the timing of commencement.

Recommendation 3

4.35         The committee recommends that the bill include a requirement that the operation of the bill be reviewed three years after it commences in a process that includes extensive consultation with industry, governments, lawyers, consumers and academics.

Government response:


Accepted.


Recommendation 4

5.27 The committee recommends that the primary legislation for the personal property securities reform include the key privacy protections for individuals, including a prohibition on making the address details of any individual public.

Government response:


Accepted in substance. The Bill will be amended to clarify the information about individuals that may be included on the register and to better describe the key privacy protections provided to individuals. The Bill will make it clear that address details of individual grantors will not be included on the register. Accordingly, a prohibition on making address details public is not required.

Recommendation 5

5.33 The committee recommends that either:
a Privacy Impact Assessment be undertaken by a person or organisation that is independent from the government and who has experience in undertaking such assessments and the results of the assessment are made public, or
the Department’s Privacy Impact Assessment is reviewed by a person or organisation that is independent from the government and who has experience in undertaking such assessments, and the results of the review are made public.

Government response:


Accepted. A Privacy Impact Assessment will be undertaken by an appropriately qualified independent person or organisation. The assessment will be published on the Department’s website. Having regard to recommendation 4 of the minority report, this will occur within two months of the completion of the assessment.

Recommendation 6

5.34         The committee recommends that if any issues raised by the Office of the Privacy Commission in its submission are not considered as part of the Privacy Impact Assessment then these matters should be separately considered by the Attorney-General’s Department and a response to the issue be provided to the Office of the Privacy Commission in writing or made public.

Government response:


Accepted. The Privacy Impact Assessment will consider all issues raised by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in its submission to the Committee.

Recommendation 7

5.44         The committee recommends retaining the requirement for rights and duties to be exercised honestly and in a commercially reasonable manner. The intended scope of these requirements should be explained in detail in the bill’s explanatory memorandum.
5.45         The explanatory memorandum should particularly explain that the requirement to act in a commercially reasonable manner should not fetter or undermine the ability of parties with similar bargaining power to contractually agree about what constitutes commercially reasonable behaviour.

Government response:


Accepted. This Bill will be amended to make clear that the duty to act in a reasonably commercial manner applies only in relation to Chapter 4 of the Bill concerning the enforcement of security interests. The duty to act in a reasonably commercial manner will not apply to the extent that the parties have contracted out of the enforcement provisions of the Bill under section 154 of the Bill.

Recommendation 8

5.55         The committee recommends that the bill adopt existing international personal property security conflict of laws provisions, such as the New Zealand conflict of laws model, unless there is a particular reason to depart from those provisions.

Government response:


Accepted. The Government accepts that the Bill should include conflict of laws provisions. The New Zealand conflict of laws provisions have been criticised as being uncertain. To avoid uncertainty in the Bill, the Government will include conflict of laws provisions in the Bill based on the provisions at Appendix A to the Department’s submission to the Committee (the revised commentary to the Bill).

Recommendation 9

5.62         The committee recommends that the scope and content of the enforcement provisions of the exposure draft bill be reviewed by the Department with particular attention to ensuring that the provisions are comprehensive and adequate.

Government response:


Accepted. The Bill will be amended to provide enhanced sanctions for improper use of the register and to ensure the registrar can monitor and investigate suspicious register activity. Further consideration will be given to appropriate sanctions for misusing the register which may include civil and criminal penalties.

Recommendation 10

5.70         The committee recommends that consideration be given to improving the priority of an unperfected lessor as against unsecured or other unperfected interests in the goods.

Government response:


Accepted. The Government will, in consultation with stakeholders, consider the appropriate priority outcomes for unperfected lessors as against unsecured or other unperfected interests.

Recommendation 11

5.78         The committee recommends that the explanatory memorandum and the proposed education campaign adequately explain the purpose and effect of the draft intellectual property provisions, including disseminating the information to appropriately targeted international industries, organisations and stakeholders.

Government response:


Accepted.


Liberal Senators’ Dissenting Report

Liberal Senators wholly support recommendations 1, 2, 3 and 10 of the majority report.
Liberal Senators support in principle the majority recommendations except recommendation 7 (in relation to the commercially reasonable manner test).

Recommendation 1

1.10         In relation to consultation and education Liberal senators recommend that:
the government uses the committee report and the Liberal senators’ additional recommendations to undertake new consultation about the proposed reform;
the government should particularly identify stakeholders who are not yet engaged with the reform and educate them about the scope and significance of the proposals;
a considerably revised draft bill should be publicly released within six months of the date of this report;
stakeholders should be extensively educated and consulted about the revised exposure draft for three months from the release of the draft; and
a final exposure draft bill should be referred to the Senate within six months of the release of the revised draft bill requesting that the final exposure draft is referred to this committee for consideration accompanied by:
the proposed draft regulations; and
a report that outlines the key concerns raised with the government by stakeholders and the government’s response to those concerns and that identifies the differences between the newly referred bill and the November 2008 exposure draft bill.

Government response:


Accepted in part. The Government will carry out targeted consultation with stakeholders about changes to the Bill raised in the Committee’s report. However, further examination of the revised Bill by the Committee would not be consistent with ensuring the final text of the Bill is settled in time to allow stakeholders an adequate period to prepare to transition to the new PPS system. In order to provide certainty to stakeholders, the Government will progress development of the PPS Bill with a view to its passage through Parliament by the end of 2009 and will develop the new PPS register so that its main functionality is complete by May 2010.

Recommendation 2

1.12         Liberal senators recommend that the government table a report in Parliament on the first year of operation of the reform within 15 months of the commencement of the Act. The report should include the views of stakeholders, including representatives of industry, governments, lawyers, consumers and academics and the government’s response to these views.

Government response:


Not accepted. Reviewing the operation of the reform after only 12 months of operation would not provide useful data about the new PPS system. The Bill will be amended to require that the Government review the Bill after the new PPS system has been operating for three years.

Recommendation 3

1.15         Liberal senators recommend that the Privacy Impact Assessment identify key privacy protections which should be contained in the primary legislation.

Government response:


Accepted.


Recommendation 4

1.19         Liberal senators recommend that:
a Privacy Impact Assessment be undertaken by a person or organisation that is independent from the government and who has experience in undertaking such assessments; and
the Privacy Impact Assessment and the government’s response to it should be tabled in Parliament within 2 months of the date the Assessment is completed.

Government response:


Accepted in part. A Privacy Impact Assessment will be undertaken by an appropriately qualified independent person or organisation. The assessment will be made public within two months of its completion.

Recommendation 5

1.20         Liberal senators recommend that any issues considered in accordance with majority recommendation 6 and the government’s response to them should be tabled in a report to Parliament within 2 months of the date that the Privacy Impact Assessment is completed.

Government response:


Accepted in part. The Privacy Impact Assessment will consider all issues raised by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in its submission to the Committee. The assessment will be published on the Department’s website within two months of its completion.

Recommendation 6

1.27         Liberal senators recommend that the requirement to act in a
commercially reasonable manner be removed from proposed section 235 of the bill and be excluded from any future version of the reform.

Government response:


Accepted. The Government acknowledges the concerns expressed in the report about the operation of section 235 of the Bill as originally drafted. This Bill will be amended to make clear that the duty to act in a reasonably commercial manner applies only in relation to Chapter 4 of the Bill concerning the enforcement of security interests. The duty to act in a reasonably commercial manner will not apply to the extent that the parties have contracted out of the enforcement provisions of the Bill under section 154 of the Bill.

Recommendation 7

1.30         Liberal senators recommend that the government further considers the content of international conflict of laws provisions and incorporate into the bill either:
a simple and effective model of conflict of laws provisions based on an existing international model; or
the conflict of laws provisions at Appendix A to the Department’s submission.

Government response:


Accepted. The Government will include conflict of laws provisions in the Bill based on the provisions at Appendix A to the Department’s submission to the Committee (the revised commentary to the Bill).

Recommendation 8

1.33         Liberal senators recommend that the government strengthen the
proposed enforcement provisions with a focus on:
comprehensive and effective sanctions for improper use of the
register;
ensuring the registrar’s ability to inquire into suspect activity; and
the availability of civil and criminal action with appropriate penalties.

Government response:

Accepted. The Government will amend the Bill to provide enhanced sanctions for improper use of the register and to ensure the registrar can monitor and investigate suspicious register activity. Further consideration will be given to appropriate sanctions for misusing the register which may include civil and criminal penalties.

Recommendation 9

1.36         Liberal senators recommend that the government should identify any outstanding concerns about the intellectual property provisions of the draft bill and should outline the concerns and its response in its report to the Senate (as per Liberal senators’ recommendation 1(e)(ii)).

Government response:


Not accepted. See response to Liberal Senators’ recommendation 1. However, the Government will seek input from stakeholders about the intellectual property provisions in the Bill to address any outstanding concerns about the provisions.

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE RURAL AND REGIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRANSPORT SENATE COMMITTEE REPORT


Implementation, operation and administration of the legislation underpinning Carbon Sink Forests

On 26 June 2008, the Senate referred the following matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport for inquiry and report:
The implementation, operation and administration of the legislation underpinning Carbon Sink Forests and any related matters.
On 23 September 2008 the Senate Committee report, which included dissenting reports, was tabled in the Senate.
The Government has prepared a response to the Senate Committee report, including dissenting reports, in accordance with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Guidelines for the presentation of Government documents to the Parliament.
The Senate Committee report made nine conclusions:
The committee considers that the tax deductions for carbon sink forests under the Income Tax Assessment Act (1997)  represent a valuable policy addition that will promote greenhouse gas reductions.  The structures and processes outlined in the Act provide for a sensible legislative and administrative framework relating to the tax treatment around the establishment of forest carbon sinks.
The committee notes that other forms of greenhouse gas emissions reduction activities by industries are tax deductible.  The change in the tax treatment of carbon sink forests addresses this anomaly in the tax system.
The committee believes that the tax deductions will provide incentives for corporate investment into greenhouse gas abatement activities which represents an ideal opportunity to direct necessary capital to achieve positive environmental outcomes.
The new tax arrangements provide a short-term incentive to encourage early establishment of carbon sink forests that will contribute to a medium-term emissions target, while other options for delivering significant emissions reductions are further developed.  Carbon sink forests also contribute to the achievement of national policy objectives for sustainable natural resource management.
The committee considers that if Australia is to meet its carbon pollution reduction goals at least cost, the support of a viable carbon sink industry is important.  Appropriate taxation arrangements are one part of a range of measures needed to encourage the role of carbon sink forests in Australia’s carbon pollution reduction effort.
The committee recognises the benefits of relying on existing state and territory regulatory structures for the management of the impacts of carbon sink forests on the environment.  The committee has some concerns that in certain key areas, such as land clearance legislation, natural resource management and water sharing, some states and regions may not currently have in place appropriate regulations or plans to manage the impacts of carbon sink forests.  The committee notes that through the National Water Initiative, states and territories are committed to completing comprehensive water planning arrangements by 2011 and that COAG is currently seeking to accelerate the pace of this planning.  The committee also notes that under this process steps have been taken to ensure that those water systems under the greatest pressure receive early attention.  The committee considers that it would be desirable if a similar focus could be directed to regulation of land clearance and natural resource management.
More specifically, the committee notes the concerns raised in relation to the need to include ground water within water sharing plans.  The committee supports the inclusion of specific reference to ground water in the Guidelines.
The committee notes the significant support expressed during this inquiry for specific incentives to encourage the establishment of biodiverse forests.  The legislation as drafted does not distinguish between the type of forest planted and the committee is satisfied that it provides no disincentive for the plantation of biodiverse carbon sink forests.  The committee also notes that biodiversity considerations have been taken into account in the development of the Guidelines and that these should contribute to the establishment of carbon sink forests in conformity with good practice environmental and natural resource management frameworks.  The committee considers that any proposal to offer specific incentives for the establishment of biodiverse plantings must be considered within the context of existing environmentally focussed taxation incentives.
Finally, the committee welcomes the evidence received in relation to alternative options for terrestrial carbon stores, particularly in relation to perennial pasture cropping.  While there clearly is some work to be done to demonstrate the benefits of such as approach within a carbon trading scheme, the committee considers that the wider benefits of improved soil structures and the potential increases in productivity of such systems warrant further examination.  The committee considers that the government should request CSIRO to assess the data being accumulated from pasture cropping trials in Western Australia and New South Wales.
The dissenting report by Senators Milne, Joyce, Nash, Boswell and Heffernan made the following recommendations:
The guidelines should be mandatory regulations.
There should be incorporated into the regulation conditions which must be met before the tax deductions would apply, namely:
The carbon sink forests must be registered on the property title.
No native vegetation can be cleared for or converted to carbon sink forests.
Carbon sink forests should be biodiverse and cannot be harvested or cleared, and
No carbon sink forest can be established in the absence of a hydrological analysis including groundwater and interception, of the proposed area to be planted.
To avoid the destruction of rural communities and the displacement of food crops, prime agricultural land must be excluded from carbon sink plantings.
The dissenting report by Senator McGauran raised concerns including the potential for carbon sink forests to displace agriculture.

Government Response

The Government has considered the findings of the Senate Committee report and the concerns indicated in the dissenting reports.  In considering these matters, the Government has taken into account the nature of the issues raised, the objectives of the tax measure, implications for administration of the Income Tax Assessment Act (1997) and for taxpayers, and the extent to which the issues raised fall within the responsibilities of the Commonwealth.  The Government’s response to the issues raised is as follows.
The Government notes that the matters raised in the Senate Committee report were debated in the Senate on 1 December 2008.
Amendments to the Environmental and Natural Resource Management Guidelines
        The Government has amended the Environmental and Natural Resource Management Guidelines to address a number of the issues raised.
The guideline relating to establishing carbon sink forests based on regionally applicable best practice approaches for achieving multiple land and water environmental benefits has been amended to include specific reference to avoiding significant negative impacts on groundwater activity.  This addresses Conclusion 7 in the Senate Committee report.
A new paragraph under the guideline relating to the recognition and adherence to all government regulatory requirements has been added to include a requirement to comply with applicable state and territory, and local government land use planning legislation regarding the establishment of alternative land uses on agricultural land.  This addresses concerns raised in the dissenting reports related to the displacement of prime agricultural land for carbon sink forest establishment (Dissenting Report (Milne, Joyce, Nash, Boswell and Heffernan) Recommendation 3; Dissenting Report (McGauran)).
A new guideline has been added to include a requirement that legal rights concerning carbon sequestration in carbon sink forests be registered on the land title in accordance with applicable state government legislation.  This addresses concerns related to the registration of carbon sink forests on property title (Dissenting Report (Milne, Joyce, Nash, Boswell and Heffernan) Recommendation 2(a)).
Amended guidelines were registered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments on 10 December 2008, and took effect on 11 December 2008.
(b)   Other findings of the Senate Committee Report and the Dissenting Reports not addressed under (a)
Senate Committee report Conclusions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8:
The Government agrees with these conclusions.
Senate Committee report Conclusion 6:
There are existing national environmental policy frameworks in place which provide agreed objectives and management approaches for all jurisdictions to protect native vegetation, including regrowth and remnant habitats.  Such frameworks include the National Strategy for the Conservation of Australia’s Biological Diversity and the National Framework for the Management and Monitoring of Australia’s Native Vegetation (Native Vegetation Framework).  These national frameworks are agreed between all jurisdictions and are underpinned by specific policies, legislation and management approaches within each jurisdiction.
The Government is conscious of the need for an effective national framework for tackling land clearing.  In April 2008 the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council (NRMMC) agreed to finalise the review of the Native Vegetation Framework.  The NRMMC confirmed the importance of the Native Vegetation Framework as the national policy framework for achieving a reversal in the long-term decline of Australia’s native vegetation and improving the condition of existing native vegetation.  The Native Vegetation Framework provides a mechanism through which the native vegetation management commitments agreed to by all state and territory governments can be progressed in a consistent and coherent manner.
The Commonwealth, state and territory governments have also enacted legislation for environmental protection, including to regulate the broad scale clearing of native vegetation and to protect threatened species and ecological communities.  The Government protects certain specific and defined matters of National Environmental Significance under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), including listed threatened species and ecological communities.  Proposals that are likely to have a significant impact on those matters must be referred to the Commonwealth Environment Minister for assessment.  Land Clearance is listed as a Key Threatening Process under the EPBC Act.  On the advice of the Threatened Species Scientific Committee, the previous government decided not to establish a Threat Abatement Plan for this process primarily because such a plan would not contribute any threat mitigation over and above existing measures such as the Native Vegetation Framework and state and territory vegetation legislation.  In accordance with the requirements of the EPBC Act this decision is now under review by the Threatened Species Scientific Committee, which will advise the Government about whether this decision is still appropriate.
In addition, the Government will invest $2.25 billion from July 2008 to June 2013 through Caring for our Country to secure improved strategic natural resource management outcomes across six national priority areas:
the National Reserve System
biodiversity and natural icons
coastal environments and critical aquatic habitats
sustainable farm practices
natural resource management in northern and remote Australia, and
community skills, knowledge and engagement.
Caring for our Country will be delivered in partnership with regional natural resource management groups, local, state and territory governments, Indigenous groups, industry bodies, land managers, farmers, landcare groups and communities. 
Senate Committee report Conclusion 9:
Better soil management, including carbon in soils, is being addressed as a priority under the $46.2 million Climate Change Research Program component of the Australia’s Farming Future Initiative.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon Tony Burke MP announced on 3 March 2009 $20 million for soil carbon research under this Program. 
Dissenting Report (Milne, Joyce, Nash, Boswell and Heffernan) Recommendation 1:
The Government notes that complying with the guidelines is a mandatory requirement of the legislation, however, the guidelines offer some flexibility in how taxpayers may comply.  Extending the guidelines to involve mandatory requirements or additional regulatory requirements would significantly increase the cost of compliance for forest growers, increase the cost of administering the tax deduction, and would raise issues about the bounds of Commonwealth jurisdiction.
Dissenting Report (Milne, Joyce, Nash, Boswell and Heffernan) Recommendation 2(b):
Concerns regarding the potential for native vegetation to be cleared, or converted to, carbon sink forests are already addressed in the legislation.  Subsection 40-1010(2)(c) notes that to obtain the tax deduction the area occupied by the carbon sink forest must have been clear of trees on 1 January 1990.  In addition, the guidelines provide that all government regulatory requirements be adhered to in order to obtain the tax deduction, and this includes relevant state and territory land clearing regulations.
Dissenting Report (Milne, Joyce, Nash, Boswell and Heffernan) Recommendation 2(c):
Concerns that carbon sink forests should be biodiverse and cannot be harvested or cleared are also addressed in the legislation.  The Government notes that it is not the primary objective of the legislation to promote biodiversity.  However, the guidelines require the carbon sink forest grower to consider regional natural resource management plans and apply best practice approaches for achieving multiple land and water objectives.  This will facilitate a focus on providing habitat for local flora and fauna, and providing biodiversity benefits for the region.  In addition, national policy frameworks and programs as described above promote biodiversity conservation.
A requirement for obtaining the tax deduction is that the trees are established for the purpose of carbon sequestration, and are not for felling or for commercial horticulture. 
Dissenting Report (Milne, Joyce, Nash, Boswell and Heffernan) Recommendation 2(d):
The recommendation in the dissenting report that a hydrological analysis be required before a carbon sink forest could be established would be cost-prohibitive.  The guidelines require water access entitlements be obtained for catchments that have been identified as fully allocated, over-allocated or approaching full allocation, consistent with the National Water Initiative commitment relating to interception that poses a significant risk to water resources.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,28,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-06-18,"—by leave—I wish to speak for a couple of moments on the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport report Implementation, operation and administration of the legislation underpinning carbon sink forests and the government’s response to it, and I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I have to say that the government’s response does not satisfy the concerns that I raised in the dissenting report from the majority report. In view of the collapse of managed investment schemes in recent times, I think the concerns that were put on the table by the Greens when this legislation was being debated are now more relevant than ever. At the time, the majority committee report said:
The committee notes that other forms of greenhouse gas emissions reduction activities … are tax deductible. The change in the tax treatment of carbon sink forests addresses this anomaly …
The committee believes that the tax deductions will provide incentives for corporate investment into greenhouse gas abatement activities which represents an ideal opportunity to direct necessary capital to achieve positive environmental outcomes.
That is exactly what they said about the managed investment schemes for forests. This was a fabulous idea to drive investment into rural Australia; what a good thing to do. It was all set up as a tax minimisation scheme, and look what an utter and complete mess and collapse has occurred because of that.
At the time, I said we should be repealing the managed investment schemes, not bringing in another managed investment scheme by way of carbon sink forests. Yet the government and the coalition overruled that and went ahead. Now we have two Senate inquiries into the managed investment schemes whilst continuing with this absolutely flawed proposal for carbon sink forests. I said at the time that these forests would not be biodiverse plantings, and the government said, ‘Oh yes, they will.’ But now in the government’s own response it says:
The Government notes that it is not the primary objective of the legislation to promote biodiversity.
Exactly. The trees they put in they will put on the best land to grow the best trees with the most water because the idea is to bulk up the trees, bulk up the carbon as quickly as possible, and it is not its primary objective to achieve biodiversity and improvements in the long term in rural and regional Australia.
The other major concern I had was in relation to land clearance. I said that this would lead to land clearance for people to plant these forests. The government have said, ‘Oh no, that’s not the case because it can’t have been forested in 1990.’ But the point is when you are talking about native vegetation you are not necessarily talking about land which conforms to the definition of a forest. There is a specific definition of a forest and quite a lot of areas of native vegetation across Australia do not conform to that, and there will be land clearance because of this. I urge the government to recognise that it is all waffle in the government’s response here about the wonderful strategies that are in place nationally to look at the clearance of native vegetation. We do not even have a trigger under the EPBC Act on land clearance, let alone anything else in terms of greenhouse. In the Tasmanian context I can tell you now there is no enforcement and compliance in relation to land clearance and there is no enforcement and compliance in relation to groundwater.
The express concerns of National Party senators and the Greens in relation to this particular legislation were specifically in terms of four particular areas. One was that carbon sinks be registered on the property title, and I am glad the government has taken that up. The second one was no native vegetation to be cleared or converted for carbon sink forests. That has not been dealt with. Carbon sink forests should be biodiverse and cannot be harvested or cleared. That has not been dealt with. As I said, the definitions are such that native vegetation will be able to be cleared. The third thing we said was no carbon sink forests could be established in the absence of hydrological analysis in terms of groundwater and groundwater interception in the proposed areas. That has not been dealt with. In fact, the government has made a statement saying that requiring hydrological analysis would be cost prohibitive. So in my view we have got MI schemes on steroids. That has always been my view.
The MI schemes have now fallen over big time. The investors in them have had their fingers burnt very badly. The people who made the money out of them were the accountants and the middlemen, the financial arrangers. They were the ones who walked off with the cash with these MI schemes. Now a lot of rural communities are stranded, and the communities I feel particularly sorry for are those where the MI schemes went in and bought up the water rights. Now those water rights will be the first things sold off as the MI schemes are wound up, and whole rural communities are going to be left without water because the water rights will be sold somewhere else, further down the catchment, most likely, and that will mean the big corporate buyers will buy the water and the family farms will be left in communities without water. So this is a living disaster, the MI schemes, and nobody in this place can say that they were not warned. They were warned. They were warned by the Greens and warned by the Nationals about what the impact would be in rural and regional Australia, and everybody took no notice, went ahead and said, ‘Let’s do it again with the carbon sink forests. Let’s get out there and give 100 per cent tax deductions for carbon sink forests.’ And now we have had proof from the government that their primary objective is not biodiversity: ‘It’s too expensive to require hydrological analysis; we’ll rely on the states to oversee land clearance.’ But we know that, in a case like Tasmania, that is a joke because there is no enforcement or compliance with regard to vegetation clearance.
I hope when this parliament starts looking at the mess of the MI schemes we will rapidly think again about this carbon sink forests legislation and get rid of it, because its primary objective is a tax deduction. When you introduce a financial mechanism the primary objective of which is tax minimisation and not the outcome—whether it was almonds, whether it was trees in the case of the forestry ones or whether it is now in terms of carbon sink forests—you always get rorting. That is what has happened. To the detriment of regional and rural Australia, that is what happened. The Collins Street investors moved in, the accountants got their 30 per cent commissions and the communities are going to end up with a mess. They are now surrounded by plantations that are going to be fire hazards this summer, that are going to be full of weeds and feral animals. There is no money to manage those MIS forests sitting out there now and there will not be any money to manage these so-called carbon sink forests either once this scheme gets underway.
We are still at a matter of debate in this parliament as to whether the tax deduction includes the cost of land. I believe it does and I have advice to say that it does which I provided to the parliament, and it is now only going to be a matter of someone taking this to court. We are going to have huge areas left with these MI schemes and what we have to make sure is that the government does not now enable forests that were planted as a result of tax deductions for wood production to end up suddenly converted into carbon sink forests in order to realise some value for the investors that were in it to reduce their tax in the first place and not actually to get outcomes. That would make an even worse situation because you would then take out those plantations that were wood production and put them in as carbon sink forests and drive the logging further and further into native forests. That would be a disaster in biodiversity terms, a disaster in terms of the timber industry and the downstreaming that was meant to come from those plantations. It would be an Australian rural community horror show, in fact.
So I would like to see the government rethink what it is doing and help to resolve the mess that was created because the Liberal and Labor parties supported this tax minimisation in the first place, clean up the mess of the MI schemes and repeal this legislation before we end up with exactly the same mess very shortly down the track.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,28,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2009-06-18,"—I want to make a couple of quick comments in respect of the government’s response to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport report Implementation, operation and administration of the legislation underpinning carbon sink forests. I welcome the fact that the government has made the report. I would note that, despite the predictions of doom and gloom and disaster that we have just heard from the Greens, enormous opportunities will arise for Australian agriculture and farmers with the incorporation of carbon sink forests into their lands.
I still have some concerns about the processes that the government is putting in place through this measure and also through the CPRS. My concern is that the opportunities that should exist for farmers to integrate farm forestry into their whole-of-farm management plans, which is the way that this should be encouraged, are not being put into place in the way that they could be. The government should be showing greater intensity in the work that it is doing to try and get some of the accounting procedures modified, particularly those that give the opportunity for the recognition of carbon stored in wood products. This not the case under the current accounting rules, which severely limit the capacity of farmers in rural communities to take advantage of the opportunities that exist for the sequestration of carbon and the take-up of these opportunities. I am concerned that the growth in restrictions around the operation of some of these projects really does provide those limitations.
In respect of Senator Milne’s comments, while I do agree with some of the prudential measures that are in place governing managed investment schemes, the collapse of two companies does not mean the demise of the whole process. There are companies that are still quite successfully operating managed investment schemes and providing opportunities for farmers and the supply of timber products into the wood supply. We all know that the Greens have the view that you should close down all forestry in Australia, and the way they misuse terminology and definitions in this debate is quite deceptive at times. I would urge people to take real caution when they listen to some of the hysterical contributions that are being made in this debate. In particular, people should listen very carefully to some of the terminology that is being used.
I welcome the fact that the government has made a response to the committee report, but there remain some concerns, as I have indicated. The government needs to make sure that the real opportunities that exist for rural Australia to participate properly in forestry are dealt with as part of both this process and the development of the CPRS moving forward.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reports: Government Responses</title>,Committees,28,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2009-06-18,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to   Colombia and Argentina which took  place from 9 to 24 August 2008 and I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The bilateral visit in August last year was an opportunity for parliamentarians to learn more about Colombia and Argentina, to promote Australia and to strengthen bilateral ties. The delegation was the first Australian parliamentary visit to Colombia and the first in some years to Argentina. Indeed, I think our first Colombian congressional delegation will be coming here next week. The report details our program activities and observations.
I wish to acknowledge my delegation colleagues. The deputy delegation leader was Mr Don Randall. The other delegation members were Senator Marise Payne, who has a very extensive and impressive knowledge of foreign affairs, Senator Helen Polley, Mr Luke Hartsuyker and Ms Melissa Parke. The delegation secretary was Ms Sara Edson, who did a great job in assisting the delegation. Each delegate was an enthusiastic participant in discussions and inspections and contributed significantly to the purpose of the delegation visit in a spirit of bipartisanship and goodwill.
The delegation visited Colombia first, from 8 to 15 August. In Bogota we had the distinct honour of meeting with the Colombian President, Mr Alvaro Uribe, as well as the Foreign Minister, Mr Jaime Bermudez. The President’s administration has ushered in a suite of reforms which have improved security, facilitated economic growth and introduced new health and education programs. Wherever we went in Colombia we learnt that past perceptions of Colombia are not necessarily the reality of Colombia today. Colombians have a renewed sense of self-esteem about their institutions and an optimism about their country’s future.
We were warmly received by the President of the Senate, Mr Hernan Andrade, and parliamentarians from the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, and impressed by the level of interest in Australia that our counterparts had. Engaging discussions were held on a range of foreign relations and trade matters, including the latest Doha Round, direct foreign investment, free trade agreements, alternative sources of energy and the scope for further cooperation in the mining, agribusiness and education industries. I had the pleasure of addressing the Colombian Senate, which was broadcast live to a potential audience of 40 million Colombians. I am not sure that anybody else could claim that credit, and I hope none of my delegation colleagues reported it back to the Prime Minister either!
In addition to meetings with parliamentarians and officials from government departments in Bogota, the delegation had a number of engagements outside the capital. Highlights included a visit to Cerrejon mine, which is one-third owned by BHP Billiton and the world’s largest open pit coalmine, and its local school program for indigenous children. We also had valuable meetings with local government and business representatives in Cartagena and visited the award-winning Port of Cartagena. We enjoyed participating in a forum on Australian relations with Latin America with university students in Medellin keen to learn more about Australia. It is not that well known that Colombia sends 5,000 students to study in Australian tertiary institutions each year. In fact, one of the President’s sons has an engineering degree from here. In Medellin, we also visited the Parque Biblioteca Espana, an unusual and successful development project which uses modern architecture and public spaces to inspire social change in disadvantaged communities. Indeed, Colombia was regarded as one of the most dangerous places in the world; Medellin, where we were, was regarded as the most dangerous place in Colombia; and this project where we were was regarded as the most dangerous place in Medellin. That has certainly changed.
From 16 to 22 August the delegation visited Argentina. This leg of the journey commenced in Missiones Province during a long weekend so that we could see the management of large tourist flows at Iguazcu Falls and inspect the world’s largest hydroelectric dam, over the border in Brazil.
In Buenos Aires, the delegation was honoured to meet the President of the Senate and Vice-President of Argentina, Julios Cobos, and the respective chairs of the foreign affairs committees in the Senate and the lower house, together with colleagues from different parties in the Argentine congress, including members of the Australia-Argentine Parliamentary Friendship Group. We acknowledge the tremendous assistance and support of Senator Sonia Escudero, chair of the friendship group, who looked after us during the visit. Both the Australian and Argentine parliaments benefit from her passion and enthusiasm for Australia. It is well known that she is married to a former Labor member of the upper house in New South Wales, Ken Reed, which might account for her passion.
A range of bilateral issues were discussed at official meetings with parliamentary and government officials, including the respective parliamentary committee systems; shared interests in peacekeeping and in environmental matters such as the preservation of Antarctica and whale conservation; the scope for further collaboration in nuclear science and technology and climate change; and the proposed work and holiday visa arrangement with Australia. All agreed that the latter would encourage greater people-to-people exchanges.
We visited the Memory Museum in Argentina, which pays homage to the victims of the military dictatorship which was in place from 1976-1983, and were impressed with the national archive that reminds and educates future generations about this gruesome period in their history.
We also met with Mr German Perez, the Tourism Secretary of Buenos Aires Province—the world capital of polo and ranches—and discussed the scope for greater two-way tourist flows between our countries. In November last year, Qantas added a direct route from Sydney to Buenos Aires. This welcome move will encourage further people-to-people contact, with business and tourism links.
Business representatives in Argentina told delegates that opportunities exist for more Australian investment in Argentina, especially in mining and agribusiness. In addition to legal and tax predictability and stability, having the right partner—familiar with local political and business conditions—is paramount for any long-term joint ventures between Australian and Argentine companies.
I am delighted to inform the Senate that we initiated an Australia-Colombia Parliamentary Friendship Group, which is in the final stages of being established. This will complement the Australia-Argentine Parliamentary Friendship Group that already exists.
In closing, delegation members join me in expressing sincere appreciation to the host parliaments, government, business and other representatives who contributed to a successful visit. We have fond memories of our time spent in each country and the people we met.
We thank our diplomatic representatives in Chile, who have responsibility for Colombia and Argentina and who provided outstanding support during our visit. Our special thanks go to the Australian Ambassador to Chile and Colombia, His Excellency Crispin Conroy, and Third Secretary, Ms Penny Toledo-Ocampo; the former Australian Ambassador to Argentina, His Excellency Peter Hussin, and First Secretary, Mr Nick McCaffrey, and Third Secretary, Ms Claire Rochecouste.
We also thank His Excellency Mr Diego Betancur, the Colombian Ambassador to Australia, and His Excellency Mr Pedro Raul Villagra Delgado, the Argentine Ambassador to Australia, for meeting with delegates prior to departure and, in the case of the Argentine Ambassador, on the delegation’s return as well.
Finally I would like to thank Ms Lynette Mollard from the Parliamentary Relations Office for her efforts in coordinating the delegation program and repeat my thanks to Ms Sara Edson. I commend the report to the Senate.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-06-18,"—Because we have such a congested and important list of matters to deal with in the next five days of sittings, I am not going to oppose this motion from the government. However, the precedent here of the government moving to amend private members’ time is not a good one. It is a matter for the opposition and the crossbench. We get very little time in this place and I do not believe the government should be ordering the business for private members. Moreover, as I have made clear a number of times before, I think private members’ time ought to be not only kept intact but also, in fact, extended.
I will not get into a debate now about the need for a much better defined private members’ time with the ability for private members legislation to pass, but we will be having a debate on that soon enough. The move here is really to enable government business to be brought back on at the expense of private members’ business when there are important pieces of legislation that I think should be dealt with. I have a contrary view to the government on this. The Greens have a contrary view to the government on this. While we are not going to get into a long debate about this at the moment, it is very important that that view be heard by the government.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,32,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2009-06-18,"—I want to place on record that my office contacted Senator Brown’s office about this motion procedurally, there having been, as we understood it, an agreement that the only matter that would proceed would be the first bill on the list of bills and that it was necessary to clean up the list for that purpose. The discussion took place and as far as we were aware there were no issues with the moving of this motion. We believed it was procedural. We hear what Senator Brown says and I can assure him that it is not our intention to establish any precedent of interfering with general business in any way. On this occasion, this was a procedure to give effect to what we understood was an agreement.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,32,1,speech
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-06-18,"—The opposition will be supporting the government’s motion but I do agree with Senator Brown in respect of the lack of clarity in relation to general business this afternoon. I should indicate to Senator Brown that it is general business and not private members’ business, but I think it is a matter that the Procedure Committee should discuss in future in order to more clearly define what happens in general business. I do note that I understand from a motion previously moved in the chamber today the Senate will actually have the potential to divide if required at the conclusion of general business. This has not happened before in my time here, and I think we just need to have those matters clarified by the Procedure Committee and clearly step out issues that govern general business time. Maybe then, Senator Brown, the opposition and the minor party crossbench will have greater clarity about the time available for use by them.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2009-06-18,"—Senator Brown will not be surprised to hear me say that Liberal and National Party senators are of the view that individual and parental responsibility is the key component to good family health. We do not support the measures proposed in the Protecting Children from Junk Food Advertising (Broadcasting Amendment) Bill 2008 and we will not be supporting it. In government we did initiate a range of healthy-eating and lifestyle programs which were aimed at enabling families to make better informed choices, and in the lead-up to the 2007 election we announced that we would establish a new ABC children’s TV channel that would provide children’s age appropriate content without advertising as another option for parents. We are very pleased to see that the Rudd government has decided to follow our lead on this, picking up on this very good idea and going ahead with it.
We do take the issue of children’s health very seriously. However, we do not believe that simply banning junk food advertising is the silver bullet that some people want us to believe it is. It is not a silver bullet to stop increasing rates of childhood obesity. It is just too simplistic to suggest that it is. What we do need, however, is to equip families with the information and support to make positive health and lifestyle choices. That is a far better long-term solution to these issues than just pursuing what we consider to be a nanny state approach to the issue.
This bill seeks to ban junk food advertising for children; yet, what is conveniently ignored by those promoting this approach is the fact that such a ban would in fact be ineffective. In Quebec and Sweden, food advertising to children was banned 25 years and 12 years ago respectively without any appreciable impact on obesity rates. The issues surrounding childhood obesity are complex and cannot be addressed by a single simplistic response such as banning advertisements.
I would also point out that reviews of the Children’s Television Standards and the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice, both of which impose obligations on broadcasters regarding advertising during children’s viewing times, have been conducted in recent years, and I understand that the final version of the revised Children’s Television Standards are due to be gazetted in mid-2009. I am sure that senators would be aware of the extensive process that the Australian Communications and Media Authority went through in reviewing children’s television standards, and of course there are a whole range of restrictions and regulatory arrangements around what kind of advertising can occur in which time periods. For example, advertisements are prohibited in what are called P periods under the Children’s Television Standards. P periods are the periods between 7 am and 4.30 pm Mondays to Fridays. Advertisements are limited to five minutes in any 30-minute C period. During any 30 minutes of a C period, a licensee may broadcast the same advertisement no more than twice. Advertisements must not be designed to put undue pressure on children to ask their parents or other people to purchase an advertised product or service. There is a series of other regulatory restrictions that I encourage senators to review at their leisure.
Suffice to say that the main point that the opposition want to place on the record is that we think the best way to ensure healthy eating habits for children is to rely on individual and parent responsibility and to support families in whatever way we can to make well-informed choices. With those few comments, I place on record that the opposition will not be supporting this bill.",SENATE,<title>PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM JUNK FOOD ADVERTISING BILL 2006 [2008]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-06-18,"—The Protecting Children from Junk Food Advertising Bill 2006 [2008] seeks to amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004 to impose restrictions on food and beverage advertising on television during children’s viewing times and provides that financial assistance for schools is conditional upon schools not displaying advertisements or sponsorships by companies whose principal activity is the manufacture, distribution or sale of junk food.
The bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs on 4 September 2008 and the committee’s report was tabled on 2 December 2008. The report recommended that the bill not be passed. An inquiry into obesity in Australia was recently undertaken by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, and the report was tabled in parliament on 1 June 2009. The inquiry considered the factors that affect obesity in Australia, including advertising and what governments, individuals and the community can do to manage increasing obesity levels. Recommendation No. 11 of the report seeks more research on the effects of advertising on the eating behaviour of children and other vulnerable groups. The report did not recommend a ban on junk food advertising.
This bill pre-empts a number of very important and detailed policy development and evidence-gathering processes which look at this issue as part of an integrated approach. I think that an outline of the government’s actions and outlook will provide some useful context and backdrop for this debate.
Let me state at the outset that there is no doubt that obesity, and childhood obesity in particular, is a serious issue. I think that health experts from across Australia would agree that the causes of the problem are multifactoral and require an integrated range of measures. Ad hoc or piecemeal responses are unlikely to succeed. The government has demonstrated policy leadership in this respect, as it recognises that children’s health, eating habits and lifestyle are very important. This is why the government is implementing a range of measures aimed at improving the health of Australian children and adults. First, the government has put its money where its mouth is. Our commitment is demonstrated by the $872 million over six years provided by the Rudd Labor government towards preventative health through COAG. There has been nothing like this level of investment commitment ever before, and I think that all senators would support the government’s actions.
Programs will be implemented in settings such as preschools, schools and workplaces to help individuals modify their lifestyles in order to reduce their risk of chronic disease, and the development of a national preventative health agency designed to provide ongoing policy leadership is currently in development. This unprecedented investment in preventative health programs builds on the more than $50 million provided for obesity prevention initiatives in the government’s first budget, including a range of initiatives targeting children. The initiatives include $25.6 million over four years for Healthy Kids Checks for all four-year-olds to improve childhood health, claimable under Medicare. That was launched on 1 July 2008. The Get Set 4 Life—habits for healthy kids guide, was launched on 1 July 2008 and provides $2.9 million over two years for parents of four-year-olds receiving the Healthy Kids Check. Under the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden program, up to 190 government primary schools will receive a grant of up to $60,000 to build a vegetable garden and kitchen facilities. That program was launched on 21 August 2008 and will provide $12.8 million over four years. The Active After-schools Communities program, through the Australian Sports Commission, encourages participation in after-school physical activity and is funded at $124.4 million over four years from 2007-08; and the Healthy Eating and Physical Activity Guidelines for Early Childhood Settings is funded at $4.5 million over five years. So the Rudd Labor government’s commitment has been solid, tangible and there for all to see. One of the hallmarks of this government has been the recognition that a good and rigorous evidence base is essential if policy development is to be effective and have a lasting effect. Once again, I think all senators would agree with this proposition.
There are currently a number of interrelated policy processes underway which are relevant to the objectives of this bill. The government has established the National Preventative Health Taskforce, chaired by Professor Rob Moodie, to examine ways to reduce health problems caused by alcohol, tobacco and, as is especially relevant here, obesity. I would like to emphasise that this task force underlines our commitment to identify root causes and the best evidence to help us develop a policy prescription. In October 2008, the task force released a discussion paper, Australia: the healthiest country by 2020, and three comprehensive technical reports on obesity, tobacco and alcohol for public comment. The discussion paper aimed to initiate debate that will assist in the development of a national preventative health strategy. The task force will be reporting in the near future. To introduce legislation now would pre-empt the work of the task force and is, therefore, inappropriate.
As with any complex issue, there is no magic cure for the trend towards childhood obesity. There are many and varied causes of for being overweight and obese amongst our children. During the Australian Communications and Media Authority’s recent review of the Children’s Television Standards, ACMA commissioned independent research on the issue. ACMA has issued a draft report for comment and will be issuing its final report in the near future. Once again, to introduce sweeping legislation now would inappropriately pre-empt the work of ACMA.
Food and beverage advertising is already subject to substantial regulation. Rules about advertising to children are set out in broadcasting standards and codes. The Broadcasting Services Act 1992 sets out a co-regulatory system for the regulation of broadcasting content, in which commercial free-to-air broadcasters comply with the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice and Children’s Television Standards. Under the system, the viewing day is divided into a series of time zones or bands to ensure appropriate material is broadcast, to assist viewers to make informed choices about the content they access and to provide parents with information regarding the suitability of material for children.
Under the current Children’s Television Standards, no commercials are permitted to be broadcast in P periods, and each 30 minutes of C periods may contain no more than five minutes of commercials, with the exception of some Australian drama programs. The standard also includes strict content rules, which include:
An advertisement for a food product may not contain any misleading or incorrect information about the nutritional value of that product.
Under the Children’s Television Standards:
No material broadcast during a C period or P period may:
(a)      demean any person or group on the basis of ethnicity, nationality, race, gender, sexual preference, religion, or mental or physical disability;
(b)      present images or events in a way which is unduly frightening or unduly distressing to children;
(c)      present images or events which depict unsafe uses of a product or unsafe situations which may encourage children to engage in activities dangerous to them;
(d)      advertise products or services which have been officially declared unsafe or dangerous by a Commonwealth authority or by an authority having jurisdiction within the licensee’s licence area.
These requirements may apply equally to program content and advertisements.
The Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice provides another layer of protection in relation to advertising to children. The Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice provides that:
Advertisements to Children for food and/or beverages:
(a)      should not encourage or promote an inactive lifestyle combined with unhealthy eating or drinking habits; and
(b)      must not contain any misleading or incorrect information about the nutritional value of that Product.
The merits of co- and self-regulatory systems are well established and apply equally across advertising media channels, including the internet and emergent media. These other increasingly influential media platforms would not be covered by a ban on television advertising. Complaint mechanisms within the existing co-regulatory systems enable broadcasters and advertisers to quickly and transparently respond to complaints and to make adjustments in responding to prevailing community standards.
In addition to the co-regulatory requirements within the broadcasting and advertising sectors, some key industry groups and bodies are implementing their own codes. I could give some further arguments but, due to the nature of the debate and the agreed time limits, I conclude by saying that the government has made obesity a preventative health priority. It is investing heavily to support efforts to reduce the numbers of people who are overweight and obese. The government is determined to take a careful, evidence based approach to this issue. Therefore, the government does not support this bill.",SENATE,<title>PROTECTING CHILDREN FROM JUNK FOOD ADVERTISING BILL 2006 [2008]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-06-18,"—in reply—I thank the contributors to the debate on the Protecting Children from Junk Food Advertising (Broadcasting Amendment) Bill 2008, which not only is an important bill but also is quite urgent in view of the ever-worsening statistics about obesity in Australia, which has a quarter of adults obese now and the speculation in medical circles that we may actually see a reduction in the longevity of the Australian population within the next decade or two starting to occur due to the increase in obesity in the community.
The evidence continues to grow that junk food advertising on television materially increases the chances of children becoming obese and that once that happens it is very difficult to reverse it. I point the Senate’s attention to the European Journal of Public Health Advance Access, published on 14 April this year. The article ‘By how much would limiting TV food advertising reduce childhood obesity?’ is by four researchers, J. Lennert Veerman, Eduard F. Van Beeck, Jan J. Barendregt and Johan P. Mackenbach of the Erasmus University Rotterdam and the University of Queensland. In summary, it says:
A complete ban on food advertising on TV may reduce the prevalence of obesity among US children by about 2.5 percentage points. Based on expert opinion, this could be as much as 6.5 percentage points. In other words, given a baseline prevalence of about 17%, possibly as many as one in seven—or even one in three—obese children would not have been obese in the absence of food advertising on TV. Comparable numbers of overweight children might have had a normal weight.
This is the latest article that I could find, and I thank my staff—not the least Prue Cameron—for the hard work that has been put into backing the necessity for this legislation and for the increasing evidence I have been able to bring before the Senate as to why we should be acting on this piece of legislation.
I hear what both the government and the opposition are saying about parental guidance being important, and it does echo to me a debate that Senator Siewert and I have had in the past in this place with regard to the terrible scourge of petrol sniffing in Central Australia, where a former minister for health, Mr Tony Abbott, said that that was a matter for parental guidance. However, government intervention there has saved hundreds of children from brain damage and potential lifelong physical and mental damage as a result of that scourge. It is not different to say that we have increasing obesity in the whole of the Australian community and it does require government control on those who are pushing junk food onto children.
What are government and opposition members saying—that children should not be allowed to watch commercial TV; that it is irresponsible of parents to allow that to happen? Or are they saying that children should have parents sitting with them during all advertising times, when they see food advertisements on television, so that they can be dissuaded from believing what they see on TV? Or are government and opposition members saying that the psychologists are wrong when they tell us that children up to the age of 12 cannot discern between the factual material they may see on television and advertising? Or have government and opposition members not read about the employment by the big food manufacturers of banks of psychologists to help them in their advertising presentation to vulnerable children who do not know the difference, using established psychological techniques to persuade children to buy junk food from advertising and, indeed, to employ the pester factor—that is, to pester their parents to buy junk food when they are at the supermarket or when they are out in the area of restaurants?
It is not naivety; it is very close to irresponsible that we are not seeing legislative action backed by the big parties on this matter—and here is the opportunity. As with the moves towards banning tobacco advertising, which saved the public health system billions of dollars and saved massive social problems and heartache—because it saved thousands of Australians from lung cancer, heart disease, stomach cancer, circulatory disease and a whole range of other factors that shortened lives in this country, through government action—can senators not see that acting to prevent the rapidly increasing toll of obesity in this country is a responsibility that is on our shoulders, and an urgent one at that?
Nobody has claimed in this debate—and nor will I—that ending junk food advertising pushed to children is going to solve the problem, because it will not. There are a range of other factors that have to be dealt with, including, for example, ensuring that not just children but also adults get adequate exercise and that there is public education on what is healthy food. This legislation from the Greens gives the minister the ability to enable good food to be advertised in children’s TV viewing hours. It therefore enables the minister of the day to be able to get expert advice on that matter. In other words, it gives the minister the ability to see whether food is in fact not just neutral or is not unhealthy but is healthy when it is being pushed in children’s TV viewing hours.
Moreover, as a result of listening to the increasing evidence on the impact on children’s TV viewing hours, I have with me amendments that I would move in the committee of the whole were we to get the government and/or the opposition to support this legislation which would increase the restriction on junk food advertising to 9.30 at night. It would be from 6 am to 9.30 at night in period C or period P, and variously extending the hours, because it has been found that the greatest impact that the junk food advertiser is having on children is targeting them before 9.30 at night—in other words, very often when they are watching with their parents.
It is not fatuous, but it is a flawed argument for both the big parties to be saying this is a parental responsibility. The fact is that it is manifestly not working. We have the same argument here that we had with petrol sniffing: that responsible parents will stop their children from getting into trouble that way. But it is a reality that we have a range of parental guidance in our community and that children who do not have the benefit of the best of caring from their parents may be the most vulnerable to the junk food advertisers. I am aware of the enormous power of the food manufacturers in this country, and they have it over the body politic. They talk about self-regulation. Every time this issue comes up, on comes the issue of self-regulation. It is not working and it has not worked and it is our responsibility to ensure that we do make it work.
It is an absolute failure of the Rudd government and the Minister for Health and Ageing that not only is this legislation being opposed by the Labor government but there is no substitute for it. And there is no apparent intention to substitute it. The health minister has been apparently struck with inanition on this issue and I have heard no argument as to why that is the case. This is our responsibility. This is a serious matter. The Greens here are acting on a public health matter of high priority to the experts in this country and around the world, and the government is failing to act in a similarly responsible way. It is very, very hard to understand why the government is not taking action on this unless you factor in the sheer power of the food manufacturers in the big end of town who always, of course, come in with the argument of parental responsibility and self-regulation.
I have here a letter from Choice, the remarkably effective consumer advocacy voice in Australia. This is addressed to Senator Milne but it has come, I presume, to all of us. It is entitled: ‘Re: Junk food advertising to children: who is the biggest loser?’ Mr Gordon Renouf, the Director of Policy and Campaigns says this:
I am writing to you to urge you to support tougher Australian regulations and international recommendations that will protect children from the unhealthy influence of junk food marketing. I am also pleased to provide you with Choice’s latest report on junk food marketing, entitled Food advertising to children: who is the biggest loser? which demonstrates the need for better restrictions on junk food advertising on TV. Choice assessed all the food and drinks advertised between 6 am and 9 pm during a one week period using the nutrient profiling scoring criteria developed by Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) for regulating health claims on food labels. The FSANZ criteria are based on the nutrient profiling system first developed by the UK Food Standards Agency to regulate junk food advertising to children.

Choice goes on to say this:
It found that 54 per cent of all food advertisements promoted unhealthy foods.
It is talking about advertisements on television. It goes on:
Most junk food ads were aired between 6 pm and 9 pm when there are no government restrictions but a larger number of children watching. Our research clearly demonstrates current advertising restrictions that apply during so-called children’s viewing periods are out of touch with children’s real TV viewing habits and do little to minimise their exposure to advertisements for unhealthy foods. Current voluntary industry efforts fail to protect children from the glut of junk food ads that appear during the programs that are most popular with children. Choice wants UK-style restrictions to be introduced in Australia based on the nutrient profiling scoring criteria developed by FSANZ.
Parents also want government action. 88 per cent of parents in our 2008 Newspoll survey said that junk food marketing undermined parents’ efforts to encourage children to eat healthy foods. 82 per cent were in favour of increasing government regulation of the way unhealthy food is marketed to children. International research shows that food advertising influences children’s food preferences and diets. The World Health Organisation recommends restrictions on food marketing to children as part of a global strategy to prevent diet related diseases and is currently developing recommendations on the marketing of food and non-alcoholic beverages to children. Children in Australia and across the globe have a right to be protected from marketing that in the long term has a detrimental impact on their health. Choice supports Consumers International, its recommendations for an international code on marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children and calls on the Australian government to do the same.
Then it cites:
www.choice.com.au/junkfoodcode
for more information about the proposed code and says:
Restricting junk food marketing to children is just one action required to address rising rates of overweight and obesity in children. This has already been highlighted by the Commonwealth government’s own National Preventative Health Taskforce. We are hopeful that food marketing restrictions will form part of the final National Preventative Health Strategy that will soon be presented to government. Choice urges you to support the development of Australian regulations including the strengthening of children’s television standards and WHO recommendations that protect children under 16 from the promotion of foods high in fat, sugar and salt in broadcast media between 6 am and 9 pm and non-broadcast media, including on-pack promotions and the use of movie tie-ins, toys, characters and celebrities to appeal to children.
The reality here is that we are unlikely to get legislation like the Greens have brought forward in this period of government, and that is not acceptable. The government will be failing the Australian populace in this matter if it does not support this move. We are told, ‘Wait on’. That is the result of the pressure of the big food advertisers. It is the ‘wait on’ factor that always has bedevilled trying to deal adequately with the seriousness of cigarette advertising and pushing by the big tobacco companies. We have here a real epidemic and an increasing impact which costs the public purse billions of dollars and a lot of heartache for those people caught up with it in increasing obesity and the number and percentage of Australians who are overweight.
This legislation should be supported. I submit there has been no cogent argument except an attempt to delay and to substitute inaction on behalf of the government and the opposition for the action that the Greens want to see taken in the interests of the primary health care, and this is preventative health care, of Australians. Finally, this will be looked back on in the future with a great deal of incredulity by people researching the matter. How can we allow millions of children every day to be exposed to junk food purveyors pushing food at these children which injures their health? How is it that we allow these big corporations their manipulative advertising based on millions of dollars spent on psychological research not in the interests of the health of children but to increase profit lines against the interests of the health of children. This is the public domain. We are here to look after the public interest. This bill is all about the public interest and it should be supported.

—I think the action is being taken. Someone is going to mind the child.

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2009-06-18,"—In 1986, Australia’s refugee and asylum seeker advocacy groups joined together for the first time to create a better understanding and a positive social awareness of refugees in the community when they established the inaugural Australian Refugee Week. Since those very first celebrations, Refugee Week has become an annual event, and this week Australia celebrates Refugee Week for the 24th time. I also note that on 20 June—that is, this coming Saturday—it will be World Refugee Day, a fact acknowledged by the Senate earlier today. Refugee Week provides an important opportunity for asylum seekers and refugees in Australia to be seen, to be listened to and to be heard. It provides those people with the chance not only to share their stories and their cultures but to celebrate the contributions that they have made to our communities.
Almost four years ago, when I made my first speech, I spoke of my concern for the plight of asylum seekers and refugees in Australia. I am still concerned with the plight of those people, but I am also pleased that in the intervening four years many positive improvements have been made. Principally, I am most pleased with the last year’s introduction by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, of the seven key immigration values that will drive the new detention policy and practice into the future. These values take a more compassionate and tolerant stance towards asylum seekers coming to our shores, and they are a step in the right direction in our treatment of those who are fleeing their native lands.
Australian Refugee Week, as I said, is a time to celebrate stories but also a time and an opportunity for all of us to reflect on why there are people who are refugees. It is a celebration of some 740,000 refugees who have made Australia their new home since we became a federation. This year’s theme for Australian Refugee Week is ‘freedom from fear’, and that encapsulates the refugee experience. In seeking refuge in Australia, refugees hope to find freedom from the traumatic circumstances that have forced them to flee from their own countries. ‘Freedom from fear’ focuses our attention on the efforts we should all make to provide protection for refugees and to allow their children to grow up without fear of violence and persecution.
Additionally, this year’s theme will draw attention not just to the fear and atrocities that compel refugees to flee but to the freedom and relief they feel when they are given the opportunity to rebuild their lives in countries like ours, where they should be safe from persecution and violence. As a member of the parliament’s Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I have been privileged to share the stories of many refugees and migrants in our country. I have heard firsthand stories of atrocious environments from which many of these people have fled in fear of war and persecution—persecution usually because of their ethnicity, their race, their political or religious beliefs, or their sexual preferences. The things that I have seen and heard as part of my role on the Joint Standing Committee on Migration are, frankly, horrendous, and many of those things are beyond the experience of most Australians.
Usually a refugee will undergo extreme danger in order to flee their country and to find shelter. Often they will spend a considerable period of time in tent camps with thousands of other refugees in countries that can barely accommodate them and with services that are barely adequate, despite the best efforts of many international organisations who attempt to assist them. Many refugees do not have the time or the chance to take many of their belongings, if they have many, with them when they flee their own countries. They become dependent on handouts of food, shelter and clothing. Unfortunately, many people do not make it at all. As I said, those people are fleeing from persecution, war and other atrocities. They experience much adversity and suffer through great obstacles and conflicts. If they are lucky enough to make it to a refugee camp, their fortune is still unknown. Often they are separated from some of their closest family members and await their fate completely unaware of what has happened to the people they have left behind.
In the early 1990s, Australia’s immigration policy was to detain all people who arrived in this country unlawfully. Originally, the persons amongst that group who were asylum seekers and refugees were detained only for a relatively short period of time while their immigration status was resolved. Unfortunately, under the reins of the former government that policy was amended and the time limit was lifted. People began to spend years and years in immigration detention. Prior to the election of the current government, far too many people were spending far too long in immigration detention, with little hope for speedy resolution of their cases.
The Rudd government is currently in the midst of reviewing its immigration policy, aiming to create a fairer and more just system for all. In the Joint Standing Committee on Migration’s ongoing inquiry into immigration detention in Australia, a recommendation was made in the first report for a time frame to be placed on the length of time that unlawful noncitizens should be detained in Australian detention centres. As I said, some refugees and asylum seekers that arrive here have already spent months, if not years, in refugee camps. The last thing any genuine refugee or asylum seeker needs is to be detained again when they are here, so close to the safety that they have been looking for. It is very welcome indeed that the Australian government is now focused on limiting the amount of time, as much as possible, that people spend in detention.
The opposition has claimed that the abolition of the temporary protection visa system has made Australia a soft target for people smugglers and asylum seekers. However, if you look at the statistics globally, the number of asylum seekers has been on the rise for some time. According to the UNHCR, the increase in asylum seekers is reflected in global trends. From 2001 to 2006 there was a global decrease in the number of asylum applications. In 2007-08, however, there was a universal increase of around 11 per cent. In 2008 a UNHCR report showed that asylum claims increased by a staggering 28 per cent, due to an escalation in worldwide insecurity, persecution and conflict. The recent spate of vessels that have been intercepted in our waters cannot be accredited to any policy change. Rather, it merely reflects the global trend and the fact that people always have attempted and always will attempt to find a safer, better future for themselves and their children. That is a goal of those people and it should not be decried and condemned, as it is by so many. We should be grateful that people have that attitude to their future, particularly for their children.
Last month’s budget saw the government increase its humanitarian program up 250 places from this year’s figure of 13,500 places. The regional component of that program will continue to see us focus on the three key regions of Africa, Asia and the Middle East, primarily settling refugees who have been suffering in refugee camps for many years. I am pleased to say Australia is an international leader in the resettlement of refugee women. In 2009-10 Australia will increase the intake of women at risk and their dependants from 10.5 per cent to 12 per cent of the refugee program. Of the approximately 15.2 million refugees worldwide, 44 per cent are aged under the age of 18, and there are 17 countries that currently offer them protection or aid in their settlement.
Australia resettles the third highest number of refugees in the world, following the United States and Canada. In 2009-10 Australia will accept 13,750 onshore and offshore refugees under our humanitarian program. Approximately 1,500 of those people will settle in our home state, Acting Deputy President Hurley, of South Australia, many with the help of advocacy organisations such as the Australian Refugee Association, the longest-serving organisation assisting the settlement of refugees in South Australia and an organisation intimately involved in the celebrations that are part of Refugee Week in South Australia. I commend all of the organisations that assist asylum seekers and refugees to settle in our community. We know that there is much more that needs to be done to assist those people to make it in Australia, but we should always give due regard to the people who do what they can to assist those people to make a new life here.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Refugee Week</title>,Adjournment,38,1,speech
