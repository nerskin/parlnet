"PRESIDENT, The",,2014-03-19,"



The PRESIDENT
 (09:31):  Yesterday in question time, I ruled a number of opposition supplementary questions out of order and undertook to review the Hansard. As I have said on many occasions, ministers must answer questions only insofar as the question relates to ministerial responsibilities—in other words, the public affairs with which the minister is officially connected, proceedings pending in parliament, or any matter of administration for which the minister is responsible in a personal or representative capacity. However, an answer may provide clarification of statements made by ministers—as ministers—even if the statements are not clearly within their ministerial responsibility. 


In this case, the substance of the questions went to events that were the subject of a statement made to the Senate by Senator Sinodinos on 28 February 2013, events relating to his business interests before he was appointed to the Senate and before he became a minister. Although Senator Sinodinos made general reference to this statement in response to questions asked of him in the last sitting week, including that he stood by the statement, the supplementary questions—with one exception that I will come to—went to details of the historic events and not to areas of ministerial responsibility. As senators will be aware, I drew to the Assistant Treasurer's attention on several occasions that he was required to answer the questions insofar as they related to his ministerial responsibilities.


The exception, which I did not hear at the time because of the amount of disorderly conduct in the chamber, was the second supplementary question asked by Senator Collins. On reviewing the Hansard, it is apparent that Senator Collins was asking when Senator Sinodinos became aware of certain information and whether he was Assistant Treasurer at the time. The part of the question I heard was not in order and, as the remaining part of the question was inaudible, it was not ruled upon. When Senator Wong brought that part of the question to my attention, I undertook to review the Hansard. On reflection, if that part of the question had been audible, it could have been answered by the Assistant Treasurer insofar as it related to his ministerial responsibilities.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2014-03-19,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:33):  I seek leave to move a motion relating to the conduct of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Sinodinos.


Leave not granted. 




Senator WONG:
  Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:


That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent her moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to a motion relating to the conduct of the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Sinodinos).


There are a number of serious questions that Senator Sinodinos has to answer in relation to allegations which have been aired publicly. I wrote to the Leader of the Government in the Senate today as a matter of courtesy, indicating to him that the opposition would grant leave for Senator Sinodinos to come into this chamber and give a full explanation. The reasons why the opposition believes this is important are threefold. In February 2013 Senator Sinodinos gave a statement to this chamber. Three aspects of that statement we believe appear to be inconsistent with evidence which has been given at the Independent Commission Against Corruption. Those three matters go, first, to Senator Sinodinos's assertion in his statement that he played no role in the awarding of the January 2012 contract. Second, in relation to political donations, he did not recollect these being discussed at board level. Third, he was not aware at the time that he was made chair that the CEO of the company had negotiated what ICAC has now described as a sham loan agreement.


I will go into further detail in the context of the substantive motion, but I say this: Senator Sinodinos gave a statement to the Senate as a backbencher; that is true. But it is important to note that all of us in this place have an obligation to be truthful and frank with the chamber. He as minister has subsequently reaffirmed that. He has said in the chamber, 'I stand by the statement I made.' I think it is incumbent upon Senator Sinodinos to attend this chamber to explain the apparent inconsistencies, and certainly the omissions, in his statement to the Senate in February when faced with the factual assertions and other allegations which have been made at the Independent Commission Against Corruption. The Independent Commission Against Corruption has made a number of statements which really fly in the face of the assertions that Senator Sinodinos made to this chamber.


It is the case that the commission against corruption is investigating these matters. We accept that, but we also believe on two grounds that Senator Sinodinos should attend this place. The first ground in particular is the one I have asserted. That is that senators in this place, when confronted with public allegations which are not consistent with a statement they have made to this chamber, particularly if they are ministers, should attend this chamber and give an explanation which clarifies the inconsistencies and omissions in that statement. We have given Senator Sinodinos a number of occasions—a number of opportunities—on which he could do so. He has chosen not to.


The second basis on which we say he should attend this chamber is the ministerial standards.




Senator Brandis:
  You of all people—




Senator WONG:
  Senator Brandis brays and cackles again. It is indicative of the contempt with which this government holds the standards of ministerial conduct that the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate so cackles and so interjects. What a first law officer of the nation he is!


The reality is that the statement of standards talks about conduct of the highest personal integrity. It talks about high standards of conduct. The reality is that there have been some extremely concerning, serious allegations which have been made at the Independent Commission Against Corruption.




Senator Brandis:
  There have been no allegations.



Government senators interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  I take the interjection from those opposite. They say no allegations have been made. I am very happy to go through some of those, chapter and verse.



Senator Brandis interjecting—



Senator Fierravanti-Wells interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis and Senator Fierravanti-Wells, cease yelling across the chamber.




Senator WONG:
  Senator Sinodinos is asking, for example, this chamber to believe he was not involved with and did not have any knowledge of political donations when donations were made at a time he was an officeholder of both organisations. It is not believable. (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2014-03-19,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (09:39):  We have just heard the most outrageous allegation against Senator Sinodinos, haven't we? We just heard it, then, from Senator Wong. Supposedly, somebody has to give an explanation. Really? Is that as good as the opposition can do in this place? So sanctimonious yet so shallow is this Senator Wong. The opposition is so unprepared to vote on the carbon tax and so unprepared to vote on the mining tax before the West Australian Senate election that they will use and consume whatever time there is in this place to ensure that we do not get to vote on those important issues before the West Australian Senate election.


Let us make no mistake that this is the Senator Wong that went to the Australian people saying there will be no carbon tax and then introduced one, who then said that the budget was in good shape, and we have seen how very bad a shape it was in.



Senator Lines interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Lines, you will cease yelling across the chamber.




Senator ABETZ:
  Yet Senator Wong comes in here, so sanctimonious, claiming that she is so clean. She claims that she is the upholder of all these great standards yet she was the great defender of Craig Thomson and the great defender of Michael Williamson.


If we want to go into people's history before they entered parliament, let us have a look at the corrupt dealings of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, of which Senator Wong used to be an official. Let us put her in the stand and ask her what she knew about the corrupt dealings of the CFMEU when she was an official of it. We on this side of the chamber say that there is possibly something to explain, but not before the Senate, because this was a period before she was a senator or a minister of the crown—albeit we would love to hear an explanation from Senator Wong about all of her activities in the CFMEU.


Clearly, Senator Sinodinos has given a proper, full, detailed, honest explanation to this chamber. Above and beyond that, as important as Senator Wong is, and as bloated as she is with her own self-importance—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Both sides of the chamber will come to order.




Senator ABETZ:
  As important as Senator Wong is, we would say to her with great respect that she ain't quite as important as ICAC! ICAC is the proper place for evidence to be provided, and that is exactly what Senator Sinodinos has said he will do. He will provide full and frank detail and cooperate in every possible way with ICAC.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Collins, stop yelling across the chamber.




Senator ABETZ:
  He has said he will do that, and we have every confidence that he will do exactly that. Senator Sinodinos said he will undoubtedly take some tutorials from Senator Doug Cameron and Greg Combet on how to appear before ICAC, because people are called as witnesses from time to time before ICAC. Indeed, we will have that opportunity and we will then be able to see what the actual evidence is. But keep this in mind: Senator Sinodinos has only been called as a witness.



Government senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senators on my left, there is too much noise.




Senator ABETZ:
  No allegation has been made against Senator Sinodinos except this pathetic, puerile attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to say that somehow there was an allegation. But, I don't know, I did not quite understand, at the end of the speech, what the allegation was. I do not think anybody else understood what it was, either.


I simply say that this is a stunt by Labor. I got a letter from the Leader of the Opposition delivered to my office at 10 to nine saying that in 40 minutes this is what would happen. And, sure enough, it has happened. But what is even worse—guess what?—Sky News rang my office to see what my response would be to this, within minutes of this letter being delivered. This is all about a media stunt. It is about mobilising the media. Senator Wong does not believe in this as a matter of credibility for this place, as a matter of integrity; it is a media stunt—nothing more, nothing less.



Government senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senators on my left, come to order.




Senator ABETZ:
  It was a pathetic attempt by this Leader of the Opposition yet again to wind down the time in this chamber so they do not have to deal with the issues of the day that would create jobs for our fellow Australians, like getting rid of the carbon tax, getting rid of the mining tax and reinstituting the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which might actually bring the CFMEU to heel—of which the good senator herself was a very important official. The appropriate place is ICAC, not the Senate.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2014-03-19,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (09:45):  I rise today to support the suspension of standing orders on this matter—



Government senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Resume your seat, Senator Milne. Senators on my right will come to order. Senator Milne is only just into the first sentence of her contribution.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senators will stop discussions across the chamber. Senator Milne has the call.




Senator MILNE:
  The Australian community deserves to have confidence in the Australian parliament, in the Australian ministry in particular. The community deserves to be able to have confidence in the highest standards of behaviour from its cabinet ministers. That is where the principle of ministerial responsibility comes from, not only in taking responsibility for government decisions but also in adhering to the code of conduct, which requires the highest standard of ethical behaviour. All that is being asked for here is a statement from Senator Sinodinos, to enable him to clear his name. If he believes he is innocent in this regard then that is appropriate. Ministers are clearly responsible for their own acts but they are also clearly responsible for their omissions, and it is important that the Australian people hear from Senator Sinodinos in this particular context—and hear more than the statement that he made earlier this year. It was a carefully crafted statement but there were several omissions. 


It is also about consistency. I refer the Senate to what the now Prime Minister had to say when he was in opposition: before anybody was charged he had already made decisions about guilt and association. In referring to Craig Thomson at the time he said: 


It really is unconscionable for the Labor Party and the Prime Minister to continue to rely on this person's vote. I think that the best thing Craig Thomson could now do would be for him to leave parliament and let someone else represent the people of Dobell. Look, it is a disgrace, it is an embarrassment to the Labor Party which spawned and nurtured and protected this person and it's a disgrace to public morality that this has happened,


The Greens have said from beginning to end that people are innocent until they are proven guilty, and we believe that it is time that Senator Sinodinos came in here and told the parliament exactly what has happened so that the parliament can make a judgement about that. 


I would remind the coalition of some of the people who have resigned. Let us talk about Geoff Prosser, for example. He was minister for small business under former Prime Minister John Howard and in 1997 he resigned immediately because of allegations of improper business dealings. Go back even further than that and you had Mick Young, for example, who had to resign over not declaring a Paddington Bear to Customs in 1984. There have been many examples of ministerial responsibility. I could go through a whole list of them that I have got here. But the important thing is that if Senator Sinodinos has nothing to hide then he should come in here and make a full explanation to the parliament. That is all that is being asked at this point. Unlike the current Prime Minister, who immediately alleged guilt before there were any court proceedings, this is the Senate asking for an explanation on behalf of the Australian people. 


That is why we need a national ICAC. That is why the Greens have argued for a very long time that we need a national integrity commissioner and that these matters should be dealt with nationally in the same way that they are dealt with in New South Wales by the Independent Commission Against Corruption. It is important that we have it at the state level, but it is important that we have it at the national level. We have moved for it consistently and it has been rejected consistently by both the Liberal Party and the Labor Party. It is time that we had a national commission against corruption so that we have the capacity for the community to know that there are appropriate levels of investigation when corruption is alleged.


It is no use for the coalition to pretend that there is no alleged corruption. That is clearly the allegation that is being made here. Frankly, all it does is undermine the parliament and every parliamentarian to see this revolving door of people leaving politics, going into business, ending up at the heights of their political party, organising political donations, going back into parliament and going back into business. This revolving door has been one of the reasons why people have lost confidence in politics and in parliamentarians. That is why we need to clean it up and that is why we need an independent commission against corruption and it is why Senator Sinodinos should come in here. (Time expired)

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2014-03-19,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (09:51):  Let us not forget the man against whom this disgraceful smear is being made. Arthur Sinodinos is one of the greatest Australians who has participated in the public life of this country over the last two decades. For more than a decade, he ran the Prime Minister's office of Australia's most successful recent government, the Howard government. He is an officer of the Order of Australia. He is a person of the highest integrity and the greatest personal decency.



Senator Kim Carr interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Senator Carr, stop yelling across the chamber.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Let us not forget the stature and the quality of the Australian against whom this disgraceful smear is being made. Those who are baying from the other side of the chamber would stop at nothing to smear anyone. It is their modus operandi. We have seen it from Senator Wong. We have seen it from Senator Conroy.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, just resume your seat for a moment. Senators on my left will come to order.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Collins, I have just called senators to order.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Those who may be listening to this broadcast should know one thing in particular. There has been no allegation of wrongdoing made by anyone against Senator Arthur Sinodinos—none. The Labor Party have been seeking to smear by innuendo—guilt by association—seeking to smear the reputation of this very distinguished Australian. But remember this, Mr Acting Deputy President: there has been no allegation of wrongdoing made against Arthur Sinodinos. Senator Arthur Sinodinos is a witness in proceedings at ICAC. Any citizen may be called as a witness in proceedings at ICAC. But neither counsel assisting ICAC, nor other witnesses before ICAC, nor the ICAC commissioner himself—no-one—has alleged any wrongdoing against Senator Sinodinos; nobody.


So the fact that this, one of the most grave motions that a parliamentary chamber can be debating, has been moved, in circumstances where no allegations of wrongdoing have been made against this man, tells you all you need to know about the motives and the modus operandi of the Australian Labor Party. Would that there were anybody sitting on the benches opposite who had served Australia as well, over more than 20 years of public service, as Arthur Sinodinos, but we look around their depleted ranks and there is no-one. There is not one of them who can boast a record of public service as distinguished as that of Arthur Sinodinos.


This government upholds and demands the highest of ministerial standards, and those ministerial standards require the highest probity of every minister. Those are standards by which Senator Sinodinos has conducted himself just as every minister in the Abbott government has conducted themselves. Let me say it again because it cannot be stressed often enough: this motion—this disgraceful motion that has been foreshadowed by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, the former CFMEU official, Senator Penny Wong—is a motion designed to humiliate and smear a man against whom there have been no allegations made of wrongdoing, against whom Senator Wong in her speech was unable to formulate any allegation of wrongdoing, against whom no member of Labor Party has been able to formulate any allegation of wrongdoing merely because he is a witness. If the Labor Party have specific allegations of wrongdoing, let them come forward with them. They should put up or shut up before they smear the reputation of a man who is a greater Australian than any of them.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2014-03-19,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (09:56):  In my view it is untenable and unacceptable for the Assistant Treasurer, if he is to remain in that position, to fail to make now a full, complete and comprehensive statement to the parliament about all aspects of his involvement in Australian Water Holdings, given the circumstances we face. The facts of the matter are these. Senator Sinodinos made a statement in the Senate about these matters on 28 February last year. That, of course, was before he was sworn in as Assistant Treasurer. Since that time, all Senator Sinodinos has been willing to do or say in the chamber is that he has stood by that earlier statement. I say that is no longer good enough. I certainly say that is no longer tenable.


Why? Because there is now incontrovertible evidence that Senator Sinodinos's statement of last year, for whatever reason, was not complete, was not accurate and cannot stand. My leader, Senator Wong, has mentioned three elements, and I would reinforce those. In Senator Sinodinos's statement to the Senate last year he said he had no role. He said:


I played no role in the awarding of the January 2012 contract to AWH by Sydney Water.


But we now know he wrote on 29 August a letter copied to the Premier and finance minister about the contractual relationship between AWH and Sydney Water. As a result of evidence in ICAC yesterday we now know further to that that he was present at a meeting about contractual arrangements on 6 September 2011 between AWH and Sydney Water.


We also know that Senator Sinodinos served concurrently as first a non-executive director of AWH and then as its chairman and, at the same time, in a role in the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party as both the treasurer and its president. He said in his statement last year that, at that time, donations from AWH were handled by the management of the organisation at their discretion. We now hear this from counsel assisting the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales: 'From the records I have seen it seems that Sydney Water has unwillingly, unknowingly, been a principal donor to the Liberal Party. But, at the time, Sydney Water could not and would not have known that this was occurring and could not get access to the documents which would have established that it was occurring. All it knew was that the administration costs were excessive, and this blew up into a dispute.'


I do believe it is untenable to argue, given the positions that Senator Sinodinos held, that either as a director or chairman on the one hand, or as an official of the Liberal Party on the other hand, he knew nothing about this. He should have, if he did not. Finally, I point out that the personal loan agreement with members of the Obeid family, which Senator Sinodinos informed the Senate about in his statement, is a sham as well. That personal loan agreement was in fact a 30 per cent shareholding in AWH. Yes, there are issues that should be addressed in this chamber. Yes, Senator Sinodinos's previous statement was incomplete, appears inaccurate and certainly demands further clarification. (Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2014-03-19,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (10:01):  Those opposite have not made a case for the suspension of standing orders. Those opposite have not made a case as to why government business should be suspended. They have not made a case as to why debate on the carbon tax repeal legislation should be further delayed. They have not made a case as to why debate on the minerals tax repeal legislation should be further delayed. If suspension of standing orders were granted, if we on this side supported that, we would be complicit in facilitating smear by motion. We would be complicit in facilitating an abuse of Senate procedure.


I think it is important to put some facts on the record in relation to the matters that are before us. They relate to matters that predated assumption of ministerial office by Senator Sinodinos. There have been no matters raised that relate in any way to the performance or execution of Senator Sinodinos's ministerial duties. Let me reiterate what Senator Abetz and Senator Brandis have said already. There are no allegations against Senator Sinodinos. There are no specific allegations against Senator Sinodinos. There is only smear and innuendo.


I listened very carefully to Senator Wong's contribution and I listened very carefully to Senator Faulkner's contribution. I think all of us in this chamber would accept that Senator Faulkner is one of the more forensic prosecutors in this chamber. As I have said previously, we know that, when a Labor attack is failing, 'in case of emergency break glass and deploy Senator Faulkner and his well honed gravitas'. Senator Faulkner did not, in any way, shape or form, level an allegation against Senator Sinodinos. I think it is very telling that the most forensic Labor senator—perhaps the Labor senator most capable of prosecuting cases—has not raised a single allegation against Senator Sinodinos.


I think all of us in this chamber, even those on the opposite side, when they quietly reflect and are being honest with themselves, recognise that Senator Sinodinos is a diligent minister. I think all in this chamber, including those opposite, when they privately and quietly reflect, would acknowledge that Senator Sinodinos is a man of great integrity. He is a man of strong character. He is someone I have known for the best part of 20 years. He is someone I see as a mentor. He is someone whose character and integrity are beyond reproach. He had a professional life before he entered this place. That is not in dispute. And, yes, there is an inquiry in New South Wales into certain matters, and Senator Sinodinos is cooperating in that forum. As has been mentioned, attendance as a witness at an ICAC hearing is not in any way an indication of wrongdoing. Senator Sinodinos has declared that he will be vindicated.


In talking about ICAC, I think it is important that we remember what the inception of ICAC was, what led to its creation by the incoming Liberal government in New South Wales in 1988. It was a response to endemic, systemic corruption in the Labor Party in New South Wales and in the former Wran and Unsworth governments. That is why the ICAC was established, because of the corruption that was manifest in the New South Wales Labor government. I am sure we will hear in subsequent debates a little bit more about that systemic corruption.


Senator Sinodinos has given an account of himself, a good account of himself, in response to questions asked of him in this place. Senator Sinodinos has served this nation well. He was chief of staff to the Prime Minister and was made an officer of the Order of Australia in recognition of his contribution. He has made a magnificent and significant contribution to Australian politics, to Australian public policy and to the nation more broadly. He is a distinguished Australian. He is a respected Australian. I have confidence in Arthur Sinodinos's integrity. The smears should cease. The allegations should cease. If you have an allegation, make it.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2014-03-19,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (10:17):  I move:


That—


(1) the Senate requires the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Sinodinos) to immediately attend the Chamber to provide the Senate with a full explanation of his dealings as a director of Australian Water Holdings, with particular reference to political donations, his shareholdings and his role in contract negotiations negotiations and his statement made in the Senate on 28 February 2013 and reaffirmed during question time on 6 March 2014;


(2) at the conclusion of the statement a senator may move to take note of the explanation; and


(3) if no statement has been made by Senator Sinodinos before 12 pm today, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) may immediately move a further motion relating to Senator Sinodinos' failure to comply.


We have heard a significant amount of hyperbole in the contributions of those opposite. I think it is useful if we go through what is being sought by the Senate and by the opposition.



Honourable senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Senator Wong has the right to be heard in silence. I remind senators that interjections are disorderly.




Senator WONG:
  Thank you. The assertion has been made that the only things confronting Senator Sinodinos are smears and innuendo. I make this factual point: this senator is being investigated by two separate anti-corruption inquiries—Operation Credo and Operation Spicer. Rather, his activities have been the subject of those inquiries. 


I also make this point. The opposition are seeking something very simple: we are seeking that Senator Sinodinos immediately attend the chamber to provide a full explanation on a range of matters that are set out in the motion. There are no allegations included in the motion, despite the hyperbole of those opposite.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senators, you will have your chance to debate this issue in a minute.




Senator WONG:
  Despite the assertions of those opposite and some of the overblown rhetoric on the other side, in fact all the opposition is seeking and has put before the chamber is a motion that requires the Assistant Treasurer to immediately attend the chamber to provide a full explanation. If the senator has nothing to hide, if the senator has—



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I have Senator Macdonald just persistently interjecting. I would appreciate it—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I remind Senator Macdonald that interjections are disorderly and Senator Wong has the right to be heard in silence.




Senator WONG:
  It has been asserted by those opposite that this is an abuse of process. I would make this point: the government say they want to have the carbon price voted on quickly, but they did not give leave for this motion to be moved, which required a suspension of standing orders today, and they sought to call a division even on a procedural motion around precedence, which also took up time, which seems somewhat odd if you really, as a government, do want to get on to voting on the carbon bills.


I return now to the issues before us, and I again say there are many matters in the public arena which, given Senator Sinodinos's past statements and his position as a minister of the Crown, really do demand that he come to the chamber and make an explanation. It may be that he has answers to the questions which are raised. It may be that he has a clear explanation for many of the apparent inconsistencies between what he has told the chamber and what counsel assisting the Independent Commission Against Corruption has asserted in his opening statement. It may be there are answers to all of these matters. If that is the case, there is a very simple course of action which the minister can take. He can come to this chamber and he can give a full statement. He has chosen not to do that. We gave him plenty of opportunity yesterday in question time, and he chose not to take the opportunity, other than to say he would be vindicated.


There are a few things I want to go through which explain some of the issues between the statement that was made on 28 February by the senator and statements on the public record. I go first to this assertion in the statement:


I played no role in the awarding of the January 2012 contract to AWH by Sydney Water.


I remind the Senate again that this was a statement made on 28 February 2013, acknowledged to be prior to Senator Sinodinos becoming a minister, but he has subsequently affirmed the statement as a minister, by way of his answer in question time on Thursday, 6 March. In relation to the assertion 'I played no role in the awarding of the January 2012 contract', there are two pieces of evidence which have come to light in the Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry. The first is that Senator Sinodinos, as chairman of the company, wrote to the chair of Sydney Water, ccd to both the Premier of New South Wales and the Minister for Finance, in relation to contractual negotiations. He requests in that letter:


I believe the best way forward is an urgent roundtable meeting that we attend with the Shareholding Ministers to resolve this matter once and for all. I would suggest that you and the Managing Director of Sydney attend this meeting.


In addition, yesterday in the Independent Commission Against Corruption, a Mr Rippon, who I understand is an officer of Australian Water Holdings, confirmed that, subsequent to that letter, a meeting was in fact held, on 6 September 2011, to discuss the contract negotiations which resulted in the awarding of the contract in 2012. I should say: the subsequent event to this meeting—and, presumably, some other discussions—was the awarding of the contract in 2012. He confirms that Mr de Girolamo and Mr Sinodinos were both at that meeting. It may be that Senator Sinodinos has a very clear explanation as to why he can say on the one hand that he played no role in the awarding of the contract but on the other hand he both cc'd to the Premier and attended a meeting to discuss the very issue which included the awarding of the contract and contractual relationships. Maybe there is an explanation, but I think a fair-minded person would say it is a little difficult to understand how you can assert you have no role in the awarding of the contract if, on the face of the public record, there is a letter which requests a meeting to deal with these issues and then a meeting to deal with these issues. It may be that nothing was discussed at the meeting. It may be that there is another explanation. But we do not know, because that question has not been answered by Senator Sinodinos.


The second point I would make is in relation to donations. Let us recall that this is at a time when, on the basis of the evidence, extraordinarily corrupt conduct appears to have been occurring within AWH. Amongst the allegations about the misuse of money, which has been made on the public record, is an allegation of the use of money from Sydney Water being used in effect to make donations to the Liberal Party. As far as I can see from the time frames, at all material times in relation to this issue, Senator Sinodinos was an office-bearer in both the Liberal Party and Australian Water Holdings. He was a director and then chairman, and I believe he held two different offices, one of which was treasurer, inside the Liberal Party. He asserts—he has very carefully worded it, and I will read it—in his statement on February 2013:


In relation to the political donations by Australian Water, these were handled by the management of the organisation at their discretion. I do not recollect donations to political parties being discussed at board level.


Then he goes on to talk about disclosure laws. So he does not go in his statement at all as to whether he knew that money that was being paid by Sydney Water was, amongst other things—it was not the only improper use of that money—being used to provide donations to the Liberal Party.


The assertion by counsel assisting the commission is as follows:


Australian Water Holdings were making big donations to the Liberal Party—$20,000 here, $30,000 there—and on what I have seen, those donations were bundled up into the expenses and charged back to Sydney Water. From the records I have seen, it seems that Sydney Water has unwillingly, unknowingly been a principal donor to the Liberal Party.


It might be that Senator Sinodinos can explain how it is possible to be a director and chair of an organisation that is engaging in this activity and not be aware of it. It might be that he can explain how it is possible for him to be an office-bearer of the Liberal Party at this time and not be aware of substantial donations. I think it is even more difficult for him to explain how he can be an office-bearer of both organisations—the payer and the payee—and not know about it. He may have an explanation for these matters. If he does, I think it is incumbent upon him—and in my submission to the chamber it is incumbent upon him—to attend and make that explanation. I think the public is entitled to know how it is possible Sydney Water—and, remember, ultimately this is the users of Sydney Water who are paying for this—money was funnelled to the Liberal Party at a time that Senator Sinodinos was both an office-bearer of AWH and an office-bearer of the Liberal Party and for him not to know about it. I suggest that it would be in Senator Sinodinos's interests for him to explain that fact. A failure to do so leaves the public, and the Senate, with this observation: Senator Sinodinos omits discussing this in his statement to the Senate, but on the public record there are very serious allegations of the misuse of this money. That is the second apparent inconsistency between his statement and his—



Senator Brandis interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  Order! Senator Brandis, Senator Wong has the right to be heard in silence.




Senator WONG:
  As I said, it is an apparent inconsistency—it may not be inconsistent; he may have an explanation. But it does seem very odd, I am sure, to any reasonable person watching this debate or looking at these documents, for it to be believed that one could not know anything about what was occurring, when one was an office-bearer of both organisations.


The third point that Senator Sinodinos needs to address is in relation to the—I think it has been described as a sham—loan agreement with the Obeid family. Senator Sinodinos does go to this issue in his statement. He said, and again, the words are very precise:


I became non-executive chairman of AWH on 3 November 2010. I was not aware that, at around this time, the CEO of the company had negotiated what has been reported as a personal loan agreement with members of the Obeid family, secured against shares in Australian Water Holdings. I believe that there should have been such a disclosure made to me.


What we now know is that on 4 November 2010—so this is the day after Senator Sinodinos became chair—the loan agreement was struck. The heads of agreement was signed on 4 November 2010. This particular transaction has also been the subject of evidence and comment at the Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry, and is one instance of apparently corrupt conduct within AWH. Senator Sinodinos in his statement deliberately does not go to when he knew about that arrangement—




Senator Abetz:
  Deliberately? How do you know that?




Senator WONG:
  Senator Abetz, I used the word 'deliberately', that is true; I should probably replace it, I agree with that. In his statement, Senator Sinodinos does not go to when he knew about the arrangement. I would say to the chamber: if you are the chair of a company, and a multimillion dollar agreement—which is described subsequently in the Commission Against Corruption inquiry as being a sham loan agreement—is entered into the day after you became chair—I do think it is incumbent upon Senator Sinodinos to explain when he became aware of that. It does seem somewhat odd that you could be chair of a company which enters into such an extraordinary agreement—on the day after you have become chair—and you would have no knowledge about it. It may be that Senator Sinodinos knows nothing about it. It may be that he knows something about it. It may mean—




Senator Brandis:
  Well, maybe you are just making something out of nothing!




Senator WONG:
  I will take the interjection. The suggestion from the first law officer of the land is that I am making something out of nothing; I know that the Liberal Party does not like to look at the facts in this matter. There are extraordinarily serious allegations being made in the Commission Against Corruption inquiry that include—



Senator Brandis interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Wong has the right to be heard in silence.




Senator WONG:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. There are extraordinarily—



Senator Brandis interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Please take your seat, Senator Wong. I will remind the Senate for the fourth time that senators have the right to be heard in silence and that interjections are disorderly.




Senator WONG:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Unlike Senator Brandis, I do not think the public is airily dismissing the allegations which are being made at the Commission Against Corruption inquiry. I do not think the public thinks that having a corrupt set of activities by an entity, whereby money from water users is channelled to inappropriate purposes—including payments to the Liberal Party and a sham arrangement with the Obeid family—is something that can be airily dismissed by a man who is supposed to be the first law officer of the land.


It may be that Senator Sinodinos has a clear explanation as to how, the day after he became chair, this sham arrangement which is the subject of a corruption investigation could have been entered into. It may be that he did not know about it. It may be that he did know about it but was misled as to its nature. I do not know. But I say to the Senate: if you come into this place and you give a statement which references some of what has occurred but omits key facts about what else has occurred, then you are entitled to be asked by this Senate to provide further details. That is particularly so when there are assertions on the public record which go specifically to the omissions in your statement, and it is particularly so when you are a minister of the Crown. Whilst all of us in this place have an obligation to be truthful and frank with this chamber, I would remind those opposite that, amongst other things, the Statement of Ministerial Standards also requires in relation to ministers that 'their conduct in a private capacity upholds the laws of Australia, and demonstrates appropriately high standards of personal integrity'. That is what is required of ministers: that their conduct in a private capacity upholds the laws of Australia and demonstrates appropriately high standards of personal integrity. If Senator Sinodinos has something to say in response to the allegations and assertions which have been put on the public record in the Commission Against Corruption inquiry, I think that, as a minister, he should come in and make that statement.


I am going to close now. I just want to make a comment about the statement of standards. This is a government that has been in office for around six months. In that short time we have seen the trashing of ministerial conduct and accountability and a contempt for this parliament. I would say this: this Prime Minister is a dangerous combination of arrogance and weakness. He is arrogant in leading a government which refuses to be accountable to the public and weak in failing to uphold his own statement of ministerial standards. A prime minister who stood by the high standards of conduct which are expected of ministers in his own statement of ministerial standards would have required the Assistant Treasurer to attend this Senate and make an appropriate and full explanation.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2014-03-19,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (10:37):  'In this country politicians are not judge and jury, and there are proper processes that have to be followed. We live in a society where there are proper processes. There are proper authorities who look at evidence and make decisions about how that evidence should be treated. They make decisions about enforcement. Those authorities are not the parliament.' So spoke, guess who? None other than Senator Wong, chief prosecutor in this case. Oh, what tangled webs we weave! 


Senator Wong has really been caught out today, has she not? She has tried to be the Penny Mason of the Senate and she has failed—and failed dismally. She has not been able to make out any case against Senator Arthur Sinodinos—not a single case. Indeed, I am reminded that, in matters such as this, mere repetition is no substitute for evidence. If this presentation of Senator Wong had been heard anywhere else, there would have been no need for myself or anybody on the government side to get up to run the defence case, because there is simply no case to answer on any of the matters that Senator Wong tried to put before this place.


I have to give Senator Wong full marks—she gets 10 out of 10 for sanctimony, 10 out of 10 for smear—but she gets nil out of 10 for substance. There was absolutely no substance to any of the matters that she raised. I must say that Pecksniffian attitude of those opposite—of the Green-Labor alliance, yet again in full collusion with each other in support of this motion—is absolutely gobsmacking. At the very worst it appears that, somewhere along the way, somebody may have made, if you add them all up, donations to the Liberal Party of some $70,000-plus in this case. 



An opposition senator:  It was a bit more than that.




Senator ABETZ:
  Even if it was a bit more than that—$75,000 or whatever it may be—do we recall a leader of another national party personally negotiating a deal with somebody for the biggest donation ever in Australian history? He personally negotiated it, and the person who gave the money said afterwards, 'I think it was a good investment.' The person who negotiated it and received it said, 'I will be forever grateful.' That would not have been the Australian Greens by any chance, would it? Here they are running into the parliament and claiming somehow Senator Sinodinos should give an explanation with particular reference to political donations. When Senator Brown—when he was Senator Brown—was in this place, the Australian Greens and Labor were invited to provide such an explanation from Senator Brown, but where were they? Absolutely nowhere to be seen! Somehow a donation of on thirteenthof that—less than 10 per cent—is worthy of a full and detailed explanation! 


It is interesting that in this motion there is absolutely no allegation made against Senator Sinodinos nor is there any suggestion of inconsistency in statements by Senator Sinodinos. All he has been asked to do is provide a full explanation of his dealings and his role in contract negotiations. I would have thought if you were to bring somebody before the Senate to explain something, you would ask them to explain one statement as opposed to another statement to show some inconsistency—and then there would be some substance to the motion. Talk about a trawl! I thought Labor and the Greens, like us, were against supertrawlers, but this beats them all. This motion was a great supertrawl—an attempt to catch anything that might be in the water. Senator Wong, after 20 tedious minutes, pulled the net in and—do you know what?—there was nothing in the net. There was absolutely nothing in the net! There was no substance to those matters that she sought to assert.


What Senator Wong was saying was very interesting. She was saying, 'We're not actually making any allegations; we're just half hinting at them.' Yet, the smear was in, because Senator Collins was interjecting non-stop in the previous motion and saying, 'The facts speak for themselves.' I think Senator Collins has already prejudged the issue, as have all those on the other side. Let's not have this pretence that you have not prejudged the issue. Of course, you have. That is why Senator Faulkner came in and made statements such as that there was 'incontrovertible evidence'. The case is shut—it is closed—if there is incontrovertible evidence, is it not? It means that Senator Faulkner once again got out of the naphthalene—out of the mothballs. You always know when Senator Faulkner is about to make a speech in this place, because there is this waft of naphthalene across the chamber; you immediately know that Senator Faulkner has been brought out of the cupboard again because he is the past master at smear. The only reason he comes into this place is to either eulogise some Labor luminary that has passed on or to smear people on this side. Does he make a contribution to public debate? No, absolutely not. All he wants to do is play the very ugly partisan: 'All Labor good, all Liberal bad; all coalition bad, all Labor good.' We know what his tactic is. As Senator Fifield said, the Labor Party look around their ranks, depleted as they are in intellectual talent, and then they have to reach into the naphthalene and get out Senator Faulkner to make his character-destroying contributions. Senator Collins and Senator Faulkner have both already prejudged the issue, yet Senator Wong is pretending and claiming that they have not prejudged the issue. Well, I think the facts speak for themselves.


What has brought Senator Wong to this motion seeking a full explanation? It was the circumstances in which the very questions asked by the Leader of the Opposition in this place, yesterday, had to be ruled out of order. So incompetent and so incapable of understanding the processes under the standing orders of this place, the Leader of the Opposition was humiliated by having her own questions ruled out of order. Just in case anybody listening is thinking that, as there has been a change of government, the chances are that there was a Liberal in the chair, no, there was not. In fact it was the Labor President of the Senate who ruled out of order the Labor leader's questions in the Senate. That is how incompetent those questions were; that is how out of order they were. You would have thought—and this is no reflection on Senator Hogg; I think he does an exceptionally good job—that, if there would be any bias, it might be just slightly towards the Labor Party. But he, as a Labor Party senator, as President of this place, could not bring himself to find some excuse to rule in favour of Senator Wong's questions. Having fallen flat on her face in one of the most embarrassing displays by a Leader of the Opposition in this place, she tries to regroup and regain her credibility by coming in here at 9.30 this morning to move this tawdry motion to try to smear Senator Sinodinos by implication.


We as a government will not have anything to do with those sorts of tactics, and that is why we have stood up to oppose this outrageous smear and this outrageous tactic. Let us make no mistake; the other part of the Labor-Greens tactic is that they do not want to be seen as being on the record as having voted against carbon tax repeal, mining tax repeal, or the re-establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. They are all matters that they want to hide under the carpet whilst the Western Australian Senate election is in the offing.


Senator Sinodinos has made a statement to this place. Has an allegation been made against Senator Sinodinos? No, there has not been any allegation. Has he been called as a witness to assist ICAC? Yes, he has. Is he assisting? Absolutely, and he has said that, when and as he is called, he will appear and give a full and frank account of himself. I think it is important to understand that nobody is suggesting that Senator Sinodinos should stand aside. Indeed, in this morning's The Canberra Times there was an article by Norman Abjorensen which said:


Nowhere is it alleged that Senator Sinodinos acted improperly, dishonestly or corruptly. He will give evidence at a later hearing to explain his role, and that will be eagerly awaited.


I say amen to that. That is how it should be and, indeed, that is how it should be according to Senator Wong, whom I quoted at the very beginning of my speech. They are the standards that Senator Wong applied when she was a minister, yet now, in opposition, those standards seem to be out of the window.


When Andrew Leigh, the member for Canberra, was asked about the proposition that Arthur Sinodinos should step down he answered: 'I don't think so on the evidence that I have seen.' Mr Albanese, the attacking Rottweiler of the Labor Party, said, 'These are serious matters, but they are matters that are before proceedings and therefore should not be pursued.' You have to love this, don't you? The only person that has asked for Senator Sinodinos to stand down is the ALP member who rejoices in the name of Thomson, not Craig on this occasion but Kelvin Thomson. He said, 'Mr Sinodinos should step aside.' Mr Thomson enters this public debate about credibility and about ensuring the highest of standards in public life clothed with the fact that he was the MP who provided Melbourne gangland figure Tony Mokbel with a personal reference. The credibility that he brings to this debate is the great standard he set as an MP by providing a reference to a gangland figure, and he says, 'According to my standards, Senator Sinodinos should step aside.' Nobody else has said that in any way, shape or form. Indeed, you have heard time and time again that there has been no allegation against Senator Sinodinos and no suggestion that he has acted improperly, dishonestly or corruptly.


The suggestion is made by Senator Wong that, at all stages, Senator Sinodinos was a part of the board or was an office bearer. Well, yes, but was Senator Wong an office bearer within the Labor Party when Michael Williamson, who is now in jail, was the National President of the Labor Party? Should we clothe her with all his misdeeds? According to the Labor Party standards at the moment, yes, we should, but my own view is that, no, we should not. We need to be mature and consistent in relation to these matters.


Senator Wong suggests that, without an explanation from Senator Sinodinos, this parliament would somehow be treated with contempt. This is the same senator who, in cahoots with Greens senators, voted over 200 times in three years to guillotine legislation through this place. Oh, that is not contempt! Anything Labor does by definition must be good.


Can I simply say that, in relation to an explanation, Senator Sinodinos has provided one. He will provide whatever evidence is asked of him by ICAC. Therefore, the question is: why should we be passing a motion which invites the Senate to further consider this matter in the event that Senator Sinodinos does not provide a statement before 12 noon today—a statement which supposedly tells us that he has to give a full explanation of his dealings as a director of Australian Water Holdings? This motion calls for a full explanation of his dealings in all areas—nothing is excluded—and with particular reference to political donations and his shareholdings. We all know that any entitlement that he may have had to shareholdings were renounced over 12 months ago—all on the public record. We know all about that, so why does that need to be spoken of—and 'his role in contract negotiations negotiations'? This is an example of how hurriedly and sloppily this motion was put together: 'and his role in contract negotiations negotiations'. They cannot even get the motion right. They were that excited that whoever did it typed the word twice. Senator Wong could not have even proofread it, and into the chamber it goes—defective on its face, defective in substance and defective in the effected sanctimony and self-righteousness that is behind this.


The Labor Party and the Greens know that there is no need for Senator Sinodinos to present himself to this chamber. What is more, they know by their own standards, according to Senator Wong on 30 April 2012 and indeed on 25 May 2012 in those statements that I read out at the very beginning of this debate, that when there is a proper process in place it should be followed, that the proper standards should be applied. Yet Senator Wong could not help herself. She told us—if I got the quote down right—'It's a little difficult for a fair-minded person to consider certain statements by Mr Sinodinos.' What she was suggesting, which was quite breathtaking, was that she, Senator Wong, was the epitome of the fair-mind person—I think not. And I think, as she reflects in her office, as we are in this chamber, she might think that chances are it is a bit over the top to try to claim that status for herself.


Very simply, there are no allegations against Senator Sinodinos, no substance and no reason why he needs to make a full explanation and talk about the 'negotiations negotiations'—whatever that might mean. Senator Faulkner, in his contribution, might actually deal with the substance of the motion rather than the smear. At the end of the day, there are proper procedures in place for these matters to be ventilated, and they will be. In the meantime—and I want to stress this—we as a government are absolutely committed to getting on with the business of running this country, of getting rid of the carbon tax, of getting rid of the mining tax, of re-instituting the Australian Building and Construction Commission and of cutting green and red tape. Chances are it is no coincidence that, on the very day that we announce hundreds of millions of dollars of extra red tape costs being removed from the Australian economy—something that we promised at the last election—the Labor-Greens alliance in this place come up with this stunt to try to divert attention from the fact that we as a government are getting on with the job of creating an environment where the Labor legacy of unemployment can be dealt with and people can be given hope again that they do have a future, that we will bring down the cost of living and that there will be a job for their children and their grandchildren. That is the real task of this place, and that is what we as a government will continue to pursue to the very best of our ability, and we will not be distracted by these pathetic stunts by Senator Wong, Senator Faulkner and the like.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-03-19,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (10:57):  I rise to speak in support of this motion on behalf of the Australian Greens. This is a motion calling on Assistant Treasurer Senator Sinodinos:


… to immediately attend the Chamber to provide the Senate with a full explanation of his dealings as a director of Australian Water Holdings, with particular reference to political donations, his shareholdings and his role in contract negotiations … and his statement made in the Senate on 28 February 2013 and reaffirmed during question time on 6 March 2014;


The motion goes on to say:


… if no statement has been made … before 12 pm today, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate … may immediately move a further motion relating to Senator Sinodinos' failure to comply.


For those who may be listening to this debate and a little confused about the background to it, I just indicate that this motion to have the Assistant Treasurer attend the Senate and give a full explanation is in relation to statements that he has made in the Senate previously—statements which, in the view of many of us, are characterised by omissions. We are concerned about the omissions in those statements, as well as what has been said in those statements. We know that Senator Sinodinos served as a director of Australian Water Holdings for three years, at a time when it was lobbying for a lucrative state government contract, which could have earned the senator between $10 million and $20 million from his shareholdings in the company.


In relation to the hearings into Australian Water Holdings by the ICAC in New South Wales, Senator Sinodinos has been requested to attend and provide evidence. Counsel assisting the ICAC, Mr Watson SC, has said:


It's … difficult to offer observations on the conduct of Mr Sinodinos—


and we acknowledge that Senator Sinodinos has not given evidence before the ICAC yet. Mr Watson continued:


It's quite transparent that Mr Sinodinos's true role in Australian Water Holdings was to open lines of communication with the Liberal party and there will be evidence that he tried to do so.


This goes to the heart of why the Australian Greens are supporting this motion at this time. It is because, increasingly, there is a murky revolving door that the Australian public are becoming aware of, with great concern, where business is linked, by donations to political parties, to the parliament. It is a revolving door. We have business donations to political parties and representatives in the parliament—and it goes round and round. It is murky territory that we see more and more in Australian public life, and the public, I think, is becoming increasingly concerned about that.


We need to have transparency. We need to be able to get to the bottom of what is occurring in these kinds of dealings that we are hearing about all too often. Given that, at this stage, we do not have processes for a national investigation of this kind of conduct, unfortunately it is then left to the parliament to try and require full explanations to be given.


I go now to some of the key elements of ministerial responsibility, which is such an important aspect of the Australian system of parliament. I refer here to the key elements recognised in the code of conduct that ministers are required to sign up to when they take on that important role being a minister. They are obligations in relation to dealing with lobbyists, obligations to disclose investments, bans on lobbying after someone has become a minister and bans on fundraising at the Lodge and Kirribilli. They go to show the importance with which the whole parliament treats matters to do with the conduct of ministers. We know that, in our Australian system, ministers are clearly responsible for both their acts and their omissions, and ignorance of a matter does not excuse a minister. These are just fundamental principles that I am referring to here. These are important principles.


When it comes to actually being able to investigate those and having some means of ensuring that ministerial responsibility is upheld, academics in Australia have pointed out consistently that the code of conduct should be enforced by an independent commissioner such as a parliamentary ethics or integrity commissioner, because in the absence of the means of enforcing that concept of ministerial responsibility, too often there are allegations, there are concerns raised, which are never properly, fundamentally, dealt with. In the absence of that kind of national commission, we now find ourselves in this position, where we are trying to require the minister to come and face the Senate and provide the full explanation that we believe the Australian public and this House are entitled to.


Because we need to have this transparency, the Australian Greens have consistently said that we need to have a national integrity commissioner to look into these kinds of issues. We have had various matters over recent years, and probably not so recent years, where issues about ministerial responsibility have been of great concern but there has not been an ability for adequate follow-up. We have ICACs in some states, such as in New South Wales, which is of course where some of this information is being examined. There is a bill before this parliament that the Australian Greens introduced, the National Integrity Commission Bill 2013, a private senator's bill, because there is currently no national anticorruption agency that can investigate claims of misconduct and corruption across the federal parliament and Commonwealth agencies. This is a glaring omission in making sure that members of parliament and Commonwealth agents are acting with the degree of integrity that the Australian public has a right to expect.


A national anticorruption and integrity commission, as envisaged by this Australian Greens bill, would protect the integrity of the federal parliament, parliamentarians and all Commonwealth departments. It would maintain integrity and help prevent corruption. At the moment, South Australia and—well, that is not true anymore; South Australia does have an anticorruption commission now; so, according to my notes, Victoria is the only state that does not have an anticorruption commission.




Senator Fifield:
  Incorrect. 




Senator WRIGHT:
  And that is incorrect too.




Senator Fifield:
  That's incorrect.




Senator WRIGHT:
  So these notes may be out of date. Then—thank you, Senator Fifield—that makes the case even more for why it is a glaring omission that the states have these commissions but there is no national one. The Greens private senator's bill will provide the infrastructure to challenge corruption by establishing the National Integrity Commission as an independent—and that is an important word: independent—statutory agency. It would establish three co-dependent offices. The National Office of the Integrity Commissioner would be based largely on the successful New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption model. It would absorb the existing Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, ACLEI, and create a new office of the Independent Parliamentary Adviser to advise MPs and ministers on entitlement claims and the ethical running of their offices that the public rightly expects. We know as members of parliament and senators that often there is a somewhat grey area in understanding the requirements in relation to entitlements, and I think many of us would welcome the ability to be able to go to an independent adviser who could tell us how we should be acting in that situation.


The Australian Greens' bill would also establish a parliamentary joint committee on the National Integrity Commission to see that that commission was accountable to the parliament. The National Office of the Integrity Commissioner would actively prevent and investigate misconduct and corruption in all Commonwealth departments and agencies, and among federal parliamentarians and their staff. As I said, at the moment there is no ability to look into those things. This would fill the largest gap in our country's anticorruption framework. Its powers would be based largely on provisions in the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006.


Unfortunately, for the time being, we do not have such a commission. In the absence of such a body, when legitimate questions have been raised about the Assistant Treasurer's dealings and about the omissions from the statement he made on 28 February, the only means available to the parliament to pursue the matter is to require the Assistant Treasurer to attend the Senate and give a full explanation—today.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2014-03-19,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (11:07):  I have been invited by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Abetz, to put a case in support of Senator Wong's motion and I certainly intend to do so. I believe that, in the circumstances we face, it is absolutely essential that Senator Sinodinos come into this chamber and make a full and comprehensive statement explaining all aspects of his involvement with Australian Water Holdings, a company of which he was firstly a non-executive director and then the chairman.


I have been very consistent in these sorts of circumstances, regardless of which political party has been in government, in taking the position that the proper course of action for any minister whose actions, behaviour or propriety have been questioned is to come into the Senate and lay out the facts. This is particularly important in this case because Senator Sinodinos, then a backbench senator, did make a statement to the Senate on 28 February 2013 about these matters. Since making his statement over a year ago, Senator Sinodinos has made it very clear that he has stood by that statement—in fact all previous statements—on the issue of Australian Water Holdings.


The problem that Senator Sinodinos faces is simply this: there is now incontrovertible evidence that that statement—the only statement that Senator Sinodinos has made about this matter—of more than a year ago was not a complete statement and not an accurate statement. We know that. As a result, a further statement is required. The original statement cannot stand, given the circumstances and given the evidence we have before us now.


I will focus on three elements of the statement. I touched on this in my brief contribution to the debate on the suspension of standing orders a little earlier this morning. We know that Senator Sinodinos was firstly a non-executive director and then became chairman of Australian Water Holdings. We know that concurrently he served first as treasurer and then as president of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party. But we now also know that, while Senator Sinodinos was serving as an officeholder in both organisations, Sydney Water became a principal donor to the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party. But Sydney Water did not know this. We now know it; Sydney Water did not.


As counsel assisting the ICAC, Mr Geoffrey Watson SC, said:


From the records I have seen, it seems that Sydney Water has unwillingly, unknowingly been a principal donor to the Liberal Party.


At the time, Sydney Water could not and would not have known this was occurring and could not get access to the documents that would have established it was occurring. All it knew was that the administration costs were excessive, and this blew up into a dispute.


Courtesy of what has occurred at the New South Wales ICAC hearings, we also know that, as Mr Watson has said:


Based upon the PricewaterhouseCoopers valuation, if the PPP came through Mr Sinodinos would have enjoyed a $10 to $20 million payday.


It is presently difficult to offer observations on the conduct of Mr Sinodinos. He has other involvements which will come under scrutiny in Operation Spicer.


Mr Watson also said:


It is quite transparent that Mr Sinodinos's true role in Australian Water Holdings—


and I stress this—


was to open lines of communication with the Liberal Party. There will be evidence that he tried to do so.


Now, the fact is—



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator FAULKNER:
  You just listen to my contribution, Senator Brandis, and you will learn something. The truth is that the company, Australian Water Holdings, were making major donations to the Liberal Party and charging them back to Sydney Water. That is the first thing we now know, and, of course, that was not known at the time that Senator Sinodinos made his statement. I am concerned that credulity is being stretched to breaking point on this matter that a non-executive director, then chairman, of Australian Water Holdings, while at the same time Treasurer, then President, of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party, had no knowledge, in either role, of this extraordinary amount of money being channelled to the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party from AWH.


The second issue that I would like to focus on in the brief time that is available to me relates to the awarding of a contract to AWH by Sydney Water. In Senator Sinodinos's statement to the Senate last year he said:


I played no role in the awarding of the January 2012 contract to AWH by Sydney Water.


But we do know now that Senator Sinodinos, as chairman of Australian Water Holdings, wrote a letter to Dr Thomas Parry AM, the chairman of Sydney Water Corporation, on 29 August 2011 about the contractual relationship between AWH and Sydney Water. We also know for the record—and completeness of the record—that that letter was copied to the New South Wales Premier and the New South Wales Minister for Finance. Further, according to the evidence in ICAC, we now know that there was a meeting about these contractual arrangements, on 6 September 2011, between Sydney Water and Australian Water Holdings. I commend page 153T of the ICAC transcript, where it is made clear that Mr Rippon, then Mr Sinodinos and Mr di Girolamo were present.


The third issue I raise is about Senator Sinodinos's statement of last year to the Senate in relation to the Obeid family, where he said:


I became non-executive chairman of AWH on 3 November 2010. I was not aware that, at around this time, the CEO of the company had negotiated what has been reported as a personal loan agreement with members of the Obeid family, secured against shares in Australian Water Holdings. 


To be fair to him, he goes on to say:


I believe that there should have been such a disclosure made to me.


What we now know is that the personal loan agreement with members of the Obeid family that Senator Sinodinos referred to in his earlier statement to the Senate is a sham. We now know that that personal loan agreement was no such thing. It was, in fact, a 30 per cent shareholding in AWH. We know that Senator Sinodinos—then Mr Sinodinos—attended meetings with Eddie Obeid Jr, and we assume that Senator Sinodinos would have had some understanding of the Obeid family involvement—




Senator Brandis:
  Well, do not make the allegation if it is based on an assumption.




Senator FAULKNER:
  I was going to say that he would have had some understanding of their involvement in the Labor Party and the Australian political process. But, although he had meetings with Eddie Obeid Jr—who is from a very notorious family, I might say—he has indicated that he did not know that the Obeid family had an interest in Australian Water Holdings. I am perplexed by that. I am perplexed that someone who has had such a long experience in politics attended meetings with the person about such matters and it apparently never occurred to him that he had interest in the company.


 


Let me be clear about this. I am not suggesting that Senator Sinodinos acted corruptly. Not for one moment am I suggesting that Senator Sinodinos acted corruptly. I would not do that. I am not doing it. I would not do that. But I do suggest that Senator Sinodinos, in these circumstances, should make a full and complete statement to the Senate about his involvement in Australia Water Holdings, particularly as the only statement he has made—which he stands by—was made more than a year ago and on at least three parts that statement warrants further explanation to this chamber.


I am not going to take the time of the Senate to make clear again my view about those individuals in the Labor Party who I do know have acted corruptly in certain matters. Everyone knows the contempt in which I hold those individuals. And I do not accept an argument, and I will never accept the argument that appears to be being mounted, that if someone acts improperly in one political party then that is apparently some sort of defence broadly for the political behaviours of others. I do not accept that and I state again: in fact, unlike others, I do not argue wrongdoing on Senator Sinodinos's part. I am not arguing he has acted corruptly. I am arguing he should make a full explanation to the Senate for the reasons I have outlined.


I happen to believe that that is even more important given Senator Sinodinos's ministerial responsibility for the Corporations Act, for corporate governance. I have mentioned before the duties of company directors: care and diligence, good faith, proper use of position and proper use of information. We all know that ministers in any government must be able to assure the parliament—and, of course, to assure the Australian public—at all times that, in their private capacity, they have upheld the law and have demonstrated high standards of personal integrity. Of course, any individual who is the director of a company also has serious responsibilities about their conduct.


But what I argue for is full transparency on these matters. That is what this motion calls for: a full explanation from Senator Sinodinos. In these circumstances I would say to the Australian Senate that the case is absolutely overwhelming. I would urge Senator Sinodinos to make such a statement. I happen to believe, as I said yesterday, that it is very much in his interest to make such a statement. Any minister in that circumstance, I believe, should make such a statement, and I believe that Senator Sinodinos in this case simply has no choice.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2014-03-19,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (11:26):  This debate began at 9.30; it has been going for almost two hours. And we had to put up with almost two hours of the smearing and the trashing of and the attack by innuendo on the reputation of a great Australian, before the Labor Party, through Senator Faulkner, made the concession that disclosed and revealed the hollowness of their attack when Senator Faulkner said, 115 minutes into this debate:


I am not suggesting that Senator Sinodinos acted corruptly. Not for one moment … I would not do that.


Well, Senator Faulkner, what are you doing? What are you doing, with the stature you bring to this chamber as an experienced Labor Party elder statesman, by your contribution joining with the disgusting innuendo to that very effect that we have heard from Senator Wong, your leader? Nevertheless, let anybody who is listening to this broadcast know that Senator Faulkner, the Labor Party's elder statesman in this chamber, asserts:


I am not suggesting that Senator Sinodinos acted corruptly. Not for one moment … 


We have been, all morning, throughout the course of this debate, interjecting on Labor Party speakers, or demanding in our own speeches, that if the Labor Party has an allegation to make then let them make it. And it took two hours of the trashing of the reputation of this fine Australian before Senator Faulkner, their elder statesman, announced in the chamber: 'We have no allegation to make. We make no allegation.' So what has all this been about? What it has been about is a cowardly attack by Senator Wong and her colleagues on a much greater Australian than any of them will ever be.


Shakespeare defined a coward as a person who is 'willing to wound but afraid to strike'. What we have seen this morning in the chamber is a Shakespearean example of cowardice by Senator Penny Wong and her colleagues. They have been willing to wound Senator Sinodinos; they have been willing to trash his reputation not only as an honest man but as a great Australian. But they have been unwilling to strike, because every time we have called upon them to make their allegations they have failed to do so. Now, at last, their elder statesman, their most forensic prosecutor, comes into the chamber and says, 'We have no allegation to make.'


What a disgraceful performance from you. You should be ashamed of yourself. The case against Senator Arthur Sinodinos is the 'When did you stop beating your wife?' argument. That is all it is. It is smear, pure and simple.


What the debate has therefore been reduced to is a debate about whether or not a statement that Senator Sinodinos gave to this chamber on 28 February last year is full and accurate in all material respects in view of some evidence that was given at ICAC yesterday. Let us get this straight. No wrongdoing has been alleged against Senator Sinodinos at ICAC by counsel assisting, no wrongdoing has been alleged against Senator Sinodinos by any witness at ICAC and now we know, late in the piece, that no wrongdoing is being alleged against Senator Sinodinos by the Labor Party. But there has been a quibble about whether or not, in three respects identified by Senator Faulkner in his contribution, Senator Sinodinos's statement of 28 February last year is adequate.


In most of the discussion from Senator Wong, in 24 wearisome minutes of sleaze and innuendo, and from Senator Faulkner, in 20 minutes of posturing outrage which culminated in the concession that they had no allegation to make, both speakers concentrated on these words of Senator Sinodinos:


I played no role in the awarding of the January 2012 contract to AWH by Sydney Water.


What they did not read to you or to the Senate are the words that follow. Senator Sinodinos went on to say:


I was by then in the Senate and Mr Michael Costa—



Senator Back interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  Mr Michael Costa! You would not believe it, would you, Senator?



Senator Back interjecting—



Senator Ronaldson interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  We have Senator Wong, and Senator Faulkner, the tribune of righteousness, here. But we are getting a bit weary of Senator Faulkner's Diogenes act, as he wanders around the landscape of Australian politics with a lamp, searching for an honest man like Diogenes in classical Greece. We are wearying of your Diogenes act, Senator Faulkner. If you are being really straight with the Senate, you would have read the next sentence:


I was by then in the Senate and Mr Michael Costa, who succeeded me as chairman, was responsible for securing that agreement. I understand from public statements by New South Wales government ministers that this process was conducted at arm's length between the two parties to the contract, AWH and Sydney Water.


One can but wonder why it is that that highly relevant sentence, immediately following upon the sentence on which the opposition seek to crucify Senator Sinodinos, was deliberately omitted, because it certainly gives you the context, doesn't it?


When one is seeking to establish what in fact happened in a course of commercial dealings—and that is what I used to do for a living, Mr Acting Deputy President: commercial cases—it is always wise to bear in mind the chronology. It is always wise to bear in mind the sequence of events.


Senator Faulkner lights upon two pieces of evidence that were given to ICAC yesterday: a letter of 29 August 2011 to the chairman of Sydney Water and a meeting on 6 September 2011 where it is said that Senator Sinodinos was present and perhaps he was. But Senator Sinodinos, on 13 October 2011, became a member of the Senate and the day he became a member of the Senate, on 13 October 2011, he resigned his position as a non-executive director of AWH and the contract was not awarded until January 2012.


What Senator Sinodinos said in his statement to the Senate is that he played no role in the awarding of the contract. Of course he didn't, because it was a contract awarded by Sydney Water, not a contract awarded by AWH. And the contractual negotiations, as we know, although the Labor Party decided to try to overlook this small, material matter, were conducted by Mr Costa in the months immediately prior to the awarding of the contract, in January 2012. That is why Senator Faulkner, who chooses his words very carefully, was not able to characterise the letter of August 2011, almost five months before the contract was awarded, as being about the contractual relationship. It was deliberately vague, weaselly words about the contractual relationship. There was no contractual relationship in August 2011. There was a contractual relationship months after Senator Sinodinos had left the board, executed in January 2012.


Again, Senator Sinodinos's allegedly sinister presence at a meeting on 6 September, months before the contract was awarded, was, according to Senator Faulkner, about the contractual relationship. Senator Faulkner, I know that you are not a man of commerce. I know that Senator Penny Wong is not a woman of commerce. I know that on the entire Senate Labor benches there sits not one man or woman who has ever been a director of a public company or who has ever advised a public company. But, if there were, they would know what anybody with the remotest acquaintance with commerce well knows: that there is all the difference in the world between pre-contractual discussions, negotiations, and the award of a contract. The fact that a person, months before a contract has been entered into, might write a letter or attend a meeting at which the possibility of a contract coming into being at some unspecified time in the future may or may not have been discussed hardly contradicts the statement, 'I played no role in the awarding of the January 2012 contract to AWH by Sydney Water,' because plainly he did not. The contract was awarded to AWH by a company in which Senator Sinodinos had no involvement, Sydney Water, and the negotiations for the contract, as opposed to vague discussions about the possibility of a contract being entered into in the future, took place after he had left the board on 13 October 2011 and were conducted by his successor, Mr Michael Costa.


Senator Faulkner made two other observations. He quoted Mr Watson, the counsel assisting the ICAC inquiry, who apparently said yesterday, 'It is quite transparent that Mr Sinodinos's role was to open lines of communication with the Liberal Party.' Well, perhaps it was. That does not contradict a word, a syllable, in Senator Sinodinos's statement to the parliament in February last year. Senator Sinodinos is a Liberal and he is a man of commerce. I hate to tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, but there is a relationship between the Liberal Party and the business community, and we are proud of it. We actually believe in private enterprise. We are not a protection racket for no-hopers and union officials like our political opponents. We actually believe in private enterprise. So Senator Faulkner's next killer point is that there was a relationship between Australian Water Holdings and the Liberal Party, and Senator Sinodinos as a prominent Liberal was part of their relationship. So what? It has got nothing to do with his statement. How is it wrongdoing? How is it wrongdoing for a director of a public company to have a relationship with the Liberal Party? I tell you what, Mr Acting Deputy President: if that were wrongdoing then there would be hundreds of public company directors in Australia today, if not thousands, who are guilty of that same wrongdoing. So that was, if I may say so with all due respect, hardly a particularly compelling point.


Finally, Senator Faulkner refers to the Obeid family. He settles upon a statement made by Senator Sinodinos in his parliamentary speech in which he says: 


I became non-executive chairman of AWH on 3 November 2010. I was not aware that, at around this time, the CEO of the company had negotiated what has been reported as a personal loan agreement with members of the Obeid family, secured against shares in Australian Water Holdings. I believe that there should have been such a disclosure made to me.


So Senator Sinodinos has said he did not know about this. He said it unambiguously. And not a word has been said by the Labor speakers in this debate to suggest that there is any reason to doubt that fact. The best Senator Faulkner can do is to say, 'We assume that Mr Sinodinos would have had some knowledge.' That is it. Senator Sinodinos says that he had no knowledge. He considers that the matter should have been disclosed to him, but it was not. Why does Senator Faulkner say that Senator Sinodinos should have had that knowledge? Because he met Mr Obeid Jnr. How does it follow from the fact that Senator Sinodinos met Mr Obeid Jnr on one or two occasions that one should assume that Senator Sinodinos knew that the Obeid family had a personal loan agreement secured against shares in Australian Water Holdings? Where does that assumption come from?


Nothing that has been said in this debate reflects on the integrity of Senator Arthur Sinodinos. Nothing that has been said in this debate contradicts a word of what Senator Sinodinos said in his statement on 28 February last year. To those who say, 'Let Senator Sinodinos come into the chamber and give another statement,' might I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that this week—yesterday, indeed, I think it was, or the day before yesterday—in question time, when asked about these matters, Senator Sinodinos said: 'I have nothing to add to my statement of 28 February 2013. It is accurate and I stand by it.' So as recently as this week Senator Sinodinos has given the Senate a statement affirming what he said last year.


So here we have it. For more than two hours now an attempt has been made on the basis of a 'When did you stop beating your wife?' type of argument to smear the reputation of a great and good Australian. For two hours we have demanded that the Labor Party formulate their allegations. Eventually their senior prosecutor declared they have no allegation to make. He declared—let me quote again—'I am not suggesting that Senator Sinodinos acted corruptly, not for a moment. I would not do that.' So we are reduced to the much more timid position, notwithstanding all this bold rhetoric we heard from the other side of the chamber, that there are contradictions between the statement on 28 February and the evidence disclosed in ICAC yesterday. In fact, there are not, because Senator Sinodinos did not negotiate that contract; Mr Costa did. That is a fact that the Labor speakers went out of their way to avoid disclosing. The signature of Senator Sinodinos on a letter and his presence at a meeting months before do not constitute securing the contract, and anybody with the remotest understanding of business would know that perfectly well. The other bases on which the statement is sought to be contradicted are suppositious, ephemeral and wrong. This is a great wrong done to a good Australian, and the Labor Party should be ashamed of themselves.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Mark Bishop
):  I call Senator Carr.




Senator Fifield:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. There have been three speakers for the motion and only two speakers against the motion. In calling Senator Carr, there will have been four speakers for the motion and only two speakers against the motion. When Senator Whish-Wilson was in the chair, he called Senator Wright after Senator Abetz rather than calling Senator Faulkner at that time. This means that when you were making the call in the chair, Mr Acting Deputy President, and called Senator Faulkner you called two non-government speakers in a row, whereas the convention in this place is that debate in the chamber alternates between government and non-government speakers. If you can have two non-government speakers in sequence, there is no reason why, in order to balance that, you should not at the moment have two government speakers in sequence. The pattern that is usually followed in relation to the calling of speakers has not occurred. If you grant Senator Carr the call, there will, as I say, have been four speakers for the motion and only two speakers against the motion. There will have been four non-government speakers and only two government speakers in relation to the motion.




Senator Moore:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: it is a longstanding convention in this place that you go to alternate sides of the chamber. I have to admit that I have not been here as long as some of the senior people in here, but debate usually goes to alternate sides of the chamber. The process was that we went from the ALP leading the motion, to the opposition and then to the Greens. Then we started again with the ALP opposition. The Greens could have been called, but we jumped up. The process consistently followed in this place is the chair has the discretion on who jumped at the time and makes that call. My proposition, then, is that we follow that call. You have the decision on who to give the call.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on the same point of order: I agree with what Senator Moore has said—that the call alternates between either sides of the chamber. So there seems to be unanimity between the government and the opposition on this. On this occasion it did not. The first speaker was Senator Wong from that side of the chamber. Then it was Senator Abetz from my side of the chamber. Then it was Senator Wright from that side of the chamber. Then it was Senator Faulkner, also from that side of the chamber. Then it was me. If you accept what Senator Moore has submitted to you, which is the same as what Senator Fifield has submitted to you, you will accept that the next speaker, in order to even the matter up, should be Senator Fifield because we had two speakers in a row from the other side of the chamber speaking in favour of the motion.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  On the point of order, if there was an objection to the order of speakers that was ruled appropriate by the chair I believe that would have been the appropriate time for a point of order to have been taken. When the call went to Senator Wright, a point of order should have been taken at that time. It was not. In any event, it is the practice of the chair to give the call to the first speaker who rises, absent a speaking list. In this debate a speaking list agreed between the parties has not been provided to the chair. In that case, the chair and successive chairs will give the call to the first person who stands and catches the chair's attention. I have done that in this circumstance. That is my ruling. I call Senator Carr.




Senator Fifield:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order in relation to the order of speakers given the call. You are right: a point of order could have been raised at the time that Senator Wright was given the call, but the government was operating on the assumption that the usual convention would be followed and that the speaker called after Senator Wright would, in fact, be a government speaker. I did, in fact, prior to the calling of Senator Faulkner make an informal petition to the chair that Senator Brandis be called rather than Senator Faulkner. So although a point of order was not raised on the floor in relation to Senator Wright, as I say, I had been operating on the assumption that the ordinary course of events would ensure that the matter was corrected and that Senator Brandis would be called. As you will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, I did make an informal petition to you before the calling of Senator Faulkner that it would be appropriate for Senator Brandis to be called. My purpose in so doing was to try to avoid this particular circumstance arising which we now find ourselves in.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  We were getting almost to a debating point then. It is correct, for the record, that you did approach me informally as to the order of speakers and I advised you, similarly informally, that the next speaker then would be Senator Faulkner. You had the option then, when the call was made, to take a point of order. None was taken. That matter is now resolved.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on another point of order. Following from your ruling that, absent a speaking list, the practice of the chair is to give the call to the senator who seeks the call first or at least is noticed by the chair first, as I sat down Senator Fifield was rising to his feet. He, in fact, jumped before Senator Carr did. So applying your own ruling, you should have called Senator Fifield at that point.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  On the point of order, as I said, absent a speaking list it is the practice of successive chairs to call the senator he or she sees first. In this case, without equivocation I say that I saw Senator Carr rise first and gave him the call.




Senator Ronaldson:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I was in the chamber and quite clearly Senator Fifield rose almost before Senator Brandis had sat down. I witnessed that and I think the anxiety of Senator Carr—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order before the chair.

 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (12:05):  I move:


That the Senate—


(1)    reaffirms the principle that ministers are accountable to the Senate, and through the Senate, to the Australian people;


(2) notes the failure of the Assistant—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Fifield.




Senator Fifield:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. In order to stand up and speak, the senator is required to seek leave. Given that the vote has concluded on the previous matter, we should be returning to the order on the Notice Paper.



The PRESIDENT:  The motion that has just been passed enables Senator Wong to take that action. The advice that I have received is that Senator Wong should be able to proceed to move her motion.




Senator Fifield:
  On a point of order, Mr President: the opportunity for Senator Wong to move the motion was contingent on the failure by Senator Sinodinos to comply with the motion. The motion was passed after 12 o'clock. Point (3) of the motion says: 


…if no statement has been made by Senator Sinodinos before 12 pm today, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) may immediately move a further motion relating to Senator Sinodinos' failure to comply.


There has not been an opportunity for Senator Sinodinos to fail to comply, because the motion was passed after 12 o'clock, the vote on which has only just been concluded.




Senator Moore:
  I too rise on a point of order, Mr President: on reading the motion that we have just passed in this place, there is no limit on how or when Senator Sinodinos could come in before 12 o'clock and make a statement. He did not come into the chamber before 12 o'clock—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  The motion had not been passed!



The PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator Moore:
  Point (3) of the motion we have passed says that if no statement has been made by 12. We have passed that motion. It could have been passed at any time. It has now been passed. Senator Sinodinos had every opportunity to come into this place before 12 o'clock—




Senator Brandis:
  He could not!




Senator Moore:
  I am sure, Mr President—



The PRESIDENT:  Order on both sides! Senator Moore, I am not going to tolerate this. If there are views to be expressed there is an appropriate way to take the appropriate point of order. Shouting across the chamber at each other does not resolve the issue.




Senator Moore:
  Senator Sinodinos was fully aware—I am sorry I will take that back. I believe that Senator Sinodinos was fully aware of the debate that was going on in this chamber this morning. We have a three-point motion that clearly identified a time—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  It wasn't passed by then!




Senator Moore:
  In the end that motion was passed and that allowed a time for Senator Sinodinos to come in and take action. He did not choose to do that. My understanding of the motion we have passed allows us to take further action.



The PRESIDENT:  I am going to recognise you, Senator Abetz, but you know that I insist that everyone who stands on their feet should be heard in silence, with respect.




Senator Abetz:
  Thank you, Mr President. On the point of order, the motion that the Senate has just passed said that it required the Assistant Treasurer to immediately attend the chamber. That has now passed.




Senator Fifield:
  At five past 12.




Senator Abetz:
  Yes, at five past 12, Senator Fifield—absolutely right. Point (3) of the motion says that if Senator Sinodinos has not abided by this motion by midday, he is deemed to have failed to comply.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Wait a moment, Senator Abetz.




Senator Abetz:
  And so, Mr President, if there is any suggestion of procedural fairness and decency, one would imagine that, if a senator is to be called upon to provide an explanation to the Senate, that senator should have a formal communication made to him or her indicating that the Senate requires something of that senator. In this motion that requirement is deemed to have been required before he actually receives the notice. In other words, this motion says that if he fails to comply to something before midday he will be deemed to be in breach, but the Senate only decided this after midday. The clever tacticians on the Labor side have really got themselves into a dilemma yet again. Like their own leader's questions being ruled out of order yesterday, we now have their own tactic in absolute disarray. How can somebody comply with something if the deadline is set and voted on after the deadline? 


This is an absolute and utter shambles, but fairness clearly demands and determines that any resolution of the Senate be communicated to the senator so that senator can respond to it. If the deadline you give to the senator is midday but you actually pass the motion past midday and say, 'Guess what? You are caught already; you're already in breach because of our motion,' it shows how bad the Labor Party's tactics are or, indeed, that they have no understanding of what appropriate procedure or fairness is. If the Labor Party genuinely wanted midday, they should have curtailed their speakers and should have had Senator Carr move immediately that the motion be put, rather than wait until a circumstance where the vote was taken after midday.




Senator Conroy:
  I raise a point of order. What we have here is a further pathetic defence of Senator Sinodinos' refusal to turn up in this chamber to give an explanation.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  This is not a point of order; it is a debate.




Senator Conroy:
  Let us be very clear—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! If you did not interrupt me, that would be very helpful indeed. I am prepared to take a point of order, but I am not prepared to have this debated.




Senator Conroy:
  Senator Sinodinos had every opportunity to be in here at the conclusion of that debate, rise to his feet, stop hiding—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! That is debating the issue now—




Senator Conroy:
  rise to his feet and speak on this matter.—



The PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator Conroy:
  He chose not to be in this chamber—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! That is debating the issue. I will take representations on the point of order.




Senator Brandis:
  I am confining myself to the point of order, Mr President. The Clerk might be able to advise you, but, as far as I could tell, the motion was passed at eight minutes past 12. Until eight minutes past 12, there was no motion. At eight minutes past 12, a motion in the terms before you was passed; compliance with which was not possible, because, the hour of 12 having expired, it was not possible for Senator Sinodinos at eight minutes past 12 to make a statement in obedience to the motion by 12. If you look at subsection (3), Mr President, of the motion just passed, the key words are 'a motion relating to Senator Sinodinos' failure to comply'. The motion that we have just passed allows Senator Wong to move a further motion relating to Senator Sinodinos's failure to comply. Because there was no motion with which Senator Sinodinos could have complied, there has been no fulfilment of the condition.



The PRESIDENT:  I think we need to work our way through this. Let me say one thing on the points of order that have been raised today and then let us work our way through it. On the point of order about the time the motion was put, I am reliably informed, because I was not in the chair, that it was prior to midday. I am going on the advice of the Clerk because I was not here.



Honourable senators interjecting—



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! I am not in this to debate it with you, Senator Macdonald; I am trying to assist the process. I can only go on the advice that I am given by the Clerk at the table. The advice that I am given by the Clerk at the table is that the motion was put prior to 12 noon, and the practice of the Senate is to dispose of the business that is before the chair. The next thing that happened was, as you found out, you cannot interrupt that process. In a not improper way you raised yourself to your feet and I refused to take the point of order. I have been consistent there, and the Clerk advises me that it was proper for Senator Wong, as the next matter, to stand to her feet to move the motion that she did.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! I have Senator Macdonald, who has been seeking the call.



Senator Wong interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  I will respect that. Senator Wong.




Senator WONG:
  Thank you. As I understand it, the nub of the proposition the government is making is that Senator Sinodinos has had the opportunity to comply with the order and come to the chamber. I would make two points. The first is that we heard from Senator Brandis twice this morning, we heard from Senator Abetz I think twice this morning, and we heard from Senator Fifield many times this morning. With respect, they are not the senators we wish to hear from; it is Senator Sinodinos we wish to hear from.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator WONG:
  By making an offer, if the Leader of the Government in the Senate indicates to me that Senator Sinodinos wishes to come to the chamber prior to question time, or later today in order to comply with this order, if the Leader of the Government in the Senate says that we should not move this motion because Senator Sinodinos has not had time to comply, my invitation to him is this: if he as Leader of the Government stands up in this place and says—




Senator Abetz:
  That is not a point of order, Chair.




Senator WONG:
  I am making you an offer.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! If it is not a point of order, it is not a point of order.




Senator Abetz:
  She should be sat down.



The PRESIDENT:  If you wish to work out a resolution to this matter with the Leader of the Government, I cannot do it by point of order.




Senator WONG:
  With respect, Mr President, I think this demonstrates the lie at the heart of those opposite because of their submissions. They are not interested.



The PRESIDENT:  That is now debating it.




Senator WONG:
  I am making an offer. The opposition would be prepared to look at a deferral of this if Senator Sinodinos wishes to come to the chamber. If the Leader of the Government is not going to bring him to the chamber we will proceed.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald, I can see you are on your feet.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr President, at midday there was no requirement on Senator Sinodinos to do anything because the Senate had not then passed the motion calling upon him to do something. So at midday there was no requirement for Senator Sinodinos to do anything.



Honourable senators interjecting—



Senator Fifield interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Yes, you will get your point of order when your colleagues have become restful. Senator Fifield.




Senator Fifield:
  Mr President, I understand that there are some quirks and peculiarities about Senate procedure. For instance a Thursday sitting is sometimes considered to be continuing on a Friday, and that in a Senate sense a Friday can, in effect, be a Thursday. I understand that what you are suggesting is that because a sequence of votes commenced before noon, therefore, the passing of a motion after noon should be deemed to have occurred before noon—in effect, the Senate backdating time. I appreciate that for the records of the Senate—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! I will just interrupt you. I do not mind you taking a point of order, but I do not like words being put into my mouth.




Senator Fifield:
  I am not putting those words into your mouth.



The PRESIDENT:  You are.




Senator Fifield:
  I apologise if that was the way it was taken, Mr President. What I am referring to is the way that Senate procedure may apparently operate. If the motion is, in effect, backdated as having taken effect at five to 12 rather than eight minutes past 12, that may be the way the Senate seeks to record things. But, for those of us who follow eastern daylight saving time, I think it is only fair and reasonable to take it that, if there is a motion that calls upon something to happen before 12 and the motion is not actually determined until after 12, that is not reasonable.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator Fifield:
  Mr President, if I can continue, the question that was before the chair before 12 was 'That the question now be put'. The question before the chair was not the motion of Senator Wong. It is quite possible that the question 'That the question now be put' could in fact have been defeated. Therefore, I cannot see how the commencement of a vote on the question 'That the question now be put' can be deemed to be the time at which the question on Senator Wong's substantive motion took effect and was passed. 



The PRESIDENT:  Can I make one thing quite clear: I am operating in conjunction with the advice that is coming from the Clerk, as I was not in the chamber. You have got to understand that in the first instance. I am being fair to everyone on that. Obviously, we need an action replay screen here somewhere but I have not got that at my disposal, so I am listening to the points of order. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr President, can I raise a point of order?



The PRESIDENT:  No.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr President, I have just asked the Clerk.



The PRESIDENT:  You might have, but Senator Wong is on her feet.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  He told me it was at five past 12.



The PRESIDENT:  That is not the advice that the Clerk gave me. 



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! That is now debating it with me, and I do not want to enter into that. 




Senator WONG:
  I make three points. 



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  Mr President, the berating of the Clerk by government senators is not appropriate. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  I am asking a question.




Senator WONG:
  I am here and I can hear what you are saying. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  You've got very good ears. 




Senator WONG:
  This is bullying of the Senate Clerk. This is utterly inappropriate and it should stop! 



The PRESIDENT:  Order! None of this is assisting the resolution of this matter. 




Senator Fifield:
  Mr President, I raise a point of order. Senator Wong was reflecting on Senator Macdonald. She made a very serious allegation and she should withdraw it. 



The PRESIDENT:  If you were reflecting on the senator, you should withdraw that comment. 




Senator Conroy:
  An accurate statement is not a reflection. 



The PRESIDENT:  Order! 




Senator WONG:
  I withdraw whatever aspect that he was offended by. Mr President, I make three points. The first is that the motion that the Senate has passed has three separate paragraphs. It does require the Assistant Treasurer to immediately attend the chamber and give some subject matter which the explanation should reflect. A separate paragraph, at paragraph (3)—which I assert to you is a continuing obligation and separate from the obligation in paragraph (1)—says that if no statement has been made by 12 noon today that I may immediately move a further motion relating to his failure to comply. On that basis I say to you that the Clerk's advice is correct and I should proceed to move this motion. I again say to the Leader of the Government in the Senate that, if he says that Senator Sinodinos has not had time to attend, we will defer this motion. 




Senator Fifield:
  Mr President, on a point of order, which may assist the chamber: the Dynamic Red says that the motion moved by Senator Wong was put at 12.01 pm and that it was concluded at five past 12. 




Senator Brandis:
  That is an official record, is it? 



The PRESIDENT:  I do not doubt what you say. 



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! I am trying to be fair to as many points of view as I can. Senator Milne. 




Senator Milne:
  Thank you, Mr President. The Senate agreed to a motion relating to the conduct of the Assistant Treasurer, saying that the motion that was to be moved would take 'precedence over all other business this day until determined'—and that is what was passed. The motion was then moved and debated to take precedence over all other business until it is determined. The motion was then moved and determined in the affirmative—that is, it does not matter what time; it was determined in the affirmative. Part (3) of that motion said—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! I have asked other senators to be heard in silence. Senator Milne is entitled to be heard in silence as well. 




Senator Milne:
  So the motion that was to be given precedence over all other business until it was determined said that if no statement had been made before 12 noon the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate may immediately move a further motion relating to Senator Sinodinos's failure to comply. When the motion that was given precedence over all other government business was determined in the affirmative, it automatically gave Senator Wong the right to move the motion that she has now moved, and that is why I support your ruling. 




Senator Abetz:
  Mr President, I understand the information that has been provided to you by the Clerk and I believe that it was given to you in good faith. However, the motion that was put at one minute to 12 was in fact not the substantive motion but a procedural motion. Before the Senate at any time there can be only one question, and the question at one minute to 12 was that the motion be put. That was dispensed with—




Senator Brandis:
  That the question be put. 




Senator Abetz:
  Thank you: 'that the question be put'. That then was dispensed with. We then moved back to the substantive issue, the substantive question, which was the motion moved by Senator Wong; and that motion, without any shadow of doubt, was put after midday. It was put after midday and the Dynamic Red discloses that. I think, if you were to ask the Clerk what time the actual, substantive motion was put, you would find that it was put after midday, which meant that there was no capacity for the senator who is the subject of this motion to have actually complied with it. Indeed, Senator Milne in her point of order indicated to you that the motion moved by Senator Wong gave that issue precedence over all other matters—which includes the capacity, if he wanted to or not, of Senator Sinodinos to give a statement. So as a result of Labor's own move, of this motion taking precedence over all matters, it was impossible for Senator Sinodinos to comply. I understand the situation you regretfully find yourself in, Mr President. But the actual motion, the substantive motion, there is no doubt, was put after midday, and that is why the Labor Party are now the architects of their own demise in this matter.




Senator Brandis:
  On the point of order, Mr President: I adopt what Senator Abetz has said. What he said is plainly right. But, further to that, can I draw your attention to standing order 84, from which it is perfectly clear that the Senate may only deal with one motion at a time.




Senator Conroy:
  Eric said that. You don't need to clarify what he said.




Senator Brandis:
  What Senator Abetz has said is right. But my point is that the standing orders actually make it clear. That being the case, the only motion to which Senator Wong's motion relates was, according to the Dynamic Red itself—



The PRESIDENT:  We are now debating it. I understand—




Senator Brandis:
  a motion put after 12.



The PRESIDENT:  I understand your point of order.




Senator Fifield:
  Mr President, on the point of order—



Senator Conroy interjecting—



Senator Kim Carr interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! 



Senator Brandis interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator WONG:
  How desperate they are to avoid him giving a statement.




Senator Fifield:
  Mr President, could I—




Senator WONG:
  They are filibustering their own—




Senator Fifield:
  On the point of order—




Senator WONG:
  Everybody knows what you are doing.




Senator Brandis:
  You're the one who screwed up your own—



The PRESIDENT:  Order!



Senator Brandis interjecting—



Senator Ronaldson interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  Well, you don't need to listen to—



The PRESIDENT:  Order, on both sides! Senator Fifield, make your point of order.




Senator Fifield:
  Thank you, Mr President. Can I offer the suggestion that this particular episode and the keeping of Senate time be referred to the Procedure Committee for examination? I think the fact that a senator is required to do something before they are asked to do something—




Senator WONG:
  Is this a point of order?



The PRESIDENT:  That is—




Senator Brandis:
  It is a helpful suggestion. Penny, you're getting flustered.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Excuse me! I am not going to take barracking from my left—



Government senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  or my right.




Senator Fifield:
  Because at the moment, Mr President, the Senate is appropriating for itself a Matrix-like capacity to slow time! 




Senator WONG:
  Like you're doing. 




Senator Fifield:
  I think all senators are entitled to operate in this place on—




Senator WONG:
  How desperate they are.




Senator FIFIELD:
  eastern standard, daylight savings time—



The PRESIDENT:  That is now debating the issue.




Senator Fifield:
  If it could be referred to the Procedure Committee.



The PRESIDENT:  All right. I am going to make—




Senator Ronaldson:
  Mr President, on a point of order—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! I am making a ruling on this matter.




Senator Ronaldson:
  But I've got a point of order, Mr President.



The PRESIDENT:  Yes, I know.




Senator Ronaldson:
  I am waiting for the call.



The PRESIDENT:  Yes, well, wait until I have made my ruling, and then you can take your point of order. I am entitled to make a ruling. My ruling—




Senator Ronaldson:
  Mr President, you said that everyone who wanted to make a point of order would be able to—



The PRESIDENT:  Yes, but there is a tolerance level as far as far as the chair is concerned as well.




Senator Ronaldson:
  But I was in the chamber when this matter was moved.



The PRESIDENT:  Good!




Senator Conroy:
  So was Kim Carr!




Senator Kim Carr:
  I moved it!



The PRESIDENT:  Order! This needs to be resolved by the chair. It is unresolved at this stage. I will be ruling that it is well within the province of Senator Wong to move as the first item of business following the consideration of that motion the motion as she moved. That has now got a ruling on the table. I have had consultation with the Clerk on this matter and I believe that that is the position.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—



Senator Conroy interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order, on both sides! Senators on both sides, this needs to be resolved by a ruling. I have now given the ruling.




Senator Fifield:
  Just on a point of order, Mr President: I am seeking clarification of your ruling. Are you ruling that the Senator Sinodinos has failed to comply with something—



The PRESIDENT:  That is debating the issue. I am ruling—




Senator Fifield:
  before he was actually required to do so.



The PRESIDENT: Just wait a minute. I am not entering into the debate. I have ruled that it was in order for Senator Wong to move the motion, in accordance with paragraph 3 of the resolution of the Senate.




Senator WONG:
  I move:


That the Senate reaffirms-




Senator Ronaldson:
  On a point of order, Mr President: I just need some clarification of your ruling—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator, I have now ruled.




Senator Ronaldson:
  I am seeking some clarification. Does your ruling say that despite the substantive motion being—



The PRESIDENT:  There is no point of order. I have made a ruling that it was in order for Senator Wong to move the motion. Senator Wong—




Senator Brandis:
  A point of order—



The PRESIDENT:  No, Senator Wong has the call.




Senator WONG:
  I move:


That the Senate reaffirms-




Senator Brandis:
  On a point of order, Mr President—



The PRESIDENT:  One minute, Senator Wong.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr President, I have a new point of order, and it does not bear on any of the matters that were debated for the last 20 minutes on the question of the time at which the motion was put. My point of order is that the motion that Senator Wong now seeks to move may only be moved by leave, because the resolution—




Senator Conroy:
  No. Mr President, he is defying your ruling.




Senator Brandis:
  No, I am not. If I may, Mr President, have the call.



The PRESIDENT:  I hear where you are coming from.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! 




Senator Brandis:
  Do I have the call, Mr President?



The PRESIDENT:  Yes, you have. Yes, I am waiting for you—




Senator Brandis:
  I am just waiting for the interjections to stop.



The PRESIDENT:  No, no. You are right. I am listening.




Senator Brandis:
  The motion that Senator Wong has been given the right to move without leave is a motion described in part (3) of the motion lately passed—that is:


(3)      if no statement has been made by Senator Sinodinos before 12 pm today, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) may immediately move a further motion relating to Senator Sinodinos' failure to comply.


It is those last seven or eight words—'relating to Senator Sinodinos's failure to comply'—which define the motion that Senator Wong has been given the right to move. If you look at the motion—



The PRESIDENT:  That is now debating the issue. You have taken your point of order.




Senator Brandis:
  If you look at the motion Senator Wong has circulated, it is not a motion relating to Senator Sinodinos's failure to comply. Irrespective of the debate we had just before about whether in fact Senator Sinodinos did fail to comply—and you have already ruled on that and I do not reflect on your ruling on that point—if you look at the terms of this resolution, it is not a motion relating to Senator Sinodinos's failure to comply. It says—



The PRESIDENT:  Now we are getting into the debating aspect of it.




Senator Brandis:
  But Mr President—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, I am not going to put up with debating points.




Senator Brandis:
  It is not a debating point.



The PRESIDENT:  I have ruled. There is no point of order, Senator Brandis, and I have given Senator Wong the call.




Senator WONG:
  I move:


That the Senate—


(1)   reaffirms the principle that ministers are accountable to the Senate and, through the Senate, the Australian people—




Senator Fifield:
  On a point of order, Mr President: it is not in order for Senator Wong to move this motion without seeking leave, because this motion does not relate—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! That is now becoming a tedious point of repetition. I have—




Senator Fifield:
  to Senator Sinodinos's alleged failure to comply.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! I have ruled on that point of order. There is no point of order. I have given Senator Wong the call.




Senator Abetz:
  Mr President, if I may raise a fresh point of order? Just for absolute clarity, can you confirm that there is nothing in any way, shape or form in your ruling that suggests that Senator Sinodinos has failed to comply with any request of the Senate—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! I have made a ruling on that.




Senator Abetz:
  because that is a fundamental proposition—



The PRESIDENT:  I have made my ruling quite clear. That was raised earlier.




Senator Abetz:
  Well—



The PRESIDENT:  I have, Senator. I have made it quite clear.




Senator Abetz:
  If I may then seek your indulgence, Mr President—



The PRESIDENT:  No, there is no indulgence. You have had your chance at a point of order. I have given the call to Senator Wong.




Senator Abetz:
  On a fresh point of order, Mr President—



The PRESIDENT:  No.




Senator Abetz:
  But—




Senator WONG:
  You cannot keep doing this!




Senator Cormann:
  On a point of order, Mr President—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! I have two people on their feet. I call Senator Abetz.




Senator Abetz:
  Mr President, I heard your ruling in relation to allowing Senator Wong to proceed. With respect, I have a certain view on that, but I do not want to relitigate that aspect. I am, however, seeking to obtain from you clarification whether there is, in any way, shape or form, a suggestion that Senator Sinodinos has failed to comply with an order of the Senate.



The PRESIDENT:  I have already made that very clear. I made no suggestions in my ruling.




Senator Abetz:
  Right, thank you. So there was—



The PRESIDENT:  My ruling was quite clear. Senator Wong has the call.




Senator Abetz:
  no suggestion of Senator Sinodinos's failure—



The PRESIDENT:  No, I made no suggestions in my ruling about anything. I made that quite clear.




Senator Cormann:
  Mr President—



The PRESIDENT:  No, Senator Wong is on her feet.




Senator Cormann:
  I am on—



The PRESIDENT:  I know you are on your feet.




Senator Cormann:
  I was on my feet.



The PRESIDENT:  I do not care. You will sit down because Senator Wong got to her feet.




Senator Cormann:
  I wanted to raise—



The PRESIDENT:  Excuse me! I have had someone on this side of the chamber—




Senator Cormann:
  But I have a point of order, Mr President—



The PRESIDENT:  You will sit down!




Senator Cormann:
  My point of order—



The PRESIDENT:  Excuse me! You will sit down. Senator Wong is on her feet.




Senator Cormann:
  But—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Cormann, you will resume your seat!




Senator Cormann:
  I still have—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Cormann! I am standing now, something I have not done in my time as President.




Senator Cormann:
  On a point of order, Mr President—



The PRESIDENT:  No! Senator Wong was—




Senator Brandis:
  Mr President—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, I will give the call in due course as I have done fairly throughout this debate. But I am not going to be put to the test by people. Senator Wong has the call.




Senator Cormann:
  But I have a point of order, Mr President.



The PRESIDENT:  No, Senator Cormann. Senator Wong might have a point of order. I do not know what Senator Wong is getting to her feet for.




Senator WONG:
  I move: 


That the Senate—


(1)   reaffirms the—




Senator Cormann:
  I have a very specific point of order, Mr President. I am seeking clarification on a very specific point. I have been here throughout the whole debate this morning. I have been here through every aspect of these proceedings and there is clearly a very important point in relation to the motion that was eventually passed by the Senate after 12 pm. It relates to the part that Senator Brandis pointed to before which makes the motion that is about to be moved contingent—



The PRESIDENT:  This is becoming a tedious point of repetition and I have ruled on that point of order.




Senator Cormann:
  I am asking for a clarification, because if there—



The PRESIDENT:  I have clarified everything in respect of that motion.




Senator Cormann:
  Have you made a ruling that Senator Sinodinos has failed to comply with an order—



The PRESIDENT:  I have just answered that in respect of a point of order made by Senator Abetz.




Senator Cormann:
  I did not understand the answer.



The PRESIDENT:  The answer is very clear, sir. You go and read the record. 




Senator WONG:
  I move:


That the Senate—




Senator Fifield:
  On a point of order, Mr President—




Senator WONG:
  Ministerial accountability under the Abbott government is on display today!



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Fifield has the call.




Senator Fifield:
  I am seeking clarification because it is still—

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2014-03-19,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (12:45):  I rise to speak on a number of issues currently prominent in public discussions surrounding the upcoming re-run of the Western Australian Senate election on 5 April. Of course, I am not the first senator to do so, either from my own side or from other parties contesting the election in a few weeks time. I am sure all senators are aware—and I am sure those listening to or watching my contribution are aware—that, during the last sitting period, Senator Ludlam made a contribution to the adjournment debate on the subject of the WA Senate election. We have heard frequently during the past couple of weeks about Senator Ludlam's speech. In particular, we have heard about it because, in current parlance, it has 'gone viral'.


Apparently, there is no greater achievement in contemporary politics than to 'go viral', if you believe some of the commentary that has surrounded what Senator Ludlam said. It is perhaps testament to the transformative impact that the internet has had on modern society that to be described as 'viral' is now considered a positive attribute. It used to be that people avoided things that were viral. Sadly, I fear I am unlikely to scale the Olympian heights of Senator Ludlam's rhetorical achievements with my modest contribution to today's discussion. I do not make these comments, however, in the hope or expectation that they will go viral.


However, when you think about it, 'viral' is not a wholly inappropriate way of describing or characterising the influence of the Greens, over recent times. The 'virus' first infected the Australian Labor Party in the wake of the 2010 federal election, with the Greens using that once great party's weakened condition to attack those things that have been so essential to the success of Labor governments past: a commitment to free markets, an appetite for genuine economic reform and an ability to withstand the demands of the more extreme elements in the body politic. Having infected the Labor Party, the virus spread. It next infected Australia's economy, with the Greens' strident insistence on a return to the high-taxing, high-spending policies of an era that many of us had prematurely hoped had been banished forever by the success of the Hawke and Keating Labor governments.


The virus had by now rendered the Australian Labor Party delirious and clearly impacted on the function of its long-term memory. In their delusion, Labor had forgotten the lessons of the Hawke-Keating era and were instead persuaded by the Greens to employ a homoeopathic version of an economic remedy that was mainly Whitlam with a pinch of Calwell. Thus we began hearing senior Labor figures talking about rich miners and foreigners needing to pay their fair share. The only way to make this happen, we were told, was through the introduction of a huge new tax that would have an enormous impact on confidence in our mining and resources sector, which, as we know, has particularly significance in my home state of Western Australia.


But the virus worsened. The enfeebled patient's symptoms now extended to a loss of short-term memory to such an extent that the Labor Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, was seemingly unable to remember, in February 2011, that just six months earlier she had promised the Australian people that there would be 'no carbon tax under a government I lead.' Recall the scene in the Prime Minister's courtyard on that day in February 2011, with then Senator Bob Brown standing side-by-side with Prime Minister Julia Gillard at the podium, smiling for the cameras, delighted that the Greens' long-held dream of increasing taxes for all Australians was at last being realised, thanks to a Labor government that had first lost its majority and had now seemingly lost its collective mind.


All the while, the virus kept doing what a virus does if left untreated—it progressed. The symptoms worsened. Under its influence, the Australian Labor Party began exhibiting patterns of increasingly odd and irrational behaviour. There were elevated levels of paranoia, with members of the then government seeing enemies both within and without. By the start of 2013, this paranoia had become all-consuming, the result being that the Labor Party began to focus on its own affairs to the exclusion of everything else, such as its responsibility to deliver good government and keep its promises to the electorate.


Perhaps this goes some way to explaining why one-third of the GP superclinics that Labor promised are still not built or not operating. This includes GP superclinics promised to the people of Northam, Wanneroo, Cockburn, Rockingham and Karratha in my home state of Western Australia. In fact, of the six GP superclinics promised by the former Labor government to the people of Western Australia, just one is operational as of today, according to the Department of Health. This is truly remarkable when you consider that GP superclinics were a cornerstone of Kevin Rudd's election campaign in 2007. So, after six years in office and having burned through two prime ministers, this is Labor's legacy in health to the people of Western Australia: a network of GP superclinics, 83 per cent of which at this very moment are still not operational.


Yet Labor and the Greens have had the hide to come into this chamber and question this government's efforts to fix the mess left to us by their inept attempt at governing. Perhaps if Labor and the Greens had spent more time focusing on project delivery, instead of attempting an unprecedented degree of media regulation last year, there might be a few more Western Australians enjoying access to the fast broadband Labor first promised them back in 2007. When the coalition took office last year and looked at what was actually happening in relation to the national broadband network, it was revealing. As opposed to the Walter Mitty-like imaginings that seemed to emanate from Senator Conroy's office during his time as minister, the news in Western Australia was particularly bleak. At the time that the strategic review into the NBN was published at the end of last year, 335,978 premises had been passed nationally. Only 16,891 were in WA. This compares with 15,492 in the ACT and 40,852 in Tasmania, both of which jurisdictions, significantly, have smaller populations than WA.


It is important to make a further distinction: premises 'passed' does not necessarily mean 'connected to the National Broadband Network'. To get that you need to look at the number of premises activated, and this is where the real story lies. Of the 16,891 premises passed in Western Australia, just 2,086—that is just over 12 per cent—were actually activated or connected to the NBN; 1,858 of these were new homes in new housing estates and only 157 were in existing premises or brownfields. The remaining 71 were fixed wireless connections. In Western Australia at present the NBN stands as another monument to the incompetence of the Rudd and Gillard governments supported by their allies, Senator Ludlam and the Greens, in this Senate chamber.


Then we have the former Labor government's cynical treatment of regional communities across Western Australia through the Regional Development Australia Fund and the Regional Infrastructure Fund. Well before last September's federal election, the former Labor government knew full well that its mining tax was falling well short of its projections. This meant, self-evidently, that the revenue projected to flow from that tax into the Regional Development Australia Fund was simply not going to be there.


Having that knowledge, surely any responsible government would have refrained from making extravagant promises to regional communities about funding their regional development and infrastructure priorities. Sadly, the former Labor government did not see fit to act responsibly. Instead, Labor ministers ran around Australia, including to communities across regional Western Australia, and cynically told local people that their priorities would be funded—in the full knowledge that there was simply no money available to fund these projects.


In fairness, I do not accuse Senator Ludlam and the Australian Greens of complicity in the act. Indeed, the Greens did manage to correctly point out to the former Labor government that its flawed mining tax would not raise the revenue projected. The problem that arises is that the Australian Greens' solution is not to scrap the tax which bogs down Western Australian businesses in red tape and foists compliance costs upon them; the Greens' solution is instead to expand the tax. Likewise with the carbon tax: the Greens fully recognise that this tax is not producing any environmental benefit, but again their solution is not to abandon something that clearly does not work; it is to compound the error by expanding the tax.


The Greens have an unerring ability to see a problem and come up with the wrong solution every single time—which brings me back to Senator Ludlam's recent viral video hit. I know Senator Ludlam has professed himself 'gobsmacked' by the reaction to his speech on various social media sites—a speech which, as he told The Sydney Morning Herald, he composed with a glass of red by his side as he made that long flight from Perth to Canberra.


Just in case Senator Ludlam is thinking of switching to champagne any time soon, I would caution him that there are other views in the community about some of the things he said in this chamber on that evening. True, there were some on Twitter and the like who rushed to laud Senator Ludlam's speech, as is their right in our free country. Many seemed to be at pains to stress the 'bravery' Senator Ludlam had displayed in making his speech. Again, everyone is entitled to their own view. But I would point out that there are a good many Western Australians who will participate in the Senate election on 5 April who did not find Senator Ludlam's speech in the least bit brave. There is no bravery in playing the prejudices of those who already agree with you. There is nothing brave about marching into this chamber and using the protection of parliamentary privilege it affords to make a series of outrageous, unsubstantiated and deeply offensive allegations about the Prime Minister, whatever your political disagreements might be.


It is a measure of the new Prime Minister's character that he has not chosen to respond to Senator Ludlam's undergraduate-style rant. That makes for a welcome contrast with the approach of former Prime Minister Julia Gillard and her supporters, who never missed and still never do miss an opportunity to exploit the cult of victimhood to suit their own political ends.


It is cheap and easy, not brave, to come into this Senate chamber and prate about compassion in relation to asylum seekers—especially when you adamantly refuse to acknowledge the role your own policy approach played in the senseless loss of more than a thousand lives at sea over the last six years. Outdated, windy Marxist rhetoric about 'predator capitalism' may well find an audience in the echo-chamber of the Twitterverse but does not do an awful lot to enhance the credibility of the Greens in a modern, open, market based economy like Australia's.


If Senator Ludlam and the Greens truly wish to do something brave, they could try going to visit families across regional Western Australia struggling with high electricity bills. They could explain to them why they think we should keep the carbon tax, which is needlessly adding pressure to household budgets, and why they are working with the Labor Party in this place to prevent its repeal. Maybe they could try explaining to the many companies and businesses across Western Australia why it is better that $626 million be spent on a tax that is having no environmental impact whatsoever rather than be invested in a manner that actually creates jobs for Western Australians and their families. Or perhaps they could try visiting the tens of thousands of refugees languishing in United Nations camps around the world and explaining to them why they should continue to languish there while Labor and the Greens pursue allegedly compassionate politics and policies that encouraged illegal boat arrivals, the loss of more than 1,100 lives at sea and denied a place in Australia's humanitarian refugee program to those who tried to do the right thing.


Governing is about making difficult choices and decisions. The Abbott coalition government has demonstrated that it is prepared to get on with the job of fixing the damage done to Australia by six years of misrule by Labor and the Australian Greens. The fact that Senator Ludlam and his supporters can offer little but Senate obstructionism and sneering contempt for anyone who dares to disagree with them says much about the Greens and what they really think about Western Australia and the priorities of Western Australians and their families and businesses.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (15:11):  I seek leave to add to an answer I gave to Senator Milne yesterday.


Leave granted.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Yesterday, Senator Milne asked me some questions about irregularities in elections for the Cambodian National Assembly in July 2013 and what the Australian government's attitude and initiatives in relation to those alleged irregularities were. I can inform the Senate that the Australian government has called on all concerned parties to ensure a transparent investigation of those alleged irregularities. There was an investigation but, regrettably, the government and opposition parties were unable to agree on the modalities for a joint investigation.


Ultimately, these are matters for the people of Cambodia to determine, but we encouraged the government and opposition parties to remain in dialogue. It is important that the door is kept open for successful opposition candidates to take up their seats in the National Assembly.


The Australian government has urged the Cambodian government to undertake electoral reforms to ensure credible elections. We welcome the agreement of the Cambodian government and opposition on 18 February to establish a joint committee on electoral reform.


Senator Milne further asked about the diversion of aid to civil society organisations. I can inform the Senate that Australia's aid program is delivered in partnership with a range of entities including civil society organisations, multilateral organisations and partner governments. We aim to work with those organisations that are the best fit for the program activities. Using a range of delivery partners, including the government and NGOs, enables Australia's aid program to maximise its impact and reach, and ensures that it is effective. A significant portion of our aid to Cambodia is already delivered through more than 100 civil society organisations—for example, in the health sector and in community development.


Finally, Senator Milne asked me some questions about Minister Bishop's visit to Cambodia. I stated that Minister Bishop, during the course of that visit, met with Cambodia's opposition leader, Sam Rainsy. In fact, Ms Bishop, during her visit to Cambodia, had a telephone discussion with Mr Rainsy but not a face-to-face meeting.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (15:14):  Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to make a short statement to note Senator Brandis's reply.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  Senator Milne, you may seek leave to do that. The Clerk has advised me, though, that there is a further opportunity for you to pursue this matter if you would like to. But I will put the question to the Senate. Is leave granted?



Senator Abetz interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for two minutes, Senator Milne.




Senator MILNE:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I appreciate that and I thank the Senate on this occasion. Sam Rainsy is the leader of the opposition in Cambodia. An election was held on 13 July last year. Subsequent to that, many irregularities in the election were identified. However, since the period to which Senator Brandis refers, there has been a complete breakdown in negotiations between the government and the opposition in Cambodia to actually resolve those election irregularities. That is why there has been a call for the international community to step up efforts to put pressure on Prime Minister Hun Sen to now reform the electoral commission. That is, the United Nations Special Rapporteur came out and said that, firstly, the electoral commission should be reformed and that an independent electoral commission be run. Secondly, there needs to be an international investigation into the election irregularities, ensuring that there is in fact an early election in Cambodia following the reform of the electoral commission.


So, whilst I thank Senator Brandis and the minister for that further information, it implies that the Australian government is going to stand by and allow this stalemate to continue. We need to ensure that we have intervention. There is now a growing body of opinion around the world that there should be an independent investigation. I call, again, on the government to take a leading role in the same way that Australia took a leading role in the Paris Peace Accord in 1991. Australia has very strong role to play in furthering the democracy of Cambodia. I would urge the minister to meet with Mr Rainsy while he is in Australia at the moment.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:16):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


There are so many legitimate unanswered questions about the Prime Minister's knowledge of the issues which have been ventilated in this place and also before the Independent Commission Against Corruption in relation to Senator Sinodinos's dealings. Let us recall what occurred today.


Over the last two days the coalition government has chosen to do everything in its power to prevent Senator Sinodinos answering questions or providing information to the Senate on the allegations and facts which have been ventilated in the Commission Against Corruption hearing. We saw that yesterday, when questions were refused to be answered and points of order were taken. We saw that this morning when the government went through extraordinary procedural shenanigans in order to avoid having to have Senator Sinodinos attend the chamber, as per an order of the Senate, to provide a statement. This is not an abstract discussion. This is in the context of some very serious allegations of corrupt behaviour in relation to Australian Water Holdings, which have been put on the public record before the Commission Against Corruption. I refer senators to my discussion earlier today about some of those matters and how Senator Sinodinos's previous statement to the Senate did not adequately address the facts which have subsequently been put on the public record.


Today we saw the Minister representing the Prime Minister being asked a number of questions about the state of the Prime Minister's knowledge when he appointed Senator Sinodinos to the ministry—what he knew about Senator Sinodinos's dealings, as both director and chair of Australian Water Holdings; whether he knew that his minister stood to gain a personal benefit of $10 million to $20 million, described as a 'payday' in the Commission Against Corruption; and whether he knew, in particular, about donations provided to the Liberal Party, which were Sydney Water money being funnelled through Australian Water Holdings.


These are legitimate questions and Senator Abetz was not able to answer them. Whilst I appreciate he was in his representative capacity, I would make the point that these are matters which have been on the public record for a period of time. One would have thought that he could have been briefed but, more importantly, I make this point: questions have been asked for months about Senator Sinodinos's appointment to the ministry. I recall a lot of commentary about why it was that Senator Cormann was appointed to cabinet and not Senator Sinodinos, as had previously been touted. Why was it that, out of the potential list of, I think, 30, Senator Sinodinos was in fact the last on that list when he was, as those opposite have continued to assert, a man of great capacity?


That gave rise to the question as to whether there were reasons why it was that the Prime Minister chose to not only not put him in the cabinet and to prefer Senator Cormann but put him so low down in order of precedence. Those questions have been raised. The Prime Minister himself has said that there was no cloud over Senator Sinodinos.


Given that backdrop, it is somewhat surprising that the Prime Minister's representative in this place cannot answer legitimate questions about what the Prime Minister knew when. What I would say to this chamber is this: it is reasonable for the Australian people to know the answer to a number of questions. They are entitled to know what the Prime Minister knew about Senator Sinodinos's activities, dealings and conduct at AWH at the time he made the decision to appoint him to the ministry. They are entitled to know if the Prime Minister took appropriate steps to consider whether or not Senator Sinodinos ought be appointed to the station of minister in the light of those facts. The Prime Minister may well have made proper inquiries and he may well have come to a view. I think, given the circumstances that we have seen in the last 72 hours, it is incumbent on the Prime Minister to explain that. (Time expired)

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2014-03-19,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education) (15:21):  I have only been here just under six years but I never cease to be amazed at the gall of those opposite. Whether it is on this side of the chamber or the other, all the contrived and confected outrage of Senator Wong, Senator Conroy, Senator Carr and various imitators of Statler and Waldorf cannot hide the profound duplicity of the Labor Party. I should add that it is not just those opposite; it is their Greens cousins down the corridor here. We sat in this chamber for the last few years and witnessed nothing less than a protection racket Tony Soprano would have been proud of. It was a protection racket to protect one of their own in the other place—a racket to protect Craig Thomson, who is now awaiting sentencing. The Labor Party and the Greens voted to prevent information that was presented in camera to a Senate committee getting to the Australian public. We knew what was in it because we could sit in those committees, Senate or joint. You knew what it was because some of you knew what it was like beforehand, and what he was like before he got here. Yet you have the gall to come in here and criticise someone else through sledging, slurring and making unfounded allegations. The Labor Party has absolutely no credibility on these matters.


The New South Wales ALP is so debased that the best people can do now is to come into this chamber to defer and deflect attention from the fact that a former ALP national president has been convicted and is going to jail and a former one of their parliamentary party is awaiting sentencing. So the best they can do in true Labor style is to sledge and to slur. At no point, as Senator Brandis and Senator Abetz have outlined, has there been an accusation of illegality or corruption. They stand behind 'We are just asking questions'—questions they would not let be asked about their own colleagues; questions they would not let be asked about Craig Thomson. They are asking questions in this chamber but they prevented information going to the Australian public about Craig Thomson, and they knew what it was: the unprecedented corruption in the Health Services Union; the use of members' money that has been found to be illegal. And they come in here and complain about an upstanding contributor to public life such as Senator Sinodinos with all the contrived and confected outrage that only a racketeer could muster. The Labor Party has become nothing more than a corrupted cabal of cronies where all the people opposite come here representing part of an alphabet soup because their union shareholders own a seat on those benches. When they are in office they launder money by giving it to the trade unions through training funds which then flow back to the Labor Party in donations and employment of organisers that campaign in seats. They have the gall to criticise people that have made a contribution to the private sector.


If I could turn to Senator Sinodinos, as Senator Abetz has said, his decision is one we regret but respect. As the Prime Minister has said this afternoon in the other place, it reflects the best and most honourable of Westminster traditions and this is the sign of the character of a man who has given our country such faithful service. Today Senator Sinodinos's actions point out the emptiness and the hollowness of the Labor Party. We sat here and witnessed the Labor Party protect their own because power is all they care about. I have seen them hand over $10 million to the Trade Union Training Authority, which then means that unions do not have to pay for training like every other business does. They are free then to employ more people or make more donations or pay higher affiliation fees or, dare I say it, get more hotel movies and more after executive committee entertainment.


The Labor Party by its attack on Senator Sinodinos has shown up its own failings—the fact that it has no standards, the fact that all it has is the ability to sledge and to slur, the fact that it seeks to hold other people to standards to which it will not hold itself. I notice Senator O'Neill shaking her head. The only thing a member of the New South Wales ALP should do is to bow their head, because it is the most corrupted organisation in the history of Australian political parties—

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2014-03-19,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (15:27):  Today we had a situation where the Leader of the Government had to be reminded of what his responsibilities were to this chamber and to represent the Prime Minister and on behalf of the government be accountable to this chamber when it came to very basic questions about what the Prime Minister knew about the details surrounding the operations of Australian Water Holdings, and in particular the operations of Australian Water Holdings when the Assistant Treasurer had in previous arrangements been the chairman of that company and simultaneously Treasurer of the Liberal Party and later President of the Liberal Party in the state of New South Wales—situations which have now come to light as a result of proceedings in ICAC which we have seen reveal quite extraordinary developments.


I notice that Senator Macdonald is with us today. Senator Macdonald has been able to offer us all advice on what he saw as the Prime Minister and his chief of staff, Peta Credlin, enforcing 'a culture of obsessive centralised control phobia'. I quote from the Sydney Morning Herald of 4 December last year. They were out of touch with voters, according to Senator Macdonald, who had shown that the government of this country had come to the points of centralisation where every staff appointment from every backbencher, every committee appointment, every ministerial appointment, every parliamentary committee appointment into cabinet and other actions within the Liberal Party and the National Party were being determined by a vetting process made in the name of the Prime Minister but by the chief of staff of the Prime Minister. So on the very point of the Assistant Treasurer's appointment to the ministry, the question arose: what did the Prime Minister actually know of the circumstances surrounding the events in New South Wales and the corrupt activity of Australian Water Holdings? This was a question that was asked on 16 September, the very day of Senator Sinodinos's appointment to the ministry.


Mr Abbott made it clear that, as far as he was concerned, there was absolutely no cloud whatsoever over Senator Sinodinos. We simply ask this question: what did the Prime Minister do to satisfy himself—or, more importantly, what did the Prime Minister's chief of staff do to satisfy herself—that Senator Sinodinos was a man able to fulfil the role of Assistant Treasurer given the circumstances that have now been revealed at ICAC? In February of last year Senator Sinodinos put forward a proposition that he was the director of a company which had been surrounded by the stench of corruption. We know that he was the director of Australian Water Holdings for two years. He claimed to the Senate that he had no knowledge of the involvement of the Obeids in that company. He was shocked, he said, when he discovered this. He said he had no knowledge about the capacity of this company to divert donations to the Liberal Party when he was the treasurer of the Liberal Party. So the chairman of the company, the treasurer of the Liberal Party, knew nothing about the operations of the company and knew nothing about the fact that the Obeids actually owned one-third of the company at the time.


We have, as I said, an obsessive, centralised control and phobia in this government, yet the Prime Minister did not choose to establish the facts in this matter prior to the appointment of Senator Sinodinos. So I can understand why Senator Macdonald would be unhappy about the circumstances. I can understand why, faced with the circumstance where he was not able to secure a place on the frontbench, he might feel a little aggrieved at what is going on, just as many Liberal-National senators and members of the House of Representatives are very aggrieved that the vetting of staff in members' offices is being conducted by the chief of staff of the Prime Minister. You have to ask yourself this question: why was this situation allowed to develop when there is this level of centralised control within the government? I am sure that there are many senators in this chamber— (Time expired)

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:32):  I commence my contribution by indicating that I totally support and agree with the comments of the Prime Minister when he said:


Senator Sinodinos has done the right and decent thing … as you'd expect from someone who has given our country such long and faithful service.


He continued:


I look forward to his restoration to the ministry.


I think every fair-minded senator in this chamber would agree with those comments from the Prime Minister.


Labor has this confected outrage about the Obeid family. I say to the Labor Party senators: if you have a problem with Mr Obeid, if you want to know what he did with his money, if you want to know who he 'imposed upon'—if I can use those words—to get favours for his company, there is no-one better to ask than yourselves, because, after all, Mr Obeid was a Labor member of parliament. He was a colleague of many of those opposite. Senator O'Neill, who is to follow me, was a colleague of Mr Obeid's. She would have been subjected to the influences of the Obeid family.


We know that Senator Conroy was very close to the Obeid family because he actually stayed in their chalet for a night or two. Mr Tony Burke, a former senior member of the Gillard and Rudd governments, also shared in Mr Obeid's largess. Senator Cameron gave my namesake, the New South Wales Labor Ian Macdonald, a reference for Mr Obeid's preselection. If Labor senators want to know about the Obeid family, why doesn't Senator Cameron ask the other Ian Macdonald from New South Wales Labor all about them? He was obviously very much involved with Mr Obeid.


I noticed a rather interesting article in The Sydney Morning Herald by Ms Jacqueline Maley. She said:


The Labor Party has a surplus of corporate knowledge in the anti-corruption inquiry ''space''.


In recent years the appearance of one of its MPs before the Independent Commission Against Corruption has been such a regular occurrence it has almost become a comfort - a reminder that, even in this crazy, fast-paced world of ours, some things can always be counted on: death, taxes, and the strong civic interest colourful Labor characters take in the awarding of mining and water licences.


I think that sums it up very well. Ms Maley also drew our attention to the fact that the only Labor person who has actually called upon Senator Sinodinos to resign is Mr Kelvin Thomson, whose own credibility is somewhat circumspect when you recall that it was he who admitted providing a reference for the Melbourne crime figure Tony Mokbel.


The Labor Party come in here with these false accusations, trying to defer attention from the union movement—into which here is shortly to be a royal commission—and from many union officials. I would have thought the Labor Party would be more interested in pursuing this story where the Newcastle Trades Hall secretary said in the recent 'march in March' protest that Qantas boss Alan Joyce 'should be shot somewhere in the back of the head'. I would have thought that if the Labor Party were interested in standards and proper public activities in this country they would be calling upon the Trades Hall secretary in Newcastle to withdraw that or to explain himself. This is an absolutely outrageous thing to say. This is the Labor Party, of course.



Senator Lines interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Lines is only in the chamber because of people like the New South Wales Trades Hall secretary who show that sort of bile in a public forum. You can understand why the Labor Party so protect the union movement. It is because every single one of their senators is here thanks to the efforts of the union movement. Without the union movement, they would not be here. So they should get real. If they want to have an inquiry, why don't they have a look a look at the Trades Hall secretary in Newcastle?

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:36):  What a sight we have seen here today. In fact, I probably should not call it a sight, because we have not really seen what we should have seen. Instead, we have been treated to a minister in hiding—no less than the Assistant Treasurer of Australia. While this place was trying to get answers to some very simple questions about the senator's former business dealings, he could not even present himself to this chamber. Then on the cusp of question time—at 1.58—he disappeared again, but this time from the front bench. He was minister no more. That was without a good question being answered and without any indication of a fulsome explanation of the gap between what he has put on the record in this place and what is now emerging in the public place.


To disrespect the Senate in that way is a shameful indication of the modus operandi of those who are running this government. There has been no statement given and there has been no accountability to this chamber. That is a failure of the government to own up to the responsibility they have. Now that they are those opposite are in government and they are the ministers, they deserve to respond to this house. It is a fair and reasonable expectation. Instead, what we are seeing are dodgy deals done behind closed doors with the Prime Minister and his chief of staff.


'Command and control' is a term that we have heard used by this government, but in fact the command and control central has been operating out of the Prime Minister's office. It is well-documented in the media. I stand here this afternoon finding it very difficult to believe that the determination was for Senator Sinodinos to put the shutters down, to run and to hide from the scrutiny of the Senate, and to do it in such sneaky and unparliamentarily way at 1.58—just before question time.


Now, further, he has made his colleague Senator Abetz come in here, take questions and respond for him. I am here to take note of answers, but really we cannot take note of answers because today we have seen—once again—a failure by this government to give answers in the manner that is the custom of this place and the expectation of the people of this nation. We on this side are trying to get answers from Senator Abetz, the Leader of the Government in this place, about why Senate Sinodinos did not get the job of Minister for Finance after the election. What did Tony Abbott know as far back as September last year about the dodgy deals of Senator Sinodinos?


In the press today, we have seen an article by Mark Kenny, who asks the questions. These are the sorts of questions that the public—




Senator Fifield:
  I rise on a point of order. Senator O'Neill was reflecting on a colleague. She referred to dodgy deals by Senator Sinodinos. No Labor senator, to this point, has made any allegation against Senator Sinodinos. So are you the first, Senator O'Neill, to do so? You may want to consider what you have said and withdraw.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
):  I would ask Senator O'Neill to consider those remarks and do what she considers is appropriate.




Senator O'NEILL:
  I think, with respect, that Senator Fifield has actually connected two completely different paragraphs in his conflation of those points.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Neill, perhaps there might be another way in which you could word those previous comments.




Senator O'NEILL:
  I am going to say that there are many concerns in the public place about dodgy deals going on behind the scenes in many contexts. The scrutiny of the government has to be observed at the highest standard. Concerns are being expressed in the public place which are well represented in articles today by Mark Kenny in the Canberra Times and also by Norman Abjorensen. They want to know. Norman Abjorensen says, 'Answers are required from this charming man.' Mr Mark Kenny argues, 'Is Abbott's pass over of Sinodinos becoming clearer?'


These questions about the uncertain nature of why Senator Sinodinos—who was expected to take the finance portfolio—was given the position of Assistant Treasurer, have been lingering in the public place for a long time. It really makes us question, once again, what we know. When did the Prime Minister actually know and have concerns about some of the issues that are now being debated in the public place? But, sadly, we are not able to get a response here in the chamber?


It is hard to think that somebody would not have tapped the Prime Minister on the shoulder at some stage and raised his awareness about the minister being a director on the AWH board and funnelling money into the Liberal Party. Surely somebody knew and raised this question with the Prime Minister. But it seems it is not enough to stop someone from entering the ministry of a Liberal government. If it comes to public attention, their response is simply to hide, to cover up, and to then demote them out to the side for a short period of time. So, we will see.


Those opposite and Senator Abetz have made much about the importance of ministerial conduct, but the really serious questions that have faced this government are the standards of ministerial conduct by Senator Nash and now Senator Sinodinos, who has stepped aside while the inquiries of the Independent Commission Against Corruption are underway.

The speech read as follows—





Introduction



Today I am introducing the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2014.


I am introducing this Private Senator's Bill because this Government has done nothing to protect our oceans, give certainty to business or respect our recreational and commercial fisheries.


This Bill will restore tough powers to the Environment Minister to act where new types of fishing operations seek to work in Australia and where uncertainty exists about their conduct.


It provides for a scientific process to occur for up to two years, providing for an expert panel to consider the impacts of the new venture if it is declared. This will provide the community, recreational fishers and business alike with the certainty for these declared activities to operate in Australian waters.


This legislation focuses on addressing uncertainty related to so-called 'super trawler' fishing vessels. 


In short, this legislation will allow the government of the day to stop new super trawlers before they come to Australia – just as Labor did in office.


When Labor introduced sensible powers in September 2012 to act against new commercial fishing vessels the amendments were opposed by the Liberal and National Parties. 


Yet only days ago the Prime Minister had the gall to say that ""It was banned with the support of members on this side of the House"". (House of Representatives, 4 March 2014)


In government Labor supported strong powers to protect the environment, respect the rights of recreational fishers and provide certainty to business.


The amendments give the government of the day the power to declare a particular type of fishing activity, where it has not been used in Australia previously and some uncertainty exists around it, to ensure proper and thorough expert scientific work is conducted.


This has been the case in the past when the Government moved to declare the activities that were proposed for the super trawler known as the FV Margiris or temporarily theFV Abel Tasman. 


As the Government refuses to act to protect our fisheries, stand up for recreational fishers or provide industry any certainty then it is for Labor to act.




Removing the sunset provision



This Bill will remove a 12 month sunset provision bringing the new Chapter 5B of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act back into effect. By removing Division 4 of Part 15B, the Environment Minister's powers to respond to new commercial fishing operations will be restored, as it currently is subject to the sunset clause that is in effect at present.


The sunset clause, Division 4, was included in the amendments introduced by the Government in September 2012.


As then-Minister Burke said in his second reading speech to the Parliament, the twelve month sunset clause was in place because,



""By that time the root-and-branch review of the fisheries management processes should be in place, but we will have this legislation to be able to fill that gap in the interim"" (Tony Burke, House of Representatives, 11 September 2012).


The root-and-branch review of the legislation was completed and a Government response was tabled in March last year. The sunset provision has operated from September 2013. 


This means that there is no power under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act for the Government to act to declare fishing activities, including fishing by super trawlers.


As the Government has failed to create new powers or take any action to implement the fisheries management review I am compelled to introduce this Bill and take action to protect Australia's oceans and fishers.


The Bill restores the powers still on the statute books:


to enable the Environment Minister (with the agreement of the Commonwealth Fisheries Minister) to make an interim declaration that a fishing activity is a prohibited 'declared commercial fishing activity' while an expert panel assesses the potential environmental impacts of the activity;


to enable the Environment Minister (with the agreement of the Commonwealth Fisheries Minister) to make a final declaration, for a period no longer than 24 months, that a fishing activity is a prohibited 'declared commercial fishing activity';


to provide for the establishment of an expert panel in the case of the making of a final declaration and specify the terms of reference of the panel and its reporting date, with a requirement that a copy of the panel report be made publicly available;


to provide for appropriate procedural fairness protections for 'declaration affected persons'; and


to create civil penalty and offence provisions for engaging in a declared commercial fishing activity. 


These measures are required to address the risk of new and future super trawlers or other new methods of commercial activity that have not previously been used in Australia.


It is a precautionary approach. It will better allow community and environmental groups, together with business, to work with a scientific expert panel to assess the true impacts of new and large scale fishing operations.




FV Margiris



The ability for a Minister to declare a particular fishing activity has been used in relation to a single vessel. Then-Minister Burke used this power to declare the fishing activities proposed by the FV Margiris, then named the FV Abel Tasman.


Subsequent declarations were made following sudden changes made by the company, which attempted to modify the vessel in response to the declaration made.


This legislation does not impact the on-going process in relation to the FV Margiris. Any expert panel convened under the legislation prior to the sunset clause coming into effect continues unchanged. Any report from such a panel will be a matter for government to respond to and manage in line with this Act and other related acts.




AFMA protocols



It would be prudent for the Government to take other actions to improve the management of new and proposed fishing activities.


The Department of the Environment and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority should establish protocols to better communicate between agencies.


As either becomes aware that a company is considering using a new and previously unused type of fishing vessel that might fall within the purview of this amendment then they should determine a process for alerting Ministers who may wish to take advice on activating these powers.


This, combined with the legislative powers, will allow for even greater certainty in Australia's fisheries management systems.


Finally, the Government response to the root-and-branch review should be implemented.




Conclusion



Australia has some of the best managed fisheries in the world. There is, however, a gap in the system in considering the powers of the Environment and Fisheries Ministers to consider new commercial fishing vessels before they arrive and begin to fish.


Given the Government has failed to act, it is sensible for these powers to be restored.


Labor is standing up for the oceans, recreational fishers and local businesses. 


I commend the Bill to the Senate.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2014-03-19,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (16:09):  This matter of public importance provides an opportunity for the Senate to review the performance of this government's first six months in office. The Statement of Ministerial Standards, which was announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott in December 2013, contains the following words: 


Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries are entrusted with the conduct of public business and must act in a manner that is consistent with the highest standards of integrity and propriety.


This replaced the previous government's statement of ministerial standards of September 2010, which had different words:


Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries hold high public office and are entrusted with considerable privilege and power. The people of Australia are entitled to expect that, in the discharge of their duties, they will act in a manner that is consistent with the highest standards of integrity and propriety. 


We know that ministerial standards were introduced by the Labor government in 2007 following the appalling behaviour of the Howard government, which saw in its very early days a whole series of ministers being forced to resign for their failure to fulfil their commitments in regard to those highest standards of integrity and proprietary. We particularly saw in this Senate in those early days of the Howard government that the Prime Minister took the view that enough was enough after a number of ministers had been forced to resign and that there would be no further resignations from the ministry. 


We know in some respects it is a philosophy that has been carried over to the new government of Mr Abbott, although some will say that today is an example of where the best of ministerial traditions has been upheld. Let us be clear about this: Senator Sinodinos has stood aside in the interests of the government out of political expediency. He has been stood aside as a result of the urgings of members of the coalition and of one of the biggest backers of the coalition, The Australian newspaper. This morning it essentially said to the government that Senator Sinodinos would have to stand aside because of the political damage that he was doing to the government. So it was not a question about ministerial standards as such; it was about political expediency. 


If we follow the events of today and look at these things carefully, we will see that in the case of Senator Nash there was a conflict of interest. Issues were raised about her chief of staff, Alastair Furnival—who, I might remind the Senate, was vetted and approved by the Prime Minister and by the Prime Minister's chief of staff—following the extraordinary developments that occurred around the junk food industry and, in particular, the relationship with Cadbury. We well know that Cadbury has a very special relationship with this government. Cadbury was the beneficiary of a grant to support its operations in Hobart, allegedly on the basis of tourism but really on the basis of what the press statement at the time said, which was that it was all about changing their business model. It was in complete contrast to the approach that this government had taken on industry policy elsewhere. 


We know that personal connections are very important. We know that in the case of Mr Furnival there was quite extraordinary speculation around what was the cause of Mr Furnival's resignation. I recall a press report in The Sydney Morning Herald on 15 February 2014, which stated:


… Mr Furnival's proposed appointment was held up by the Prime Minister's chief of staff, Peta Credlin, due to concerns over his background and commercial interests.


I asked myself: where did that come from? Where did that report come from? Was that not an example of the chief of staff actually leaking information against ministers? I think this is the problem that emerges in circumstances where political expediency becomes much more important than the maintenance of ministerial standards—because we know how long it took for there to be a resolution in regard to the questions that surrounded Senator Nash and her chief of staff.


As I said before, we know that there is a case in regard to the operations of Cadbury which we have yet to hear the full details of, but we know that it is an example of a single act of co-investment by the government where so many others were found unworthy. So I am looking forward to the examination of that matter in detail, when that grant is actually made. We know that Senator Nash intervened personally in the taking-down of a new health rating website only hours after it was launched and we know that Senator Nash claimed that it had nothing to do with her chief of staff's ties to the junk food lobby. To this day, Senator Nash has yet to adequately explain the policy operations of her office in regard to the healthy star website.


We know that there is a very strong case of secrecy within this government which has developed with regard to Senator Nash in an attempt to dodge, avoid, answering basic questions. It is a fundamental requirement of ministerial conduct to treat the parliament with respect and not to seek to use claims of public interest immunity in such a way as to subvert the proper work of the parliament in understanding the exact nature of government policy. In fact, it suggests that anyone asking a question about Operation Sovereign Borders, for instance, is almost an act of treason; it has now got to the stage in this parliament where it suggests that the mere act of asking such a question is to provide aid and comfort to people smugglers. Clearly, that is not consistent with the proper functioning of parliamentary democracy and not consistent with the highest standards of integrity and probity.


Then, of course, we have the case of Senator Sinodinos. The Independent Commission Against Corruption, in its proceedings on Monday, was looking at a number of ministers in the New South Wales government, the Premier and other ministers—and in fact former Labor minister Mr Costa, whom I know Senator Brandis waxed lyrical about this morning. There were actually statements to the effect that there was no evidence whatsoever of corrupt behaviour by a number of them. I quote the commission transcript directly:


… we've looked carefully at the activities of Mr O'Farrell and Mr Pearce and we have found no evidence to implicate either in any corruption.


Again, in regard to Mr Costa, it says:


… ICAC has uncovered no evidence of corruption on the part of Michael Costa.


But, when it came to the question of Senator Sinodinos, it says:


It's presently difficult to offer observations on the conduct of Mr Sinodinos. He has other involvements which will come under scrutiny in Operation Spicer.


So what we do know is that, in regard to ICAC, there are serious questions that are being answered. But they are not questions that the minister, the minister who has now stood down, was prepared to answer in this chamber. It would have been quite appropriate, quite straightforward, to explain the contradictions in the position he has put to this chamber and answer the allegation that he has actually misled the Senate. No, what we saw was every effort being made to avoid scrutiny, to avoid accountability and to seek to denigrate others. Senator Brandis, when you talk about smears, I recall only too well you in this chamber saying that we had a criminal in the Lodge. Even your best mate, Andrew Bolt, said you had gone too far. So you are only too happy to throw abuse around, but then you seek to claim that those who raise legitimate questions are engaging in smear campaigns. This is a government that undertakes witch-hunts by way of royal commissions, a government that seeks to denigrate— (Time expired)

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2014-03-19,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) (16:19):  Today is a sad day because we have seen a great Australian, a good Australian, a good man, a good senator and a good minister step aside from his duties. That is unfortunate. As I said in this place yesterday, I am proud to call Senator Arthur Sinodinos a colleague; I am proud to call him a friend. He is someone who has made an outstanding contribution to public life in Australia and someone who I am confident will continue to make an outstanding contribution to public life in Australia.


We have seen in this place over the last couple of days an unfortunate, regrettable and terrible smear campaign waged by those opposite, who have attempted to turn this fine institution, the Australian Senate, into nothing more than a kangaroo court where they have ignored any sense of proper processes; where they have ignored any sense of fair process; where they have simply, for their own base, political ends, sought to smear and bring down the reputation of a good Australian, a good senator and a good minister. They have lost all sense of perspective in this matter. When challenged to identify what the specific wrongdoings or allegations are against Senator Sinodinos, they have been found wanting.




Senator Brandis:
  They couldn't say a thing.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  As Senator Brandis rightly highlighted then, and before today, the Labor Party—from Senator Wong down—have been unable to specify a single act of wrongdoing by Senator Sinodinos, yet they have continued with their smears. They have ignored the fact that Senator Sinodinos has made very clear to this Senate and to all Australians that he will cooperate fully with the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales.


He will cooperate fully in those proceedings, as many witnesses have done before—most recently, as he highlighted yesterday, former Labor minister Greg Combet and current Labor frontbencher Senator Doug Cameron. They both cooperated with ICAC proceedings. They cooperated with ICAC proceedings as witnesses, just as Senator Sinodinos will, but they were not subjected to the same type of smear campaign that Senator Sinodinos has faced. There were no calls at the time for them to step aside from their positions. Yet the Labor Party has done just that in relation to Senator Sinodinos. In fact, they have gone further than that in calling for the resignation of Senator Sinodinos, yet they have not even been able to cite an allegation against him, let alone an act of wrongdoing.


There is a right place and a wrong place for the prosecution of these things. The right place is the appropriately established tribunal that sits in New South Wales, the ICAC, where Senator Sinodinos will give his evidence. The wrong place to go over matters that predate not only his career as a minister but his career as a senator is this Senate chamber. This is the wrong place. This is not a court in which to assess these matters that predate his time as a senator. The right place is the ICAC, where he will give his full and complete cooperation.


Sadly, Senator Sinodinos has, for the good of the nation and the good of the government—so we can get on and focus properly on the big public policy challenges Australia faces—stood aside today. As the Prime Minister has rightly indicated, it is the right and decent thing for Senator Sinodinos to do and what you would expect from someone who has given so much to his country and so much service over such a long period of time. As the Prime Minister rightly indicated, he looks forward to Senator Sinodinos's restoration to the ministry in due course, once these matters are handled.


This is not of course the first time this has occurred. We should all keep in mind precedents where ministers have stood aside and rightly been returned. These precedents have included both ministers and shadow ministers. One example was Phillip Lynch in the Fraser ministry. He stood aside but, following an official inquiry that found no illegal or improper doings, rightly returned to the ministry. Ian Sinclair was rightly returned to the ministry following investigations into allegations made against him. Wayne Swan stood aside for a period of time as the shadow minister for family and community services but eventually returned to the frontbench and became the Treasurer of Australia.


There was also the amazing case of Mick Young. Mick Young stood down from the Hawke ministry on 14 July 1983 following the revelation that he had disclosed matters of national security. A royal commission upheld those allegations—yet do you know what the Labor Party did? They re-elected him unopposed to the ministry. Allegations were upheld, yet they re-elected him unopposed to the ministry. He was again forced to stand down at a later stage in relation to other matters—and the Labor Party again reappointed him to the ministry. So there are good precedents where people have been exonerated, as I am sure will occur with Senator Sinodinos, and there are other precedents, such as that of Mr Young on the Labor side. In his case they simply ignored due process and reappointed him to the ministry.


This government will apply the best of ministerial standards throughout its term. We will ensure, as we have done, that full disclosures are made, as they have been, across the government and that those disclosures are applied and adhered to in order to ensure that no real or perceived conflicts of interest occur amongst ministers, parliamentary secretaries or their staff. We will make sure, unlike those opposite, that we run a clean show.


We heard earlier today the very long list of people, from state and federal parliaments and Labor Party ranks, who have done wrong—in some cases ultimately finding themselves in jail. The two relatively recent cases that spring to mind are those of the former national president of the Labor Party, Mr Williamson—national president only a couple of years ago during Ms Gillard's prime ministership but today in jail—and the former member for Dobell, Mr Thomson. Mr Thomson was a member of the Rudd and Gillard governments who left parliament only at the last election. Today he is awaiting sentencing.


Those opposite come in here and smear the name of a good man, yet have absolutely no track record of their own that they can stand by. Those opposite come in here and use this Senate as their own kangaroo court rather than allowing the right proceedings to occur in the right place.


Senator Sinodinos is a great Australian. He came here as part of a Greek migrant family. He is a great Australian success story—somebody who grew up as the son of Greek migrants and went on to become the longest serving adviser of Australia's second-longest serving Prime Minister. He is a man who has given much, not just to the government of this country but to charities and other organisations, including the Mary MacKillop Foundation, the Aboriginal Employment Strategy and the Australian Institute of Management. He has been recognised as an Officer of the Order of Australia for his service to government, to the community and to the Greek community in particular. He has been recognised as one of the great public policy minds of this country. I have no doubt that he will rightly be back and that those opposite will be seen in due course to have smeared a man for absolutely no reason and with absolutely no rationale whatsoever.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2014-03-19,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:29):  This debate needs to be seen in the wider context of strengthening our democratic process. We urgently need politics to be cleaned up in this country. That needs to go much further than just dealing with the issues of today around Senator Sinodinos, because there is a real thread through so much of this work with regard to lobbying and how it is conducted in this country. But it goes much wider than that, and that has implications for political donations. Our houses do not fully come under freedom of information requirements; there is the question of how entitlements from members of parliament are managed; there are codes of conduct for ministers and MPs and the need for those codes to be legislated—these are all highly relevant to this issue. You can see why there is increasing cynicism from members of the public. They do see MPs as a protected species—and that applies to all of us—because what has happened today damages the standing of parliaments and the parliamentarians who attempt to do this work, and the very fabric of our democracy is undermined. We need to address greater transparency and improve accountability so that the public can scrutinise the work more readily, because that certainly is not possible at present.


I start with the issue of donations, and this certainly goes back to how the Prime Minister operates. In the latest release of data from the Australian Electoral Commission that came out on 1 February, we saw that tobacco and mining money still found its way into the coffers of the coalition, and the alcohol industry was there to benefit both Labor and the coalition in that case. Imperial Tobacco and Philip Morris spent about $4.5 million under their own names, and the Alliance of Australian Retailers—which just seemed to appear out of nowhere but really had so much to do with plain packaging—dispersed $9 million. The Minerals Council of Australia reported $4 million and the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies reported $2.2 million. This, interestingly, was around the time of the debate about the mining tax, and it is worth remembering that those companies spent $22 million on advertising. These are big companies influencing and being very close to key politicians in this place, and people are not able to open a window on how that influence is exerted and what discussions go on behind closed doors. That it is certainly very relevant to what we are discussing here.




Senator Brandis:
  Have you heard of the register of donations?




Senator RHIANNON:
  While I did not hear the interjection from Senator Brandis—but I am sure it will be very interesting—he might be interested in this aspect because it is another area where we need to clean up politics. Through some of the debates that are currently occurring in terms of how political parties operate, there are some interesting discussions around the need for standards for political parties in terms of how they operate, particularly if they are going to run in elections, be registered and gain public money. Should there be some standard regarding democracy within political parties? I was interested to read in July 2011—and I do note this was before the current government was formed—that claims emerged of possible vote tampering during elections for the State Executive of the New South Wales Liberal Party. The accusation that the Herald reported was that up to 80 ballots had been identified where the original vote had been changed using correction fluid to follow the ticket put forward by the hard or religious right faction. I use that example as another reason why we need to clean up politics and explore ways to ensure that the highest standards are followed.


Then there is the issue of entitlements. When this government came to office, the whole issue of entitlements really got a working over with those extraordinary reports of various government members claiming entitlements to go to weddings. Senator Brandis and former Senator Joyce—both now ministers—used money to go to weddings and denied any wrongdoing. Then we had some very interesting statements about this from Minister Malcolm Turnbull. When he was asked about $15,000 that was claimed by some senior coalition ministers to attend three different weddings, he said, in this case with regard to Minister Julie Bishop, that she made 'a very valid use of her travel entitlement' when she claimed $3,445 to pay for flights home from the lavish wedding in India which we have heard a great deal about. Where it becomes very interesting is that Mr Turnbull's comments were made on the same day that news reports emerged that Prime Minister Tony Abbott repaid $1,094 in travel expenses he had charged taxpayers for attending the 2006 wedding of former MP Sophie Mirabella. This does not need to occur. It really is so damaging. Mistakes are made with entitlements, and I am obviously aware that these things can happen. In this case, I felt the claim for weddings went a bit too far.


I would again highlight what the Greens have been advocating. The Scottish parliament has a very simple website where you click on your MP and you can see how the expenses have been paid. The transparency is there. The accountability is there. The public have an understanding of how public money is being spent by their publicly elected people, and that is certainly how it should be. In this context, it is interesting to note that former Prime Minister John Howard did see what some would say was an opportunity. Others would say he was doing the right thing—although I think some of his colleagues thought that he went too far—when he campaigned when he came into office in 1996 for tighter rules on entitlements. He did promise, and eventually delivered, a new code of conduct for ministers. Interestingly, it led to five ministers going in his first term. Sadly, it seems, the lesson that the coalition learnt—and maybe it is a lesson some others took from that—is that we have weaker rules around entitlements, and many would say that ministerial responsibility barely exists these days. This is another area where we need to clean up. It is very easy. It is public money. I will say it again: it is public money being spent on public duties by publicly elected people. Let us have it on an easily accessible website—that is so easy to do in this day and age.


The issue of lobbying is a thread that runs through so many of the problems that we have confronted in recent weeks. We have heard about how Senator Nash ran her office. We are yet to hear more about the operations of Senator Sinodinos. But the issue of lobbying, of people trying to gain influence, is certainly there.


Clearly lobbying has an important role in the democratic process; that is a given. It is a right for people to engage in this way. But, when they do, we need to think about how it operates and what information is then available to people, because right now there is so little information that the public can access when it comes to lobbying.


We need to have a code of conduct for lobbying legislated; that is long overdue. When the Greens were successful in setting up an inquiry to review how lobbying is conducted, unfortunately and disappointingly Labor voted against it. The coalition did vote for it. But then we hardly called any witnesses, so it was controlled in that way.


What is clearly needed is this. As the Greens have been putting forward, we need a commissioner of lobbying. The definition of 'lobbyist' needs to be expanded to include in-house lobbyists. Records should be kept of the discussions that are held when lobbyists meet with ministers. Also, the code needs to cover not just ministers but all MPs. Clearly, in this day and age, with the way politics work, backbenchers and crossbenchers can play a key role in the final decisions governments make. So those meetings also should come under any code.


In conclusion, this is a valuable debate. We need to be looking at how we clean up politics in many areas: political donations; codes of conduct for MPs in general; the issue of entitlements. Transparency and accountability need to be the foundations of how we work.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2014-03-19,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (16:39):  I am very pleased to participate in this debate and to bring the attention of the chamber to the Prime Minister's failure to uphold ministerial standards. It is quite clear that what we witnessed today, what we saw from the Prime Minister, is another example of coalition secrecy and coalition cover-up. I take the view that the Prime Minister has either deliberately tried to cover things up or failed to understand the seriousness of the issues surrounding the AWH inquiry at ICAC.


The coalition fought long and hard on this issue today and yesterday. Senator Sinodinos looked, at one stage, as if he was not going to move; he was going to tough it out. But this is a serious blow to the government, to have such a senior minister forced off the front bench.


I take the view that the PM should have acted earlier. The PM should have acted earlier because not only was it clear that there was a problem surrounding the appearance of Senator Sinodinos at ICAC but the view, in some quarters, is that it could be a serious problem.


Those opposite, on a number of occasions, have raised my appearance at an ICAC inquiry, to try and say, 'Well, anyone can be called to an ICAC inquiry to give evidence.' That is true. Anyone can be called to an ICAC inquiry to give evidence. But let me tell you: when I was called to ICAC, I was told, from the first contact with ICAC, from the ICAC investigative officers, that I was not a person of interest and all they wanted to do with me was to clarify some facts. I was not a person of interest. That is somewhat different from what Senator Sinodinos is facing—and I will come to that in a minute.


When we talk about sleaze and guilt by association, there has been the sleaze and guilt by association from the other side because I had a knowledge of Ian Macdonald—not Senator Ian Macdonald but the disgraced Ian Macdonald of the New South Wales government—for some 30 years, as did many other politicians on both sides of the political fence. But what I did when I went to ICAC was to decline to have an order under section 38 of the ICAC Act made. What that means is: if you seek an order under section 38, then you get various protections as a witness. The evidence you have given is subject to an objection or a direction under section 38 of the ICAC Act and it cannot be used subsequently in criminal or disciplinary proceedings except in proceedings for offences under the ICAC Act. I took the view that I had nothing to hide. I took the view that I did not need any special protection.


Senator Sinodinos yesterday said to me that if he needed any advice, he would ask me for some advice. Well, I will give Senator Sinodinos a couple of pieces of advice. The first piece of advice is: when you go to ICAC, tell the truth. Tell the truth—that is my first piece of advice to Senator Sinodinos. My second piece of advice to Senator Sinodinos is: do not seek protection under section 38 of the ICAC Act because—if you are as squeaky clean as your colleagues are saying you are; if the Prime Minister has got so much confidence in you—why would you seek a section 38 protection under the ICAC Act if you have got nothing to fear? So two pieces of advice to Senator Sinodinos: tell the truth and do not seek protection you do not need. Those are the two pieces of advice from me to Senator Sinodinos. We will see in a couple of weeks whether he takes that advice, especially in relation to telling the truth and to seeking protection that you really do not need if you have done nothing wrong. So let us see what he does with that.


I bet Senator Sinodinos would love to have the character reference that I got out of ICAC. I bet he would love to know that ICAC is going to say the same about him that ICAC said about me. Let me tell you what ICAC said about my appearance at ICAC. I quote chapter 3 from the report:


In many instances, Mr Macdonald’s evidence is contrary to that given by his former political colleagues of high seniority and certain trade union associates, such as the Hon Luke Foley MLC, Anthony (Tony) Maher and Senator the Hon Doug Cameron (all of whom were impressive witnesses, not shown in any material respect to have given false or incorrect evidence).


They said that I was an impressive witness and that I told the truth. That was my appearance at ICAC, simply because I knew someone over a period of time and simply because he was involved in the same political party as myself. But that is not the case with Senator Sinodinos. Clause 30 of the opening statement by counsel assisting the inquiry says this:


Based upon PricewaterhouseCoopers' valuation, if the PPP came through Mr Sinodinos would have enjoyed a $10 million or $20 million payday.


And further:


""It is presently difficult to offer observations on the conduct of Mr Sinodinos. He has other involvements which will come under scrutiny in Operation Spicer.""


…   …   …


""It is quite transparent that Mr Sinodinos’ true role in Australian Water Holdings was to open lines of communication with the Liberal Party. There will be evidence that he tried to do so.""


That now brings me to the article in today's Australian by Dennis Shanahan, who says: 


Sorry, senator, you don’t have a choice—


that is, to stand down. I do not know why Dennis Shanahan felt he had to say sorry. Maybe because he completely misunderstands what is going on in ICAC. He goes on to say:


Sinodinos is in limbo for at least the next two weeks, before he’s due to give evidence to ICAC, with only the vague suggestion of guilt by association through corruption and the developing sleazy theme of being a ""door opener"" to Liberal politicians.


I do not know that counsel assisting the ICAC inquiry, Mr Watson QC, is developing a sleazy theme or if that is an allegation from The Australian to protect a wounded, former frontbencher from the coalition, but it is no sleazy thing. That is what ICAC are saying they will have a look at: the relationship between Senator Sinodinos and the Liberal Party and the role he played.


Let me finish up on this. I think ordinary Australians around this country would be horrified to think that someone could get $200,000 a year from a company to do 100 hours work—while the same company did not have the money to pay its tax account—and to have an opportunity to pick up $10 million to $20 million. These are the issues. And if you want a royal commission in this country, let us have a royal commission into the sleaze in the business community when people do that with shareholders' funds.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (16:49):  I am pleased that Senator Cameron welcomes a royal commission into sleaze and corruption and grubbiness because, indeed, I can announce to Senator Cameron—and I am sure it is no surprise to him—that there will be one into the union movement in this country. And that is brought about by the sleaze, grubbiness and disgraceful conduct that we continually and repeatedly hear about. But I do not want to pursue that too diligently today.


This is one of those most difficult days. It is difficult for me as a politician because I find that the gruelling aspects of public life are enough without having to deal with the smear, the innuendo and the character assassination that have been trumped up and that we have seen thrown at Senator Sinodinos today.


I would also like to put on the record that Senator Sinodinos has done the right thing and the honourable thing. When spurious allegations are hurled at you, you can answer them but then you have to make a decision that is in the interests of your party and in the interests of the people of Australia and, if you are a frontbencher, you stand aside until they can be cleared and dealt with. Senator Sinodinos is an honourable man and he has done exactly that.


But that is in stark contrast to those on the other side, those who ran the protection racket, as Senator Birmingham referred to before, for Craig Thompson. He was a man who was entitled to the presumption of innocence but, in the face of overwhelming evidence, it was galling to hear his defence rather than to hear those on the other side say: 'He should stand aside or separate himself from the parliament to answer these allegations.'


Similarly, we can talk about the references to Ms Gillard when she was Prime Minister and her alleged involvement in a union slush fund in which money was misappropriated—that is the appropriate word. She facilitated the misappropriation of that money through the establishment of a slush fund. There is an ongoing police investigation into this. But we were told that it was misogynistic to inquire into that and that it happened such a long time ago.


Let me make this point to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and to the people of Australia: criminal conduct, notwithstanding that there may be a statute of limitation, is inexcusable under any circumstances and every politician and every member of the public should, in a legal sense, be held fully to account for their conduct when they are in this place and before they come into this place. If they have done the wrong thing, then bang, hit 'em up for it.


But what strikes me is that not one person, either at ICAC or in this chamber under parliamentary privilege, has levelled an allegation of any substance against Senator Sinodinos. Somehow they object to how much he was allegedly paid or supposedly paid to chair a business and an organisation. Somehow they are condemning him and his ability to be a frontbencher and a valued member of the coalition team on the basis that he was involved in an organisation which was tainted by Labor Party members of parliament. We are talking about that guy Eddie Obeid, the guy who has successfully destroyed the New South Wales Labor Party. He has bubbled up all the uncomfortable excesses and all the excrement that has been hidden underneath by the New South Wales Labor Party for far too long.


You can go back to: where were they when Mr Paul Keating as Prime Minister was allegedly making millions of dollars out of the piggery? Where were they saying 'Stand aside' then? Where were they when there were allegations against former Senator Richardson with suggestions that he was involved with prostitutes and bribes and all sorts of things like that? Where were they saying 'Stand aside' then? Where were they with Ms Gillard? There was a protection racket. It is ingrained in those members of the union movement and the Labor Party to protect their own. On this side of the parliament I will protect my own too when I think they have done the right thing and I will be scathing of them, just as people have been scathing of me when they think I have done the wrong thing.


The point I want to make is this: there is not one substantive allegation that has been put—not one suggestion that Senator Sinodinos has done anything whatsoever inappropriate. And this is before he got into parliament. I support Senator Sinodinos in standing aside. I think it is important that he gives evidence to ICAC. I am sure he will get a good character reference from ICAC, just as Senator Cameron claimed that he did. But the point is this: we have had trial by character assassination and it is unbefitting of this parliament to score political points simply to try and destroy a political opponent inappropriately.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2014-03-19,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:54):  I rise to support the matter of public importance today on the Prime Minister's failure to uphold ministerial standards. This government has been constituted for a mere six months. In that short time we have seen the trashing of ministerial conduct and accountability and a contempt for this parliament. For most of this year, this Senate has dealt with matters of impropriety by government ministers. As Senator Wong articulated well this morning, this Prime Minister is a dangerous combination of arrogance and weakness. He leads an arrogant government that refuses to be accountable. He leads a weak government that sets itself standards and fails to uphold them. And, worse, this is a Prime Minister who led an opposition which sought at any opportunity to attack the personal integrity of Labor Party and Independent members of the 43rd Parliament. He sought to bring arguments before this place well before anyone had had their time in court, and yet he displays the most curt arrogance in dealing with any serious matters of his own, or his side's own, doing. It is a government that is but six months old and that has already become more arrogant about its responsibilities than any government in living memory. It is a government that has adopted Joh Bjelke-Petersen's famous 'Now, don't you worry about that' approach to public life.


No-one took that approach in this morning's debate more so than Senator Brandis. With the utmost bravado, Senator Brandis spoke of Senator Sinodinos's character, of his numerous public awards, of the coalition's wonderful associations with business, of their superior character, of their superior knowledge of things worth knowing about. You can tell that Senator Brandis is enjoying his position. But as the first law officer of this land, you would expect him to have a bit more self-control, a bit more grace, in dealing with matters of such sensitivity. Given his successful attempts to drag out the debate this morning to delay a vote, he must have known of the senator's intentions to stand aside just before question time today. One would assume that Senator Abetz and the Prime Minister also knew of Senator Sinodinos's intentions. The country knew about it. The Financial Review reported Senator Sinodinos's musings this morning.


And this isn't the end of the matter. Senator Sinodinos may have temporarily stood aside but many questions still remain unanswered. If the Prime Minister is serious about ethical standards, he will require Senator Sinodinos to make a full disclosure about his involvement in AWH. Further, it is incumbent upon the Prime Minister to explain his knowledge of Senator Sinodinos's involvement with AWH and the steps he and his office have taken to examine this matter.


This afternoon, moments before question time, we had former Assistant Treasurer Sinodinos stand down from his position in the ministry. Senator Sinodinos has made the decision to temporarily stand aside for the duration of the ICAC trial, and the Labor Party welcomes his decision. However, the Senate has not received an explanation from Senator Sinodinos about his dealings with Australian Water Holdings. Senator Sinodinos came into the Senate at approximately 1.55 pm today to make a statement. His statement lasted approximately two minutes, leaving two to three minutes before question time. Why did Senator Sinodinos not use this statement to answer questions raised during the debate this morning if he has got nothing to hide? Why did he sit down with two or three minutes to go until question time? Why won't he answer the legitimate questions put forward by the opposition? 


This morning, the Senate spent a number of hours debating the worth of Senator Sinodinos making a full statement to the chamber. We know that the New South Wales ICAC has heard disturbing allegations of corruption by persons associated with the company Australian Water Holdings. We know that Senator Sinodinos was firstly a non-executive director and then became chairman of AWH. We know that concurrently he served first as treasurer and then as president of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party. Virtually all of the behaviour alleged at ICAC occurred while Senator Sinodinos was with AWH from 2008 to 2011—alleged behaviour that includes skimming money off government contracts to be paid as excessively generous salaries and dodgy share deals. The Prime Minister must require that Senator Sinodinos make a full statement to the Senate about this matter. The statement this afternoon from Senator Sinodinos was purely political, not about providing ministerial accountability to this place and through this place to the Australian people. (Time expired)

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2014-03-19,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (17:21):  Before I forget, I would just like to congratulate Senator O'Sullivan on a very fine first speech. Clearly a touch of the Irish remains—an irreverence, a lyricism, a wit and a touch of the troublemaker. I know all senators wish him well.


My friend Senator Claire Moore, as Manager of Opposition Business, is having a great week. As you know, I am a fan of Senator Moore, and when I received this MPI that was submitted for discussion this afternoon, 'The Prime Minister's failure to uphold ministerial standards,' I thought to myself, 'Well, either this is a joke or there is a deep touch of irony running through the MPIs this week.'


There is significant history behind this. If we go back to the previous two coalition administrations and the previous two Liberal prime ministers, Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and then Prime Minister John Howard, there is no question at all that both Liberal prime ministers set the bar very high for their ministerial colleagues. Some, I remember, argued that it was too high. I recall the dismissal of Sir Phillip Lynch by Mr Fraser, and then of course John Howard, Australia's second-longest-serving Prime Minister, having to receive the resignations of several of his ministers. There was never a question at all in the past about Liberal prime ministers, leading a coalition government, setting the standards for our ministers too low. If anything, they have always set them too high. There was always discussion among the parliamentary party, the academic community and, indeed, the public suggesting that the standards were actually too high. No-one has ever said that there was a failure to uphold ministerial standards. I have never heard that before of a Liberal Prime Minister or a coalition government.


By contrast, we have the Labor Party—in particular, the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party. It looks like an episode of The Sopranos; it has become that bad. We have Mr Eddie Obeid, known around the traps, I am told, as 'Fast Eddie'. We have Mr Tony Kelly, known in Chinatown as 'Machine-Gun Kelly'. We have Mr Joe Tripodi, known down there in Sussex Street as 'Smokin' Joe'. Finally, we have Mr Ian Macdonald. He is just known as Bad Ian Macdonald, in deference to my friend the good Senator the Hon. Ian Macdonald. We have these characters running around, these party figures. They are jokes, really. They are parodies of Australian political life and often a disgrace to our profession and public life—let alone the former federal president of the Labor Party, Mr Michael Williamson. He is just known as a crook. Of course, what the Labor Party have done is besmirch the profession, lowered Australia's trust in public life and diminished public life as a whole.


We have them all running around, and those blokes have done the impossible: they have given the New South Wales Labor Party an even worse name. You would not believe it was possible after years and years of the New South Wales Labor Party, rotten since the Rum Rebellion and the Rum Corps, but now it is even worse under these blokes. How I miss all my old right-wing friends from Sussex Street, including Steve Hutchins. You will remember Steve Hutchins, Acting Deputy President Bernardi. He was my old friend. He used to always worry about reds under the bed. Now we only worry about Obeids under the bed. That is all we worry about now.


Now all we have is an allegation against Senator Sinodinos. What is this allegation? It is that he has had some dealings with New South Wales Labor Party figures, some of whom clearly are very unattractive people. Let me just get this right: Labor's idea of misconduct and a hanging offence in this parliament is—wait for it—associating with members of the Labor Party. That is an interesting turn of events, isn't it? That is what the Labor Party now believes. I have a confession to make. I am used to making confessions, although I have not done it in a church for a while, I have to say. However, I do make confessions. I too have associated with some very unattractive figures in the Labor Party. There are many to choose from. I also, however, have associated with some very attractive figures, even from the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party: Senator Faulkner, Senator Stephens and others. They are attractive people. You cannot say that someone should be put down or hanged because of associations with others. So I am just wondering if perhaps I should hang my head in shame because of my associations with attractive or unattractive people.


There is a serious point in this, though, and I acknowledge it. The Labor Party wants to claim a scalp, to claim a win, to claim that the coalition has as many ratbags in it as the Labor Party does—that we are full of crooks. That is wrong. There has been no allegation of wrongdoing made by anyone against Senator Sinodinos. Senator Sinodinos is a witness. He is a witness in proceedings of the New South Wales ICAC. Any citizen may be called in as a witness in proceedings before ICAC, as you know, Acting Deputy President Bernardi. Neither council assisting ICAC nor other witnesses before ICAC nor the ICAC commissioner himself have alleged any wrongdoing against Senator Sinodinos. There are no allegations per se. Attendance as a witness at an ICAC hearing is not in any way an indication of wrongdoing, as Labor senators in this chamber very well know.


If appearing as a witness is now Labor's new standard of impropriety and implies guilt, just think of the precedent that now sets. If appearance as a witness with no allegations against a particular senator now qualifies as a hanging offence or as misconduct, just think of the precedent that is setting. It is one hell of a precedent not just for Senator Sinodinos but for any senator in this place—indeed, any member of parliament. It is a bar many of us would be very scared to try to jump over


The royal commission, as you know, will soon be calling in a lot of witnesses, and a lot of those witnesses will no doubt be past and present Labor Party officials and identities. And who knows? Some of them may be members of the Senate or the House of Representatives. They may be called as witnesses. And what are we supposed to make of that? Just because they are asked to testify, are we supposed to imply from that that they are crooks? I am not going to be doing that simply because someone is called as a witness to testify in a royal commission about trade unions. Tempting though it might be, I think we should, as it were, hold our horses.


I do not always agree with Mr Albanese, but I heard him this morning when I was jogging away at the gym, doing my best. The member for Grayndler said: 'Perhaps we should just hold back. People are entitled to rely on the presumption of innocence—even members of parliament.' Mr Albanese was right, and any fair-minded person would agree with that.


But it is actually more than that. All of us—and perhaps I have been guilty myself—have to try to resist trying other members of parliament in forums like the Senate or House of Representatives where there really is no chance to test evidence. There is really no chance to test proof. This is totally the wrong forum for the taking of evidence and the examination of witnesses, because it does not happen. The veracity of witnesses cannot be tested. This is the wrong forum for it. Let's just leave it to ICAC.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (17:33):  I present the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services Report on the 2012-13 annual reports of bodies established under the ASIC Act, together with the minutes of proceedings of the committee and the transcript of evidence.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator FAWCETT:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I present a report by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, as I have said, into the 2012 annual reports of those bodies established under the ASIC—the Australian Securities and Investments Commission—Act. Section 243 of the ASIC Act specifies this committee's duties, which include to examine each annual report that is prepared by a body established by the ASIC Act, and the report on the 2012-13 annual reports has been prepared in accordance with this section of the ASIC Act.


For this report the committee examined the 2012-13 annual reports of the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, the Australian Accounting Standards Board, the Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board, the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee, the Financial Reporting Council and the Takeovers Panel. The committee examines the annual reports prepared by ASIC as part of the committee's ongoing oversight of ASIC and, accordingly, the annual report of ASIC is not considered in this particular report.


The committee has made a number of observations and recommendations in this report. Firstly, several of the bodies did not implement changes to annual reports previously requested by this committee and the Senate Economics Committee. The committee has therefore made explicit recommendations to the Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board, the Takeovers Panel, the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board and the Australian Accounting Standards Board. The Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee has already implemented suggestions from the Senate Economics Legislation Committee.


Secondly, amendments to the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Audit Enhancement) Act 2012 significantly change the Financial Reporting Council's role within the financial reporting framework, repealing its auditor independence functions and refocusing it to provide strategic policy advice. In addition, the Financial Reporting Council's strategic analysis of Australia's financial reporting framework identified significant changes to the threats and weaknesses faced by Australia's financial reporting system. The committee will continue to monitor the new role and changing environment of the Financial Reporting Council.


Thirdly, in its annual report the Financial Reporting Council identified deficiencies in the financial literacy of some cohorts of Australian directors. The committee is pleased to see that the Financial Reporting Council has already initiated measures to mitigate these deficiencies. The committee has also recommended that the council implement regular surveys to monitor the effectiveness of the measures.


Lastly, the committee is pleased that the Takeovers Panel annual report indicates a substantial reduction of time between panel decisions and the publication of reasons.


The committee also noticed the following trends, which we will continue to monitor. There has been an increase in the number of applications being dismissed by the Takeovers Panel, a decline in the case load of the Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board and a surge in projects being undertaken by the Australian Accounting Standards Board as a result of the work program developed by the International Accounting Standards Board.


I would also like to note the wind-up of the Financial Reporting Panel in October 2012. As the Financial Reporting Panel had no activity report for 2012-13, all operations were covered in its final 2011-12 report. The committee considered the final annual report for the panel in its previous report on annual reports. In reviewing the annual reports, the committee also considers whether there are opportunities to strengthen the operation of the corporations legislation. However, the committee is not recommending any changes at this time. 


The committee considered the 2012-13 annual reports generally satisfactory and would like to thank officials of the organisations for their continuing cooperation and the secretariat for their assistance in compiling this report. The committee holds its next oversight hearing with ASIC and the Takeovers Panel on 28 March and will continue to pursue a number of the issues discussed in these reports and raised today. I commend this report and its recommendations to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Deregulation</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,15,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2014-03-19,"



Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (17:40):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


As always in matters of consequence, as this statement is, the devil lies in the detail. In the House today, the Prime Minister made a speech that highlighted a range of absurdities contained in regulation, extant regulation, and which the government will in due course seek to repeal.


The Prime Minister deliberately ignored the fact that some, indeed most, of the regulations in the repeal package have been around for at least 40 years and possibly longer. In that period, successive governments chose not to seek regulation repeal. Indeed, in most of that time period, the treasury benches were occupied by the current government and its predecessors.


The truth of the matter is that the current government is seeking to continue the practice of the previous Labor government as carried out over the last five or six years. Put simply, the previous government repealed reams and reams of redundant regulations and legislation. It was stock in trade for the previous government. So, surprise, surprise, the Abbott government has discovered the digital age and seeks to repeal redundant legislation requiring paper copies to be maintained in some government offices. Well done. But, in summary, the Abbott government continues previous practice.


Repeatedly, over the last few weeks and in the Prime Minister's statement we have it asserted that the last Labor government was responsible for some 21,000 new regulations. It seems to the opposition that the coalition is not capable of any analysis more nuanced than a self-serving scratch tally of the legislative instruments enacted between 2007 and 2013. Had the government bothered to be honest about the content of those 21,000 regulations, they would have found that over 4,000 were in fact tariff concession orders—regulations that reduced cost for business and that were requested by businesses. They might have found that a further 3,400 of these regulations were airworthiness directives addressing safety issues.


So, as always when one looks below the surface with this government, we find the justification for a course of action fits poorly with the evidence behind the assertion. I repeat, the previous Labor government never felt the need to confect a media stunt like repeal day to celebrate a dubious achievement, because the job was being done on a regular basis as part of the ongoing, sound administration of the nation's affairs. 


In contrast, Labor knows what brave regulatory reform is. In contrast, Labor well understands the virtue of the market operating free of unnecessary restriction and regulation. In contrast, Labor knows deregulatory reform is more than the routine repeal of redundant regulations that are no longer enforced. Since the eighties, Labor has achieved real deregulatory reform like banking sector liberalisation, sweeping competition reform, the floating of the dollar and the slashing of tariffs.


A real commitment to light-touch regulation might see the coalition adopt, as their own red-tape reduction manual counsels them, a market based climate change policy rather than a half-baked command-and-control scheme that even after four years they are unable to consistently explain. A real commitment to light-touch regulation might see the coalition support a fiscally responsible paid parental leave scheme rather than an inequitable, bloated program funded by a levy on business.


This is all apparently too complex for a government addicted to slogans in place of policy. This is a government that seeks to hide from the fact that, even by their own simplistic calculation of 21,000 new regulations, the all-time record for added pages of regulation was not under Labor Prime Ministers Gillard or Rudd; it was of course in 2006 under the coalition, led by then Prime Minister Howard. Let us move beyond rhetoric and put a few facts on the table at the beginning of this debate. The claim of 21,000 regulations is misleading and, arguably, deliberately misleading. Many if not most have nothing to do with business at all. For example, as I said, 3,400 relate to airworthiness directives issued to maintain and enhance public safety. Regulations have been used to assist business—4,200 legislative instruments saw business benefit from relaxing tariff concession orders. In the period of April to July of last year, the Gillard government repealed over 4,000 regulations. Some regulations may be valid for as little as one day and are used to repeal multiple other regulations. 


The PolitiFact website rated the coalition's claim 'mostly false'. PolitiFact concluded:


Our best available comparison shows there were more of these legislative instruments introduced in two years of the Howard government than Labor to date.


They said this in the middle of 2013. They went on:


The Labor government has made progress in their promised reform of excessive regulation.


In the last few months the government has been building a very simple argument, building the perception that regulation equals red tape, which equals bad. Yet in the last few weeks the Abbott government has created a pattern of deregulation that is bad for jobs, leaves small business out in the cold and disempowers ordinary Australians in the choices they make about their lives, including in the key areas of health, financial security and safety.


Some examples of the proposed red-tape reduction included in the package which is the subject of the ministerial statement before the chair include the following: a proposal to abolish the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal as part of the government's 'Repeal Day', and plans to scrap the Australian Jobs Act, which is designed to maximise the use of Australian goods and services in major construction projects. At the same time, the government is reviewing, with an eye to removing, the conditions Labor placed on the use of 457 visas for temporary foreign skilled workers, which include a requirement that a job must be advertised locally before a 457 visa is issued. The government proposes watering down legislation that requires companies with 100 or more employees to provide detailed annual reports about gender balance to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. This will make it impossible to know whether we are meeting targets. The proposed red-tape reduction also includes the likely abolishment of the Food Plan, leaving no plan for food processing and the small businesses that support it; the proposed FoFA changes, which effectively mean financial advisers will no longer be required to act in their clients' best interest and will remove the ban on conflicted remuneration like commissions; removal of the five-star food-rating website, weakening the ability of a person to make health choices for themselves and their families; removing Labor's clause in the TGA bill that would have enabled the TGA to instruct a company to release health warnings about their products, leaving people with less control over their health choices; and proposed changes to the Environment and Biodiversity Protection Act, handing powers over World Heritage listing to the states.


In summary, the opposition brings the attitude to the government's package that it pursued whilst it was in government. Unnecessary regulation, redundant regulation, legislation made irrelevant by time or circumstance or geography, is worthy of repeal. Simply jumping to a conclusion without thorough examination is in itself a wasted effort. The opposition will carefully scrutinise all aspects of the government's package of measures and release further advice at a future time.

Before I commence, I want to acknowledge—and draw the attention of the Senate to—the Deputy Chair and the CEO of the Northern Land Council and the Chair of the Central Land Council, who are in the gallery and are sharing this discussion with us today.


The opposition will be seeking to disallow these motions. We believe that in this area—a most sensitive area of activity that has been regulated and looked at by a series of governments and inquiries over so many years—there are two key points which I think we need to enshrine in all actions we take in this area. One of course must be effective, responsive and engaging consultation with the people who are involved and who will be affected by any form of change. We have heard this so many times. Commitments have been made by a series of governments that where there is any change to Aboriginal legislation there must be—there has to be—effective consultation. We put forward that that effective consultation has not taken place in this case. 


We know that the proposal by government is to make significant changes in the operation of Aboriginal land councils; to widen scope, to look at a delegation, to corporations, of a range of core issues. This was actually placed in legislation in 2006 but the way to move it forward is through regulation. 


You and I remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, working on the regulations and ordinance committee and putting forward the absolute assurance that there must be effective consultation for all legislation. We do not believe that there has been effective consultation with the people most affected in the development of these particular regulations. 


Telling people about it, asking for their opinion by mail, does not constitute consultation. What constitutes consultation—and we know this—is working closely with the people, working through the impact, working through the process, to ensure that there is absolute understanding and, where possible, agreement. We understand that consultation does not always mean agreement, but it certainly means respect for concerns that have been raised, and particularly respect for concerns that have been raised about the effective operations of the business. The business that is currently being done by the land councils makes sure that Aboriginal people have a true sense of ownership of their land and of any development that is taking place on their land.


The process that we have before you has had considerable response. When the letter was sent out to the corporations, naturally they responded; they always do. When issues are put before the councils they always respond to ensure that the concerns of their people are heard. There have been significant concerns about the impact that these regulations would have in ensuring that there is effective scrutiny and accountability for any decisions that are made.


The second point, leading on from effective consultation, must be ensuring that there is transparency and accountability and consistency in any kind of action that is taken. 


In this place, we have had the real pleasure of working with land councils over a number of years. Through the Senate estimates process, we have had the opportunity to work with land councils in relation to their annual reports and, on many occasions, to have land council members appear before us. In fact in recent times, since we have had the dedicated day looking at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues—which I think must be enshrined in our process in this place—we have on a number of occasions had council members appear before our committee to work through issues of concern that have been raised by senators.


One of the concerns that has been put on the record by the councils—who will be impacted by these regulations—is that this degree of accountability and scrutiny will not translate to any of the processes that are devolved to corporations. And we have yet to see any kind of process put forward by the government that tells us how that accountability and transparency will work. We know that, consistently, areas relating to Aboriginal land, Aboriginal wealth and Aboriginal income are of interest to those this place, but also and most importantly of interest to the traditional owners—to the people whom these processes are supposed to support. 


I know my friend Senator Peris will take this forward with her local knowledge of the area, and she will say much more about the concerns that people in that area have. But I really just wanted to make this point about accountability and transparency. But I also wanted to mention one of the more stupid aspects of these regulations, which is the time frame that is imposed on the regulations in terms of process. A three-month time frame is actually put—




Senator Scullion:
  Imagine having to respond in three months! Imagine that!




Senator MOORE:
  Minister, you will have your go—as you always do. The process outlined in the regulations includes a three-month turnaround for decisions which must involve careful scrutiny of the proposal for a corporation to take over key functions—and that scrutiny would be expected and must occur. But this is not a workable expectation: Aboriginal land councils have a clear schedule of meeting times, which we all know; when and where these councils meet is public and transparent. Their people know when they meet; we know when they meet. Not one of them would be able to turn around a decision of this nature within a three-month period. To put that forward in this regulation just does not make it workable. And the thing that comes behind that, of course, is that if there is not a decision made—and a response given back—by one of the land councils about a proposed devolution of authority to a corporation, the expectation is that the minister will step in immediately.


I have heard the current minister speak many times, both as a minister in the previous government and as the shadow minister for the last six years. He has told us consistently—in this place, in meetings and in regional meetings—about the importance of having effective ownership by Aboriginal people of their decisions. That is a statement by which he consistently stands. I agree with him. I respect the position he has taken. But the proposal in terms of these regulations does not reflect that position. 


If we are going to be—as we always agree we should, here in this place—respectful of Aboriginal land councils, and if we were acknowledging their work and their place in history, we will ensure that any expectation from the government or the parliament will include the opportunity for them to do their job. That has always been the process. The regulations we have before us in this chamber do not allow that to happen. I have read here about the processes that the minister is trying to put in place. In short, if the aim is to engage the councils and give them more flexibility, the best and most effective way forward—in fact, the only way forward—is to let the land councils see that they are partners in this process, and not being imposed upon by government. That has consistently been the argument that we have put up.


In terms of the process, we believe there is much more discussion to be had. No-one believes that everything should be locked in stone, and that no changes should be made. That has never been the position of the opposition. I believe that there is a willingness to maintain the discussion around further changes and further ways to ensure that there is the best possible outcome for the traditional owners of the land—which was the intent of the original legislation. So, we are not closing down the discussion; what we are saying is that the most effective way to move the discussion forward is to ensure that due process is put in place. The regulations as they are now drafted do not allow that due process.


We need to ensure that we have effective consultation, and an effective response to the issues that have been raised by the councils themselves about why they are uncomfortable with what has been put forward. We need to ensure that that consultation is there, that it is open, and that it is as engaging as possible. And I would suggest that it involves this place, Minister—not just outside. I suggest that it involves all of us in this place—because you know more than anyone else the interest and the commitment that people in this place have to ensuring that we have effective services and effective accountability in Aboriginal communities. These regulations do not provide that. In fact, there is a real danger that if these regulations are pushed through, it will further alienate the people who are most deserving of being consulted.


I know Senator Peris and Senator Siewert will have more to say, and so I will leave it at that. The opposition will not be supporting these regulations.

"Peris, Sen Nova",ALP,2014-03-19,"



Senator PERIS
 (Northern Territory) (18:05):  I rise in support of this disallowance motion, as it has direct relevance to the Northern Territory. As my colleague did earlier, I would like to acknowledge in the gallery today Northern Land Council members, Mr Sammy Bush-Blanasi and Mr John Daly, and deputy chair and CEO, Mr Joe Morrison; and also Central Land Council chairman, Maurie Japarta Ryan.


I support and applaud the very important role that the land councils play in representing Aboriginal people. We have four land councils in the Northern Territory: the Northern Land Council, the Central Land Council, the Tiwi Land Council and Anindilyakwa Land Council. They represent the traditional owners of the land and they also represent the concerns of Aboriginal people on many fronts. Aboriginal people have an extremely important connection to the land. The land owns Aboriginal people, not the other way around. Every aspect of our lives is connected to the land. We have a very deep spiritual connection to it. We have, in fact, 40,000 years of an inherited responsibility to the land and the sea. Aboriginal law and spirituality are intertwined in the land. This forms our culture and sovereignty. The health of the land and water is central to our culture. The land councils in the Northern Territory protect this connection but they also understand the importance of jobs and economic opportunity for our people. It is terrific that representatives of the land councils are here today, because this is a very important issue.


The essential reason that this disallowance motion exists is the lack of consultation from the Minister for Indigenous Affairs. The minister simply did not properly consult with affected stakeholders, in particular the land councils of the Northern Territory, when he amended the regulations that this motion seeks to disallow. Late last year, on December 12, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs tabled an amendment, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment (Delegation) Regulation 2013. This regulation directly affects land councils in the Northern Territory and I reiterate that the minister did not properly consult with them. The land councils do not support the regulation—and I will explain in a minute why the land councils are opposed—but what land councils and all Aboriginal people are sick of is, when changes that directly affect them are being made in Canberra, Aboriginal people do not have their say.


That is what has occurred here: no real or meaningful and respectful consultation process and no formal opportunity to comment on the changes that directly affect them have taken place. Nothing upsets Aboriginal people more than being ignored on matters that affect them, and being ignored by the minister who is meant to be responsible for Indigenous affairs is especially wrong. The Prime Minister says that he will be the Prime Minister for Aboriginal people, yet this government makes changes to Aboriginal rights regulations without properly consulting with Aboriginal people. That is not right. 


This is not the first time we have seen this approach. Last month, without any consultation, $10 million was scrapped from Machado–Joseph Foundation. There was outrage, even from members of the Liberal Country Party of the Northern Territory. Party members were calling the decision disgraceful and disgusting, but that is what happens when you do not talk to the people when making decisions that affect their lives or without telling them. The minister, to his credit, back flipped and has restored some of the funding, but the damage has already been done. I hope that the minister now understands that Aboriginal people do not like having decisions thrust upon them.


I will now explain why the land councils are opposed to these regulations. First and foremost, they impose new requirements on the content of applications for delegation for Aboriginal corporations. The regulation seeks to impose criteria by which land councils would be required to consider delegation applications. The changes also impose a three-month time limit for land councils to consider an application for delegation on an Aboriginal corporation before it may be referred by the Aboriginal corporation to the minister for approval. If the proposed changes are not allowed, land councils will not receive adequate information so as to make an informed decision as to whether a delegation should take place. This will be subject to an unreasonable time frame for the consideration of potentially major and permanent transfer of core land council functions.


The two biggest land councils, the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council, have submitted a joint submission opposing this regulation. It is a very comprehensive submission and it supports this disallowance today. I want to read out an extract from the submission that outlines their objections. The submission says:


The regulations require a Land Council, to respond to an application for delegation of functions within 3 months, failing which the Land Council is deemed to have refused such that the Minister may force a delegation. The response time for adequate consideration of such a request must accommodate both the investigation and decision making processes of the Land Council. During the period after an application has been received the Land Council will need to:


Confirm whether the membership meets the eligibility requirements;


Consider the matters for which a delegation has been applied for, particularly with regard to the Land Council's statutory obligations;


Determine whether the corporation is soundly governed and whether it has met its statutory reporting requirements;


Assess the administrative and financial capacity of the corporation;


Undertake any consultations required;


Assess the requested resource implications;


Assess the implications for 3rd parties including the impact on 'transaction costs';


At a meeting of the Council: decide on the application;


Provide written notice to the Corporation and to the Minister.


The period of 3 months is utterly inadequate as the Land Councils decision will need to be made by the Council at one of its Full Council meetings (triannual for the CLC, and biannual for the NLC) following the completion of the above investigation and consultations. Further, the regulations fail to adequately prescribe how the proposed area in which the Aboriginal corporation wishes to exercise Land Council functions is to be described in the application. Precision is needed in this regard to provide the Land Council with an accurate basis for determining whether the corporation, membership complies with eligibility requirements, and to look at whether the area provides logical administrative boundaries for the delegated functions. Precision is also needed, because the Land Councils will need to be certain about which body, it or the delegate, may exercise functions over a given area, and third parties need certainty about who they should be dealing with.


It is plain, from experience regarding applications to create new Land Councils, that the period of 3 months to consider a delegate corporation's 28A application is manifestly insufficient.


As you can see, their objections are very comprehensive, very considered and very well founded.


The Anindilyakwa Land Council from Groote Eylandt have also written to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs opposing this regulation, and I will quickly read an extract from their letter. They say:


We have a grave fear that even the threat of an application for delegation, by maverick groups and/or 'carpetbagger' advisors purporting to act on their behalf, will lead to intra-community disputes and even possibly litigation, which the ALC, and possibly you, Minister, would have to defend at great cost to us all.


We respectfully request you give consideration to our grave concerns, to avoid these many serious unintended consequences.


There has been absolutely no consideration of their grave concerns by this minister. I am also advised that members of the Tiwi Land Council share the concerns of the other three land councils. So the land councils' opposition to this amendment from the minister is clear. Not only is the rationale behind their objections very clear, but they are also upset by the fact that they have been ignored. I also understand that the Northern Land Council have found that their dealings with the minister on this matter have been extremely unsatisfactory. That is extremely concerning, not just in relation to this issue, but in relation to the government's approach to land councils and to Aboriginal people. It gives me no pleasure that the minister and the land councils are at loggerheads because, for the good of the Northern Territory it is very important that the Commonwealth government's Minister for Indigenous Affairs has a good relationship with the land councils.


I want to quote from a speech by the now Minister for Indigenous Affairs that was given at a Northern Land Council meeting in Timber Creek in May last year when he was in opposition. He was talking about potential changes to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act and said:


I do not intend to force this on anyone. I want to support the Land Councils and I want you to be a part of it. I want Land Council's to be strong.


They are such beautiful words, but they were just words. They remind me of the late Dr Yunupingu's famous lyrics:


All those talking politicians


Words are easy, words are cheap


Much cheaper than our priceless land.


The minister concluded his speech to the Northern Land Council by saying:


Whichever way it goes my friends, whether we win the election or not, whether I become the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I will always be on your side and I will always want to work with you.


If this disallowance is supported, then the Minister for Indigenous Affairs should go back to the drawing board and begin talking to Aboriginal people, in full consultation with land councils, in an honest and open manner. He should do what he said he would do before the election.


I support the disallowance, and I call on both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Indigenous Affairs to ensure that, next time they intend to make changes that affect Aboriginal people, they do the right thing and have the decency to properly consult with them. I thank the land councils for coming here today and for the work they continue to do in protecting our land and for standing up for Aboriginal Territorians.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2014-03-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:16):  From the outset I indicate that the Greens will be supporting this disallowance. I have looked at this issue, and I have talked to both the government and the land councils. I, too, acknowledge the presence of representatives of land councils in the gallery tonight.


We need to look at the context of these regulations. They are coming from the amendments that were made in the Howard government era that were clearly designed, I believe, to make it easier to remove the control of lands from the land councils. I think it was part of the amendments made to facilitate that process. I would suggest that that did not achieve its aim and that is why this regulation is being brought in. I am not suggesting evil intent by the current minister, but I am concerned about the precedent that this regulation would make, because it allows a minister to have quite extraordinary control. I do not think that that is appropriate when you are talking about areas that are under the responsibility of land councils and around decisions that they, rightly, should be making.


I listened to the minister very carefully—and I thank him for taking the trouble to explain to me his reasoning for this regulation—but I think there are better ways to achieve what he is trying to achieve. If it is just about the time frame for decision making, I think there are better ways to do that. Some of the loopholes—the gaps—in this regulation are, very properly, being raised by the Central Land Council and the Northern Land Council, although I have had other people and organisations raise their concerns about this with me. Concerns have been raised that, by allowing and facilitating Aboriginal corporations to have powers delegated to them through this mechanism, it may include non-traditional owners. In fact, as I understand it, there is not a requirement that the people involved are Aboriginal. That is a concern for me.


There is concern about the viability and sustainability of the corporations involved. I do not see how a land council, in making the decision around delegation following an application, could be assured about the financial viability and sustainability of a particular corporation. As I understand it, if that corporation folded, the powers would then default to the minister. I am concerned about those particular issues which, again, undermine the decision-making responsibilities of the land council.


Concern has been expressed to me about decisions being made that should properly be made by traditional owners, which I am very concerned about. The position has been put to me that there are some decisions, which are smaller decisions, that do not need to be made by traditional owners. With all due respect, I think that is a decision that should be made by the traditional owners. The traditional owners, therefore, should be in a position to make the decision about whether they need to make that decision—if you understand where I am coming from. It is my opinion—and it is an opinion that has been made strongly to me—that it is not up to non-traditional owners to decide who should be the decision makers.


There are also concerns around the responsibilities where, once they are delegated to a corporation, the land council still has certain financial responsibilities and responsibilities, potentially, for supporting the corporation to which these responsibilities have been delegated. Again, they then have no control over the decision in the first place. It seems to me that, while we are talking about trying to improve the decision-making process and get rid of some of the complexities, it could potentially lead to further complexities in decision making and further confusion.


I do understand that the government is trying to make some of these processes easier. It has been put to me that where other entities have applied for delegation of power it has been to set up new land councils. Where an application has been made and there has been serious discussion about it, the decision has been made and agreement reached. I do not think that facilitating what ultimately is a transfer of responsibilities back to the government through the minister is appropriate. 


Let us go back to where this power originated. It originated from a Howard government agenda to get, for example, township leases in place. This was to allow outside development in townships, because the government was frustrated—other people were not necessarily frustrated—by traditional owners not allowing certain developments in their townships. This power came along, if people remember, with the whole process around income management and some other very draconian powers, including setting aside and exempting from the Racial Discrimination Act those measures at that time. When the ALP government came in, they wound back some of those draconian powers. If you remember rightly, there were no financial payments under those township lease arrangements. That has become more 'normalised' since that issue of payments was addressed. 


We need to remember where this power came from. It was about gaining control of decision making over land. I am not suggesting that Minister Scullion is trying to concentrate that power. I am saying, however, that in the future these regulations could be used to enable more concentration of ministerial control over decisions that rightly sit with the traditional owners. The Greens will not support that further concentration of power in the executive. We believe that decision making should be with the traditional owners. 


On behalf of the Greens, I very willing to say that, if there is another proposal which deals more appropriately with the time frame of decision making and with the questions and issues that have been raised by the land councils, we will be very happy to look at that alternative approach but we will not support the approach that is currently outlined in this regulation. We did raise very serious concerns when these amendments were first made, and we still hold those very serious concerns. I am not about to agree to a regulation that in fact concentrates those decision-making powers outside of the processes of land councils. Having said that, we will agree to look at an alternative approach. We are very happy to consider that, but we will not support this regulation. We will support the disallowance.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-03-19,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:26):  Can I indicate that I take a contrary position. I will not support the disallowance. I have listened very carefully to what the contributors have put in relation to this debate, and I note particularly the comments made by Senator Siewert in relation to looking at alternative approaches. I have approached this issue by looking at some of the procedural aspects of the regulations, which I thought had some merit, but I do acknowledge the contributions made by other senators. 


The Northern Territory Land Rights Act already includes specific provisions that enable an Aboriginal corporation to apply to a land council to request a delegation of some of the council's powers. What these regulations do is introduce a specific process and a time line for these applications. I have heard the criticisms about that time line, which I will address shortly. However, without these regulations, the provisions in the act cannot be practically effective, because if there is no time frame specified to deal with a request for delegation then arguably they are meaningless. 


I note that these regulations do not change the intent or application of the act. They, as I understand it from the government's point of view, improve its mechanics. If there is to be a debate about the intent of the legislation—what was passed by the Howard government—then so be it, but I am looking at the way that the mechanics of these regulations work. The regulations themselves make provisions for the type of information that corporations should provide and that land councils should consider so that due diligence takes place. The regulations also place a three-month time limit for considering applications, which I note has been heavily criticised, but, importantly, the regulations allow councils to apply for an extension on this limit. 


I think part of this debate seems to centre around whether the delegation of powers should exist in the first place. I think that, in appropriate circumstances, there ought to be a delegation. Where there is an adequate organisational capability or when there is a majority of voice in a corporation then there should be a capacity for councils to delegate. This can provide traditional owners with greater control and autonomy over their land and the ability to maximise the economic benefit from it. But this is not what this debate is about today. The provisions for delegation exist in the bill and, as such, should be operating properly. I believe these regulations achieve that aim. In the absence of these regulations, the provision is meaningless. 


I note the position of the opposition and the Greens, and I respect that, but I believe that the current situation allows applications to remain in limbo indefinitely. I do not think that is desirable. I think some would say that it is pointless and, I am sure, distressing for those members of the corporation who have made the application. When I received a briefing from the minister in relation to this just a couple of days ago he said that there was an application from the Mangarayi Aboriginal Corporation—I have probably pronounced that wrongly and I apologise—to the Northern Land Council back in 2010 that has still not been decided on. So, if no decision is made, then there are no avenues of appeal. Instead, the corporations will have to go through an expensive and lengthy legal battle to even get a decision to appeal—via, as I understand it, a lengthy and costly judicial review process—and I do not think that is desirable.


I see this as being about procedural fairness, although I support the broader issues behind it. I am encouraged by Senator Siewert's comments that the Australian Greens will look at dealing with some of the issues that have been raised by the minister, and I think that might provide a middle ground or a way forward in relation to that. But, on balance, I am not convinced to support this disallowance.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (18:30):  As other speakers have done, I would like to acknowledge my good friends in the gallery from the Northern Land Council and from the Central Land Council. But, more importantly, I would like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the Northern Territory, which is whom this debate should be about—not their representatives, not the bodies that represent them. I am here, as Senator Peris should be here, to represent the interests of my constituents. That constituency is part of the fabric of the Commonwealth government, within which the Northern Land Council is a statutory body. My responsibility as minister is to ensure that you carry out your functions in a way that is lawful and provides procedural fairness to your constituents, whether you do so or not. That is my role in this.


It was with some sadness that I heard what Senator Siewert said. I would like to be cranky with you but we have had a very long relationship. I would like to sit down and explain a number of things, Senator Siewert—a couple of things, just technical changes. This change was made in 2006. It was not associated with the income management process; it was done well before that—



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator SCULLION:
  Just in terms of a correction, Senator. This regulation—and I do not have time to just make up regulation, to just slip in here and throw a few regulations around—was the subject of a significant consultation process with all the land councils and with Aboriginal corporations. There were a series of consultations, and the reason those consultations were had was that there was mischief afoot. Certainly, the land councils in that consultation had indicated a whole range of things, and in response to that we made some changes. On the basis of that very clear advice, we put the regulations forward.


Now, those on the other side seem to think this is an opportunity to talk about section 28. That is actually our law. That is our law now and that is the law which the Northern Land Council, which is a servant of this, being a Commonwealth statutory authority, needs to respect. Section 28, effectively, is land rights plus. It is a law that allows people to make some significant decisions themselves on their own land. It is real land rights. That is not just a statement. I have no interest in this. None of these processes actually provide the minister with any decision-making power. It is there, as always, as a default position, but we do not get any land. I genuinely have no interest in who is speaking for whose country; that is entirely a matter for traditional owners. But there was a fair bit of mischief going on.


If I could just use a short anecdote about a friend of mine who would be well known to Maurie, perhaps not to others. There was a guy called Herman Malbunka—he has passed away, bless his soul—who was a good friend of mine. I can remember him sitting on the side of his road, and it is a road that goes past Hermannsburg over to the west. He used to think, 'People have to get jerry cans to get all the way. Wouldn't it be good if I could have a service station here?' I said, 'Why don't you get a service station, apply to the land council?' He said, 'I've been trying.' I said, 'How long have you been trying, mate?' 'Oh, I don't know, Senator; maybe for four or five years.' I said, 'Oh, okay.' He said, 'My vision is, with the least money I can get from this, I want to buy cattle, because I'm a cattleman.' He was always proud of wearing his big belt buckle, and his sons were cattlemen. He said, 'That's our future, because I want to buy cattle and put it on the rest of my land and this is how I can do it.' 


But the process of the land council—and it is no reflection, Maurie Ryan, on the Central Land Council; it happened a long time ago. It is more of a reflection on the sorts of things that Senator Peris brought up. They only meet every now and again. It is a terribly cumbersome process. Wherever I go, Senator Peris—and, after you start travelling a little bit more, you will find this—almost everyone says, 'Look, I'd really like to have a faster process or something where we can actually make a decision, where we can make a decision in our own lunchtime,' because sometimes in a business sense that is really important: 'I want to make a decision today.' 'I know—I'm sorry; you're going to have to wait a long time.' And that is in circumstances where the land council is going to cooperate.


So why do we actually need this regulation? First of all, despite what has been said about the consultation, we consulted considerably. We had the consultations start in November 2013. We introduced this last year, in December. I spoke at length to the full land council, and this is the important point—and thank you very much, Senator Peris; I omitted to find my speech and you managed to quote for me the exact part I wanted to quote, which was: 'I'm here; I'm talking about section 28.' If you had read the remainder of the speech, you would have seen that section 28 was the preference to what seemed to be the only alternative, which was an entirely new land council. I spoke to the Northern Land Council. I spoke to the entire Central Land Council. In Timber Creek—because I spoke about it twice to the Northern Land Council—there were a whole range of questions. The second time I spoke to it, which was in Darwin, to the entire Northern Land Council—the first minister to have appeared before them, I understand—there were a few questions of interest, but none of the rank and file were saying, 'This is a bad thing.' I speak to the rank and file and I have to say it is pretty interesting. Maurie Ryan has not said to me that he has spoken to the land council and, 'This is the view of the land council.' Nor have the Northern Land Council. You did not have a resolution of the meeting that I was at that said, 'Suddenly, section 28A is odious to our organisation,' and you are empowered as the executive to come down to Canberra and say so and make a submission because you would be the only ones who knew about it. Your constituency knew nothing about it and know nothing about it today.




Senator Urquhart:
  On a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President: I ask you to bring the minister's attention to the fact that he should be addressing the chair, not the people in the gallery. I do not think that is acceptable.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ruston
):  There is no point of order.




Senator SCULLION:
  In consultation with the land councils, one of the things we have said—I note that Senator Peris read out that bit about codification—is that we would provide, as part of this regulation, a series of things that the people making the application had to have in it. It is not difficult. It includes things such as the names of the corporation's members, evidence of the corporation, why the corporation seeks delegation, why the corporation selected part of the area of the land council, description of the consultation, the traditional owners of the land, description of the area and so on. That was exactly what the land councils wanted us to do. That was what was said at the consultations.


We all need to understand—and I am sure those in the Labor Party know exactly what is going on here—that this is a deliberate decision. The Labor Party do not like section 28A for some reason. The fact that it is a law does not seem to be of any material concern to them. They do not like it, so they are going to find a way around it. The thing is that the law is applied so traditional owners can get procedural fairness. This is about procedural fairness.


The good senator opposite indicated that the minister would of course intervene if the process took more than three months. But, as has been mentioned before, there was an application made on 4 August 2010. It is the only one. Some 1,324 days later—for those who need the translation, that is three years, seven months and 15 days—there has been no response. The other thing that is interesting about the fact that they have not responded is that the minister got a copy. The Labor minister got a copy on the same day! Where is the intervention to achieve procedural fairness for the traditional owners? Where was she? Where was Labor? Where were they when they should have been intervening on behalf of traditional owners to ensure their access to justice and their access to procedural fairness? They were nowhere.


This is not a debate, Senator Peris, about land councils. This is a debate about access to justice and procedural fairness. If you want to change the act, bring a bill into this place and do so. That is how it works. If you want to give traditional owners access to something—this was more than three years! Quite clearly there is a mischief in that. So we thought, 'Maybe we should introduce some regulations.' We went to see the land councils and they said, 'Three months is not enough.' We said, 'No worries—that is understandable.' In a normal administrative process, if after three months you needed any longer, you would have to do something. One would have thought that, in all that time, they would have acknowledged the letter—they have not. So we added a ministerial discretion for an extension if one is required, as is normal.


It is just a nonsense to say, 'Three months—that is not long enough.' Of course sometimes it is not long enough. In some cases it would be long enough. As a consequence of the consultations, we have said that, if the letter to the land council does not meet all the provisions of the act, you must refuse it. We put up a much higher bar because we listened to what the land councils had to say to us. When we consulted, it was not just the department going out with me and talking to all the land councils. There was a comprehensive official consultation process.


Two things came out of that consultation process. First of all, there needed to be some discretion in case the process took too long and, second, we needed to codify things. So here we are in the Senate having created a regulation that allows traditional owners to make the decision. In addition to consulting with the land council members, I have, for a long period of time, been talking to my real constituents—the traditional owners on the lands. They see this as a benefit. In fact I was speaking recently to Galarrwuy Yunupingu. He is not the father of land rights but he had a fair bit to do with it. He said, 'We always need to move towards people on country having more say about their country'—and that is exactly what this does. It allows them to have more say about their country. I am sorry but I do not have any letters from land councils to read out, Senator Peris, because I have been talking to your constituents rather than the land councils.


I have a letter here from the Rirratjingu Aboriginal Corporation. It says:


We are writing to you today in support of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment (Delegation) Regulation 2013 (the ""Regulation"") and our strong belief that it should not be disallowed.


…      …   …


A corporation may apply for these powers under subsection 28A(1) of the Act, but if the Regulation is not in place the Land Council is not required to respond in any set period. This means that the NLC would be able to refuse to ever make a formal decision on an application.


We have demonstrated that is the case. We have demonstrated that that is exactly what happens—and we have also already demonstrated that it was done with the full compliance of the previous minister. It is no wonder they are worried. They say: 'These are sorts of arrangements we need to move towards. We need to be able to make a decision on our own country.' How could that possibly be so repugnant, so difficult?


The letter goes on to say:


The Regulation is urgently needed to address this situation, and we fully support the Minister for Indigenous Affairs in this regard.


It continues:


The statutory authority and responsibility of the NLC is not changed by this Regulation—


and it is not—


What the Regulation does is ensure that the NLC properly exercises that statutory responsibility on behalf of the people that it is meant to represent.


I could not have said it better myself. The responsibility of the land council is not something this place should have to create a regulation to remind them of. Three years and seven months! I do not really think that is procedural fairness for Aboriginal people. The letter continues:


It is unconscionable that an Aboriginal corporation, and the Aboriginal people, which it represents, may be denied any answer to their application—


thereby denying them procedural justice in their application—


and that the land council could refuse to fulfil its statutory duties and effectively shut down an application without giving any reasons for doing so.


Well, of course, that is an outrage, and it is what has happened. It happened on Labor's watch with the full concurrence of the minister at the time, which is inexplicable. Perhaps, Senator, in response, you might want to touch on some of those matters, because I am miffed that I only recently found out that the Labor Party, the minister and the government at the time knew on the same day—three years, seven months and 15 days ago—that this application had been made. Throughout that time, people were waiting for a response. She knew they were waiting for a response, and nothing was done.


The letter continues:


You have the full support of the Rirratjingu Aboriginal Corporation to pursue the continuation of this important Regulation to make certain that Land Councils cannot simply ignore Aboriginal Corporations as representatives of their constituents, and to ensure the proper operation of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act.


It is signed by Bakamumu Marika. He is also not the father of land rights, but his father is. This is the son of Roy Marika, a wonderful man I would have learned an awful lot more from if I had not had to sit next to him in his tractor and next to the exhaust while he was providing his wisdom to me, but I can tell you that I have a pretty clear understanding of what he thought land rights were. If you go upstairs to the bark petition on your way out, guys, you might check it out, because what it says is that people on country need to make decisions for themselves. The disallowance of this motion completely prevents that.


What we have here is a situation where consultation was done to remove a mischief. The mischief was clear. It was well known by the previous government—in fact, by the previous minister—that what the land council were doing to get around the law was to deny their own constituents procedural fairness. Their own constituents—the people who elected them to the council—and, I suspect, the members of the council, but I do not think that they have been told.


The other side would have us believe that this is not important. But I cannot imagine, with respect, Senator Siewert, when it came to access to justice, access to the law and access to procedural fairness, that you would not normally be the absolute champion of that first up. I am a bit disappointed—not so much over here—Senator Peris, at your decision, uninformed as it is, to remove procedural fairness and access to the law for your own people. You might be able to somehow befriend the land councils, but I think you are going to have to answer to the traditional owners who, all over the place, are saying, 'We've got a law. Why can't I get access to the law like anyone else?'


It is interesting that if somebody writes BHP a letter, for example, they would be required to write back. It is all part of a process. They just do not write back because that is cool; that is much better—'We just won't write back. It's the Greens. Forget it.' If it does not provide procedural fairness about a response, or something like that, we would all be outraged. But what outrages me more is that somehow because it is Aboriginal traditional owners it is okay, because they do not know anything, do they! They are not smart enough, really, the poor blackfellas; they cannot make up their own mind! I have never heard anything more patronising in this place. They simply can't make their mind up! 'We know best'—Labor know best—'and we don't want them to get access to this because they are not ready for it, are they?' I have never heard anything more disgracefully patronising in my life. I can tell you: we would never be applying it to white people in this place. You would all be crying, 'Access to justice! What about the law? Procedural fairness!' Why is it any different for my countrymen? Why is it any different for the people we represent? There is no difference, is there? So they have been selected on the basis of their race.


I will not make silly allegations about that particular matter, but it disappoints me so deeply that we sit here today with a law that people can access that is legitimate, they have a legitimate access to the law, and today we are about to move in this place to deny people a legitimate lawful right that was provided them in this place by this parliament. Again, I cannot say how disappointed I am that Aboriginal people are still not going to get access to justice, they are not going to get access to procedural fairness, and I think that the only thing that you can say is that—

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2014-03-19,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (17:55):  At the request of Senator McLucas, I move:


That the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment (Delegation) Regulation 2013, as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2013 No. 272 and made under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, be disallowed.


This will lead into the debate we are having about a disallowance motion for a range of regulations that are being put forward by the minister. Before I commence, I want to acknowledge—and draw the attention of the Senate to—the Deputy Chair and the CEO of the Northern Land Council and the Chair of the Central Land Council, who are in the gallery and are sharing this discussion with us today.


The opposition will be seeking to disallow these motions. We believe that in this area—a most sensitive area of activity that has been regulated and looked at by a series of governments and inquiries over so many years—there are two key points which I think we need to enshrine in all actions we take in this area. One of course must be effective, responsive and engaging consultation with the people who are involved and who will be affected by any form of change. We have heard this so many times. Commitments have been made by a series of governments that where there is any change to Aboriginal legislation there must be—there has to be—effective consultation. We put forward that that effective consultation has not taken place in this case. 


We know that the proposal by government is to make significant changes in the operation of Aboriginal land councils; to widen scope, to look at a delegation, to corporations, of a range of core issues. This was actually placed in legislation in 2006 but the way to move it forward is through regulation. 


You and I remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, working on the regulations and ordinance committee and putting forward the absolute assurance that there must be effective consultation for all legislation. We do not believe that there has been effective consultation with the people most affected in the development of these particular regulations. 


Telling people about it, asking for their opinion by mail, does not constitute consultation. What constitutes consultation—and we know this—is working closely with the people, working through the impact, working through the process, to ensure that there is absolute understanding and, where possible, agreement. We understand that consultation does not always mean agreement, but it certainly means respect for concerns that have been raised, and particularly respect for concerns that have been raised about the effective operations of the business. The business that is currently being done by the land councils makes sure that Aboriginal people have a true sense of ownership of their land and of any development that is taking place on their land.


The process that we have before you has had considerable response. When the letter was sent out to the corporations, naturally they responded; they always do. When issues are put before the councils they always respond to ensure that the concerns of their people are heard. There have been significant concerns about the impact that these regulations would have in ensuring that there is effective scrutiny and accountability for any decisions that are made.


The second point, leading on from effective consultation, must be ensuring that there is transparency and accountability and consistency in any kind of action that is taken. 


In this place, we have had the real pleasure of working with land councils over a number of years. Through the Senate estimates process, we have had the opportunity to work with land councils in relation to their annual reports and, on many occasions, to have land council members appear before us. In fact in recent times, since we have had the dedicated day looking at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues—which I think must be enshrined in our process in this place—we have on a number of occasions had council members appear before our committee to work through issues of concern that have been raised by senators.


One of the concerns that has been put on the record by the councils—who will be impacted by these regulations—is that this degree of accountability and scrutiny will not translate to any of the processes that are devolved to corporations. And we have yet to see any kind of process put forward by the government that tells us how that accountability and transparency will work. We know that, consistently, areas relating to Aboriginal land, Aboriginal wealth and Aboriginal income are of interest to those this place, but also and most importantly of interest to the traditional owners—to the people whom these processes are supposed to support. 


I know my friend Senator Peris will take this forward with her local knowledge of the area, and she will say much more about the concerns that people in that area have. But I really just wanted to make this point about accountability and transparency. But I also wanted to mention one of the more stupid aspects of these regulations, which is the time frame that is imposed on the regulations in terms of process. A three-month time frame is actually put—




Senator Scullion:
  Imagine having to respond in three months! Imagine that!




Senator MOORE:
  Minister, you will have your go—as you always do. The process outlined in the regulations includes a three-month turnaround for decisions which must involve careful scrutiny of the proposal for a corporation to take over key functions—and that scrutiny would be expected and must occur. But this is not a workable expectation: Aboriginal land councils have a clear schedule of meeting times, which we all know; when and where these councils meet is public and transparent. Their people know when they meet; we know when they meet. Not one of them would be able to turn around a decision of this nature within a three-month period. To put that forward in this regulation just does not make it workable. And the thing that comes behind that, of course, is that if there is not a decision made—and a response given back—by one of the land councils about a proposed devolution of authority to a corporation, the expectation is that the minister will step in immediately.


I have heard the current minister speak many times, both as a minister in the previous government and as the shadow minister for the last six years. He has told us consistently—in this place, in meetings and in regional meetings—about the importance of having effective ownership by Aboriginal people of their decisions. That is a statement by which he consistently stands. I agree with him. I respect the position he has taken. But the proposal in terms of these regulations does not reflect that position. 


If we are going to be—as we always agree we should, here in this place—respectful of Aboriginal land councils, and if we were acknowledging their work and their place in history, we will ensure that any expectation from the government or the parliament will include the opportunity for them to do their job. That has always been the process. The regulations we have before us in this chamber do not allow that to happen. I have read here about the processes that the minister is trying to put in place. In short, if the aim is to engage the councils and give them more flexibility, the best and most effective way forward—in fact, the only way forward—is to let the land councils see that they are partners in this process, and not being imposed upon by government. That has consistently been the argument that we have put up.


In terms of the process, we believe there is much more discussion to be had. No-one believes that everything should be locked in stone, and that no changes should be made. That has never been the position of the opposition. I believe that there is a willingness to maintain the discussion around further changes and further ways to ensure that there is the best possible outcome for the traditional owners of the land—which was the intent of the original legislation. So, we are not closing down the discussion; what we are saying is that the most effective way to move the discussion forward is to ensure that due process is put in place. The regulations as they are now drafted do not allow that due process.


We need to ensure that we have effective consultation, and an effective response to the issues that have been raised by the councils themselves about why they are uncomfortable with what has been put forward. We need to ensure that that consultation is there, that it is open, and that it is as engaging as possible. And I would suggest that it involves this place, Minister—not just outside. I suggest that it involves all of us in this place—because you know more than anyone else the interest and the commitment that people in this place have to ensuring that we have effective services and effective accountability in Aboriginal communities. These regulations do not provide that. In fact, there is a real danger that if these regulations are pushed through, it will further alienate the people who are most deserving of being consulted.


I know Senator Peris and Senator Siewert will have more to say, and so I will leave it at that. The opposition will not be supporting these regulations.

",Senate,<title>REGULATIONS AND DETERMINATIONS</title>,<title>Disallowance</title>,REGULATIONS AND DETERMINATIONS,19,2
"Peris, Sen Nova",ALP,2014-03-19,"



Senator PERIS
 (Northern Territory) (18:05):  I rise in support of this disallowance motion, as it has direct relevance to the Northern Territory. As my colleague did earlier, I would like to acknowledge in the gallery today Northern Land Council members, Mr Sammy Bush-Blanasi and Mr John Daly, and deputy chair and CEO, Mr Joe Morrison; and also Central Land Council chairman, Maurie Japarta Ryan.


I support and applaud the very important role that the land councils play in representing Aboriginal people. We have four land councils in the Northern Territory: the Northern Land Council, the Central Land Council, the Tiwi Land Council and Anindilyakwa Land Council. They represent the traditional owners of the land and they also represent the concerns of Aboriginal people on many fronts. Aboriginal people have an extremely important connection to the land. The land owns Aboriginal people, not the other way around. Every aspect of our lives is connected to the land. We have a very deep spiritual connection to it. We have, in fact, 40,000 years of an inherited responsibility to the land and the sea. Aboriginal law and spirituality are intertwined in the land. This forms our culture and sovereignty. The health of the land and water is central to our culture. The land councils in the Northern Territory protect this connection but they also understand the importance of jobs and economic opportunity for our people. It is terrific that representatives of the land councils are here today, because this is a very important issue.


The essential reason that this disallowance motion exists is the lack of consultation from the Minister for Indigenous Affairs. The minister simply did not properly consult with affected stakeholders, in particular the land councils of the Northern Territory, when he amended the regulations that this motion seeks to disallow. Late last year, on December 12, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs tabled an amendment, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment (Delegation) Regulation 2013. This regulation directly affects land councils in the Northern Territory and I reiterate that the minister did not properly consult with them. The land councils do not support the regulation—and I will explain in a minute why the land councils are opposed—but what land councils and all Aboriginal people are sick of is, when changes that directly affect them are being made in Canberra, Aboriginal people do not have their say.


That is what has occurred here: no real or meaningful and respectful consultation process and no formal opportunity to comment on the changes that directly affect them have taken place. Nothing upsets Aboriginal people more than being ignored on matters that affect them, and being ignored by the minister who is meant to be responsible for Indigenous affairs is especially wrong. The Prime Minister says that he will be the Prime Minister for Aboriginal people, yet this government makes changes to Aboriginal rights regulations without properly consulting with Aboriginal people. That is not right. 


This is not the first time we have seen this approach. Last month, without any consultation, $10 million was scrapped from Machado–Joseph Foundation. There was outrage, even from members of the Liberal Country Party of the Northern Territory. Party members were calling the decision disgraceful and disgusting, but that is what happens when you do not talk to the people when making decisions that affect their lives or without telling them. The minister, to his credit, back flipped and has restored some of the funding, but the damage has already been done. I hope that the minister now understands that Aboriginal people do not like having decisions thrust upon them.


I will now explain why the land councils are opposed to these regulations. First and foremost, they impose new requirements on the content of applications for delegation for Aboriginal corporations. The regulation seeks to impose criteria by which land councils would be required to consider delegation applications. The changes also impose a three-month time limit for land councils to consider an application for delegation on an Aboriginal corporation before it may be referred by the Aboriginal corporation to the minister for approval. If the proposed changes are not allowed, land councils will not receive adequate information so as to make an informed decision as to whether a delegation should take place. This will be subject to an unreasonable time frame for the consideration of potentially major and permanent transfer of core land council functions.


The two biggest land councils, the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council, have submitted a joint submission opposing this regulation. It is a very comprehensive submission and it supports this disallowance today. I want to read out an extract from the submission that outlines their objections. The submission says:


The regulations require a Land Council, to respond to an application for delegation of functions within 3 months, failing which the Land Council is deemed to have refused such that the Minister may force a delegation. The response time for adequate consideration of such a request must accommodate both the investigation and decision making processes of the Land Council. During the period after an application has been received the Land Council will need to:


Confirm whether the membership meets the eligibility requirements;


Consider the matters for which a delegation has been applied for, particularly with regard to the Land Council's statutory obligations;


Determine whether the corporation is soundly governed and whether it has met its statutory reporting requirements;


Assess the administrative and financial capacity of the corporation;


Undertake any consultations required;


Assess the requested resource implications;


Assess the implications for 3rd parties including the impact on 'transaction costs';


At a meeting of the Council: decide on the application;


Provide written notice to the Corporation and to the Minister.


The period of 3 months is utterly inadequate as the Land Councils decision will need to be made by the Council at one of its Full Council meetings (triannual for the CLC, and biannual for the NLC) following the completion of the above investigation and consultations. Further, the regulations fail to adequately prescribe how the proposed area in which the Aboriginal corporation wishes to exercise Land Council functions is to be described in the application. Precision is needed in this regard to provide the Land Council with an accurate basis for determining whether the corporation, membership complies with eligibility requirements, and to look at whether the area provides logical administrative boundaries for the delegated functions. Precision is also needed, because the Land Councils will need to be certain about which body, it or the delegate, may exercise functions over a given area, and third parties need certainty about who they should be dealing with.


It is plain, from experience regarding applications to create new Land Councils, that the period of 3 months to consider a delegate corporation's 28A application is manifestly insufficient.


As you can see, their objections are very comprehensive, very considered and very well founded.


The Anindilyakwa Land Council from Groote Eylandt have also written to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs opposing this regulation, and I will quickly read an extract from their letter. They say:


We have a grave fear that even the threat of an application for delegation, by maverick groups and/or 'carpetbagger' advisors purporting to act on their behalf, will lead to intra-community disputes and even possibly litigation, which the ALC, and possibly you, Minister, would have to defend at great cost to us all.


We respectfully request you give consideration to our grave concerns, to avoid these many serious unintended consequences.


There has been absolutely no consideration of their grave concerns by this minister. I am also advised that members of the Tiwi Land Council share the concerns of the other three land councils. So the land councils' opposition to this amendment from the minister is clear. Not only is the rationale behind their objections very clear, but they are also upset by the fact that they have been ignored. I also understand that the Northern Land Council have found that their dealings with the minister on this matter have been extremely unsatisfactory. That is extremely concerning, not just in relation to this issue, but in relation to the government's approach to land councils and to Aboriginal people. It gives me no pleasure that the minister and the land councils are at loggerheads because, for the good of the Northern Territory it is very important that the Commonwealth government's Minister for Indigenous Affairs has a good relationship with the land councils.


I want to quote from a speech by the now Minister for Indigenous Affairs that was given at a Northern Land Council meeting in Timber Creek in May last year when he was in opposition. He was talking about potential changes to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act and said:


I do not intend to force this on anyone. I want to support the Land Councils and I want you to be a part of it. I want Land Council's to be strong.


They are such beautiful words, but they were just words. They remind me of the late Dr Yunupingu's famous lyrics:


All those talking politicians


Words are easy, words are cheap


Much cheaper than our priceless land.


The minister concluded his speech to the Northern Land Council by saying:


Whichever way it goes my friends, whether we win the election or not, whether I become the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I will always be on your side and I will always want to work with you.


If this disallowance is supported, then the Minister for Indigenous Affairs should go back to the drawing board and begin talking to Aboriginal people, in full consultation with land councils, in an honest and open manner. He should do what he said he would do before the election.


I support the disallowance, and I call on both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Indigenous Affairs to ensure that, next time they intend to make changes that affect Aboriginal people, they do the right thing and have the decency to properly consult with them. I thank the land councils for coming here today and for the work they continue to do in protecting our land and for standing up for Aboriginal Territorians.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2014-03-19,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:16):  From the outset I indicate that the Greens will be supporting this disallowance. I have looked at this issue, and I have talked to both the government and the land councils. I, too, acknowledge the presence of representatives of land councils in the gallery tonight.


We need to look at the context of these regulations. They are coming from the amendments that were made in the Howard government era that were clearly designed, I believe, to make it easier to remove the control of lands from the land councils. I think it was part of the amendments made to facilitate that process. I would suggest that that did not achieve its aim and that is why this regulation is being brought in. I am not suggesting evil intent by the current minister, but I am concerned about the precedent that this regulation would make, because it allows a minister to have quite extraordinary control. I do not think that that is appropriate when you are talking about areas that are under the responsibility of land councils and around decisions that they, rightly, should be making.


I listened to the minister very carefully—and I thank him for taking the trouble to explain to me his reasoning for this regulation—but I think there are better ways to achieve what he is trying to achieve. If it is just about the time frame for decision making, I think there are better ways to do that. Some of the loopholes—the gaps—in this regulation are, very properly, being raised by the Central Land Council and the Northern Land Council, although I have had other people and organisations raise their concerns about this with me. Concerns have been raised that, by allowing and facilitating Aboriginal corporations to have powers delegated to them through this mechanism, it may include non-traditional owners. In fact, as I understand it, there is not a requirement that the people involved are Aboriginal. That is a concern for me.


There is concern about the viability and sustainability of the corporations involved. I do not see how a land council, in making the decision around delegation following an application, could be assured about the financial viability and sustainability of a particular corporation. As I understand it, if that corporation folded, the powers would then default to the minister. I am concerned about those particular issues which, again, undermine the decision-making responsibilities of the land council.


Concern has been expressed to me about decisions being made that should properly be made by traditional owners, which I am very concerned about. The position has been put to me that there are some decisions, which are smaller decisions, that do not need to be made by traditional owners. With all due respect, I think that is a decision that should be made by the traditional owners. The traditional owners, therefore, should be in a position to make the decision about whether they need to make that decision—if you understand where I am coming from. It is my opinion—and it is an opinion that has been made strongly to me—that it is not up to non-traditional owners to decide who should be the decision makers.


There are also concerns around the responsibilities where, once they are delegated to a corporation, the land council still has certain financial responsibilities and responsibilities, potentially, for supporting the corporation to which these responsibilities have been delegated. Again, they then have no control over the decision in the first place. It seems to me that, while we are talking about trying to improve the decision-making process and get rid of some of the complexities, it could potentially lead to further complexities in decision making and further confusion.


I do understand that the government is trying to make some of these processes easier. It has been put to me that where other entities have applied for delegation of power it has been to set up new land councils. Where an application has been made and there has been serious discussion about it, the decision has been made and agreement reached. I do not think that facilitating what ultimately is a transfer of responsibilities back to the government through the minister is appropriate. 


Let us go back to where this power originated. It originated from a Howard government agenda to get, for example, township leases in place. This was to allow outside development in townships, because the government was frustrated—other people were not necessarily frustrated—by traditional owners not allowing certain developments in their townships. This power came along, if people remember, with the whole process around income management and some other very draconian powers, including setting aside and exempting from the Racial Discrimination Act those measures at that time. When the ALP government came in, they wound back some of those draconian powers. If you remember rightly, there were no financial payments under those township lease arrangements. That has become more 'normalised' since that issue of payments was addressed. 


We need to remember where this power came from. It was about gaining control of decision making over land. I am not suggesting that Minister Scullion is trying to concentrate that power. I am saying, however, that in the future these regulations could be used to enable more concentration of ministerial control over decisions that rightly sit with the traditional owners. The Greens will not support that further concentration of power in the executive. We believe that decision making should be with the traditional owners. 


On behalf of the Greens, I very willing to say that, if there is another proposal which deals more appropriately with the time frame of decision making and with the questions and issues that have been raised by the land councils, we will be very happy to look at that alternative approach but we will not support the approach that is currently outlined in this regulation. We did raise very serious concerns when these amendments were first made, and we still hold those very serious concerns. I am not about to agree to a regulation that in fact concentrates those decision-making powers outside of the processes of land councils. Having said that, we will agree to look at an alternative approach. We are very happy to consider that, but we will not support this regulation. We will support the disallowance.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-03-19,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:26):  Can I indicate that I take a contrary position. I will not support the disallowance. I have listened very carefully to what the contributors have put in relation to this debate, and I note particularly the comments made by Senator Siewert in relation to looking at alternative approaches. I have approached this issue by looking at some of the procedural aspects of the regulations, which I thought had some merit, but I do acknowledge the contributions made by other senators. 


The Northern Territory Land Rights Act already includes specific provisions that enable an Aboriginal corporation to apply to a land council to request a delegation of some of the council's powers. What these regulations do is introduce a specific process and a time line for these applications. I have heard the criticisms about that time line, which I will address shortly. However, without these regulations, the provisions in the act cannot be practically effective, because if there is no time frame specified to deal with a request for delegation then arguably they are meaningless. 


I note that these regulations do not change the intent or application of the act. They, as I understand it from the government's point of view, improve its mechanics. If there is to be a debate about the intent of the legislation—what was passed by the Howard government—then so be it, but I am looking at the way that the mechanics of these regulations work. The regulations themselves make provisions for the type of information that corporations should provide and that land councils should consider so that due diligence takes place. The regulations also place a three-month time limit for considering applications, which I note has been heavily criticised, but, importantly, the regulations allow councils to apply for an extension on this limit. 


I think part of this debate seems to centre around whether the delegation of powers should exist in the first place. I think that, in appropriate circumstances, there ought to be a delegation. Where there is an adequate organisational capability or when there is a majority of voice in a corporation then there should be a capacity for councils to delegate. This can provide traditional owners with greater control and autonomy over their land and the ability to maximise the economic benefit from it. But this is not what this debate is about today. The provisions for delegation exist in the bill and, as such, should be operating properly. I believe these regulations achieve that aim. In the absence of these regulations, the provision is meaningless. 


I note the position of the opposition and the Greens, and I respect that, but I believe that the current situation allows applications to remain in limbo indefinitely. I do not think that is desirable. I think some would say that it is pointless and, I am sure, distressing for those members of the corporation who have made the application. When I received a briefing from the minister in relation to this just a couple of days ago he said that there was an application from the Mangarayi Aboriginal Corporation—I have probably pronounced that wrongly and I apologise—to the Northern Land Council back in 2010 that has still not been decided on. So, if no decision is made, then there are no avenues of appeal. Instead, the corporations will have to go through an expensive and lengthy legal battle to even get a decision to appeal—via, as I understand it, a lengthy and costly judicial review process—and I do not think that is desirable.


I see this as being about procedural fairness, although I support the broader issues behind it. I am encouraged by Senator Siewert's comments that the Australian Greens will look at dealing with some of the issues that have been raised by the minister, and I think that might provide a middle ground or a way forward in relation to that. But, on balance, I am not convinced to support this disallowance.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (18:30):  As other speakers have done, I would like to acknowledge my good friends in the gallery from the Northern Land Council and from the Central Land Council. But, more importantly, I would like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the Northern Territory, which is whom this debate should be about—not their representatives, not the bodies that represent them. I am here, as Senator Peris should be here, to represent the interests of my constituents. That constituency is part of the fabric of the Commonwealth government, within which the Northern Land Council is a statutory body. My responsibility as minister is to ensure that you carry out your functions in a way that is lawful and provides procedural fairness to your constituents, whether you do so or not. That is my role in this.


It was with some sadness that I heard what Senator Siewert said. I would like to be cranky with you but we have had a very long relationship. I would like to sit down and explain a number of things, Senator Siewert—a couple of things, just technical changes. This change was made in 2006. It was not associated with the income management process; it was done well before that—



Senator Siewert interjecting—




Senator SCULLION:
  Just in terms of a correction, Senator. This regulation—and I do not have time to just make up regulation, to just slip in here and throw a few regulations around—was the subject of a significant consultation process with all the land councils and with Aboriginal corporations. There were a series of consultations, and the reason those consultations were had was that there was mischief afoot. Certainly, the land councils in that consultation had indicated a whole range of things, and in response to that we made some changes. On the basis of that very clear advice, we put the regulations forward.


Now, those on the other side seem to think this is an opportunity to talk about section 28. That is actually our law. That is our law now and that is the law which the Northern Land Council, which is a servant of this, being a Commonwealth statutory authority, needs to respect. Section 28, effectively, is land rights plus. It is a law that allows people to make some significant decisions themselves on their own land. It is real land rights. That is not just a statement. I have no interest in this. None of these processes actually provide the minister with any decision-making power. It is there, as always, as a default position, but we do not get any land. I genuinely have no interest in who is speaking for whose country; that is entirely a matter for traditional owners. But there was a fair bit of mischief going on.


If I could just use a short anecdote about a friend of mine who would be well known to Maurie, perhaps not to others. There was a guy called Herman Malbunka—he has passed away, bless his soul—who was a good friend of mine. I can remember him sitting on the side of his road, and it is a road that goes past Hermannsburg over to the west. He used to think, 'People have to get jerry cans to get all the way. Wouldn't it be good if I could have a service station here?' I said, 'Why don't you get a service station, apply to the land council?' He said, 'I've been trying.' I said, 'How long have you been trying, mate?' 'Oh, I don't know, Senator; maybe for four or five years.' I said, 'Oh, okay.' He said, 'My vision is, with the least money I can get from this, I want to buy cattle, because I'm a cattleman.' He was always proud of wearing his big belt buckle, and his sons were cattlemen. He said, 'That's our future, because I want to buy cattle and put it on the rest of my land and this is how I can do it.' 


But the process of the land council—and it is no reflection, Maurie Ryan, on the Central Land Council; it happened a long time ago. It is more of a reflection on the sorts of things that Senator Peris brought up. They only meet every now and again. It is a terribly cumbersome process. Wherever I go, Senator Peris—and, after you start travelling a little bit more, you will find this—almost everyone says, 'Look, I'd really like to have a faster process or something where we can actually make a decision, where we can make a decision in our own lunchtime,' because sometimes in a business sense that is really important: 'I want to make a decision today.' 'I know—I'm sorry; you're going to have to wait a long time.' And that is in circumstances where the land council is going to cooperate.


So why do we actually need this regulation? First of all, despite what has been said about the consultation, we consulted considerably. We had the consultations start in November 2013. We introduced this last year, in December. I spoke at length to the full land council, and this is the important point—and thank you very much, Senator Peris; I omitted to find my speech and you managed to quote for me the exact part I wanted to quote, which was: 'I'm here; I'm talking about section 28.' If you had read the remainder of the speech, you would have seen that section 28 was the preference to what seemed to be the only alternative, which was an entirely new land council. I spoke to the Northern Land Council. I spoke to the entire Central Land Council. In Timber Creek—because I spoke about it twice to the Northern Land Council—there were a whole range of questions. The second time I spoke to it, which was in Darwin, to the entire Northern Land Council—the first minister to have appeared before them, I understand—there were a few questions of interest, but none of the rank and file were saying, 'This is a bad thing.' I speak to the rank and file and I have to say it is pretty interesting. Maurie Ryan has not said to me that he has spoken to the land council and, 'This is the view of the land council.' Nor have the Northern Land Council. You did not have a resolution of the meeting that I was at that said, 'Suddenly, section 28A is odious to our organisation,' and you are empowered as the executive to come down to Canberra and say so and make a submission because you would be the only ones who knew about it. Your constituency knew nothing about it and know nothing about it today.




Senator Urquhart:
  On a point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President: I ask you to bring the minister's attention to the fact that he should be addressing the chair, not the people in the gallery. I do not think that is acceptable.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Ruston
):  There is no point of order.




Senator SCULLION:
  In consultation with the land councils, one of the things we have said—I note that Senator Peris read out that bit about codification—is that we would provide, as part of this regulation, a series of things that the people making the application had to have in it. It is not difficult. It includes things such as the names of the corporation's members, evidence of the corporation, why the corporation seeks delegation, why the corporation selected part of the area of the land council, description of the consultation, the traditional owners of the land, description of the area and so on. That was exactly what the land councils wanted us to do. That was what was said at the consultations.


We all need to understand—and I am sure those in the Labor Party know exactly what is going on here—that this is a deliberate decision. The Labor Party do not like section 28A for some reason. The fact that it is a law does not seem to be of any material concern to them. They do not like it, so they are going to find a way around it. The thing is that the law is applied so traditional owners can get procedural fairness. This is about procedural fairness.


The good senator opposite indicated that the minister would of course intervene if the process took more than three months. But, as has been mentioned before, there was an application made on 4 August 2010. It is the only one. Some 1,324 days later—for those who need the translation, that is three years, seven months and 15 days—there has been no response. The other thing that is interesting about the fact that they have not responded is that the minister got a copy. The Labor minister got a copy on the same day! Where is the intervention to achieve procedural fairness for the traditional owners? Where was she? Where was Labor? Where were they when they should have been intervening on behalf of traditional owners to ensure their access to justice and their access to procedural fairness? They were nowhere.


This is not a debate, Senator Peris, about land councils. This is a debate about access to justice and procedural fairness. If you want to change the act, bring a bill into this place and do so. That is how it works. If you want to give traditional owners access to something—this was more than three years! Quite clearly there is a mischief in that. So we thought, 'Maybe we should introduce some regulations.' We went to see the land councils and they said, 'Three months is not enough.' We said, 'No worries—that is understandable.' In a normal administrative process, if after three months you needed any longer, you would have to do something. One would have thought that, in all that time, they would have acknowledged the letter—they have not. So we added a ministerial discretion for an extension if one is required, as is normal.


It is just a nonsense to say, 'Three months—that is not long enough.' Of course sometimes it is not long enough. In some cases it would be long enough. As a consequence of the consultations, we have said that, if the letter to the land council does not meet all the provisions of the act, you must refuse it. We put up a much higher bar because we listened to what the land councils had to say to us. When we consulted, it was not just the department going out with me and talking to all the land councils. There was a comprehensive official consultation process.


Two things came out of that consultation process. First of all, there needed to be some discretion in case the process took too long and, second, we needed to codify things. So here we are in the Senate having created a regulation that allows traditional owners to make the decision. In addition to consulting with the land council members, I have, for a long period of time, been talking to my real constituents—the traditional owners on the lands. They see this as a benefit. In fact I was speaking recently to Galarrwuy Yunupingu. He is not the father of land rights but he had a fair bit to do with it. He said, 'We always need to move towards people on country having more say about their country'—and that is exactly what this does. It allows them to have more say about their country. I am sorry but I do not have any letters from land councils to read out, Senator Peris, because I have been talking to your constituents rather than the land councils.


I have a letter here from the Rirratjingu Aboriginal Corporation. It says:


We are writing to you today in support of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment (Delegation) Regulation 2013 (the ""Regulation"") and our strong belief that it should not be disallowed.


…      …   …


A corporation may apply for these powers under subsection 28A(1) of the Act, but if the Regulation is not in place the Land Council is not required to respond in any set period. This means that the NLC would be able to refuse to ever make a formal decision on an application.


We have demonstrated that is the case. We have demonstrated that that is exactly what happens—and we have also already demonstrated that it was done with the full compliance of the previous minister. It is no wonder they are worried. They say: 'These are sorts of arrangements we need to move towards. We need to be able to make a decision on our own country.' How could that possibly be so repugnant, so difficult?


The letter goes on to say:


The Regulation is urgently needed to address this situation, and we fully support the Minister for Indigenous Affairs in this regard.


It continues:


The statutory authority and responsibility of the NLC is not changed by this Regulation—


and it is not—


What the Regulation does is ensure that the NLC properly exercises that statutory responsibility on behalf of the people that it is meant to represent.


I could not have said it better myself. The responsibility of the land council is not something this place should have to create a regulation to remind them of. Three years and seven months! I do not really think that is procedural fairness for Aboriginal people. The letter continues:


It is unconscionable that an Aboriginal corporation, and the Aboriginal people, which it represents, may be denied any answer to their application—


thereby denying them procedural justice in their application—


and that the land council could refuse to fulfil its statutory duties and effectively shut down an application without giving any reasons for doing so.


Well, of course, that is an outrage, and it is what has happened. It happened on Labor's watch with the full concurrence of the minister at the time, which is inexplicable. Perhaps, Senator, in response, you might want to touch on some of those matters, because I am miffed that I only recently found out that the Labor Party, the minister and the government at the time knew on the same day—three years, seven months and 15 days ago—that this application had been made. Throughout that time, people were waiting for a response. She knew they were waiting for a response, and nothing was done.


The letter continues:


You have the full support of the Rirratjingu Aboriginal Corporation to pursue the continuation of this important Regulation to make certain that Land Councils cannot simply ignore Aboriginal Corporations as representatives of their constituents, and to ensure the proper operation of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act.


It is signed by Bakamumu Marika. He is also not the father of land rights, but his father is. This is the son of Roy Marika, a wonderful man I would have learned an awful lot more from if I had not had to sit next to him in his tractor and next to the exhaust while he was providing his wisdom to me, but I can tell you that I have a pretty clear understanding of what he thought land rights were. If you go upstairs to the bark petition on your way out, guys, you might check it out, because what it says is that people on country need to make decisions for themselves. The disallowance of this motion completely prevents that.


What we have here is a situation where consultation was done to remove a mischief. The mischief was clear. It was well known by the previous government—in fact, by the previous minister—that what the land council were doing to get around the law was to deny their own constituents procedural fairness. Their own constituents—the people who elected them to the council—and, I suspect, the members of the council, but I do not think that they have been told.


The other side would have us believe that this is not important. But I cannot imagine, with respect, Senator Siewert, when it came to access to justice, access to the law and access to procedural fairness, that you would not normally be the absolute champion of that first up. I am a bit disappointed—not so much over here—Senator Peris, at your decision, uninformed as it is, to remove procedural fairness and access to the law for your own people. You might be able to somehow befriend the land councils, but I think you are going to have to answer to the traditional owners who, all over the place, are saying, 'We've got a law. Why can't I get access to the law like anyone else?'


It is interesting that if somebody writes BHP a letter, for example, they would be required to write back. It is all part of a process. They just do not write back because that is cool; that is much better—'We just won't write back. It's the Greens. Forget it.' If it does not provide procedural fairness about a response, or something like that, we would all be outraged. But what outrages me more is that somehow because it is Aboriginal traditional owners it is okay, because they do not know anything, do they! They are not smart enough, really, the poor blackfellas; they cannot make up their own mind! I have never heard anything more patronising in this place. They simply can't make their mind up! 'We know best'—Labor know best—'and we don't want them to get access to this because they are not ready for it, are they?' I have never heard anything more disgracefully patronising in my life. I can tell you: we would never be applying it to white people in this place. You would all be crying, 'Access to justice! What about the law? Procedural fairness!' Why is it any different for my countrymen? Why is it any different for the people we represent? There is no difference, is there? So they have been selected on the basis of their race.


I will not make silly allegations about that particular matter, but it disappoints me so deeply that we sit here today with a law that people can access that is legitimate, they have a legitimate access to the law, and today we are about to move in this place to deny people a legitimate lawful right that was provided them in this place by this parliament. Again, I cannot say how disappointed I am that Aboriginal people are still not going to get access to justice, they are not going to get access to procedural fairness, and I think that the only thing that you can say is that—


Debate interrupted.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2014-03-19,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (18:52):  Tonight I rise to speak on the increasingly devastating effects that ice, or crystal methamphetamine, is having on regional Australian communities. The increasing prevalence of ice has been called 'a scourge', 'devastating', 'an epidemic' and 'a drug that has been tearing apart regional communities right across our nation'. As the Minister for Indigenous Affairs leaves the chamber, I will say that, when the minister was down in Victoria travelling with me through Indigenous communities, he said that in some of his northern Indigenous communities where bread and milk cannot get in at times of flood, the ice still gets in. So it is not just regional communities in my own home state of Victoria but, indeed, those right across our nation that are feeling the scourge of crystal meth.


Ice is a pure and potent form of amphetamine, crystallised rather than in powder form, and can be snorted, swallowed, smoked or injected. It is highly addictive. There are numerous reports of young people being offered free or very cheap 'samples' of ice at parties, and then getting hooked and being turned into very loyal paying customers. We do not have comprehensive statistics about the extent of the ice problem, but a rapid increase has been widely reported in many local media outlets and in my home state the problem is now the subject of a Victorian parliamentary inquiry.


Among other symptoms, ice causes the user to experience panic attacks, anxiety and aggression. But it is when the user is 'coming down' that the worst effects become visible. As the effects of ice wear off, the user may experience depression, radical mood swings, uncontrollable violence and exhaustion. Paramedics and emergency room staff in Echuca, Shepparton, Mildura and right across Gippsland would attest to the violent and aggressive tendencies of an ice user coming down. They have witnessed ice users punching holes in the isolation rooms of emergency departments, and they have copped the abuse and aggression from these victims of ice. They are on the front line when it comes to the effects of ice in regional communities.


Families are also coming to terms with previously even-tempered and predictable teenagers—and I do use those words in the context of normal teenage behaviour—becoming unrecognisable menaces: young people who, when taking the drug, steal money from their families, often do not return home for days at a time and are aggressive and unpredictable.


I have heard firsthand from communities which are struggling to deal with this new and dangerous drug. A community forum last year in Warragul saw nearly 300 people attend. Sue Geals from Community College Gippsland noted at the time that: 'The number of people that are accessing this drug is beyond numbers that we've had in any other outbreak before; it's an epidemic.'


Ice is also having a devastating effect on Indigenous communities and other regional communities across Australia. When the parliamentary inquiry visited Mildura, it heard about a number of young Aboriginal men in the community who were believed to have committed suicide due to their debts to drugs dealers. There were also reports that young Aboriginal men were being targeted to become users and then dealers of the drug.


Unfortunately, the effects do not end there. Ice related violence and other crime is on the rise, and police are also bearing the brunt of dealing with drug-induced violence and aggravated burglaries. The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service estimates that up to 85 per cent of clients in some parts of the state were using the drug ice at the time of their offence, with the far south-west of my home state being hardest hit. Armed robberies in central Victoria's Loddon region have risen from a long-term average of about 10 per year to 40 in the past 12 months, with 30 of those suspected to be ice-related. In Ballarat there was a 73.6 per cent spike in drug crimes, with 420 offences last year. Ice is expensive in regional towns, and addicts need to finance their habit. One report said users spend about $200 a day on this habit. When the Victorian inquiry visited Shepparton in the central region of Victoria it heard from a local youth worker who said that users would do anything to pay for their addiction, with some resorting to prostitution in order to get their next hit. Last year the Shepparton News reported that the ice epidemic was costing the community about $650,000 every single month.


While we are all—parents, the community, law enforcement agencies, health services and schools—still coming to terms with how to deal with this issue, many regional communities are taking matters into their own hands and attempting to formulate a coordinated response. Last year, the Community Against Drugs organisation was formed in Echuca-Moama, led by sporting clubs and community leaders. They held forums and started a support group for family members of people who had become addicted to ice. They wanted to raise awareness of what was happening and the effects of ice on their community.


The Project Ice Mildura organisation was established by the Northern Mallee Community Partnership to combat the increase of ice in the community in the last two years. A statement on their website says:


Ice … is now the second most common illicit drug in Mildura … and is … one of the most addictive …


Project Ice Mildura holds free information sessions and provides resources and support to those affected.


In Benalla today, a community forum was held to discuss methods to combat this issue. The forum included officials from the Department of Justice; the local member for Benalla, the Nationals' Bill Sykes; the member for Murray Valley, Tim McCurdy, who is also a Nationals member of the Victorian parliament and who is also sitting on the state inquiry into drugs in regional communities and, specifically, ice; as well as police and health workers. This demonstrates my long-held belief in the resilience of regional communities, which continually rise to the challenges presented to them.


However, it is my concern, as I travel around the nation, that this is an epidemic sweeping aside everything in its path, and its victims are our young people and our future. I do believe that it is time for a national response; it is required to address this ongoing scourge affecting our young people and their health.
