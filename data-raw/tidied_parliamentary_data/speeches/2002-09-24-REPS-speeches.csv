"SPEAKER, The",N/A,2002-09-24,"—I inform the House of the death on Monday, 23 September 2002 of George Georges, a former senator. George Georges represented the state of Queensland from 1968 to 1987. As a mark of respect to the memory of George Georges I invite honourable members to rise in their places.

"Downer, Alexander, MP",LP,2002-09-24,"—by leave—In 1996, I commissioned a major independent study, which was known as the Simons review, of Australia's aid program. It is now five years since the government's response to the Simons review, which was called Better aid for a better future, marking a turning point for the aid program. In 1999, the OECD Development Assistance Committee found that Australia's development cooperation program had `gone through an impressive process of restructuring and renewal', with Australia `in the vanguard' of OECD practice. Today, I would like to table a new policy statement on the aid program, called Australian aid: investing in growth, stability and prosperity. The statement sets out a renewed policy framework for our development assistance; demonstrates how aid is reducing poverty and promoting growth, peace and stability in the region; and identifies ways in which the government will strengthen its impact.
For the first time in history, we are making unprecedented gains in reducing poverty. Over the last 40 years, average life expectancy in developing countries has increased by 20 years, adult illiteracy has been almost halved and maternal mortality has been cut in half. Most importantly, despite a rapidly growing world population, the number of people living in absolute poverty has begun to fall—a reduction of 200 million since 1980. There are some notable achievements in individual countries, including in our region. In just a few decades, countries such as Korea, Malaysia and Singapore have transformed. For example, Malaysia's poverty fell from over half the population to around seven per cent in the 1990s. More recently, Vietnam and China have made remarkable progress. In Vietnam, per capita GDP doubled in the 1990s and levels of poverty halved. In China, there has been a large reduction in the numbers of people living in poverty, from 270 million in 1978 to 200 million now. Elsewhere, Chile, Uganda, Mauritius and Botswana have performed impressively.
Other countries have not fared so well. In South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, the number of people living in poverty has grown by tens of millions. The reason why some countries succeed is clear: strong economic growth drives development and reduces poverty. East Asia, for example, has achieved average growth rates of 7.7 per cent over the last two decades, while the economies of sub-Saharan Africa have either declined or remained stagnant. Of course, the quality of economic growth is important for reducing poverty sustainably. There must be investment in human capital, particularly in education and health. And there must be an environment that encourages the private sector, generating jobs and incomes for the poor.
Outward-looking states—those countries that have taken advantage of globalisation and integrated into the world economy by liberalising trade and investment—have achieved much higher rates of growth. Developing countries embracing trade have achieved average per capita GDP growth of five per cent a year during the 1990s, compared with only two per cent for developed countries. Good governance—that is, sound policies, mature institutions and accountable systems—is also a prerequisite for sustained economic growth and reductions in poverty. Adopting these three strategies—growth, openness and good governance—helps countries attract investment, which in turn generates innovation and further economic and social development. Aid, at some $90 billion a year, constitutes only a small portion of the resources available to support development. International trade provides developing countries with export earnings of close to $3.6 trillion a year, and foreign direct investment from developed to developing countries totals almost $360 billion annually.
Nonetheless, aid can play a critical role. Aid can help policy reform and good governance. Aid can help develop the environment for private sectors to grow. Aid can support investments in health, education, agriculture and public infrastructure. Australia's aid has a clear, single focus: to advance Australia's national interest by assisting developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development. To do this, our aid concentrates on five areas: firstly, good governance, not just in central governments but in local administrations, the private sector and civil society; secondly, helping countries benefit from open and accountable trade regimes and access to new information technologies; thirdly, effective basic services, particularly in health and education; fourthly, building the capacity to prevent conflict and manage transboundary challenges; and, fifthly, sustainable resource management.
Investing in good governance—where we have doubled our budget—is now the centrepiece of Australia's aid program. Those investments have helped countries improve economic and financial management, strengthen public sector institutions, strengthen democratic systems, operate with more accountability and transparency, and entrench the rule of law. Australia's aid program is focused, not surprisingly, on the Asia-Pacific, which is where the majority of the world's poor—some 800 million people—live and yet which receives less than one-third of total global aid flows.
Under the Howard government, the proportion of our bilateral aid directed to high-priority countries in East Asia and the Pacific has increased. There is wide international recognition that we are a lead donor in the Asia-Pacific region. The priorities in our aid program mean that Australia has been able to respond to often wrenching changes in a dynamic region. Our aid has played a critical part in responding to the Asian financial crisis, to the emergency in East Timor and to conflict and instability on Bougainville, the Solomon Islands and Fiji.
Our aid has played a critical part in helping developing countries address the challenges and opportunities of globalisation and participate in the new round of global trade negotiations at the World Trade Organisation, with its explicit development agenda. Our aid has played a critical part in helping regional countries respond to a range of what these days are known as transboundary issues, such as HIV-AIDS; the illicit trade in drugs and small arms; and illegal immigration and people smuggling, which threaten regional development and also threaten regional security.
In sum, our aid program expresses Australia's strong engagement with the region and our commitment to helping the region address its considerable development challenges, especially in reducing poverty. The statement I am tabling today contains numerous examples of the impact of our aid. We have helped the government in Samoa achieve sustained economic growth of 6.5 per cent whilst reducing tariffs and taxes. We have helped strengthen prudential supervision and regulation in the Bank of Thailand, contributing to greater economic stability. We have helped the government of Vietnam disseminate a new enterprise law that, in only 18 months, has resulted in 27,000 new businesses, employing more than half a million people, being registered.
We have helped China's accession to the World Trade Organisation by training more than 1,700 officials in trade policies and practices that are expected to generate an additional one to two per cent annual GDP growth. We have helped train more than 45,000 primary and high school teachers, built or refurbished at least 1,200 schools and education centres, and helped over two million children gain an education. As a final, poignant example, we have helped deal with the scourge of landmines in Cambodia, reducing mine casualties from over 3,000 people a year to around 800.
Papua New Guinea and the countries of the South Pacific are some of Australia's most important development partners. The international community and the Australian public expect Australia to play a leadership role in assisting South Pacific countries in their development efforts. We are doing that by assisting national governance reform efforts, strengthening the rule of law, and supporting stability and national unity through the effective delivery of basic services. The government are committed to making Australia's aid even more effective. We want to make sure our aid programs mesh with the development agendas of each of our partner countries. We want to make sure that specific projects are delivered in a way that supports local systems and structures and minimises administrative burdens on those we are trying to help.
We want to focus on what we do best—with our particular bent on reducing poverty—with systems that demonstrate clearly how effective we are. We want to make more use of incentives that will support our core priorities in governance and other reform efforts by rewarding good performance. As part of our continuingreform effort, the government will strengthen its relationships with international development organisations, with the Australian non-government organisation community and with individuals and firms that deliver aid so that our assistance yields better outcomes.
There has been much discussion lately of so-called poor performing states. Some of our Pacific partners and neighbours, mostly in Melanesia, are beset by problems that will continue for the foreseeable future. For humanitarian, developmental and broader security and national interest considerations, Australia cannot simply walk away from our neighbours. To do so would allow instability to worsen, conflict to escalate and services, especially in health and education, to deteriorate. This would prove far more costly in the long term, and in the short term it would affect those most who can least bear the burden: the poor.
Today I would like to set out a strategy for our aid to reduce the impact of state failure on the poor and to encourage governments to reform. Firstly, our assistance will be based on thorough analysis of the underlying causes of state failure or conflict. Secondly, we will focus on humanitarian assistance that directly targets the poor and reduces their vulnerability, especially in delivering essential services such as health and education. Thirdly, where government systems are failing, we will look at channelling our assistance directly to community organisations, non-government organisations and other civil society groups.
Fourthly, a continued priority will be to strengthen the institutional capacity of legal and police systems, including community policing efforts to improve the safety and security of people and communities. Fifthly, we will continue to engage governments on good governance. This does not mean taking a hectoring approach or behaving like a neo-colonial power. It does mean supporting the efforts to grapple with appropriate approaches to good governance and offering incentives for those countries to do so. It is my strong belief that civil society, including the media—dare I say it—can also be a powerful advocate for accountability and reform. Australia will continue to invest aid funds in projects that support civil society.
Sixthly, we will engage with other donors to strengthen our leverage, including by adopting a leadership role in coordinating donor engagement. In circumstances where the failure of government is due to conflict, we will draw on our experience in working with the parties to resolve conflict and offer a `peace dividend' through the resumption of basic services and assisting a return to stability and prosperity.
It is important that the Australian community understands that dealing with state failure will be a difficult and long-term task. Progress may be a long time coming. We will need to match our expectations with the reality on the ground, including in our aid assistance. We will also need to accept that fully sustainable outcomes are unlikely to be achieved in poor performing environments. This is not to say that sustainable poverty reduction should not be our overarching goal; of course it should. But, in order to get to the point where this is possible, creative approaches and opting for more intermediate goals may become necessary.
In conclusion, development is a difficult, complex and long-term undertaking. Development gains can easily be eroded by conflict, economic crises or failures of governance. Australia's aid is playing an important role in supporting our partner countries' own development efforts. It is also engaged in promoting growth, peace and stability in the region and addressing issues which are directly linked to Australia's own prosperity. I am confident Australia's aid is addressing fundamental development problems, is making an impact, and is playing an important role in meeting the government's priorities in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. Australians can be proud of the contribution we are making. I present the following papers:
Australia's Development Cooperation Program—Australian aid: investing in growth, stability and prosperity—11th Statement to Parliament
Ministerial Statement—24 September 2002

That the House take note of the papers.

That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Rudd speaking for a period not exceeding 15 minutes.
Question agreed to.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Australia's Development Cooperation Program</title>,Ministerial Statements,4,1
"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2002-09-24,"—I welcome the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has sustained the practice of the last 11 years by making an annual statement to the Australian parliament on Australia's development assistance program. We on this side of the House may from time to time disagree with the content of the government's development assistance program—as indeed we disagree with today's statement as well—but we welcome the fact that the minister has sustained this practice.
Let me begin today by acknowledging what I think reflects a curious sense of humour on the part of the foreign minister, Mr Downer. On the very day we read reports that the UN office in Sydney is to be closed, Mr Downer decides the timing is right to stand up and deliver a statement on aid delivery, including our multilateral aid delivery through the United Nations. I am sure other members of the House appreciate Mr Downer's burlesque timing. The UN was established on the principles of promoting social progress and better standards of life, in larger freedom. So I do believe there is considerable irony in the foreign minister's actions today in standing in this place and delivering a speech on Australian aid delivery when his own government has done more than most of its predecessors to undermine the collective credibility of the United Nations—one of the most important mechanisms available globally and nationally for aid delivery.
The practice of the past has been this: whenever this government has seen a domestic political advantage in attacking the United Nations, it has done so with relish. This same government has not bothered to defend the UN for the good that it does this country and the world. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has never used the authority of his office to tell the Australian people how Australia benefits from the UN: the fact that East Timor would never have been possible in the absence of the UN Security Council resolution; that the demographic transition of East Timor would never have been possible in the absence UNTAET and UNAMET; that the repatriation of East Timorese refugees would have been financially impossible were it not for the resources of the UNHCR; and that the economic reconstruction of East Timor would have been an almost exclusively Australian financial burden, rather than one shared with the international community, were it not for the UN. 
The fact is that it has never been domestically politically useful for the Prime Minister to defend the UN, only to attack it. It is unlikely that the UN would close its office in Australia for budgetary reasons if this government had a different track record and if this government bothered to lodge its strenuous objections with Secretary-General Kofi Annan. If the closure of this UN office in Sydney comes about, it will be the closure of an office which has been in continuous operation since Doc Evatt was President of the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. It will represent a symbolic parting of the road between this country and the UN of which we should collectively be ashamed.
Despite periodic flourishes in rhetoric, the government has failed to demonstrate a fundamental and consistent commitment to international development through its overseas aid program. The minister's statement Australian aid: investing in growth, stability and prosperity is part of this continuum. In 2001, Australia committed itself to the UN millennium development goals: to assist developing countries to halve poverty, to reduce child mortality rates by two-thirds and to ensure that every child in developing countries has access to free and good quality education by 2015. Against these objectives, the challenges are grave. According to research from Oxfam Community Aid Abroad, child death rates are falling at half the rate needed to reach the 2015 development goals. In education, 75 million children will still remain out of school by 2015, and three-quarters of these children will be in Africa. 
If Australia is to meet its commitments under the Millennium Development Goals Agreement and play a more proactive role in creating real regional security, our aid budget needs to be more closely aligned with basic services—aimed at poverty reduction, health and nutrition—that will provide real tangible benefits for those most in need. If the government is serious about upholding the very principles it has signed on to with the millennium goals agreement then the government should be refocusing our aid program towards those areas that will make an immediate difference in the realisation of those objectives. 
Eliminating global poverty is a global project in which we should be collectively engaged and in which Australia should be leading not following, as it has done in so many other areas. But what sort of leadership have we seen from Australia on the millennium goals? At the Monterrey conference earlier this year, unfortunately the minister was unable to attend, despite the fact that prime ministers, presidents and ministers represented practically every other developed country on the planet and most other developing countries on the planet at that conference. Instead, this government was represented by a parliamentary secretary, who some it seems sought to represent as a minister. Unfortunately, there is symmetry between this and the most recently concluded Johannesburg conference on sustainable development where, while we had a minister in attendance, most governments of note were represented by their head of government.
Since this government came to office in 1996, Australia's ODA to gross national income has decreased from 0.32 per cent to 0.25 per cent. This falls far short of the internationally accepted target of 0.7 per cent of GNP. That is nearly one-third of the global target. While some five countries meet or exceed the UN target of 0.7 per cent—Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Luxembourg and the Netherlands—a further seven developed countries—Portugal, Canada, Greece, Ireland, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK—have all made clear commitments to increases, and Ireland and Portugal have promised to reach 0.7 per cent target by 2007 and 2006 respectively. Even the United States—historically sceptical of overseas development assistance—indicated at Monterrey that it will significantly increase its national effort by as much as 50 per cent.
I repeat to this House: the elimination of global poverty is an exercise in which Australia should be a leader not just a follower. For this reason, it is right in itself that this government increases its international efforts and its domestic efforts to bring about the realisation of the millennium development goals. It is the right thing to do; it is also the responsible thing to do in terms of our international standing and our own immediate national and regional interests.
As some in this place will know, I visited Islamabad and refugee camps near Peshawar in Pakistan between 10 and 15 December last year. The purpose of that visit was threefold: to investigate the quantum of the humanitarian crisis arising from the conflict in Afghanistan that rid the world of the Taliban regime, to investigate the international reconstruction program for Afghanistan for the post-conflict period and to investigate the resource capacity of UN agencies and donor countries—including Australia—to meet the immediate humanitarian needs and medium-term reconstruction requirements for Afghanistan.
I returned from that visit with a number of recommendations on how the gaps that existed might be filled. I presented these to the government through a letter to the minister. They were not unreasonable recommendations: indeed many, including those most in need, would argue that those recommendations were essential. That exercise was not about partisan politics; it was about trying to work together to ensure that Australia could do its part to avert a potential humanitarian disaster. Among the most essential recommendations I asked the government to consider were the following four.
The first recommendation was that Australia contribute an additional $US2 million to the emergency UNOCHA donor alert for the mine action program for Afghanistan. Regrettably, the government has not seen fit to increase its allocation to UNOCHA for the purposes of that program by that amount. This was not a figure which I plucked out of the air. It was based on detailed discussions with the UNOCHA coordinator on the ground in Islamabad as well as the director of the mine action program, reflecting their combined view of the immediate and most urgent requirements faced for the reconstruction task and the immediate humanitarian task in Afghanistan.
I am advised that the government in recent times has increased its allocation by $US0.75 million. I ask the government to consider once again increasing that allocation further because when it comes to the economic reconstruction of Afghanistan the clearance of mines is of first and fundamental importance. One of the great tragedies that you see in Pakistan as you travel through refugee camps, as I did, is the living legacy of tens, hundreds and thousands of persons who have had limbs blown off as a result of ordnance and landmines.
The second recommendation I put to the minister was that a further $US6.5 million be directed to the UNHCR to enable it to more effectively deal with the looming humanitarian tasks over the crucial winter period in Afghanistan. My advice is that the government did increase some funding effort to the UNHCR in that period but not of that order of magnitude. The third recommendation I made was that a further $US6.5 million be directed towards UNICEF's appeal for emergency humanitarian programs for children. The fourth recommendation was that the Australian government, together with other governments participating in the reconstruction efforts for Afghanistan, combine to establish an office of the coordinator general for the economic reconstruction of Afghanistan.
At the Tokyo conference held in February this year on the reconstruction of that country, governments around the world convened and discussed the reconstruction task. Australia did not, as I am advised, increase its allocation to Afghanistan at that time. It restated its previous aid allocation of some $40.3 million. As with most significant international ODA conferences, foreign ministers were again in attendance. My recollection is the minister did not attend. A government which for many months prior to the February conference—extending back to the height of the Tampa crisis in August-September the previous year—had articulated clearly and loudly the fundamental importance of addressing the problem of Afghan asylum seekers when faced with the challenge of dealing with the problem of Afghan asylum seekers at source and of creating material incentives for people to remain in that country or to return to it was found at the Tokyo conference to be missing in action.
We find the Howard government to be loudest on its rhetoric when it comes to the threat posed to this country by Afghan asylum seekers but when it comes to the delivery of aid dollars for the economic reconstruction of Afghanistan we find the government not the loudest but the lousiest almost of all. Since February and the Tokyo conference, we have also seen statements of concern by President Hamid Karzai of the Afghan administration about the fact that those who did commit to aid allocations in February have not yet delivered and have shown signs of weakening their commitment.
Within our own region, I will make some remarks about the Solomons. We welcome the government's stated focus on the Asia-Pacific region in the document and acknowledge that there is an international recognition that Australia is a lead donor within this region. We also note that the government has fallen tragically short in matching its action to its rhetoric. The foreign minister has spoken much about the Townsville peace agreement over recent years. As recently as 7 May this year, he spoke loudly about the achievements which have occurred as a result of the Townsville peace agreement. The Townsville peace agreement provided for an amnesty for the perpetrators of ethnic violence in the Solomons in exchange for the mandatory return within 30 days of all guns held by militia groups in the Solomons to the Solomon Islands police force. That was 18 months ago.
The Solomon Islands militia groups remain awash with guns. The Solomon Islands police force has, in most instances, refused to take action either to enforce the agreement or even to arrest perpetrators of fresh acts of ethnic violence. Under the peace agreement, the foreign minister and the government have provided $30 million in financial assistance to the Solomon Islands police force to clean up the security problems in that country. I think it is fair to conclude that, in the period since then, we have seen no substantial improvement in physical security within the Solomon Islands. It is also fair to conclude to the House that the Solomon Islands remain awash with guns and, if this problem is not arrested in the near future, we will have a significant regional crisis on our hands. I regrettably conclude to the House that the use of $30 million of Australian funds on the Solomon Islands police force has been a demonstrable failure.
When it comes to development assistance programs, no-one pretends that it is an easy debate to sustain within this country. We lack a domestic constituency for foreign aid commitments within this country, and to build such a constituency requires political leadership capable of creating one over time, not only in our own interest but in the legitimate and compassionate interest of others. No-one pretends, either, that the delivery of aid in the field is an easy matter. I have met many AusAID officers in the field, and one can only have respect for the level of professionalism they dedicate to the task at hand. I have seen their projects in Baluchistan, East Timor and elsewhere. Our challenge for the future is to lift our combined national effort to achieve the millennium development goals. (Time expired)
Debate (on motion by Mr Downer) adjourned.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Australia's Development Cooperation Program</title>,Ministerial Statements,4,1
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2002-09-24,"—I want to begin this matter of public importance debate with a direct quote:
You lose respect, you lose dignity, you're humiliated, you're in despair, you're embarrassed, you're angry, you're frustrated and finally you just don't care. You just don't care. All this stuff leads to loneliness, alienation, feeling of inadequacy. You get very suicidal. I tend to. I am very angry.
This extraordinary quote is from a job seeker. It is about the Howard government's Job Network. The inclusion of this quote by the Productivity Commission at the very beginning of its report tabled last Thursday underscores the seriousness of the situation confronting long-term unemployed Australians. It shows just how out of step this government is with ordinary Australians and reality.
The government would like us to believe that the 383,000 Australians who have been unemployed for 12 months or more are all dole bludgers, job snobs and cruisers. This government specialises in wedge politics. In the area of employment, it specialises in vilification of the victims of economic change—the long-term unemployed.
The truth is that Australians are stuck in the Job Network, a system that is not helping them to find a much needed job. Job Network is the employment program that the government established without public consultation or without a proper legislative process. The Job Network program replaced the Commonwealth Employment Service, which had existed since 1946. The government launched into the Job Network, after being in opposition for 13 years, and immediately set about shrinking the Commonwealth's responsibilities as quickly as possible, no matter what the cost. It is an ideologically driven change which has not benefited unemployed Australians and has undermined the long-term viability of the Australian economy.
The program that the government established to assist job seekers has been labelled by the Productivity Commission report as only giving the pretence of assistance. The Howard government love to boast about the Job Network, and the minister opposite speaks about how much money the government are saving. That is half the story. The government are saving money because they are spending less in assisting the unemployed, but the long-term social costs of this policy—the increased health costs, family breakdown, social dislocation and social division—all add up to a cost that Australia cannot afford.
The government's experiment with the Job Network has been a failure. The Productivity Commission report was released last Thursday and, once again, tabled after question time. You know the government are in trouble when they release a report like this on the Thursday afternoon so as to avoid ministerial accountability. When the government have something they are proud of, they come in here and make a ministerial statement—they make it on the Monday and hold a press conference. There was none of that from this minister, because he is embarrassed by the findings of this report. What did he do? He issued a press release the next day which said:
Job Network is clearly delivering results.
What an extraordinary analysis. Compare what the minister said with what the Productivity Commission said:
Job seekers are increasingly being `recycled' through Intensive Assistance. Already, around half the job seekers currently commencing in Intensive Assistance have participated in this or similar programs previously, with little sustained success.
I quote again:
Data on commencements over the year from March 2000 indicate that just under 50 per cent of commencements in Intensive Assistance were by job seekers who had commenced previously.
Another quote:
Many job seekers receive little or no assistance while in the apparently intensive phase of assistance. This is popularly called `parking' in the industry.
They actually have terms in the industry for how they are doing over the unemployed. They have a language. They also said:
Commencement fees paid to Job Network providers for signing on job seekers are still a substantial share of total income—reflecting the fact that payable outcomes are uncommon. For example, during the second contract, only 15 per cent of commencements achieved interim primary outcomes and a further eight per cent, an interim secondary outcome.
It also went on to say:
... the existing Intensive Assistance program is neither intensive nor assistance to some disadvantaged job seekers. The proposals for CA under the Active Participation Model guarantees a much higher level of interaction with job seekers ... However, there is no guarantee that individual job seekers will get access to any Job Seeker Account funds or that the three day a week requirement need amount to genuinely significant assistance. Accordingly, some job seekers with large barriers to employment may not get much direct assistance from the Job Network.
All those quotes are from the Productivity Commission. The government also likes to boast that the Job Network offers people choice and a quality assured flexible service that caters to individual needs. What did the Productivity Commission find? It found that:
Under the proposed arrangements for ESC3—
that is the next round—
there will be even less scope for choice.
So they are going backwards. The Productivity Commission has found that the current Job Network system is not working, yet the government is winding it back. The same Productivity Commission has seen the future, and the future is worse.
Remember the minister's response? He said he welcomed the report and that this showed that the Job Network system was working. It is like the CEO of Canterbury Bulldogs welcoming an inquiry into the salary cap breaches. This is a complete failure, but it is not just that. The government's own Department of Employment and Workplace Relations analysis finds it is a dud too. These are quotes from the government's own department:
... the main criticisms voiced by job seekers and providers were that less financial assistance was available for longer and more expensive training of people with more significant employment barriers.
It also said on page 7:
... the evaluation found that while job seekers can choose which provider to go to, the services offered by providers were often regarded by job seekers as similar.
So much for competition. On page 101, it says:
The financial incentives in the fee structure make it rational for providers to focus assistance on those who require only a limited level of assistance to obtain outcomes.
And most damningly, Minister, page 102 of your own department's review, snuck out last Thursday—not in the parliament; released on the Net with no big fanfare—said:
Most people leave Intensive Assistance without an income.
We are talking about the long-term unemployed leaving the system with zero outcome. We do not say it; the government's own report says it. We have two reports and these are not the only ones showing that unemployed Australians are getting a raw deal. What does the government say? The minister also says:
The report has found that Job Network's purchaser provider model with its focus on outcomes, competition and choice is a suitable policy framework for the delivery of active labour market programs.
What a joke. Here we have two reports released late on Thursday afternoon so as to avoid public scrutiny, yet the government says that it is okay. What a load of bureaucratic nonsense. It is about job seekers and taking them off welfare and giving them a hand up, not just a handout. What is even scarier about the government's response is that they think that the Productivity Commission gives them a tick to further privatise government services. The minister's release states:
The success of the Job Network could have lessons for other areas where the government purchases services. 
That is why, Minister, we raised Maximus Inc. That is why we are concerned that the largest for-profit provider of social services in the United States has entered the Australian Job Network system through the back door. These allegations against Maximus include that in 1994:
Mississippi froze a child support collection contract with Maximus when costs nearly doubled what the state had spent previously.
It concerns Connecticut, where they were concerned about child care and welfare payments. It concerns a coalition of 50 Milwaukee area church groups in 2000 calling for the termination of a $US46 million Maximus contract. These are all left-wing organisations, are they, Minister? Well, how about this one? How about the big doozey? Maybe you know well about this, given your activity in the Queensland Liberal Party, because in March 2000, a contract awarded by Mayor Giuliani's administration in New York City to Maximus raised the appearance of `corruption, favouritism and cronyism'. A New York State Supreme Court—obviously connected with the communist party of the United States, one would assume, given the minister's analysis—found `compelling evidence that the contracting process has been corrupted'. Yet you, Minister, refused to conduct an investigation into this. The signals are there that this government is about privatising and removing itself from every area of social policy.
What will Labor do? We have a four-point plan. Firstly, we will make providing assistance to the most disadvantaged commercially viable. It will be a rebalancing of risk and reward for Job Network providers who are currently providing a quality service to their clients. Secondly, we will reconfigure the incentive structure to provide early intervention. Services need to be provided earlier in the unemployment cycle before unemployment becomes entrenched. Thirdly, we will redesign the job seeker classification instrument. We need to stream job seekers into an appropriate range of services. Fourthly, we will open up access to the job matching services so that people who are part-time workers or just working on a subsistence level can actually have access to get into proper, fully paid employment.
The fact is we are providing some constructive suggestions to the Minister for Employment Services, which, given that there were two reports last week which were a damning indictment of the Job Network system that he has presided over, maybe he should listen to. Job Network III has already been condemned and the independent review by the Productivity Commission says that it will not fix the problem.
Of course, we know the minister has been busy with other things. Perhaps that is why he has not got time to fix the Job Network. He has been busy working overtime to sort out another mess—the mess that is the faction-riven Queensland branch of the Liberal Party. More precisely, he has been engaged in an all-out war with the ruling faction within the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party—the Santoro-Brandis faction.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—I would wonder what this has got to do with the MPI.
—In fact, for months now, Mr Brough has been devoting his energies to stopping Santo Santoro from coming to Canberra as John Herron's replacement in the Senate. The problem for the minister is that he cannot fix the Job Network because he does not have the time! He has been busy engaging in his own employment programs—that is, not paid employment; just visiting Liberal Party meetings in Queensland!
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My point of order goes to relevance. This is an MPI which did not manage to get a question up in question time. We are now talking about something absolutely devoid of any relevance to the Job Network.
—There is no point of order. The member for Grayndler will direct his comments to the MPI, which is very specific.
—I was concerned that there were 137 new members signed up within 15 minutes from the closing of enrolments in the Caboolture branch. What we see here is a minister who has presided over a Job Network that is not working. He has presided over the next change of contracts: letters went out on Monday offering to treat for 60 per cent of providers—40 per cent of providers, of course, will drop off the table. What we see that is consistent about this government is that it does not care about the unemployed. It is about social division, and the `axis of evil' that exists when attacking the unemployed—Brough, Abbott and `Vandalstone'—
—The member for Grayndler will refer to members by their seats.
—are only happy when they are causing carnage to the unemployed. They are only happy when they are breaching the unemployed; they are only happy when they are taking away income support from the unemployed in order to make savings, because they do not understand what it is like to be a part of social exclusion. Their whole political strategy is based upon social division. That is what their strategy is about that we see in question time every single day, and the minister needs to respond appropriately and fix the problems of Job Network.

"Brough, Mal, MP",LP,2002-09-24,"—It is extraordinary, isn't it, that here we are in this particular segment of parliamentary proceedings—a matter of public importance debate—and it is such an important issue that, with 10 questions from the opposition today, it did not actually warrant a question? There was not one question from the shadow spokesman, who could not actually find himself in the tactics committee being worthy of a question today. It indicates how bereft of ideas the opposition are. Instead of dealing with the issue of employment, the shadow spokesman started trawling through matters totally unrelated to the subject.
Before outlining some of the significant changes that the government has undertaken with the Job Network, let us just go back a little bit and have a look at why the government decided it was necessary to change from the CES—which I think the shadow spokesman has admitted came in in the 1930s or 1940s. It was a system that had been in place for more than 50 years, which was no longer serving the nation in the way it should and which this government replaced with a far more flexible, far more individualised and far more targeted system. In March 1986, when the unemployment rate stood at 8.2 per cent and the now Leader of the Opposition was the then employment minister, there were 739,800 Australians out of work.
 The shadow spokesman talks about the long-term unemployed. Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition stood here and said that he would like to correct the record—that he did a great job with the long-term unemployed. He then went on to say that the long-term unemployed stood at 197,700 at the time he left the portfolio because he went into opposition. Today, that figure is 130,000—some 60,000-odd fewer.
—I suggest that the shadow spokesman have a look at the ABS figures that were released last Thursday and avail himself of the facts. Do not just read what ACOSS puts out, because it is incorrect. The long-term unemployed—and for those that do not know, they are people who  have been unemployed for longer than 12 months—have come down by more than 60,000 since this government came to power. There have also been more than one million jobs created, almost 50 per cent of those being full-time jobs, when less than 20 per cent of the jobs created in the last six years of Labor were full-time jobs—everyone else was part time, everyone else was casual under Labor's CES and Working Nation.
The structural problems of the labour market programs of the previous Labor government have been well documented. That is why this government changed them. Three thousand million dollars was spent by the then employment minister, today the Leader of the Opposition—$3,000 million on labour market programs. According to the Productivity Commission, according to the internal studies and according to the OECD reports, that did not even manage to get the result that this government is achieving with less than half of that expenditure. To put this into context, the worst excess of Labor's labour market programs cost the taxpayer—the people sitting in the gallery today—more than $180,000 for every net job. That means for someone that was unemployed that would not have got a job under any other circumstances, this Labor Party spent $180,000-plus on getting that individual a job. I guarantee that there is not one soul up there in the gallery today—whether they be adult or child, visitor from overseas or anybody who is a constituent of any one of the members of parliament here—that could not do that themself and do it a lot better. This is the system that, in 1997, I think it was, the shadow spokesman said was far better than the Job Network that replaced it.
Working Nation and the CES were inefficient and inflexible; they were the `one size fits all' system that failed the unemployed of this country and failed the nation. The Job Network, on the other hand, has innovation. It is incentive based and it is driven by people who want to see one outcome—people getting into jobs.
These are the facts. Under the CES there were 300 sites. Job seekers had to find their way to a CES, which in many instances was quite some considerable distance. Otherwise they got no service at all. Today there are some 2,000 Job Network sites right around Australia in people's communities where they are unemployed. That is the Job Network and the government's services coming to the unemployed, not the government saying, `Here we are. You come in here. One size fits all. If we can't get you a job, bad luck.' We have backed this with world-class IT, which means that every job that the government employment services network has is available at the fingertips of every single Australian—at a library, at their home computer if they are on the Internet, or on touchscreens through kiosks for both Centrelink and Job Network members.
The results of the massive change that the government undertook in going from a CES that was 50 to 60 years old to the Job Network speak for themselves. Here are the facts. Forget the rhetoric we hear over on the other side. In the last 12 months, job matching has put 320,000 Australians into work. Indisputable fact: 320,000 jobs. There have been over 770,000 vacancies placed onto the Job Network system. When we talk to the long-term unemployed, we find that nearly 50 per cent—nearly one in two—of the long-term unemployed go into work or into some form of formal training or education as a result of the intervention of intensive assistance.
Today a lot has been made of the independent review of the Job Network by the Productivity Commission. Let me tell you what is different about this. When Simon Crean, now the Leader of the Opposition, then the minister, was responsible for spending $3,000 million per year of taxpayers' money, there was not one independent review, because he did not have the guts to have somebody out there go and do an independent review of the wasteful, exorbitant use of taxpayers' funds. Let us go to the overview of the report, under `The goal of the Job Network'. This is an independent review, not something that this government or our department says. The report says:
The Job Network policy framework is a new and evolving way of attempting to reduce unemployment—it brings flexibility, choice and competition to the provision of employment services. In the Commission's view—
the view of an independent body—
the new framework has many advantages and should be retained ...
There it is, right off the bat, No. 1.
But it is not only nationally based programs that have looked at this. What about world's best practice? The OECD has had a look at what we have done with the Job Network. Today Ireland is using our Australian innovative IT. Ireland has our kiosks and the IT backbone that supports them. The UK has gone a long way towards providing it. One of the members who sits opposite has a family member who is a very successful Job Network member and who has translated the success she has had here into winning contracts under the UK's New Deal system. This only goes to show that it is not only the Labour Party in Great Britain who support much of what we are doing in many areas—and I might add that the Beattie government is using the Australian government's Job Network—but also some of those who sit on the frontbench of the opposition. The OECD, when it had a look at our results from the Job Network—and this government is committed to results—said this:
The reaction amongst job seekers—
who are, after all, who we are here to help—
and the employer clientele to Job Network has largely been favourable ... Moreover, among job matching clients who entered paid employment, most characterised the assistance of the provider as having played an important role. Similarly, JobSearch Training clients characterised their providers as having improved their job prospects. Most employers also assess the Job Network favourably.
That is a far cry from any tick in the box that would have been given to the previous government's CES and its labour market programs.
The OECD are not the only people who have supported what we are doing here. During our public consultation phase, the Labor Party had opportunities to put forward worthwhile ideas. Once the horse had bolted, once we actually had the documents in the field for the next three years, the shadow minister trundled in here and said, `I've got some ideas.' He put up four points, two of which have already been adopted by this government, which obviously he cannot quite clearly see.
—I've only been here a month.
—The shadow minister makes the point that he has only been here a month. In the last 18 months, there have been three employment services spokesmen for the opposition—about one every six months, which is about the term we use for Work for the Dole. Maybe this is a work experience program that Simon is introducing you to, mate, so that maybe you can progress down the tracks. We'll see.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I ask that the minister address his comments through the chair.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—I would ask all members to address their comments through the chair.
—The point is well taken, Mr Deputy Speaker. I mention Senator John Cherry from the Australian Democrats. The Democrats thought it was worth while putting their thoughts on paper. They said:
Many individuals and organisations in the employment service industry are developing excellent practice and this benefits the job seekers and the sector as a whole ... We welcome the introduction of Service Guarantees—
which is part of the ESC3—
and this will go some way to addressing the issues of parking identified in the Draft Review.
We do listen and we do react. We do not stick our head in the sand as those opposite do and try to pretend that what failed the Australian public as good policy under Working Nation should be continued. 
Today, 24 September, we have ACOSS—not necessarily a friend of the government—saying that we should spend more money on Job Network. We would not expect anything else from them, but they also say in their press release:
We `welcome' the government's changes to the Job Network funding model ... the new Job Network model is better designed ... This shows the government has been listening to concerns and ideas raised by organisations such as ACOSS and the Productivity Commission.
They go on to say:
The job seeker account is a welcome move because it will encourage Job Network providers to invest in disadvantaged job seekers.
The new shadow spokesman points out that he is only new in this position—a week, a month or whatever it has been. His predecessor had this to say about the Job Network:
We acknowledge that one of the strengths of it—
the Job Network—
is its diversity in that, you know, workers can find someone that they have a better rapport with in one agency than in another.
His predecessor went on to say:
The increase in funds to those very disadvantaged job seekers with multiple barriers to employment I think it's been also something that deserves a tick for the government.
I would bet that is not something you will hear from the shadow spokesman in the short term. Have a listen to this:
Much of it—
the Job Network—
is going very, very well.
The opposition, the Democrats, ACOSS, the OECD and the Productivity Commission all say that the Job Network is far better than what it replaced and that it is performing well for the Australian public and for the unemployed but that it could be better. This government agrees with that. There seems to be one person, and one person alone, who sits over there, lonely on the end of the bench, carping, moaning, groaning and saying to himself, `I wonder if there is something else I could have a whinge about today.' The member for Werriwa knows all about that. He said that nobody will ever hear a positive comment from the shadow minister and that, if they do, he will give them a lottery ticket. I do not think we are going to get any lottery tickets; in fact, I am likely to double it if you hear anything positive from the shadow minister. 
Let us quickly go to some of the initiatives from which job seekers are going to benefit in the Employment Services Contract 3, which will commence in July next year. There will be $400 million more pumped into the Job Network which will enable contractors to assist the unemployed into work over the next three years. There will be more participation, because we know participation, or activity, equals outcomes. There will be a job seeker profile placed on the AJS so that people can daily, through SMS messages, telephone messaging or some other form of communication, be told what opportunities are available for them. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it beats the hell out of someone having to find one of the three CES offices in the locality or looking on the noticeboard at bits of cardboard—quite often out of date—that said, `Here is a job for X, Y or Z,' and then pulling it off the board and being told, `Sorry. That job was filled a month ago.' This is automation, this is the best system available in the world and it has been adopted around the world today.
We will have a job seeker guarantee, which is basically a compact between the unemployed person and the person who will work with them through their period of unemployment so that they can meld together and get a commitment from each other to assist the person into work. We will have a guarantee of assistance to eligible job seekers. There is an $800 training account for the mature aged or for any Indigenous personnel, who we know are at risk of long-term unemployment. We will be providing this assistance to them so that they can be empowered to say, `Here is money that I can spend on worthwhile accredited training so that I can make the leap from unemployment into employment.' There will be an extension of the Job Network through the job placement agencies, increasing the number of jobs available to Australia's unemployed who are welfare recipients from about 30 per cent today to over 50 per cent. 
The beauty of this is that it can be done at about a third of the cost that Labor was charging the Australian public. Let me put it quite bluntly: the taxpayers are the ones who had to foot the bill. We are getting better outcomes, we are improving the system and we are doing it with less cost.
I have here a Labor Party document from the last election, and it says, `We support Job Network.' It remains to be seen whether the shadow minister has any original ideas and whether the member for Werriwa is 100 per cent correct when he says that the member for Grayndler will never say anything positive in his life. That is the challenge. 
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Grayndler! The member should, when he is doing some research, read standing order 55.
—You should come up with something positive rather than four little insignificant points scribbled on a bit of paper, at half past four on a Tuesday afternoon. Let us see some policy that is costed. Let us see you being committed to what this government has done, and that is to provide programs for Australia's unemployed.

"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2002-09-24,"—I rise to support the matter of public importance raised by the member for Grayndler. This government has failed to run an effective employment services program and to assist Australia's unemployed to find work. In my electorate of Newcastle we are, like many others in regional Australia, very much aware of the human cost of that failure under this government's mismanagement. It is a failure that sees the unemployment rate in Newcastle stubbornly remain at over nine per cent, in spite of continuing and sustained economic growth. It is a failure that sees young Novocastrians accepting that they may have to leave their city to find work. 
The two reports released last week that appraised the Job Network system were both critical of that system, and both singled out intensive assistance as the most critical area of failure. They reported that, for the people who needed assistance most, there was very little assistance—intensive or otherwise. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations compared two groups of long-term unemployed and found that the group of people given Job Network support did only marginally better than those who looked after themselves. In fact, they had a 0.6 per cent chance of doing better if they took part in the Job Network. That means that they had almost the same chance of getting a job if they did nothing. That is appalling. 
The Productivity Commission report found that the Job Network did little to help the disadvantaged. It recommended that more be done to target this group. That does not surprise us. In April this year, the Productivity Commission held a public hearing in Newcastle and heard first-hand what it is like to be parked in intensive assistance. Those who made submissions in Newcastle told the Productivity Commission that the Job Network focused too much on the needs and sometimes even the whims of the employer and too little on the needs of the job seeker. This often meant, they said, that job seekers who were over 45 years of age just need not apply, no matter how skilled or experienced they were. As for the claim by the Minister for Employment Services of world-class IT, they talked of presenting at a Job Network agency and having one computer to share between 20 people.
There were also many complaints about individual Job Network providers and people who called for choice and flexibility. Fortunately, that is what the Productivity Commission has now recommended. People who made submissions to the commission also said that the strict guidelines of mutual obligation and compliance meant that people were inevitably, and almost unavoidably, breached. They suggested to the commission that the level of breaches was in fact a new measure of Job Network's success, rather than actually getting people into jobs. I think that the ANU's independent review of breaches and penalties in the social security system—which also slammed the breaching system—validated that point. The Productivity Commission report also suggested changes to the compliance system, and we would welcome those. 
Of course, the people of Newcastle will never forget the minister's response during question time. He spoke about dealing with a constituent who had reported to the Productivity Commission that he had applied for 175 jobs, and the minister responded that the people of Newcastle should be glad there are so many jobs to apply for. Out of touch, Minister! The minister also says that the Productivity Commission report reflects the Job Network's success in providing services, but he forgets to say that it also reflects the Job Network's failure to actually get people jobs. Minister Brough also says that the report shows great support for this purchaser-provider model. Is that the model that used taxpayers' money to buy golf buggies and DVD players for participating employers? That is how it seemed to us. 
The minister seems particularly pleased with the finding that the Job Network is delivering employment outcomes at a much lower cost than previous assistance regimes. The cost may be less to the government, but the performance is not much different to doing nothing. How cost-effective is that? No wonder the minister claims it is cost-effective, when a miserable $11 is spent per person in their first year of unemployment. That just about guarantees that they will stay unemployed.
The two reports released last week saved their most damning criticism for the intensive assistance program. And why was that? That was because six years ago we had 383,000 long-term unemployed people in this country. What do we have now? In 2002 we still have 383,000 long-term unemployed waiting for jobs, the result perhaps of the parking that the report has condemned. This so-called cost-effective program is a government program on the cheap; so cheap it represents an investment of $1 billion less than Labor spent on Working Nation. Getting people into jobs is not a cheap exercise, but the social and economic dividends of doing so are huge.
It is, though, very welcome that finally job seeker accounts, trading accounts and vouchers will now be required. That should mean that Job Network providers actually spend the taxpayers' money on job seekers—on helping individual people get jobs. What with $214 million unspent by the Job Network system in the last financial year, it is about time. The government had no idea previously of just how much taxpayers' money was spent on individual job seekers or how much profit Job Network's providers were making from the intensive assistance contracts—and yet the government claims to be a responsible economic manager. Job seeker accounts will at last see a minimum amount spent on those participating in the intensive assistance programs. That is the good news. Under the new tender, the number of disadvantaged long-term unemployed who will receive the highest level of assistance will be cut from 300,000 to 167,000, and they can only stay on that now for six months rather than 12 months.
We should be getting used to a government that gives with one hand and takes away with the other—mean and tricky, indeed. The minister claims more people are getting jobs under the Job Network than ever before, and he boasted it is costing the taxpayer less to achieve that. However, another report released this year showed that, within three months of gaining work, one in three newly employed intensive assistance clients were again out of a job. So if they only cost $5,000 each time they walk through the revolving door at Job Network, how many times did we pay $5,000? The minister's claims of success do not match reality.
The minister and his government are strong supporters of the market economy and of open competition, but in the third employment services tender released, there will not be open competition. Sixty per cent of high-performing providers will be invited to treat for what I call JN3; for the other 40 per cent of Job Network agencies, apparently it is trick and no treat. Like us, they will just have to ponder what the criteria for high-performing are. Did they fail because they spent too much on intensive assistance clients? Did they fail to get people jobs because in their region, like mine, there just are not enough jobs to go around? Did they fail to breach enough job seekers? And what will happen to the people who work for those 40 per cent of agencies? Will they be looking for work too, knowing that staffing levels will very likely be reduced? The Productivity Commission recommends free entry to the Job Network system by accredited agencies, subject to ongoing quality assurance practices—a much better approach, we think.
The member for Grayndler has raised in the House yesterday and today his concerns about Maximus Inc. entering the Job Network system for the first time. Maximus Inc. is the largest private provider of welfare services in the United States, and it has a performance record that sets alarm bells ringing. The name says it all: a giant incorporated—another US corporate giant heading perhaps for disaster. I contrast that with the Newcastle provider of welfare services, the Samaritans. The Samaritans are a highly regarded not-for-profit agency that concentrate on supporting the disadvantaged and the needy in Newcastle. In March this year, they voluntarily withdrew from the Job Network system because, they said, it was failing the long-term unemployed. They could not make it work and retain their integrity. They could no longer reconcile breaching participants on one day, under the harsh government guidelines, and then offering them welfare support the next day. They suggested that there must be a better way to help people find jobs. Obviously, they are correct; there has to be a better way.
I wonder what the Samaritans would think of the government's proposed better way that changes the Job Network code of conduct so that providers are no longer required to assist those with disabilities to find work—not much charity there, it seems. In responding to this matter the minister harked back to the past, desperately dredging up statistics he claimed showed his government's success. An effective government has no need to retreat to the past—but this government have no vision for the future and no vision for the unemployed. If they did, in Newcastle and all around Australia we would see locally based job creation programs, support by this government for regional development and infrastructure investment, and effective reform of the Job Network system. Unfortunately, the bottom line for job seekers in Australia is that the Job Network system is a program on the cheap and that this government have indeed failed to run an effective employment services program that assists Australia's unemployed to find work. Minister, it is time to stop cruising, start creating jobs and start improving the Job Network system—20,000 Novocastrians are waiting.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Employment Service Program</title>,Matters of Public Importance,5,1
"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2002-09-24,"—I can understand the opposition's inability to understand the issue of jobs, because it is like a foreign language to them. When they were in power, jobs were down. Now jobs are not down, it is very difficult for them to understand. Job Network is about getting people jobs; it is that simple. Since the establishment of the Job Network, the government has turned a bureaucratic system into a workable enterprise that is finding jobs for people. Don't let the facts get in the way of a good story! The opposition can always put up a good story—but don't let the facts get in the way.
I am standing here again this afternoon defending a network of employment opportunities in the face of another Labor member of parliament who is hoping we have forgotten the days of a slow, inefficient job-finding system called the CES. Unfortunately, we could not forget Labor's failures. Let me remind you of the bad old days of the early nineties—I am not unhappy to retreat to the past, because it shows how well we have done and how wonderful this government have been in fixing those past failures of the former Labor government.
In the early nineties, when we had the CES under the previous Labor government, one office had 3,500 job seekers registered with the same name, the same address and the same date of birth—and that is providing jobs! Another office regularly recorded 1,000 referrals to placements with the town's largest employer in order to increase its monthly performance statistics. Don't worry about actually securing employment for people; just register them. Another office created so many phoney referrals and registrations that the staffing formula indicated that they needed 35 staff to run the office, when in fact there were about four. 
In my electorate of Riverina, maximum unemployment was 13 per cent in January 1993. Currently, under this coalition government of Liberals and Nationals, unemployment in my electorate of Riverina is 5.3 per cent; I repeat: 5.3 per cent. Isn't that huge? This government has created new structures to empower community organisations, rather than fund the central bureaucracy mentality the former Labor government had. This government has turned service recipients into active citizens once again. As far as this government is concerned, what matters is getting people back into work. How Job Network members bring that about is almost entirely up to them. This government is a virtual silent partner in the Job Network, and so it should be. This is an open and transparent job network, and an open and transparent government. The Job Network is not just a better way of delivering employment services; it also ensures employment service providers actually work hard to find their clients work. If the shadow minister for employment services and training, the member for Grayndler, is serious about assisting Australia's unemployed—
—He's not serious.
—No, he cannot be serious. If he wants to assist Australia's unemployed to find work, he should be about removing unfair dismissal. That is a tax on jobs. Let us talk about employment, let us talk about the tax on jobs and let us talk about who has been successful in creating jobs.
—Job Network!
—That is exactly right, member for Cowper. This government introduced legislation to amend the impact on employment that was imposed upon us by a former Labor government with regard to unfair dismissal laws. The amendment to the unfair dismissal legislation has been the subject of an almost unprecedented degree of political obstructionism. Yet we have the shadow minister espousing the view that this government has failed. Might I add that, as the minister has said, this is the third shadow minister in two years. Does this fact not speak volumes about the capacity of the opposition to deliver effective employment options for Australia? They cannot even get their portfolio in place long term, let alone the unemployed into long-term employment.
Labor does not even acknowledge the evidence that links the impact of unfair dismissal laws and the hiring intentions of employers. Labor does not even recognise that there is a perception out there in the business community that unfair dismissal legislation impacts on the employment intentions of business. Yet Labor members want to come in here with a monotonous rhetoric—which we all get tired of listening to—about the failure of this government to provide employment assistance. I think they must have a list that they pin on the board, and then they just throw a dart into it and decide what their matter of public importance is going to be today. I seem to come up against this one every time; it is a monotonous little term for me.
This government has delivered to the Australian people sound economic management. It has delivered solid, long-term economic growth. It has delivered a low inflation and a wages growth environment. This government has been willing to take the hard decisions to reform taxation, workplace relations and employment services so that more Australians can access employment—now and into the future. In this discussion of a matter of public importance it must be recognised that this government is strong in leadership and in determination, and that this government is committed to continuous improvement in employment delivery.
—What about a million new jobs?
—That is right, member for Cowper—a million new jobs. This government accepts that there will be room for improvement in any program. Not only does it accept it; it welcomes it. For every improvement that this government makes and that is identified for this government to take forward, more people are employed and more people are put into jobs. This government sets a program, moves forward to implement it and then, if it requires improvements on the road, that is what happens: improvements on a continuous basis. It is not a matter of sitting back, letting bureaucracy run the world and not taking responsibility—as any former government needs to understand—for the devastation that their policies have inflicted upon rural and regional Australia in particular.
We talk about going backward. I am very happy to retreat to the past. This government going backward and looking over their shoulder to see where they are going would be far better than the opposition going forward and having full vision ahead. Let us go back to the past. Under Labor, from 1983 to 1996 low-paid workers had a 5.2 per cent real wage reduction. Under the coalition, from 1996 to 2002 they had a 7.5 per cent real wage increase. How about that?
—How much?
—Seven point five per cent, member for Cowper. In relation to aggregate wage growth, Labor's record from 1983 to 1996 was 0.4 per cent real growth per year. The coalition record from 1996 to 2002 was two per cent real growth per year. Let us talk about inflation and the CPI. Labor's record from 1983 to 1996 was 5.2 per cent growth per year in the CPI and in inflation. The coalition record from 1996 to 2002 was 2.3 per cent per year. Congratulations to this coalition government. Let us look at jobs growth. The Labor record from March 1990 to March 1996 was 459,000 additional jobs. That seems like a lot, but it pales into insignificance when you look at the coalition's record since March 1996: 1,045,500 additional jobs.
Employment is at a record level, and we have an MPI from the member for Grayndler suggesting that this government has no real policies in place. I think that is absolutely ridiculous. Let us compare our casual and permanent jobs growth record with Labor's record. The record for the Labor Party from 1990 to 1996 was 569,500 additional casual jobs—but there was a loss of 72,900 permanent jobs. There is no permanency with the Labor Party. The record for the coalition from 1996 to 2001 was 276,300 additional casual jobs but—wait for it—we have a positive amount of 433,700 additional permanent jobs. There is permanency in this coalition government—now and into the future. Labor's record for full-time jobs growth from March 1990 to 1996 was 56,700 additional jobs, representing only 12.4 per cent of total jobs growth. Since March 1996 the coalition's record was 453,900 full-time jobs, representing 43.4 per cent of total jobs growth. (Time expired)

"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2002-09-24,"—I moved an amendment to the Transport Safety Investigation Bill 2002 in the Main Committee earlier this week because I had received numerous submissions from people within my electorate, from the pilots of planes and, today, from the light aircraft fraternity. As opposed to the two-year imprisonment that had been suggested, my amendment says:
(1)	Insert after section 26(2)(a) `make a copy of the whole or any part of the report;'
Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units.
As I said at the time, it is a very minimal amendment that pertains to the penalty accruing for the copying of various documents. I said that imprisoning a person who copies what is basically a draft of a report was a draconian and outrageous measure.
Section 26(2) of the bill states that a person must not make a copy of the whole or part of the report or disclose any of the contents of the report to any other person or to a court. The penalty for that was two years. The amendment simply seeks to reduce that penalty from two years to 20 penalty units. I will not say any more at this stage other than to commend the amendment to the House.",REPS,<title>TRANSPORT SAFETY INVESTIGATION BILL 2002</title>,<title>Report from Main Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2002-09-24,"—As the House appreciates, the Transport Safety Investigation Bill 2002 clearly has a major focus on transport safety. In the light of discussions and having heard the comments by the member for Calare, I am pleased to indicate that Labor support the amendment moved by the member for Calare. While our support for this amendment could not be described as reluctant, it is the opposition's view that the amendment avoids the potential for an extreme penalty on a person copying a draft investigation report. In the mind of the opposition, that would be a very extreme case. In all honesty, the opposition doubt that the two-year penalty for copying would ever be used, but we have been persuaded to remove that potential.
The opposition considered the issue in the context of the tragic Whyalla accident. As I think we all appreciate, the families and interested parties received a copy of the draft report on the Whyalla accident, and I firmly believe that it was absolutely correct that they did so—it confirmed facts for the families, and I think it is exceptionally important that they knew the latest information. I would like to bring to the attention of the House the fact that, at that time, copies of that report unfortunately went beyond those to whom it was given.",REPS,<title>TRANSPORT SAFETY INVESTIGATION BILL 2002</title>,<title>Report from Main Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2002-09-24,"—On indulgence, I do not know whether the member for Batman is aware of the fact that I have had negotiations with the government around my amendment. There seems to be some insistence from the minister's office that paragraphs (a) and (b) be included in a revised amendment. I was advised to move my initial amendment. I intend to move a revised amendment. Assuming that that original one may be voted down, I will then move a revised amendment.
 (Mr Jenkins)—I thank the honourable member for Calare for that clarification. At the moment, the question before the chair is the unresolved question that the amendment be agreed to, which was the amendment that was originally moved in the Main Committee. We just felt a requirement to clarify that.",REPS,<title>TRANSPORT SAFETY INVESTIGATION BILL 2002</title>,<title>Report from Main Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2002-09-24,"—I appreciate that but I thought that, despite the knowledge of the issue just shared by the member for Calare, it was better to make the comments and deal with it all in terms of the issue currently before the chair. Unfortunately, with respect to the Whyalla accident, the report went beyond those to whom it was originally agreed should have access to the report. Unfortunately, at that time I was personally lobbied by a key aviation identity who had an axe to grind and wanted the opposition to make a public comment on the draft report, to try to access copies of the draft report and to distribute that draft report to the media. The opposition and my office correctly resisted that representation because, as far as we were concerned, it would have been the wrong way to handle these very sensitive issues. If anything, that case reaffirmed to me the importance of strong penalties in relation to the disclosure of draft reports. Those tough penalties are not impacted upon by the amendment that has been agreed to by the government, which is not only as a result of negotiations between the member for Calare and the government but also, importantly, as a result of representations made by my own office following the debate in the Main Committee last week.
In considering this case, I did not think it as severe a misdemeanour to copy a report. I appreciate that, in the minds of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the two go together to widen the net to stop leaks. In reviewing the Whyalla situation, I could contemplate that the circumstance of copying the report was less severe than disclosing it. On balance, the opposition was therefore persuaded to support the amendment that has been agreed as a result of negotiation between all in the House, thereby creating a distinction between copying and disclosing. I am satisfied that, although this amendment was not imperative, it does not fundamentally undermine the strong suite of measures to deter leaking of draft reports. (Extension of time granted)
As I was indicating, the suggested amendment does not undermine the original intent of trying to create proper deterrences to leaking draft reports. In our view, the leaking of draft reports into investigations is dangerous. There is a clear role for and high level responsibility on the ATSB to check the accuracy and technical veracity of reports before they are released for public discussion and consumption. A draft report reaches the public domain with inaccuracies, and because of the sensitivity of the reports, characters and reputations can be damaged. Similarly, the public may be alarmed unduly if an uncorrected error relates to a technical issue.
The opposition, as I have indicated, were persuaded to support this amendment by Mr Boyd Munro following discussions in my office late last Thursday. We then made a decision to encourage the government to come on board as we believe that there were other ways Labor could have handled this amendment. If anything, we had those discussions to avoid politicising the matter. Therefore, we decided it was in the best interests of the passage of this important bill to organise consensus, and that is reflected in a further amendment to be moved as a result of this debate.
When I spoke on this bill in the Main Committee, I also urged the minister to front up to the House and give some information relating to outstanding questions on the operation of the ATSB. I hope that will correctly be done this afternoon. The Transport Safety Investigation Bill 2002 is exceptionally important. The amendment we are talking about goes to the proper operation of the act in terms of the investigation of sensitive transport issues. For that reason, I also want to pinpoint another potential problem this afternoon which goes to the issue of fuel and the ethanol matter across the Treasury, transport, environment and consumer affairs portfolios. I believe this has been nothing short of a disgrace and will contribute, if we are not careful, to safety issues.
The government knows that the ethanol content in fuel is out of control and causing damage to cars, farm engines and outboard motors. The impact on outboard motors is important to raise because it goes to transport safety. I have a letter from the Australian Marine Industries Federation Ltd, which represents recreational boating enthusiasts— people who are vitally concerned about transport safety. This organisation has written to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Dr Kemp, stating its concerns about the impact of ethanol on outboard motors. This is a very important maritime safety issue as thousands of Australians every weekend fill their fuel tanks at the local service station, get in their boat and head off to sea fishing. The AMIF is concerned that more than 10 per cent ethanol may cause engine problems, including vapour lock or fuel starvation and starting and operating difficulties.
As I speak, the government is refusing to take any action to put a limit on ethanol content in fuel thereby leaving consumers exposed and raising potentially very serious transport safety issues. I would have thought this a no-brainer, that I would not have to spell out the potential risk to life at sea in this situation. But the Minister for Transport and Regional Services stays mum and sits on his hands. I again call on the minister this evening—while he is Acting Prime Minister—in the interests of consumers and transport safety to put a cap on ethanol in fuel.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. A discussion on the merits of ethanol is beyond the remit of the bill, particularly as we are now considering the amendment to the bill which relates to the penalties.
 (Ms Corcoran)—The member for Batman will come back to the question.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, as you would appreciate, this is a major transport safety bill. In conclusion, with respect to the very serious safety issues I was just raising concerning ethanol and outboard motors, instead of focusing on the elite producers of ethanol in Australia, the government should use its powers and commonsense to look after consumers, motorists and recreational boat users and therefore focus on what this bill is about. Transport safety is a very serious issue. For that reason, I seek leave to table correspondence from the Australian Marine Industries Federation Ltd of 20 August 2002 to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage concerning the issue of ethanol content in fuel.

Leave granted.",REPS,<title>TRANSPORT SAFETY INVESTIGATION BILL 2002</title>,<title>Report from Main Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2002-09-24,"—In backing up my colleague the member for Calare who moved this amendment, I want to praise Mr Boyd Munro and his organisation for bringing this fact to our attention. It is easy for people to skip over a two-year penalty and say, `That would never happen.' I always like to remind people that I was in a government where four people went to jail because they used their government cars for private purposes. Twenty-five per cent of the cars in Australia are on a government contract and today every single one of those will be used for private purposes and for taking out people on their plastic magic—something which every single minister will do this week in Australia and should do. They do not want to waste meeting time. When people say, `Oh, no-one would ever be put in jail for two years for this,' don't you believe it. I have seen people go to jail for nothing.
The safety Nazis keep coming at us and asking us questions. There is no-one in this place who is more at risk than I am. I have arguably the highest charter allowance in Australia of any member of parliament and I use every single cent of it. I also use it for commuting from the airport. In a three-year period, of the six light aircraft that I used, four crashed killing everyone on board. If there is anyone at risk and on the line with a relaxing of standards, it would be me. I can tell you, this proposition that a person would be put in jail for two years is outrageous.
I understand the sentiments of the opposition spokesman in referring to ethanol. It was with very deep regret that 40,000 people whose jobs rely upon the sugar industry were absolutely ignored—and I hope the opposition takes note of this—when they asked for the excise tax to go on and an environmental rebate to be granted. When one rich person in Australia was disaffected and hurt by the action, there was immediate action by the government.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In the interests of equity and fairness, I feel I should also ask the member to return to the substance of the amendment which relates to the penalty provisions in the bill.
—I remind the member that the question is in fact penalty divisions and air transport safety.
—The last speaker had some six minutes on the issue of ethanol; I have had about half a minute. If there is equity and fairness here, I think it should be between the opposition and me as well as between the government and me.
On the issue of safety, a 10 per cent ethanol blend has been used in Brisbane and a number of people have come forward and said that their car runs an awful lot better—it has a much greater power level; it lifts the octane rating by about three points. We take cognisance of the points raised, quite rightly, by the opposition spokesman in this area, but we would hope, for the benefit of this nation as a whole, that every single person in this place will be pushing the government as hard as they possibly can to a 10 per cent ethanol blend. I will go along with the opposition spokesman: I am quite happy to go to 10 per cent, but remember that 23 per cent is the level in Brazil—and in most cases what you put in your motor car in Brazil is 100 per cent. I am sure that there are similar applications in the boating industry as well. Also, there are additives that can be made to a petrol or a petrol-ethanol blend that will overcome the problems that have been outlined by the opposition spokesman.
I am very pleased that the government has accepted the proposal put forward by the honourable member and my Independent colleague. We are pleased that it has been accepted, and it is very important that this sort of ridiculous, outrageous rubbish is taken out of bills. The public servants have a hide coming in here proposing this sort of rubbish.",REPS,<title>TRANSPORT SAFETY INVESTIGATION BILL 2002</title>,<title>Report from Main Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Windsor, Antony, MP",IND,2002-09-24,"—I would like to speak briefly to the amendment moved by the member for Calare to the Transport Safety Investigation Bill 2002. I had the pleasure of supporting this amendment in the Main Committee by the member for Calare. I made the comment in the Main Committee that this amendment should have been unnecessary. I think it indicates that there has been a lack of consultation through the process, particularly with Air Safety Australia but with other pilot organisations, that the penalties in particular would impact upon. Having said that, I am pleased to see that the minister has accepted the spirit of this amendment and, even though there is going to be some procedural work done here in a moment to re-instigate the amendment in a slightly different form, the spirit of the amendment as moved by the member for Calare will be incorporated in the legislation.
I would like to place on record the concerns that are still out there, particularly with Air Safety Australia and other aircraft organisations, as to some of the other aspects of the bill. Rather than dig up an old trench again, I think it should be on record that there are concerns out there and perhaps those concerns will be raised in the Senate. Perhaps the minister and the department could look closely at those concerns and make further adjustments, if they deem it appropriate, when the Senate considers the bill as a whole.
The shadow minister for transport made a very important comment in relation to transport safety involving the use of ethanol. I would like to comment on this briefly, given that the average time that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Family and Community Services will allow before taking a point of order is about one minute 15 seconds. 
I have some differences from time to time with the Deputy Prime Minister on a number of issues, but I happen to agree with him on this particular issue in the comments that he made today in the parliament at question time. I would suggest to the shadow minister that, rather than take a negative approach to this particular safety issue in the use of ethanol in engines, perhaps he take a more positive approach. I think we should be looking at somewhere between five and 10 per cent almost immediately. If there is research to be done—and that research has already been done in the United States—I would encourage the government and the Deputy Prime Minister to get on with it rather than using delaying tactics and listening too much to what the opposition is saying about this issue. 
The safety aspects have been well and truly covered in the research in other parts of the world, and a mandatory level of five per cent introduced now can be well covered within any safety regime or scientific work that has been done anywhere in the world. So, with due regard to the shadow minister, I would advise him to do a bit more homework on that particular issue. However, I am very pleased that he is supportive of the member for Calare's amendment to this piece of legislation.",REPS,<title>TRANSPORT SAFETY INVESTIGATION BILL 2002</title>,<title>Report from Main Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Katter, Bob, MP",IND,2002-09-24,"—I want to again thank Boyd Munro and his group for bringing a number of these things to our attention. One of the other things that is very contentious—which I personally will be referring to and I am sure my Independent colleagues will be referring to in the Senate—is the right to search without a search warrant. All right, this is very serious stuff with respect to aeroplane accidents, but the safety Nazis do this all the time: they will intimidate legislators and say, `Oh, you'll need this. If you don't do this, this plane's gonna crash,' and they give themselves the most outrageous powers. A right to search without a search warrant! The common law gives you that right if it is thought that someone could be killed as a result of you not searching. The common law is already delivering these rights, and I think that the common law situation is superior to the situation that has been put forward here today.
Again, on the ethanol question, it is important to add to what my colleague from New England said. A 10 per cent ethanol blend will make for a much safer environment in Australia, both to humans and to the general environment. That is why the United States has moved on this. We still have benzene and aromatics as octane enhancers to replace lead; the United States banned them long ago. We hope that the opposition spokesman is taking note of what is being said, because it is very important for him to understand this. The United States banned benzene and aromatics and replaced them with MTBE. Now the United States has decided that even MTBE is too dangerous and has banned MTBE, which is to be completely phased out in four years time. We hope that everyone in this House becomes very positive towards the ethanol alternative.
 (Ms Corcoran)—The unresolved question is that the amendment be agreed to. 
Question negatived. ",REPS,<title>TRANSPORT SAFETY INVESTIGATION BILL 2002</title>,<title>Report from Main Committee</title>,Bills,11,1
"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2002-09-24,"—Given that result, I move:
(1)	Clause 26, page 25 (line 6), omit the penalty, substitute:
(2)	Maximum penalty:
in the case of a contravention of paragraph (a) - 20 penalty units; or
in the case of a contravention of paragraph (b) - imprisonment for 2 years.
This new and improved amendment to the Transport Safety Investigation Bill 2002 allays just one of the many fears about this bill held by the pilots and owners of small aircraft, and changes the maximum penalty for copying a draft report from two years imprisonment to those 20 penalty points as I outlined earlier. I do not want to take up the time of the House except to say that I am unable to see what harm might result from copying such a report without disclosing it, and I really do not know why it should be a criminal offence at all. 
I have received indications that this amendment will be supported by both the government and the opposition. I would like to thank the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the opposition for listening to those affected by this bill. But I should point out that there are many more concerns amongst those people in the aircraft fraternity. It appears that the consultation process in relation to the bill has completely failed in that there are several thousand people who have interests in it who, as far as I can see, have not been consulted. The consultation process was delegated to the ATSB, which is surprising given that it is the major beneficiary of the bill: the bill gives it extensive new powers and extends the scope of its operations to include rail transport for the first time. Once the ATSB had the running of the consultation process, it decided with whom it should consult and it decided to exclude Air Safety Australia on the grounds that it was not a major aviation organisation. 
Air Safety Australia represents 1,400 pilots who have appointed it as their sole political representative on aviation matters. I note that two government speakers on this bill, the member for Flinders and the member for Barker, spent more than half their time talking about Air Safety Australia in their contribution to the debate. ATSB's arbitrary decision to exclude Air Safety Australia meant that that organisation did not know what the bill contained and that the ATSB itself did not know the views of those 1,400 pilots.
Air Safety Australia was not the only important aviation organisation that was excluded. I received a call just last night from Paul Middleton, the Executive Director of the Australian Ultralight Federation. He said that he had known nothing about the bill until a few moments before he called me. 
It is not clear to me why the ATSB should bother investigating incidents—as opposed to accidents—involving private aircraft and ultralight aircraft. These are events that are much more akin to road traffic accidents than airliner accidents. Remember that an incident is something that might have been an accident but did not result in one. It is obvious why an accident involving an airliner should be investigated, but it is not obvious why an incident involving only a private aircraft or ultralight should be investigated in the same way. Accidents, especially fatal ones, are a different matter. I note that neither the explanatory memorandum nor the second reading speech offers any explanation. 
Because these two clauses have been brought together, on the advice of the government, I am happy, on the advice I have got, to include them as the recommended amendment. But I am not that sure about a two-year jail penalty for disclosure. I put that on the record, but I do accept the advice about the seriousness of this offence and the arguments about the appropriateness of the penalty. However, I do refer to the comments made by the member for New England and hope that the government is of a mind to enable a brief Senate inquiry to allow some of the people who have been excluded from the process to make their point before this bill proceeds any further.

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2002-09-24,"—We are continuing the debate in the consideration in detail stage on the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002. When the House last dealt with this issue, I had moved amendments to clause 25, page 9. My amendments seek to ensure that only research relating to stem cells should be carried out on embryos, because the legislation deals with that particular issue. Clause 25 currently reads `the use by the person is authorised by a licence'. To those words I am seeking to add the words `the use is for the extraction of embryonic stem cells and is authorised by a licence', so that it is very clear what the bill seeks to do in this critical part. 
I want to focus on research on stem cells because that is contained in the title of the bill and it is supposed to be about research on stem cells. The embryonic stem cell was the subject of the COAG agreement between the premiers and the Prime Minister. Research on stem cells was the matter which was excluded from the previous vote that the House took. The House was considering a large bill which dealt with both research and cloning, and it was the decision of the House to split that legislation into two parts, with one part dealing with cloning and the other part dealing with research. We are now looking at the research part, which relates to research on embryos, and the purpose of this legislation is to detail the way in which research may take place on embryos and the extraction of stem cells.
Amendment (1) is to make sure that the embryos are used only for the extraction of embryonic stem cells. Amendment (2) is to ensure that the embryos are not damaged or destroyed. We are talking about excess embryos; and I do not know how you could call human fertilised eggs—which have all the potential of life and the ingredients of full human beings—`excess' but that is the term in the legislation. Excess embryos which were created before 5 April this year can be used for research, provided certain conditions are met. The purpose of these amendments is to specify the use of excess artificially created embryos and to ensure that they are not used, by licensed persons, for anything other than the extraction of stem cells. The amendments are narrow and they are meant to be. They deal with only a small part of the legislation. They do not seek to interfere with the process of the IVF use of embryos at all; they relate purely to the use of excess embryos.
In moving these amendments I was encouraged by my experience as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. We took evidence from a wide range of people, including people who have been beneficiaries of a large Commonwealth government grant of $46 million, which will allow them to continue in research. I will bring to the House's attention statements made before that committee and statements made since which lead me to express a great deal of concern about research on embryos unless this House confines the research specifically to the factors that are proposed in the legislation.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2002-09-24,"—I rise this evening to support the amendments moved by the member for Mitchell to the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002. From the member for Mitchell's amendments, I can see that there is a real possibility that this bill may be passed in the House of Representatives and perhaps even in the Senate, with the tragic consequences which I spoke about at length in the House on 22 August and again last Monday. That being said, the debate becomes one of damage control; that is, how to minimise the most harmful foreseeable effects of this bill.
The debate has led this House and the parliament to a number of necessary conclusions in light of all the evidence before us. I would like to summarise the propositions that have been well argued in this debate and which are, in my view, incontrovertible. One, it is now well established that the real agenda of those scientists advocating support for this bill is that if this bill becomes law it will permit experimentation on human embryos for the benefit of, for example, the pharmaceutical industry for toxicity testing associated with drugs and other products such as cosmetics. 
Two, it is established as scientific fact that there have been no accredited scientific papers demonstrating real scientific gains from experimentation with embryonic stem cells derived from human embryos. Three, it is equally established that the real gains from stem cell research have been the result of research on adult stem cells.
Four, it is now demonstrated that this parliament has been lied to, deceived and misled on a raft of what are now demonstrably false claims about the purported benefits of stem cell research involving human embryos, making totally unsubstantiated claims of miracle cures for everything from Parkinson's disease to Alzheimer's disease, even though it has been equally demonstrated that human embryonic stem cell research will never be able to address some or all of these wild and fantastic claims by certain scientists with an obvious vested interest. So why aren't the scientists honest with us? Why don't they say that it is speculative, which is the correct word?
Five, members of this House and the Senate have been bombarded by emotional appeals from thoroughly misled members of society who have been deceived and lied to about the purported benefits of promised miracle cures from human embryonic stem cell research. In my view, this has been a most deceptive and cruel campaign, as I have said previously, of lies perpetrated to offer hope not only to those who suffer from many severe disabilities, diseases or ailments but also to their families. However, the gains they have been promised simply will not come from human embryonic stem cell research.
Six, we were lied to about so-called cures in rats—cures falsely asserted about the use of human embryonic stem cell research—and how this was only a stone's throw away from similar cures in human beings.
In light of all this deception, cynicism and lies, the truth has been masked; it has been covered up, hidden and in fact buried. It is very disheartening to see the number of members in this House who would still, in all honesty, continue to believe in what I believe is the false and misleading propaganda that has been put before us to support this bill becoming law. Be that as it may, the member for Mitchell's amendments offer hope in maintaining at least the `de minimus' ethical and legally responsible decision this House and this parliament may take. 
To members of this House who fail to be convinced of anything other than the purported benefits of embryonic stem cell research, the member for Mitchell's amendments are thoroughly consistent with your position, in that embryonic stem cell research would be permitted if solely for the purpose of extracting embryonic stem cells. No member of this House would agree that the sole reason for supporting the original bill was the use of human embryos for toxicity or other pharmaceutical testing. No, the reason why the apparent majority of members of the House want to vote yes to this legislation is that they accept the speculation by certain scientists that bedfast people might walk again, that miracle cures might be found and that it is only through experimentation using embryonic stem cell research that such miracle cures—for a whole raft of diseases—might be reached. That being said, the member for Mitchell's amendments give hope to severely disabled people and ensure that this is the sole purpose test for the bill.

"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,2002-09-24,"—I rise to respond to some of the arguments that have been put forward by some of those who support the amendments to the Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002. In doing so, I propose to do what I would urge all members in this debate to do, and that is to address the amendments and not reopen or repeat the second reading debate. If we were to do that, we could be here for a very long time, and I am not sure the House as a whole would accept that.
The member for Mitchell has argued, both last week and today, that the purpose of the bill is to deal with embryonic stem cell research only, and therefore research on embryos should be limited to the derivation of embryonic stem cell lines. Much of the debate has focused on the benefits of embryonic stem cell research versus adult stem cell research. The Council of Australian Governments agreed to a nationally consistent approach for the use of excess ART embryos. The derivation of embryonic stem cell lines is only one of a number of outcomes using excess ART embryos. The bill provides a strong national framework to regulate the use of all excess ART embryos.
The members for Lowe, Mitchell and Sturt and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations have suggested that the legislation will allow scientists to use embryos for their own commercial benefit. The bill puts in place a scheme that allows research involving excess ART embryos to proceed subject to strict regulatory oversight. It is true that at some point in the future the results of some of this research might ultimately generate valuable intellectual property rights for scientists and medical researchers. This fact also applies to research into adult stem cells using freely donated human tissue. Financial benefits will only accrue if research results in discoveries with potential as therapies or cures for disease, the same as with any other medical research. The proposed amendment by the member for Mitchell to limit use that damages or destroys an embryo to extraction of embryonic stem cells will not change this situation.
It has been argued by the Deputy Prime Minister and the members for Mitchell and Sturt that the bill opens the door for scientists to do what they like with embryos—the member for Lowe probably made the same argument a few minutes ago. In fact, the situation is quite the opposite. The bill provides, for the first time in Australia, a strong national framework to regulate the uses of excess ART embryos. The derivation of embryonic stem cell lines is only one of a number of outcomes using excess ART embryos. Rather than being in the hands of scientists, decisions regarding the use of excess ART embryos will be made by an independent licensing committee with broad membership. The decisions of this committee will be publicly available. In deciding whether to issue a licence, the bill requires the committee to take into account a number of factors, including the number of embryos required, whether the proposed use will lead to a significant advance in knowledge or improvement in technology and whether the work could not reasonably be achieved by other means.
The member for Mitchell argued that subclause (2) of clause 25 already exempts current ART practices and that, therefore, this amendment will have no effect on ART practice. That is not the case. The proposed amendment will have an impact on current ART practices. What I said last week seems to have been misunderstood by the member for Mitchell. I was not saying that it would put a stop to ART or IVF programs; I was saying that it will put a stop to a number of practices associated with IVF programs. The proposed amendment would not prevent a woman from receiving ART treatment in Australia; it would prevent practices which are important to maintaining the high quality of care and improving the effectiveness of ART treatments.
Unamended, the bill allows continuation of these important practices, such as training of ART clinicians and quality assurance testing to ensure that culture and pre-implantation testing is optimal. That a licence will be required for these practices recognises that the bill takes a consistent approach to the treatment of an embryo that is damaged or destroyed, whether it be for deriving a stem cell or training an ART clinician.",REPS,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,13,1
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2002-09-24,"—In response to the Attorney-General's comments in relation to the amendments, I have to say again that the amendments proposed by the member for Mitchell totally paralyse the prospect of commercial reward being secured by the scientists—and the big businesses promoting the scientists—in terms of embryonic stem cell research. I am very grateful to Mr David Brice from the Physical Disability Council of New South Wales, who has provided me with a partial copy of a transcript from Sandy McCutcheon's Perspectiveprogram of 5 September, for which Mr Erik Leipoldt prepared a piece. Erik Leipoldt is a PhD student in Human Services at Edith Cowan University, Perth. He is also former Executive Officer of People With Disabilities in Western Australia and former Chair of the Disability Services Advisory Committee in Western Australia. He has been a quadriplegic for almost 25 years. What he has to say is very powerful. It reads, inter alia:
Good evening. 
In recent weeks, the corridors and offices of the Federal Parliament have been the site of some emotion-charged speeches about the potential benefits of embryonic stem cell research on eradicating various forms of disability and disease.
	...	...	...
At the highest political level and in senior scientific circles, we have been told first hand stories of the tragic situation faced by people with disabilities.
Leading politicians blinked away tears in Parliament.
We've seen TV images of other politicians visiting people with spinal cord injuries.
And there were scientists making amazing, enticing promises for cure just so long as we could legalise embryonic stem cell research to help these unfortunates.
But, in all my years of involvement in advocacy, in disability services and on government disability advisory groups I have never encountered this emotional concern on the part of most of these people about the day-to-day needs of those of us with disabilities.
At times, I must say, quite the contrary. Meanwhile, many disability problems remain unresolved. 
Even in our wealthy society, disability advocacy is still extremely necessary.
People with disabilities still face isolation from mainstream education, employment and community life.
But I found it offensive to see disability being used as a lobbying tool for the biotech industry.
What's going on with all the tears and pleading?
Clearly, politicians are not intending to suddenly make a big effort on outstanding issues facing people living with disabilities now.
No, some ride the public fear of human fragility and disability as a means to their far more lowly profiled agenda—that of potential profits. Profits from the ethically controversial and potential $70 Billion embryonic stem cell research industry. After all, the public is less likely to merely support private profits. But it will support a cure for the secret horror of their dreams: disability and mental and physical decline.
...	...	...
The amount of public money being poured into some of this research is huge.
When we now weigh the scales with these vast financial interests on one side and the real interests of Australians with disability on the other we hear a heavy thump. This is not the sound of altruism.
And it is costing people with disabilities.
We had arrived, I thought, at some understanding that disability is not just created through impairment. Our collective social values and attitudes create much of the disability experience. And changing them does not involve ethically contentious action.
Now, the embryonic stem cell lobby is shamelessly sacrificing these hard-won gains for profit, reminiscent of tear-jerk fundraising by charities of old. We're back to `disability as tragedy', a condition to be pitied and cured. [This attitude stymies the acceptance of people with disability as valued community members and hinders a healthier accommodation of disability in our own minds.]
As a person who has lived with quadriplegia for almost 25 years, I have a mandate to protest.
In this debate, the public, people with disabilities included of course, should beware of politicians and scientists bearing gifts.
The embryonic stem cell lobby's ethically questionable treatment of this debate alone puts its ends in a dubious light. It makes for a shaky platform for the respectful treatment of either embryos or people with disabilities. [Disability being part of the human condition, all of us should be concerned about that.]
This is a cry from the heart from Mr Leipoldt, who is severely disabled himself. I am very happy to voice his concerns in this House. Truthfully, he understands that this research is purely speculative and is being driven by the commercial and economic agenda of the scientists and those backing them, in the name of making a lot of money. Quite candidly, Mr Leipoldt has no confidence in this bill. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,13,1
"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,2002-09-24,"—I want to respond to an assertion made by the member for Sturt last week. It follows on from one made by the member for Mitchell. The member for Sturt asserted that the procedures that IVF practitioners apply to embryos for training and for re-implanting in women for the purposes of birth do not destroy the ART embryo. I am advised that that is not the case. Training technicians in some of the techniques involved in ART treatment may result in damage to or destruction of the embryo, since many techniques considered to be safe in experienced hands may be less so in the hands of trainees.
ART clinics carry out a range of activities that require the use of excess ART embryos, including training technicians, quality assurance and research. While the excess ART embryos will be left to die following these activities, some activities may directly involve the destruction of an embryo. All such activities will require a licence under this bill. An example of training that may damage or destroy the embryo is pre-implant-ation genetic diagnosis, or PGD. PGD requires microsurgery on an embryo to remove a single cell, which is used to test whether the embryo is carrying a severe genetic disease. While PGD itself does not harm the embryo, it requires considerable skill and training in using excess embryos that would otherwise be destroyed and it may damage or destroy the embryo.

"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2002-09-24,"—When these amendments were before the House last week, I very quickly outlined the opposition's position and made the point, as the Attorney-General did on that occasion and again earlier this evening, that we are concerned about the adverse effects on IVF procedures and practices of the member for Mitchell's amendments. Again, I endorse the Attorney-General's comments and make the point that the opposition formally oppose these amendments. They are, of course, subject to a conscience vote on our side.
I also underline the point that the Attorney-General made earlier. This has been a very good debate but we do not want to try the patience of the House by, as the Attorney-General said, repeating second reading debate speeches during debate on consideration in detail stage amendments. We have been going for some considerable time on these amendments. Frankly, the issues have been well and truly canvassed and I think it would be unfortunate if members inadvertently tried the patience of the House.

"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,2002-09-24,"—I would like to support the amendments moved by my colleague the member for Mitchell. I would like to deal with a couple of issues that have been raised by other speakers. I do not want to delay the House either. We have four other amendments to deal with in regard to this piece of legislation. I am sure that they will be dealt with comprehensively and that the House will get an opportunity to put a number of issues on the public record, which is important, and that opportunities will be available for members of parliament to improve this bill through amendment. I agree that the House should not be delayed but neither should the debate be truncated. Opportunities should be present for MPs to put issues of importance on the public record. Besides these amendments there are four other amendments. They are all technical amendments that deal with important issues. It would be a very sad day for the parliament if those issues were truncated in an act of undemocratic behaviour. 
The member for Mitchell has moved an amendment that would require that the bill apply only to the extraction of embryonic stem cells from excess ART embryos. He has very carefully added in clause 2 that that would not apply where the use of the embryo does not destroy or damage the ART embryo. That was done for the specific purpose of ensuring that IVF procedures are not inhibited in any way. So the furphy that has been created in this debate by some contributors that somehow these amendments are designed to curtail the IVF program is utterly untrue. That is the reason why I support these amendments.
The amendments make this bill honest. If this bill is really about embryonic stem cell research, how could anyone vote against the member for Mitchell's amendments? The member for Mitchell is seeking to ensure that the legislation only allows embryonic stem cell research under licence from ART excess embryos and not for pharmacological testing, testing for perfumery et cetera. That is a very laudable intention on the part of the member for Mitchell. Let us face it, the precedent set by this bill would be that the use of live human embryos for research is permitted. Once we have crossed that line it is a short hop, skip and jump to allow permission to clone embryos—not humans but embryos—to make hybrid embryos or parthenogenetic embryos and to create embryos for the sole purpose of use in destructive experiments. That would be very difficult to resist.
This legislation sets a 14-day time limit. That is simply an arbitrary time limit set by legislators. There is no reason why it should not be 60 days, 90 days or any other number of days. How long would it be before the parliament is asked to allow experimentation on human embryos well past 14 days? What will the arguments be in that case? Will we be presented with the argument, `You people who are against embryonic stem cell research are trying to stop people in wheelchairs or those who are suffering horrific illnesses from being saved by the scientific benefits of embryonic stem cell research'? Will our answer be that 14 days is arbitrary or that 60 days is arbitrary? How do we argue that? Once this bill sets this precedent, it quickly becomes a slippery slope. The important thing about the member for Mitchell's amendments is that they make the bill do what it claims it wants to do—license embryonic stem cell research. That is all that the amendments are about. I urge my colleagues to seriously consider these amendments rather than just assuming their positions.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2002-09-24,"—I rise again to support the member for Mitchell's amendments to clause 25 of the Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002 because, as I have indicated, the sole purpose is surely to provide those miracle cures that the scientists are promising. Surely no member of this House would stand up and declare publicly they are supporting the original bill so as to permit testing of toxicity of drugs on embryos or mere utilitarian commercial benefits by large pharmaceutical companies to experiment with their drugs. I invite every member of the House who intends to vote against the member for Mitchell's amendments to stand up in the House and indicate why they intend to vote this way.
The amendments moved by the member for Mitchell achieve the end of leaving open the door for the miracle cures by destructive use of embryos whilst not making the reason for voting in support of the original bill the mistaken belief that human embryonic stem cell experimentation will achieve any of the results being falsely promised. That is the truth of it. Let's be frank about what we are considering here. The original bill is not only about miracle cures but also, inter alia, about pharmaceutical testing on human embryos and the reductionist view of the first stages of human life being reduced to that of a mere experimentation material. So, if there are members of this House who cannot bring themselves to support the member for Mitchell's amendments, then we are truly a lost people, in my view, for the defeat of those amendments will signal a new era of blindness in reasoning.
The benefits of the member for Mitchell's amendments to clause 25 ensure that the bill, as amended, will have as its intent the purported miracle cures. I fully admit that the member for Mitchell's amendments could be argued to be de minimis utilitarianism—no different morally to the utilitarianism exhibited in the substantive bill. The only benefit in a scenario of bad and worse is that at least a bad solution will admit that if we must have this bill then we should at least eliminate the real economic incentive for the bill. The member for Mitchell's amendments achieve this because they utterly paralyse the prospect of substantial commercial opportunities for the scientists and those who are backing the scientists. 
I cannot understand how anyone could possibly vote against the member for Mitchell's amendments when we come to vote on them. Those amendments allow embryonic stem cell research and—for those people who believe the speculation by the likes of Professor Trounson and others—offer hope. The member for Mitchell's amendments clearly flush out the real agenda of the scientists. If the scientists are genuine, they too should be coming out and saying to the member for Mitchell, `Well done; we'll support your amendments.' I will continue to urge every member of this House to oppose the substantive bill, with or without the member for Mitchell's amendments.
Right to Life Australia wrote me a letter on 4 September. Mrs Margaret Tighe, the president, said, inter alia:
The leading question to be addressed to Professor Trounson is: if the benefits of embryonic stem cell research are so dazzlingly mind-boggling, why is there any need to engage in the sleight of hand to win the support of the MPs? Although Trounson claimed he has divested himself of shareholdings to avoid a financial conflict of interest, a search of a Singapore registered company of ES Cell International, Professor Trounson's company, showed he still held 200,000 shares.
So we know what Professor Trounson's agenda is. We must support the member for Mitchell's amendments because those who oppose the substantive bill will still achieve what they are hoping to achieve.

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2002-09-24,"— We are past the point in this legislation where the moral argument counts. We had that vote. This is about the science of the issue. My amendments to the Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002 say that Trounson cannot be trusted. He has been silenced by his own university and told not to speak on this issue. He has admitted in the press on numerous occasions that he has been silenced. He has been told to shut up on this issue because he has caused so much damage. If he is an example of the scientists involved in this field and the parliament decides to go ahead and vote $46 million to this character, then I think we are grossly mistaken. I know of no instance where the parliament has been blatantly misled on every turn and continues to pursue an issue. If this were a large businessman or a union leader, you would be out with the dogs howling—you would not tolerate it. This character, this scientist, has been told by his own university to shut up or lose his job. It appears the House is wanting to pursue this matter, if the Attorney is any indication, whether or not there is merit in the science.
Let me go back over Professor Trounson's record. Firstly, he told the Andrews committee that he felt that it was a fantastic idea to go into embryonic stem cell research but he did not need any more lines. He gave evidence to say that they did not need any more stem cell lines. It looks as though the House, despite a matter of conscience, wants to move on. I am prepared to wear that, but I think the House is grossly mistaken. Within 12 months this same man says that he wants to adopt therapeutic cloning. At the beginning of this year there were press statements saying he wanted to adopt therapeutic cloning. Within three months he said he felt he did not need therapeutic cloning. So the House is going to pursue this matter and vote $46 million to him without containing him. That is foolishness. This legislation and these amendments need to confine scientists who are cavalier in their approach and quick off the lip to persuade, to use Professor Trounson's words, `simple politicians' to their position. If the House pursue that, I think we are walking away from the responsibility that we are charged with.
The science is clear. The Deputy Vice-Chancellor and research and development biologist at the Australian National University, Professor John Hearn, has said:
The specifics need to be quite open and transparent concerning the special status of the human embryo if research is to be allowed on it; to restrict the use of embryos to stem cell derivation and not to general pharmacological testing—say of teratologic agents; to prevent deliberate formation of embryos for research, which is currently part of legislation; to keep numbers to a minimum ...
There it is, in a nutshell: one of Australia's leading scientists in this field, saying that we need to be careful. We have proved that Professor Trounson cannot be trusted. He has shown films that have proved to be inaccurate. He has made statements in writing that are inaccurate. He has given results of research that is not his own. He has claimed that he has divested himself of his financial interests, and he has not. There are press reports by the mile linking him with the activities in the United States and Singapore. And the company which is being granted these funds is only 40-odd per cent Australian owned.
So, without proper deliberation or investigation, we are going to pursue this matter tonight. If the House feels it can salve its conscience by not examining the matter, so be it. But I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hawker, and other members of the House will not be put off by this process. We will continue to challenge the science, putting the moral stuff aside—and I hold strongly to that also. But these amendments tonight are based on the science and they attempt to get this bill in line with what both the government and members of the opposition who support it claim it should be doing. The first part of the amendments is to ensure that research on embryos is done on stem cells. The next amendment I will deal with in a different way. But I urge the House not to be hooked in by a man who calls those in this place who oppose this legislation irrational hypocrites. So, unless some constraint is put on these people, I believe that we will be derelict in our duty—and I am not persuaded by the arguments of the government. This man and these scientists need strict control, and their brother scientists are saying so.

"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,2002-09-24,"—I rise for the 26th speech on these small amendments to the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002. Twenty speeches have been given in favour of it and six have been commentaries against it—two of them procedural only. I think the debate has gone long enough on these amendments. There are others to be dealt with and there is other business before the House. There has been a tendency for some issues to be debated on a second reading basis rather than on an amendment basis. I think the time has come to put the amendments and, if those present in the House do not agree, I am prepared to move it.

"Washer, Dr Mal, MP",LP,2002-09-24,"—Tonight I was to speak to the Gambaro amendment to the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002. Ms Gambaro is absent, recuperating from surgery. This amendment was to ensure that the high standard and quality of IVF in this country remained world's best practice. Pregnancy rates in the best units are as high as 43 per cent for patients less than 37 years of age—three times higher than those in nature. Since mid-2000, IVF pregnancies have almost doubled in all units throughout Australia. This success reflects the ongoing training of scientists and quality assurance testing.
Approximately five years ago, scientists in Sydney and Melbourne discovered a culture medium that most accurately matched the environment of a woman's fallopian tubes, where the egg is normally fertilised. This discovery increased the efficiency of IVF. The 20th century saw a number of discoveries, including IVF, that have benefited society dramatically and allowed thousands of infertile couples the opportunity to share the privilege of being a parent. It is important that IVF programs be able to use excess embryos for training, quality assurance and the development of new culture mediums.
The success of IVF programs in Australia is also attributed to the open and accountable manner in which it is practised. We are confident that the concerns raised by credible IVF specialists will be addressed in the pending Senate inquiry. This inquiry should provide a forum for careful evaluation of these concerns and should ensure that excellent research is continued, with high ethical standards that are monitored by the National Health and Medical Research Council. This would allow a more deliberate consideration to prevent any unintended consequences arising from the bill. To allow this evaluation the time and proper scrutiny, Ms Gambaro and I have decided not to proceed with the amendment. I would like to put on record my appreciation of Ms Gambaro for highlighting this need for scrutiny and for elevating public and parliamentary awareness of these important issues.",REPS,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,13,1
"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,2002-09-24,"—I move:
(1)	Clause 25, page 9 (lines 23-26), omit sub paragraph (2)(d)(ii), substitute:
	“(ii)	the use forms part of any necessary diagnostic investigations conducted in connection with assisted reproductive technology treatment of the woman for whom the excess ART embryo was created; or”.
I move this amendment because the legislation as drafted has a loophole, which I will explain. The current IVF procedures that are able to be conducted allow any number of eggs to be taken from a particular woman, fertilised and then put back into the woman for the purposes of the creation of a human being. The way the legislation is drafted, that is quite possible. The IVF program takes a number of eggs and diagnostically tests them to see which are the strongest, which have flaws and therefore which ones should be replaced into the woman.
The legislation as it is currently drafted would allow as many eggs as the IVF clinic decided to take to be diagnostically tested. It does not indicate how the testing should be conducted, how many eggs should be taken, what the testing should seek to achieve and whether there should be a licence for that testing. This is a loophole in the bill because what could happen is that 20, 30 or 40 or, in particularly fecund women, 50 or 60 eggs could be taken. Under the guise of diagnostic testing to determine which were the strong ones, the flawed ones, the weaker ones, an embryonic stem cell research program could be conducted in theory without a licence. This clause in the bill establishes the exemptions from the requirements for a licence. A licence is required for a whole lot of purposes except where they are exempted. The ART program for diagnostic testing is exempted. If an IVF program decided to take 50 or 60 eggs and test them diagnostically, they could, under the guise of diagnostic testing, conduct an embryonic stem cell research program. That was not the intention of the bill. 
The intention was that diagnostic testing was to mean exactly what occurs now, which is that eight, 10 or 12 embryos are created, diagnostically tested and the strongest are put back in and the 10 that are not put back in are frozen. That was the purpose of diagnostic testing as described in this bill. The loophole that is created needs to be closed. My amendment inserts the word `necessary', just one word, and would deal with that problem. An IVF clinic that was to determine what diagnostic testing was required would need to have regard for the fact that the use forms part of any `necessary' diagnostic investigations conducted in connection with an ART program. So the word `necessary' would be a hurdle or a break, if you like, for any IVF program to consider whether the diagnostic testing being conducted was a necessary part of the ART program. If it were not necessary, they would not conduct it. If it were necessary, it would be exempted. If it were to be exempted, it would require a licence.
This whole bill is about embryonic stem cell research being conducted under licence. It is a very important point. This bill is not about allowing carte blanche embryonic stem cell research. It is not about saying that embryonic stem cell research is a good idea and must be conducted without any fetters. It is about the Commonwealth government, through the ethics committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council,  establishing a regime under licence for ART programs for embryonic stem cell research programs. The amendment would make clear that a licence was needed to do any necessary diagnostic testing. I would urge my colleagues to consider seriously this amendment and support it.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2002-09-24,"—I wish to address the amendment to clause 25 of the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 moved by the member for Sturt. As members are aware, this bill was originally part of a larger bill called the Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002. At first, this bill was split and that was welcomed. It overcame the problem that members who may oppose cloning but support human embryonic stem cell experimentation, or vice versa, were corralled into voting yes or no on both issues simultaneously, even though the two issues raise very different ethical questions.
Whilst we are all pleased in the House with regard to the outcome of the prohibition of human cloning bill, I am still disturbed that there is a prevailing ethic that says that an act that is deemed legal or illegal is therefore licit or illicit by virtue only of the existence of positive law. I was quite staggered in the previous divisions that those who opposed the member for Mitchell's amendments did not fully appreciate what they were voting on. I have spoken to a couple of members and I do not think they understood that they were actually voting to support embryonic stem cell research, but only embryonic stem cell research, nothing else. I am terribly concerned that people still have a closed mind in relation to this debate. There is value in having this consideration in detail stage. Talking to the amendments can illuminate what each amendment is about.
This line of reasoning says that human cloning is to be considered licit simply because there is a Commonwealth law that says so. Well, one day a government may make amendments to that act and say what was illicit—that is, illegal—yesterday is licit, that is, legal, today. In so doing, I fear some in this House may have totally lost sight of the fact that there are higher laws—laws that are not simply the purview of the flight of fancy of whatever enters a person's mind at the time. This, with respect, is exactly how I believe some members are approaching this debate.
The amendment put by the member for Sturt—in my opinion and with respect to the member for Sturt—is fraught with problems, and I cannot support it. This amendment deals with, inter alia, the issue of limiting embryonic research to IVF investigations. I notice that, by specifying the use of excess ART embryos, the amendment seeks to ensure that embryos are not used by a licensed person for anything other than creation of stem cells. I understand what the member for Sturt is saying but, with respect, neither the bill before this House nor the amendment by the member for Sturt reflect my absolute opposition to the bill nor the continued error in the statutory drafting of the bill. I specifically refer to the member for Sturt's proposed amendment to clause 25, which continues to distinguish between so-called excess and non-excess ART embryos. I must reiterate my comments made in the House on 22 August for the benefit of all members:
In my view, it is not possible to distinguish between the so-called `excess' human embryos and `non-excess' human embryos.
This fact has been stated by many in various speeches during this debate, including the Minister for Ageing, who is not here tonight. I will repeat what I said in my speech in the House on 22 August regarding this point. Dr Robert Jansen from Sydney IVF noted the following in his submission to the Senate inquiry into human embryo experimentation of 1986:
It is a fallacy to distinguish between surplus embryos and specially created embryos in terms of embryo research—any intelligent administrator of an IVF program can, by minor changes in his ordinary clinical way of going about things, change the number of embryos that are fertilised. So in practice there would be no purpose at all in enshrining in legislation a difference between surplus and specially created embryos.
There it is. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,13,1
"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2002-09-24,"—This amendment is similar to the last one in that it seeks to add the word `necessary' to confine the work in IVF to the field that it should be confined to. That is necessary because I do not think anybody involved in an IVF program would want to be unaware of what their embryos—if they are called `excess' and they approve of it—can be used for. Martin Pera and Alan Trounson in the Canberra Times of 5 April 2000 said that they wanted to test pharmaceuticals and also perform possible toxicological experiments. They said that both in the Canberra Times and before our committee. I am suspicious of motives in this instance. Therefore, again I appeal to the House to support the amendment from the member for Sturt, which seeks to limit the IVF program research to IVF uses and not to allow it as an excuse to develop an unusually large bank of embryos for other purposes. An article in the Financial Review of 10 August 2002 said:
BresaGen CEO John Smeaton said the COAG proposal was `OK for research but hasn't addressed the issues on the horizon as we move into therapeutic development'. He said frozen IVF embryos wouldn't meet their needs because they were mostly four- to six-cell embryos that would need to be cultured onto the blastocyst stage to harvest stem cells. `That is not what we want to waste our time on,' Smeaton said.
So the motivation is out there to go a lot further than this legislation says, and the wish of the member for Sturt and many others is to make sure that this legislation does precisely what it says it will do. BresaGen Ltd, ES Cell International Pty Ltd and Stem Cell Sciences Pty Ltd—this is the trio that holds rights to more than 10 of the world's very limited bank of stem cell lines, variously estimated to total no more than 20 to 60 developed cell lines.
Even in that very strong position, we have key people in these organisations saying they want to go further. We are not prepared as a House to put a boundary around the use of research for IVF or training for IVF. We are just going to say that they can have a go. Simply the word `necessary' is all that the member for Sturt is seeking to add here. The purpose of necessity is to conduct research and to do training for the purposes of IVF. There is no restriction on the IVF program. I refer again to the Financial Review articleof Saturday, 10 August 2002:
This week, Trounson's company announced plans for commercial production of embryonic stem cells for export using aborted foetal tissue as a feeder layer. This is possible due to ES Cell's Singapore research on a 14-week-old aborted foetus. (So much for Trounson saying recently he is `relaxed about working on embryos until the point where a body shape can be seen'.)
The inconsistencies of the remarks made by the key people in these companies would have me believe that the House needs to be cautious about the way in which this legislation is drafted. The addition of the words `if necessary' in the section proposed by the member for Sturt is absolutely reasonable. There is nothing hidden. There is no hidden agenda. The moral arguments have been had and the House has decided not to look at scientific and moral arguments. 
Tonight I am putting in a plea for a sensible scientific assessment of these people's intention. You have to look at their intention. Time after time, they are saying that their intention is not to live by the rules but to go outside the rules. I believe that the House needs to put a boundary around the process. We can review the process in a couple of years time. That proposal is already there, however that review may be done. We can do the review.

"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,2002-09-24,"—Let me outline my understanding of this amendment to the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002. Under clause 25, subclause (1), it is an offence if a person intentionally uses an excess ART embryo unless they have a licence or unless the use is an exempt use. Subclause (2), which is the subject of the amendment, then provides that a use of an excess ART embryo is an exempt use if, in the case of paragraph (d), 
... the use is carried out by an accredited ART centre; and: 
(i) the excess ART embryo is not suitable to be placed in the body of the woman for whom it was created; and
(ii) the use forms part of diagnostic investigations conducted in connection with the assisted reproductive technology treatment of the woman for whom the excess ART embryo was created ... 
The amendment simply seeks to add the words `any necessary' prior to the words `diagnostic investigations'. The effect is not significant in a practical way in the sense that diagnostic investigations in this context are only carried out to improve the chances of pregnancy of the woman for whom the embryo was created and they can only be carried out with that woman's consent. But adding those words will give rise to arguments about whether a diagnostic investigation is accepted by a respectable body of relevant professional opinion as being necessary or, alternatively, as distinct from desirable or potentially useful.
Diagnostic investigations are an accepted clinical practice carried out with the consent and benefit of those involved in an IVF program. This accepted IVF practice is overseen by the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee of the Fertility Society of Australia and it should not be subject to further regulation.
The member for Sturt also suggested that clause 25(2)(d)(ii), the subject of the amendment, allows a loophole in that 20 to 30 eggs could be taken and, under the guise of testing, used for the conduct of research without a licence. I beg to differ. It is in fact not the case. Section 14 of the Prohibition of Human Cloning Act, already passed by this House, provides that it is an offence to create an embryo outside the body of a woman unless the intention is to attempt to create pregnancy in a particular woman.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2002-09-24,"—I would like to pick up on what the member for Mitchell was saying in support of the amendment to the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002, although I am not going to support it. He raises very valid issues in relation to this debate, and they concern the economic agenda of the proponents of this legislation. I am very grateful to Dr Amin Abboud from Australasian Bioethics Information, who sent me an email on Monday providing information he obtained from a stem cell conference held in Melbourne last week. This document clearly highlights the issues that the member for Mitchell is raising about the economic motive behind the industry in this issue. The document says:
The commercialisation of stem cells
1. Please refer to attached article from 17th August in the Weekend Australian, Fickle Fortunes of Biotech Biz. The statements made in this article were confirmed at the Stem Cells 2002 conference. From the venture capitalist's point of view, therapies from stem cell research are very, very risky business. 
`I can't think of a better place to talk about miracles than a stem cell conference,' said Stuart Wardman-Browne, Chief Operating Office at Amwin, a venture capital firm.
2. The temptations to scientists from the commercialisation of stem cell research are obvious. Return on investment will end up being the only ethical criterion. What is to prevent entrepreneurial scientists from engaging in practices which are now considered sordid and unethical— apart from legislative guidelines? Apart from cures, there is immense potential for profit in stem cell research from drug discovery, screening and growth factors. And in the words of Professor John Shine, the Executive Director of the Garvan Institute of Medical Research, `we [in Australia] still have a culture that the poorer the scientist the better the science.' I suspect that stem cell scientists are determined to turn this attitude around.
Commercialisation of embryo research will send scientists to venture capital firms—and these have few ethical scruples. One VC manager told me in August that his firm refused to invest in the sex, tobacco and military hardware industries, but he did not know anyone who saw embryonic stem cell research as ethically out-of-bounds. 
VC managers are driven only by profit. `We're not driven by the good of mankind,' admitted Dr Mike Hirshorn, CEO of St George Innovation Funds, Nanyang Ventures, at the stem cells conference. `Our task is to return a profit to investors.' Or, in the words of Mark Morrison, Investment Manager for CM Capital, `if somebody came to me with a malaria vaccine, I wouldn't invest in it.' Malaria, which kills about one million African children each year, is not a money-spinner.
This is what makes Professor Alan Trounson's carelessness with his promotional talks and videos and his financial disclosure all the more alarming. What does this augur for the rigour of scientific ethics? In the opinion of Rahul K. Dhanda, author of a recent American book, Guiding Icarus: Merging Bioethics with Corporate Interests: `What's more of a concern is how the attitudes that compromise corporate ethics may have a broader effect in a biotech company. If there is an attitude about cutting corners in accounting, that might spill over to science, that is very disturbing' (The Scientist, Sept 16).
There is no doubt that this agenda is all about making money. Unfortunately, the amendments moved by the member for Mitchell have been defeated. They would have completely rendered impotent the campaign by the scientists and those who are backing them to make a vast amount of money. I have no confidence in the agenda of the scientists in relation to this legislation. Whilst I understand the sincerity of the member for Sturt in moving his amendment, I cannot support it.

"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2002-09-24,"—The opposition oppose the amendment to the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 which was moved by the member for Sturt, but it is, of course, subject to a conscience vote. The reasons for the opposition formally opposing this amendment are substantially the same as those outlined by the Attorney-General. The amendment seeks to include the word `necessary' in relation to types of diagnostic investigations. The word either adds nothing, in which case the amendment is meaningless and therefore not required, or, on the other hand, it requires something further from current accepted practices. As the case is at present that diagnostic investigations must be with the consent of the person receiving the artificial reproductive treatment, the artificial reproductive treatment embryo must be unsuitable for implantation and the diagnostic procedures must be part of the ART treatment of the particular woman for whom the embryo was created. That is the accepted practice and procedure. The danger the opposition see is that if, on the one hand, the use of the word `necessary' adds nothing, it might on the other hand require some further tests or steps which would adversely impact on current accepted IVF procedures, which is not something the opposition support. For those reasons, the opposition oppose the amendment of the member for Sturt. ",REPS,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,13,1
"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,2002-09-24,"—During the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002, Professor John Hearn appeared and gave evidence, on 19 September. He is Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) and developmental biologist at the ANU and is a member of the Australian Academy of Science. He also gave advice to the Andrews committee on legal and constitutional affairs. He said at the hearing on 19 September:
I have made a comment about suggested criteria for embryonic stem cell research because I believe that Australians do know and understand many of these issues—and this goes to the over 600 submissions we had in the House of Representatives review and report. Although Australia is a very pluralistic society, we understand the specifics. The specifics need to be quite open and transparent concerning the special status of the human embryo if research is to be allowed on it; to restrict the use of embryos to stem cell derivation and not to general pharmacological testing—say of teratologic agents; to prevent deliberate formation of embryos for research, which is currently part of legislation; to keep numbers to a minimum, and that is quite possible through the normal proposals; and, to require evidence that the research question cannot be performed on adult stem cells or other stem cells or indeed on animal stem cell surrogates.
I agree with Professor Hearn's comment to the Senate committee about the need to create parameters for the use of embryos for the purposes of science. In his statement he set out a number of parameters, and in this amendment we are seeking to maintain faith with those parameters by allowing diagnostic testing—which is obviously a necessary part of the IVF process—but not allowing diagnostic testing that becomes, by any other name, an embryonic stem cell research program without licence. That is all this amendment seeks to do. 
Those people who are saying that this amendment is about striking at the heart of the IVF program totally misunderstand—not deliberately, I am sure—the motivations and intentions of people like me and others who support this amendment. I cannot speak for everybody, but I do not want to stop the IVF program. The IVF program is about creating life. It is about giving thousands of couples, who would otherwise not have had the opportunity, the ability to bring new life into the world. I congratulate and welcome the IVF and ART programs. I can even say that the pioneering work of Alan Trounson—let us say one positive thing about him in this debate—in the area of the IVF programs is utterly to be supported and lauded. But that does not mean that we should allow diagnostic testing that becomes an embryonic stem cell research program by another name. Of course, if a woman is told, `We are going to take 20 or 30 eggs and test them, and we will put the two best ones back in for the purpose of creating life,' she is not going to say, `No, no, I do not want you to take 20 or 30; I want you to take six or eight.' Obviously she is going to give herself the best possible chance to have the healthiest and strongest eggs to attach and develop.
The argument put by the member for Perth and the Attorney-General that somehow this is not going to happen because it has not happened in the past—because of the consent required from the couples involved in IVF—totally misunderstands the emotional state of those people using the IVF program. Of course they are going to say, `If you want 20 or 30 eggs, take them. Take as many as you can, because we would like the best implanted for the purposes of birth.' They are not going to say, `No, we only want you to take six or eight; we don't want to have too many eggs left over.' That argument is a total furphy and an embarrassment because it misunderstands what we are talking about. I will speak again when I get the opportunity.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2002-09-24,"—A constituent wrote to me the other day as follows:
The philosophical position that we hold is often dismissed or denigrated as “uncaring”, “conservative” or “catholic thinking”. So be it; but it is not simply a position that seeks to conserve “old” values, nor is it about “safety” in the face of the unknown. Rather, it is about never presuming to hold the “fullness of truth” about good and evil and to never presume that an unethical or doubtful “means” justifies a “noble” end.
The Hon. Peter Breen MLC, from Reform the Legal System, wrote to me as follows: 
Dear Mr Murphy
It is an odd thing that genetically modified Frankenstein food horrifies us and yet we seem willing to flirt with Frankenstein in the debate over embryonic stem cell research. Human embryos are a rich source of stem cells, runs the argument; the IVF program has created a wealth of excess human embryos, and so why not allow medical research rather than waste the resource? The argument is compelling except for the ethical and moral problems of harvesting human body parts. To my mind the risks are greater than the benefits at this stage of our knowledge and the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 is premature in my opinion. Bad law brings discredit on the parliament and is difficult to overturn.
I am also concerned about destroying the integrity of the human embryo in the name of medical research. While it is true that a woman's body destroys vast numbers of human embryos, this process of natural selection is to be distinguished from the artificial situation that exists in a medical laboratory. The genetic imprint of human life appears at the moment the male and female cell unite to form a new organism. Manipulation of the genes in the laboratory can begin from that first moment. Inevitably, scientists will want to `grow' their contrived embryos, circumventing the process of natural selection if necessary.
Intention is critical to this debate as it was in the debate on voluntary euthanasia legislation. The intention in palliative care is to relieve suffering and the treatment must stop if a patient begins to respond. Similarly, the IVF embryo is frozen for the purpose of implantation in the mother's womb at a later date. The frozen embryo will not survive indefinitely, but so long as the intention to implant the embryo remains then we are not crossing any ethical or moral divide. To begin research on the embryo, however, is the first step that leads to flirting with Frankenstein, and for this reason I urge you to oppose the bill.
Endeavour Forum Inc. also wrote to me. It said:
Dear Mr Murphy
In the controversy over extracting stem cells from embryos, the assumption is that these embryos are going to be destroyed anyway. However, they can be pre-natally adopted and implanted in adopting mothers. Attached is an email I received from such a mother in the US.
This lady asks:
If some of the $46 million of taxpayers money earmarked for Trounson was given for setting up an adoption agency like Snowflakes, many of the lives of Australian embryos could be saved. President Bush has allocated $US 1 million for embryo adoption; surely Australia could do the same.
I think that is a valid point. This lady goes on:
All political parties have deplored the low birth rate in Australia, so why is the Australian Parliament contemplating destroying 70,000 of our future citizens many of whose lives could be saved?
The taxpayers have helped Professor Trounson to the tune of some $46 million in the name of science. Why couldn't we do something with regard to promoting the adoption of those embryos? Why was an embryo created? An embryo was created to give life.

"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,2002-09-24,"—This amendment, while significant in the eyes of the member for Sturt, raises very narrow issues of interpretation. I think we have had a reasonable debate with regard to that. I would suggest that the member for Lowe's last contribution did not address the amendment at all; it was a repetition of the second reading debate, which we ought to be avoiding.

"Cadman, Alan, MP",LP,2002-09-24,"—I refer to clause 25(2)(d)(ii) in the section of the bill dealing with exempt uses:
(ii) the use forms part of diagnostic investigations conducted in connection with the assisted reproductive technology treatment of the woman for whom the excess ART embryo was created;
That says that the production of an embryo and the diagnostic investigations associated with that embryo are exempt from any penalty, provided it is investigated in connection with assisted reproductive technology treatment of the woman for whom the embryo was created. My colleague the member for Sturt has added the words `any necessary' because the original proposal does not say `any necessary diagnostic investigations'.
The Attorney-General has presented a case saying that he considers that this narrows the process to a point where a peer review process might be necessary to carry out diagnostic work. I would hope that peer review is necessary in a whole range of medical procedures, particularly when they apply to embryos. I cannot see what the objection is to narrowing the proposal. Unless the Attorney-General goes into further detail, I cannot understand how anything can be designed in order to object to this other than to favour the proposals of scientists who want to go beyond what is reasonable. Peer review is part of science. Something cannot be said to be achieved by scientists unless there is a proper peer review process.
The diagnostic investigations that may be necessary in connection with reproductive technology for the treatment of women are an essential part of the whole process. The amendment seeks to limit it to any necessary diagnostic investigations, not any unnecessary investigations. Surely the Attorney-General is not proposing that, by leaving these words out, we should imply that any unnecessary treatment be allowed. Is that what he means by leaving this out—that any unnecessary diagnostic treatment should be allowed? It seems to imply that.
In an article in the Stem Cell Report entitled`Advances in alternatives to embryonic stem cell research', Professor Alan Trounson is reported as saying that his view was that `there are at least three or four other alternatives that are more attractive already than therapeutic cloning'. The intention and the motivation are there among the scientists. We have explored that fully. I fail to understand the Attorney-General's insistence that, by implication, any unnecessary diagnostic investigations may be conducted. Necessary or unnecessary, there does not seem to be any boundary in this proposal. If I understand what is being said, he is saying that any necessary or any unnecessary investigations are allowed; it is up to the person doing the diagnostic work. They do not have to be reviewed, they have approval to do the diagnostic work and then they do not have to prove whether it was necessary or not.
Why shouldn't they have to prove that the diagnostic work is necessary? Surely, in this area, it must be demonstrated that the diagnostic work is necessary. I cannot express myself more strongly or more clearly than to say that those who do not wish to support this amendment either live in a world of legal expertise where the practice of science is unfamiliar to them or are aware of practices that scientists want to undertake and they approve of them. It is one or the other, because both unnecessary and necessary diagnostic work can continue with no peer review and at the whim of the scientists.

"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,2002-09-24,"—There are still two or three issues I want to raise, which the Attorney-General alluded to in his contribution. The first of those my colleague the member for Mitchell spoke on: the question of appropriate checks. The Attorney-General seemed to suggest that this amendment requires that diagnostic testing, if not to be done just with the consent of the woman concerned, would perhaps require some kind of ethics committee or some kind of peer review by similar practitioners in the same area. To that I would say: I would have no difficulty at all with diagnostic testing that I did not deem to be necessary, and that perhaps medical practitioners did not deem to be necessary, being part of a peer review check.
Why shouldn't there be some kind of two-stage process where diagnostic testing needs to be assured, not only to the woman concerned and her partner but also to a peer review group? It would not have to be done every single time diagnostic testing was to be undertaken, because that would obviously be impractical, but if an IVF clinic had determined that it wished to do a procedure with a number of embryos, it could then seek an assessment by an ethics committee—it might even be an ethics committee similar to the one set up by this bill; it might even be the ethics committee set up by this bill under the NHMRC—to determine whether that set of procedures was deemed to be necessary diagnostic testing. If the ethics committee set up under this bill and under the NHMRC determined that it was necessary diagnostic testing, that would be an acceptable outcome.
Right now the bill, as it is drafted, allows diagnostic testing of embryos to determine their strength for placement into a woman without qualification and without licence. There is a considered loophole in this bill that would allow diagnostic testing to be interpreted by the IVF clinicians themselves—self-assessment. I do not believe that self-assessment by the clinicians is good enough when we are talking about human life. Unlike the Attorney-General, I believe that a peer review assessment by an ethics committee of the NHMRC set up under this bill is an entirely appropriate course of action to follow. Far from limiting or reducing my enthusiasm for this amendment, the Attorney-General has encouraged me to believe that this amendment was very much in the interests of the industry we are talking about because it would require a proper assessment of whether the diagnostic testing proposed to be done was necessary. Who could argue with that?
The second thing I want to pick up is that the Attorney-General suggested that the intention must be to create pregnancy—that the first bill makes it clear that the intention must be to create pregnancy and so diagnostic testing that was not designed to create pregnancy would somehow be outside the gamut of the first bill and therefore illegal. The intention of taking 20, 30 or more eggs may well be to create pregnancy in the first instance, but it is not practical for 20 or 30 eggs to be put back into a women for the purpose of creating life—most people doing IVF do not want 20 or 30 children at once. Obviously, if this amendment is not passed, it would be open for an IVF clinic, under the guise of diagnostic testing, to run an embryonic stem cell research program without a licence because the diagnostic testing was not deemed to be necessary. Simply put, the eggs could well have been taken for the purpose of creating pregnancy, but the clinic could deem that there are so many eggs and, under the guise of diagnostic testing, use them for embryonic stem cell research. (Extension of time granted) The third point that I wish to raise following the Attorney-General's contribution is that he accuses this amendment—
Mr SNOWDON (Lingiari) (9.36 p.m.)—I move:

Question put:",REPS,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,13,1
"Pyne, Chris, MP",LP,2002-09-24,"—I move:
(2)	Clause 56, page 29 (lines 4-7), omit the clause, substitute:
“56 Operation of State Laws
		Nothing in this Act is to be taken to affect the operation of any law of a State that prohibits absolutely the use of excess ART embryos, or that imposes additional conditions, whether consistent or inconsistent with this Act, on the use of such embryos.”.
The key phrase in that amendment is `whether consistent or inconsistent with this act'. The reason why I have moved this amendment is that my understanding of the COAG agreement struck by the Prime Minister, the premiers and the chief ministers was that the Commonwealth was to establish a national regime to deal with embryonic stem cell research but, in those states where regimes already existed, as long as those regimes were more restrictive than the Commonwealth regime, then the state regimes would still apply. In Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria there are regimes that deal with embryonic stem cell research. They have been operating for some time—in the state of South Australia for 10 years—and they have been found to be entirely adequate for the purposes of conducting world-breaking IVF procedures and programs.
There has been no suggestion in those states that IVF procedures have not been able to be carried out; in fact, much of the ground-breaking research in Australia that has been achieved has been achieved in my own state of South Australia, and I am sure the same could be said for Victoria and Western Australia. Those states have established their own regimes. In the arrangements with the Prime Minister, the premiers and the chief ministers, it was understood that those regimes would be able to continue as long as they were not less restrictive than the Commonwealth regime. Clause 56 of the bill says:
56  Operation of State laws
This Act is not intended to exclude the operation of any law of a State, to the extent that the law of the State is capable of operating concurrently with this Act.
The key phrase is `concurrently with this act', but the explanatory memorandum says:
This clause provides that the Act is not intended to exclude the operation of State and Territory laws except where the State or Territory laws are inconsistent with the Act and cannot operate concurrently.
One of the intended effects of this clause is that if a State has existing legislation that, for example, bans the use of excess ART embryos, such a law would not be capable of operating concurrently with the Act and as such it is intended that the Act override the State law to the extent that it is inconsistent.
My understanding is that that paragraph in the explanatory memorandum does not accurately reflect the COAG agreement because it suggests that, if a state law is more restrictive than the Commonwealth law, it cannot operate concurrently with the Commonwealth law and therefore should be banned when, if a law sets a certain standard and another law sets a more restrictive standard, it can by logic and longstanding legal practice operate concurrently.
The only circumstances in which it would not be able to operate concurrently would be if the Commonwealth had set a standard—for want of a better description, a national benchmark—and a state law had a less restrictive benchmark. Then it would not be able to operate concurrently because it would be allowing things that the Commonwealth law did not allow. My understanding of the COAG agreement is that the states are allowed to have more restrictive legislation. Later in the debate, because I see my time is drawing to a close, I will draw out where in the state legislation I support the restrictive regimes that they have in place and that I would like to see remain in place.",REPS,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,13,1
"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,2002-09-24,"—Clause 56, which is the subject of the member for Sturt's amendment, provides as he indicated that the act is not intended to exclude the operation of state and territory laws except where the state and territory laws are inconsistent with the act and cannot operate concurrently. Let me try to explain the way this operates. If a state has existing legislation which, for example, bans the use of excess ART embryos, such a law would not be capable of operating concurrently with the act. By virtue of clause 2 of the bill, clause 25 of the bill, which provides that a person must not use an excess ART embryo unless the use is authorised by a licence or is an exempt use, will not commence operation for six months from the date that this bill receives royal assent. During this time, any inconsistent state laws that ban the use of excess ART embryos will continue to operate subject to amendment by the relevant state parliaments.
It is intended that all states and territories will introduce corresponding laws in order to establish a comprehensive and effective national scheme banning certain practices as detailed in part 2 of the bill and regulating certain uses of excess ART embryos. All states and territories propose to introduce corresponding state laws into their respective parliaments. It is proposed that these laws will confer functions, powers and duties on the NHMRC licensing committee. This provides for the effective operation of the national scheme relating to the regulation of uses of excess ART embryos by enabling corresponding state laws to provide that the licensing function is exercised under a state law actually be undertaken by the NHMRC licensing committee. 
The amendment proposed by the member for Sturt is to the effect that nothing in this act is to be taken to affect the operation of any law of a state that prohibits absolutely the use of excess ART embryos, or that imposes additional conditions, whether consistent or inconsistent with this act, on the use of such embryos. I do not support the amendment. The effect of the amendment would be to allow state legislation to override Commonwealth legislation. This is inconsistent with the notion of a nationally consistent approach to regulation in this area. The effect would be that states could prohibit the use of excess ART embryos or impose conditions on the use of such embryos that would be inconsistent with the Commonwealth legislation.",REPS,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,13,1
"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2002-09-24,"—The opposition also opposes the amendment moved by the member for Sturt. It is of course subject to the application of a conscience vote on this side. I entirely agree with the Attorney-General's analysis. 
—The member for Parramatta is not in his normal allocated seat. The member for Perth has the call.
—The effect of the COAG communique was to have one nationally consistent scheme with one licensing body. The effect of the member for Sturt's amendment is potentially to throw up an inconsistent scheme with differences in various jurisdictions. That is neither the intention of the COAG communique, nor is it the desire or the intention of the state governments to whom he refers. It is simply a quite narrow based amendment which has at its heart this: you either support a national scheme, which this House has by an overwhelming majority in the course of the second reading debate and vote, or you do not. It is quite straightforward: you either have a consistent national scheme with one licensing authority or you do not. It is a narrow amendment. The amendment moved by the member for Sturt seeks to drive a stake through the heart of uniformity and national consistency. On that basis, the House should reject it.",REPS,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,13,1
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2002-09-24,"—I support this amendment because it is my belief that this amendment moved by the member for Sturt ensures that those states that do not possess laws governing research involving embryos are protected by Commonwealth legislation. We know that Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia have stronger laws than other states. Without this amendment, I believe the Commonwealth legislation would remain uncertain. In conclusion—I know that people are probably getting tired of this debate—Mr Speaker, you were not in the chamber when we voted on the member for Mitchell's amendments early in the evening. I was absolutely staggered that anyone could possibly not support those amendments.
—The member for Lowe must be aware of the obligation he has under the standing orders, particularly on a debate like this, to confine his remarks to the amendment currently before the chair.
—I believe I am being very relevant. I am not convinced from the contributions that I am hearing around the chamber—and I am not talking about those made at the dispatch box or in one's place, recorded by Hansard—that people properly understand these amendments. I think that is sad and I want to make that point because, if people take the time to go back to and have a close look at what the member for Mitchell proposed, they would think more carefully about the amendments that we still have to consider in this debate. I feel that members in the House are getting tired of this. They want to vote on it. We all want to vote on it, but some of us want to vote in different ways. During the last division, when people came into the chamber they could not understand why I was voting on this side of the House. Plainly, they did not know and people said to me, `I think I might have to abstain because I really don't know what we are actually debating.' I think that is sad.
—The question is that the amendment be agreed to. I apologise to the member for Parramatta. I will in fact recognise him, because I failed to see him on his feet.",REPS,<title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,13,1
"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,2002-09-24,"—Mr Speaker, I do apologise for my earlier unruly outburst in response to the remarks of the member for Perth, for whom on these issues I certainly have a high regard—
—You didn't do it for the Attorney-General when he was on his feet.
—The member for Corio will also get the call to apologise if he so desires, but right now the member for Parramatta has the call.
—I was provoked, if I may use that expression, by the remark—which I think Hansard will show—from the member for Perth, when he said that the opposition opposes this amendment subject to the operation of a conscience vote. It is hard for me to imagine a more nonsensical sentence.
—That is what I said on every amendment, if you took an interest in it.
—The member for Perth's repetition of the statement does not make it any more meaningful, and I appreciate the fact that the member for Corio has made himself present—and, I must say, with greater diligence than I have myself—for each of the amendments and is clearly addressing his mind to the merits or otherwise of each of the propositions put before the House. I certainly regard that as good practice for a series of propositions advanced not through the of lens of some global party interest but on the basis that this is a genuine conscience debate.
—The member for Parramatta must come to the amendment currently before the chair.
—The amendment puts a proposition, which the Attorney has responded to on the basis that it erodes the principle of uniformity—and there is no question that the amendment does have that effect. Those of us supporting it had the impression that this was anticipated by COAG in the original agreement, which this legislation is intended to reflect. The agreement, as I understand it—and as I and other members of the coalition parties were briefed in the joint party room—was that the legislation would not have the effect of overriding the states that already had their own regimes in place where those states incorporated a higher duty of care in relation to scientists, researchers and clinicians practising in this area. The member for Perth interjected that we did not understand what the states themselves want. The amendment does not prohibit in any way the states from making their own decisions and amending their own legislation. We just feel that there is some sense of humility required on the part of the Commonwealth where, if our objective is to ensure the legislation of some basic safeguards, some minimum standards, a national benchmark, we ought not then at the same time to roll over the top of the states and to say to the parliamentarians—the representatives of Australian citizens in other states and territories of the Commonwealth—that your judgment as previously exercised in a considered way is defective and inadequate, even where that judgment has resulted in a higher standard of care than the one which is proposed before the House today. So, for those reasons, I am happy to support the amendment.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2002-09-24,"—On Sunday, 15 September I met with some very special parents and their children for a barbecue at Camp Breakaway. These parents and their children were members of a support group for children with rare and very serious genetic disorders. They all lived on the Central Coast of New South Wales and the parents all had very severely disabled children with very high support needs and very high care needs.
I found that I was overwhelmed by the dedication of these parents and the extreme adversity that they had to face each day. The love and care that they gave to their children was phenomenal and the hurdles that they had to overcome every day were beyond imagination. They were doing the work of registered nurses. They had to resuscitate their children on a regular basis. It was one of those experiences I am sure all members have from time to time and one that truly moved me. These parents were at their wits' end, really. They find that there are not enough resources for their children and they have to struggle and fight for every little bit of extra respite or assistance they have. 
One of the children was Tori, with her mother Karen. I visited them at their home before I went to the barbecue at Camp Breakaway. Tori suffers from spinal muscular atrophy and has very limited movement. She is a very bright little girl but has very restricted movement. Karen averages about three hours sleep a night but her dedication to Tori is phenomenal. Tori needs a wheelchair and a car seat. She needs so much equipment that every day is a struggle.
When I went to the barbecue, I met Sonya. Sonya has four children. Her son Alex is the one with the disability. As well as having four children, including Alex with his very severe disability, Sonya has a husband who is a quadriplegic. It was really touching as she reached out to say, `Please, is there anything that you can do to help or assist me and all these other parents here? Every day we fight this battle. Every time we are faced with one hurdle after another.' When they went along to Centrelink to get assistance with the disability payment for children with a disability, ticking the boxes was not sufficient and they were rejected. In the end, one of the mothers said, `I got so sick of filling in these forms and being rejected I decided I would take my child into Centrelink.' The Centrelink officer took one look at the child, saw that it had a `trachie' in its neck and saw just the level of care that it needed. They immediately granted the payment.
As members of parliament, when we pass legislation, we really need to be aware of the impact that it has on people who just keep their heads above water, as these parents do. One of the big issues was respite, how desperately they need respite. At this point, I would like to implore the government to rethink the money that it is giving to the states through the Commonwealth-state disability agreement. These families need assistance. They need that respite. They are saving state and federal governments many millions of dollars. They do it for love. They do it because they care for their children.
As members of parliament, sometimes it is very important for us to really get away from listening to what the bureaucrats say, to get away from looking at this bundle of money and that bundle of money for one thing or another, and just to think about the people—these children and these parents who struggle on a day-to-day basis to keep their children alive, to provide for their children. When we do that—when we actually get to the stage of thinking of the people— then we can realise just how much help we can give within this parliament.
