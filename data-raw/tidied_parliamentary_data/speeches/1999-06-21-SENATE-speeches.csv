"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—We seem to be engaged in a bit of changing of the agenda of business this afternoon, dropping off the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Bill and moving straight to the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill. Would the minister care to give an explanation to the chamber as to why that change of order has occurred?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—It is simply because it is, I think, the most critical piece of legislation in terms of the total package. We would like to see the matter dealt with as a matter of priority. Notice has been given to other parties in the Senate. I understood that it was not a matter of contention. By prioritising, the 
 government is taking the view that this is by far the most important measure. The others are clearly of significance and will be debated in due course. But the sale bill is the one upon which everything else turns.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I accept those comments by the minister. If consideration of the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill is concluded today or tomorrow, does the government intend to move straight away to resolve the other four bills in the package, or will they be adjourned to a later time?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—No, we would simply proceed through. In other words, we would like to see the total package passing through the chamber as expeditiously as possible. I would hope that that might even occur before the close of business tonight. I am sure, with the cooperation that has been forthcoming to date at various stages, we should be able to accomplish that—unless, of course, other people feel the need to get a bit of verbal exercise. But I am sure that that is not the case. Therefore, I remain very hopeful.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998
The bill.
—The question now before the chair is that the bill stand as printed. A running sheet has been circulated in the chamber. Senator Margetts, the first item is your Greens (WA) amendment No. 4 on sheet 1267 to insert an item on page 4 of the bill.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-06-21,"—I wish the communications had been a little better. I entered the chamber prepared to speak to the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Bill. That is why I am left flat-footed at the moment in relation to Greens (WA) amendment No. 4. I would like to talk briefly about almost anything at all until my briefing notes arrive. The minister said he thought this matter was uncontentious, but it would have 
 been nice had we had a few phone calls to adjust this.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—I apologise if all parties, including the Greens, were not advised in advance of the government's intention. It was certainly my understanding that they would be and had been. Given that there are amendments in the name of the Australian Democrats that could be dealt with while Senator Margetts is waiting for her papers to arrive, perhaps it would be convenient to take those first and then come back to the two Greens amendments.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—On behalf of the opposition, we have a number of comments on this rather critical bill that we want to place on the record. I was going to suggest to Senator Margetts that we take the opportunity to make our comments now until she gets her notes from her adviser.
—It is appropriate that you speak because the question before the chair is that the bill stand as printed. You may wish to speak on general issues.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—Thank you. I take it Senator Margetts is happy with that. Greens (WA) amendment No. 4 is the first amendment to be discussed in respect of the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998 . The opposition wishes to place a few remarks on the record concerning our approach to this bill. The opposition is opposed to the bill and will divide on its passage at the appropriate time. The opposition is opposed to any amendment that seeks to allow the sale of one more share of the Telstra Corporation. We have opposed the sale of Telstra in three successive elections and that is both common and public knowledge. In this debate today, and tomorrow if it proceeds, we will again follow that election commitment, both in spirit and in intent, by opposing any further sale of parts of or the whole of Telstra.
As the minister indicated at the outset, this bill is the most significant of the five bills in the package under discussion in the chamber. 
 This bill authorises the sale of Telstra and privatises an essential part of Australia's national infrastructure. This bill contains provisions which will enable 16 per cent of Telstra to be sold, an inquiry to be held and, subject to the findings of that inquiry, the balance of Telstra—the other 51 per cent—also to be sold in due course. As was indicated the last time we discussed the Telstra package of bills, we are coming to the point of no return. If this bill is passed, it is inevitable that in due course Telstra will go into full private ownership.
The device of holding an inquiry is fundamentally flawed and can and will lead to only one conclusion. An inquiry will not result in proper public scrutiny, proper public review and proper public consideration of the worth or otherwise of the sale of the outstanding 51 per cent of Telstra. According to the bill before the chamber, that inquiry can be a private inquiry. There is no need for public testing, public scrutiny or public examination of the submissions. There are no criteria or guidelines laid down in the bill for how that private inquiry will conduct itself. It is simply a device to get over the objection of the National Party and achieve full private ownership of Telstra.
So we arrive at the point of no return and it is only proper to briefly summarise the reasons for our continuing opposition to the sale of Telstra. Three points can be made in that regard—three critical points which have guided our internal forums and deliberations in this process. Those three reasons are on the record. They were addressed in my speech in the second reading debate and in the concluding remarks made by Senator Cook. There have been numerous press releases put out by the shadow minister for communications and the Leader of the Opposition and they are contained in the platform of our party. What are those reasons?
Firstly, we say that Telstra is a fundamental part of Australia's infrastructure. It needs to be in public hands. Putting it in full private ownership removes from our nation the ability to build on this most critical part of our infrastructure as we move into the new technologies and the new information processes 
 of the next millennia. Secondly, since one-third privatisation of Telstra, various reviews have been conducted by a number of government agencies and they have all come to one conclusion: that service levels have fallen and will continue to fall over time, and that the state of Tasmania has been on the receiving end of the greatest continuing fall in those services by the Telstra organisation.
Our third reason for opposing this bill is that Telstra is a contributor to the national economy, both as an efficient telecommunications operation and as a payer of dividends to the national budget and to government. We believe this device of the government is a trick, it is a con. We are told that apparently there is a social bonus of $678 million, plus something in the order—released yesterday—of an additional $300 million to be allocated by the government. The government's rationale is to sell Telstra and allocate the social bonus as a community reward. The opposition has a different position. We say retain Telstra, keep the dividends of $1.8 billion every year for the foreseeable future. Build community infrastructure every year—not just once in select areas by allocation of a limited social bonus, but do it on a continuing basis. We say keep the golden goose, keep the dividend stream, keep building the Australian community. The savings on interest are not worth the sale of the assets.
Let me develop each of those arguments: the importance of keeping our national infrastructure as represented by Telstra in public hands; the importance of improving service standards and not reducing them, as happens time and time again when government utilities are privatised; and the importance of keeping in perpetuity a reward for business for the bush, for rural and regional Australia, instead of a miserable one-off bribe. Turning to the first argument, consider only the significance to industry of the commercial activities of the nation, the ongoing growth of an efficient telco providing needed services. In addition to that necessary growth, the opposition also identifies the human element of Telstra, not as a profit taker but in its role of bringing families and communities together. It is fundamental to the social intercourse of our 
 nation. If it is in private hands, service will not be the guiding ethic. The guiding ethic will be private return.
What is the proof of the allegation in respect of service levels? I refer to a number of government reports since December last year which have examined the provision of service by Telstra. In December the ACA identified a number of disparities. On the provision of new services it says that Telstra's performance in remote areas is down an average of 16.8 per cent on performance in metropolitan areas. So rural services are significantly below those of metropolitan areas. On fault clearance within one working day, performance in remote areas is down an average of 17.2 per cent on performance in metropolitan areas. On fault clearance within two working days, performance in remote areas is down an average of 16 per cent on performance in metropolitan areas. The average number of hours to clear a fault in country areas is almost 57 hours, whilst in the cities it is 27 hours.
The ACA's Telecommunications performance report 1997-98 identifies a high rate of fault repair and provision of service complaints from Telstra's residential customers. Almost 50,000 Telstra customers had reason to complain to Telstra in the June quarter. Eighty per cent of these were residential customers. Again, in late March of this year—barely three months ago—the Australian Communications Authority's Telecommunications performance monitoring bulletin for the December 1998 quarter showed a six percentage point decline nationally for new services to major rural areas and a 24 per cent decline for Tasmania. Again, in late March, the ACA findings in the Telecommunications performance monitoring bulletin painted a damning picture of declining Telstra service delivery in rural and regional Australia. Among its findings, the ACA revealed a six per cent decline nationally for new services to major rural areas, which includes a 24 per cent decline for Tasmania, as well as an 11-hour increase in the average time for payphone fault clearance in Tasmania and a 10 per cent point decline in fault repair times for Tasmania. 
So it is not just an assertion by the opposition that, when major utilities are put into private hands or partially privatised, service performance levels decline. The ACA, in its own monitoring, has looked at the empirical evidence and put in black and white that service levels are declining, have declined since the first one-third of Telstra was sold off and are not improving at all. The decline in services is no surprise because we have an inherent contradiction between the private corporation using the system to maximise returns—exploiting the most profitable markets—and minimise gain to other carriers. The further privatisation necessarily increases that pressure on the bottom line and one method of achieving that system is to reduce labour costs and service levels.
Turning to our third point, the question of reward to the Australian community, many countries are facing issues of privatising telcos and utilities generally. It is occurring in western Europe and in many parts of the United States. It is normal to go down the path of seeking a cost benefit analysis to see whether there is ongoing benefit to the community through the transfer from public hands to private hands of a major utility. If you sell the asset, you no longer have any return to owners via dividends. If you keep the asset, you improve its performance, make it more efficient and the return to the shareholders can go up. The value of the ongoing dividend stream is almost $2 billion per year. The value of another 16 per cent sale of Telstra is around $16 billion to $17 billion on current market prices. The net proceeds are likely to be in the order of $15 billion to $16 billion after costs. The interest saving at current bond levels is only $890 million per year.
As was said some two or three weeks ago, on this simple calculation alone, dividends forgone through the sale of Telstra equal interest savings to governments in only 11 years. So, out of the 16 per cent sale of Telstra, the community receives only something in the order of $980 million: $671 million already outlined and $300 million outlined in the last 24 hours. Those dividends of $2 billion per year in a growth telco market are sacrifices for a mere 11 years of 
 interest savings plus the one-off social bonus. Even that bribe is fairly miserable. It spreads the benefit in five separate areas. Everyone thinks they are getting a slice of the pie, but it is a one-off slice only, directed particularly at one small state. Even the extra bonus of $300 million is not an additional cost to government, and I will return to that point later.
The general approach of the opposition to this bill is relatively simple. We will oppose every minor party amendment that seeks to improve the bill or make it more effective. We will support other amendments that are consistent with the opposition position of maintaining 66 per cent of Telstra in public hands. In this instance, we will support the deletion of schedule 3, which is the full sale, and the deletion of schedule 2, which is the sale of the next 16 per cent. Otherwise, the position of the opposition will be to oppose amendments from other parties that seek to improve or make more effective the passage of this bill.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-06-21,"—I thank Senator Bishop for speaking, thus enabling me to get my thoughts sorted and not look as incompetent as I did about 15 minutes ago. I move Greens (WA) amendment No. 4 on sheet 1267:
(4)	 Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 13), at the end of the Schedule, add:
7  At the end of subsection 8AE(1)
	 Add:
		 (g)	 substantially reduce services to regional and rural Australia;
		 (h)	 reduce the provision of emergency services.
I echo a number of the comments from Senator Bishop in relation to the sale of Telstra. The evidence that has been given over time in relation to this bill and the inquiries associated with it clearly show that what we have done already has not lived up to the government's promises. Therefore, how can we assume that things will not continue in the same direction—that is, in the wrong direction in terms of accountability, consumer services and the whole way the market is operating? 
Our amendment extends the reporting requirements to include notification of any reduction in service from rural or regional Australia or reduction in emergency services. This is a reasonable extension of the reporting requirements to cover the legitimate concerns that under a fully privatised Telstra or even a partially privatised Telstra there is a serious risk of undercutting rural and regional and emergency services.
In relation to rural and regional services, there has already been a steep service decline and reductions in employment. Over 17,000 jobs have been lost since partial privatisation, especially in rural and regional centres. Any significant reduction of services in a rural or regional centre is likely to have a major impact and is something that governments will have to plan for. It would be highly useful to know that in advance but, of course, under a privatised entity governments can then say it is not their doing.
In relation to emergency services, AAP reported that the manager of Telstra public safety, Ms Simpson, suggested in a response to a letter from ALP Senator Reynolds that Telstra may reduce its emergency role in the future. The response continued:
Telstra believes that the best provision of the emergency call service is to have callers answered by specialist emergency call takers who can provide immediate assistance to the caller.
That was written to Senator Reynolds in January. How does one translate `specialist emergency call takers'? My translation is that that is somewhere in a centralised office—maybe in one of the capital cities—where there is no local knowledge of the area involved. We know that in relation to emergency services that can mean the difference between life and death. `Specialist emergency call takers' is somebody's idea of economic efficiency where you allow for the fact that sometimes call takers in smaller regional areas are not available to take emergency calls all day. So it is more efficient to have a specialist taking emergency calls all day even if they do not know what to do with them when they get them. The letter to Senator Reynolds continued:
This is not the core business of Telstra. 

One can only ask: what is the core business of Telstra? Is it making money or enhancing profits—
—Non-core assets according to Senator Alston.
—Yes, non-core assets. The quote continues:
We will continue to work with all of those involved to identify ways to provide emergency services which may well see Telstra's role in the process reduced.
We know what is going to be happening at the end of the year to analog phones, and we know that that is definitely going to have an impact on emergency provision and on those who rely on their analog phones—and have done for a few years now—to have access to emergency services. Maybe the services were not available before people had analog phones but, funnily enough, people in rural and regional Australia do not actually like those services being taken from them once they have them.
The amendment requires that Telstra give written particulars of any reduction of their service standards in relation to emergency services and general services in rural and regional Australia. We think the amendment is reasonable. I gather from the signals coming from the opposition that this is not the kind of amendment they can support, because it might make the passage of the bill easier. I certainly do not support the passage of the bill, but I can see that it might save some lives if we manage to get support for this amendment.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-06-21,"—I want to echo the words of Senator Margetts in saying that we certainly do not support this bill either but we do think it is important—especially given the likelihood that there is going to be a sell-off of 16.6 per cent—to improve the bill. This amendment will do that. The effect of the amendment is to extend Telstra's reporting obligations to the minister. At present Telstra must notify the minister of certain significant events—for example, the acquisition or disposal of significant business. This amendment will require Telstra to notify the minister if it substantially reduces services to rural and regional Austral 
 ia and if it reduces the provision of emergency services. We support this amendment because it is consistent with our concern about the level of services provided to those in rural and regional areas and because we think any reduction in the provision of emergency services should be drawn to the minister's attention.
I must say it is disappointing to hear that the ALP do not intend to support this amendment or any others. As I said earlier, it has become clear that even without our support—and that was never a likelihood—at least a modified version of this bill will go through. So Labor can look to themselves and their support of both regional and rural Australia when they vote against this amendment.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I want to take up, for a very brief time, the gauntlet thrown down by both the Greens and the Democrats. The amendment does go to reporting obligations to the minister if services are reduced in rural and regional Australia or if emergency services in rural and regional Australia are reduced by Telstra. I am not going to repeat my earlier comments. I think it is fairly clear that changes in service levels, reductions in service levels in Tasmania and indeed in wide parts of our country have been occurring for the last 18 to 24 months. That is no secret and it is on the public record.
It is on the public record because, every quarter and every half, the ACA issues a monitoring review on the level of service carried out by Telstra and a range of other carrier providers—Optus and other competitors around Australia. Every quarter, the government, the opposition and the minor parties review those public reports, engage in discussion and debate here and pursue the issues that should be pursued in the various forums that are available to us, either in the various inquiries, in the estimates processes or through questions on notice.
The reason the opposition have highlighted this consistently for almost three years since the coalition came into government is that we have noted the declining level of services across the board—whether it be linesmen attending private homes in cities, linesmen 
 and technicians attending to problems in bush areas, or linesmen and technicians replacing services that break down because of natural occurrences. We said, when the first one-third was privatised, that service levels would decline.
We said that because we knew—from a range of academic literature, from our own intuition and from a range of reports that have been in the public domain on the efficient operation of telcos in the Western world—what happens when they are privatised or partly privatised. They have been privatised or partly privatised in Canada, parts of the US, the United Kingdom, right across Western Europe and in New Zealand. Without exception, when those dominant telco carriers were privatised and the government of the particular country reviewed the quality of operations of the new institution, service levels in each of those countries had declined. It was not a one-off decline, it declined gradually and continued to decline over time.
So, when the first one-third was privatised, we said then—and the relevant Senate committee at that time made a finding—that service levels would decline, and nothing in the last three years has changed that. You did not have to be a Rhodes scholar to figure out that one of the methods of increasing value in a corporation, maintaining a high dividend flow and returning an increasing proportion of that dividend flow to shareholders was to reduce costs. The obvious way to reduce costs is to reduce the composition and number of persons employed—that is, to directly reduce labour costs. It is a direct transfer from employees via the corporation to shareholders. It is out in the public domain that Telstra has an agreement and is in the process of implementing an agreement that something in the order of 20,000 or 25,000 employees will be, or have been, retrenched in a two-year period starting from this time last year. That is no big secret.
Now, 25,000 employees off the payroll is a huge labour cost saving. I acknowledge that they have not been sacked and thrown on the scrap heap. There has been a very generous redundancy payment made to each of those employees, and many of them have gone out 
 as independent contractors and have turned up in competitors or in other parts of the telecommunications industry. Nonetheless, the savings to Telstra have been dramatic, and the labour costs savings directly correlate to the reduction in services. It has been no secret. We predicted it. Overseas experience showed that it would happen. It was a finding of the Senate committee that this would happen, and it has occurred.
To have an amendment that the corporation advise the minister in writing of a substantial reduction in services strikes the opposition as stating the blindingly obvious. It is occurring. We know it is occurring. Employees tell us so every day of the week. At every estimates, the officials from Telstra do not hide the fact. It is government and Telstra policy to reduce labour costs, to reduce service levels and to transfer the gain to shareholders via dividend.
The amendment that has been circulated—whilst it has worthy intentions, and I do not quarrel with that—is in some respects a non sequitur. The best way, the only way, to turn around the ongoing decline in service levels is to oppose the sale of the next 16 per cent and the outstanding 51 per cent of Telstra. If that is achieved, Telstra can be directed by government to establish guidelines—which can be checked—to improve service levels, call-out times, fixing of fault times and new line times. These are relatively easy things to do, but those services can only be offered and made mandatory on an ongoing basis when the government of the day so directs Telstra. It can only do that effectively if the 66 per cent of Telstra remains in public hands.
As I said in my opening remarks, once you go to 49 per cent—33 plus 16—that is the end of the story. The gate is open. It will be virtually impossible to return Telstra into public hands. To seek to improve the bill is to give a tick to the government's intent. The government is not backward about saying that. It went to the people on it. It was not shy about it. It is its policy. But it is not the position of the Australian Labor Party to encourage or to give authority to continuing reductions in service levels by Telstra. We say that the best way that that can be avoided is for Telstra to remain in public hands.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—I might indicate the attitude of the government. I welcome Senator Bishop's acknowledgment that this amendment will not be supported by the opposition. In fact, I think it is quite right of Senator Bishop to point out the logical deficiency. If your aim is to actually stop any decrease in service, mere notification does not achieve that. What does achieve it, however, are the provisions that are already embedded in legislation, requiring adherence to universal service obligations and, of course, the customer service guarantee arrangements.
Irrespective of any change in ownership—and, indeed, under the current arrangements—Telstra could not significantly reduce regional and rural services without infringing against the universal service plan which it has to lodge. The minister is able to require Telstra to vary the plan if it even sought to significantly reduce those services. Therefore, there is no need to require Telstra in that regard. The current arrangements relate to the interests of the minister in his shareholder role—that is, in matters to do with changes in corporate strategy; it is not to do with service levels.
We do not accept the mythology that Senator Bishop and his colleagues seek to perpetuate: that privatisations around the world have inevitably been accompanied by reductions in quality of service. The US, for example, has never had publicly owned telcos—so there is no evidence that you can point to there—but has always had universal service obligations and universal service level arrangements. There is nothing to stop the parliament from tightening those requirements, as we did recently. It is now possible for the ACA to require a remedial direction under clause 118 of this bill and to seek to have court imposed penalties if directions are not complied with, so we think we have covered all of those bases.
Everyone knows that Mr Beazley was the very minister who promised Mr Blount that, if he came out and took the job as CEO of Telstra, the Labor Party would privatise the company. And why wouldn't they? As Cheryl 
 Kernot said, `I'm not worried about what Labor might do in opposition; it is what they might do in government that worries me.' And she is dead right, because we all know this is a strategy of convenience on the part of the Labor Party. The delivery of an effective 000 service, again, is simply not dependent upon the goodwill of Telstra; many other service providers have a role to play. The legislation does provide for emergency call service arrangements that meet community expectations in a multicarrier environment.
We already have arrangements in place to ensure that the ACA monitors industry-wide compliance, and it is incumbent on Telstra to inform the ACA of any proposed changes. Indeed, Senator Ian Campbell recently wrote to the ACA asking it to increase its 000 monitoring and reporting activities in the light of proposed Telstra changes and concerns about effective deployment of mobile location capabilities. The ACA is considering adding a formal requirement to the emergency call service determination. If the intention of this amendment is that Telstra should notify the minister whenever it proposes to close a depot, a work management centre or a store, not only would it be an inappropriate proposal but it would be unnecessary and a waste of time and effort for both the minister and for Telstra.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I have a number of questions to put to Senator Alston in relation to employment issues in regional Australia and, specifically, Tasmania. The first one I want to put to the minister is in relation to the package which was released yesterday. There was no mention in the package of a reorganisation or restructuring of Telstra in Tasmania—a commitment which I understood Senator Harradine had sought, particularly in relation to making Tasmania a single area and removing it from the Vic-Tas region. It has been reported in the media today that Senator Harradine holds out some hope that that may occur, so perhaps the minister could advise precisely what arrangements are in place for Telstra internally and in Tasmania and, secondly, what commitments have been given in relation to existing job levels.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—I thought this was already a matter of public record, but the fact is that Telstra has given an undertaking—and that certainly has been communicated to Senator Harradine—that its consumer and customer arrangements will involve a separate regional area for Tasmania. In other words, it will not be simply added on as part of regional Victoria, as it has been in the past, but it will be a separate and distinct statewide structure.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-06-21,"—What are the consequential impacts as a result of that? For example, we have lost the work management centre in Tasmania. Does this mean we are going to get it back as a result of the restructure? What are the consequential impacts of the restructuring, and what are the staff impacts in terms of employee levels?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—It will not change the formal requirements, but it will mean that Telstra will have to consider Tasmania as a whole and not simply as an appendage of Victoria. Part of the criticism which Senator Harradine has consistently made is that, if it is simply seen as part of regional Victoria, then there is much more of an inclination to centralise services in Victoria rather than to look at Tasmania on a statewide basis. Otherwise, these are operational matters. The important thing is that what is put before the CEO is a Tasmanian perspective, not a Greater Victoria perspective. On that basis, there will be every opportunity for a dedicated proposition to be put forward representing Tasmania's interests rather than Greater Victoria's interests.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-06-21,"—Minister, I am still not sure exactly what is meant by the Telstra commitment or your commitment in relation to Tasmania becoming a single region or a single area. What practical effect does that have? Perhaps you could seek advice from Telstra officials.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—It is not a matter of seeking advice from Telstra officials; it is a matter of the internal structure of Telstra. Until now, Telstra has treated each state separately, with the exception that it has treated Tasmania—commercial and consumer—as part of regional Victoria. This undertaking involves reverting to a situation where Tasmania stands on its own feet. It has someone in charge with that statewide perspective only and able to argue the case for Tasmania. I think that is what Senator Harradine and others have sought—that instead of seeing Tasmania simply as part of Greater Victoria, it is seen as having its own stand-alone arrangement. Therefore, it gives Tasmania a much greater opportunity to argue its case on its merits rather than being treated as part of a perhaps more efficient overall viewpoint. It gives Tasmania the standing that would equate it with all other states. No other state is treated any differently as a result of this arrangement. They all now have the opportunity to argue a statewide case.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-06-21,"—Other than being able to forcefully put its case and having, presumably, a state manager, I am still at a loss to know precisely what it means structurally to Tasmania in terms of additional services or additional staff. While I am on my feet, Minister, I will ask you another couple of questions to which I have not been able to get a response to date. Hopefully, you would be aware of correspondence that I sent you on 26 March in which I asked a number of questions in relation to staffing in Tasmania. I understand that the state government has also asked a number of questions and, similarly, has not got a response. Firstly, how many full-time equivalent staff are currently employed in Tasmania?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—I cannot give you the answer off the top of my head, but I can make some inquiries. It is not my understanding that the state government has sought answers to these questions. I am aware of your correspondence and I can get you the detail on that, but not immediately.
As far as the other issue is concerned, I cannot say any more other than what was sought was a separate, stand-alone arrangement for each state and that Tasmania not be treated differently. It is not treated differently now under this new regime. Commercial and consumer for Tasmania is the same as for any other state. That does not mean that there are any necessary employment or other consequences for Tasmania, nor for any of the other states. It is simply an operational management approach that provides the opportunity for each state to argue its own case rather than simply having to put in a submission to Victoria and hope that somehow Tasmania's views are taken fully into account. I can understand the argument that, inevitably, they would be downgraded if they were part of someone else's bailiwick.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-06-21,"—So, in terms of the proposal that has been put to Senator Harradine, you are saying that it does not necessarily have any operational or employment effect? That is what I understand you to say, but I am not quite sure precisely what being a `separate area' means if that is the case, other then being able to articulate your case more directly to Dr Switkowski rather than having to go via the Victorian manager. So if it has no operational effect and it has no employment effect, it seems a bit of a chimera in terms of any commitment given in relation to the package.
On the second issue, Minister, I am stunned that you need to seek further advice in relation to correspondence that was sent to you about three months ago in relation to staffing levels in Tasmania. Firstly, I ask you to reconsider your initial comments. Are you sure that it has no operational or employment significance in terms of Tasmania? If it does, what are they? Secondly, is it the case or not that since 1996 the decline in full-time employees in Tasmania has been of the order of 350? We have asked you this question many times, but we have not got a response in estimates hearings, to questions on notice or from direct correspondence to you, so I am seeking this opportunity to find out precisely what the status of staffing in Tasmania is. You have had these questions since 26 March.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-06-21,"—I have listened to what the minister said, and I did not hear him say that there would be no operational staffing implication of the decision of Telstra with regard to the manager of Tasmania. This was a decision made by Telstra. It was a decision conveyed to me, at all events, in writing by the Chief Executive Officer of Telstra. In fact, this will not be a chimera. Senator Mackay is making assumptions which are not there. You are putting words into the minister's mouth that I at least did not hear him say. I do not think that is appropriate in the committee stage of a debate, nor, indeed, in the second reading stage. With regard to that particular position, it will recognise Tasmania as a separate entity in that particular area—a major area—rather than as a Victorian country region. In addition to the appointment of that manager, there will be a support team of at least five people for that particular operation; and that has been conveyed to me by Telstra.
I am interested to hear Senator Mackay asking questions about employment in Tasmania. She ought to know—and I ask her to get up and deny this—that, in respect of job adjustments and job losses, other states have fared much worse than Tasmania in actual terms and in percentage terms over the last three or four years, despite the fact that a decline was commencing even then. I ask her to get up and deny that. She has not had any hand in trying to protect the jobs of Tasmanians in Telstra itself. In fact, she is part of an organisation, the Labor Party, which supported very strongly the deregulation of the industry.
I had independent advice given to me. I asked what was causing the effect on employment in Telstra in mainland states of Australia and in Tasmania. In summary, the response was:
. Telecommunications is a very high growth industry.
. While its services are very capital intensive, the companies involved (particularly Telstra) are significant employers.
. But as the industry becomes more capital intensive (eg through the elimination of manual exchanges and reduced dependence on the traditional copper wire infrastructure) it is to be 
 expected that employment growth will ease or actually decline.
. Easing off in Telstra's employment growth since 1996 is a response to deregulation to the extent that Telstra has lost market share in the long-distance markets.
. Too early to say what impact privatisation has had on Telstra employment, but the predominant influences on Telstra employment have been the impact of deregulation and the labour shedding effects of technological change.
Forget about all of the argument that Senator Mackay has been carrying on with in Tasmania. Let her face the facts—and those are the facts. The independent advice that I have received was that the predominant reasons for job losses are the deregulatory environment, the new players coming into the field, together with advances in technological change. I think we have to face the situation realistically. In those circumstances, you have to try to look at the area where you are best suited. Those areas have been identified, and there has been considerable work done on getting alternative job opportunities within Telstra as well as outside Telstra for persons in the communications industry.
I am not here to talk much about what has transpired over the last few months with respect to negotiations. All I do say is that I acknowledge that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has had a considerable interest in what happens in regional and rural Australia and, particularly, he has a great interest in the state of Tasmania. But in pursuing that interest, the minister has not disadvantaged other areas within Australia. In fact, I pay credit to him for bumping up the social bonus from $671 million to $1 billion. I think that is an action that the minister took having regard to the importance that he and indeed his government place on rural and regional Australia in the area of communications. I am aware of the Prime Minister's view and the views of a number of ministers, including the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, on this.
I would also like to place on record my appreciation of the work done by Telstra and various government departments—both federal and state, Senator Mackay. I believe that the considerable amount of work that this 
 involved has resulted in a substantial improvement on what we were first faced with in this chamber in the bill that is currently before us.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-06-21,"—The first point I would make in response to Senator Harradine is that it is not me that is voting for a further 16 per cent sell down of Telstra, nor was it the Labor Party that supported the one-third sale in relation to the first tranche. In terms of Tasmanian employment, a number of Tasmanian federal and state members and, in fact, some members on the opposition had a lot to do with attempting to retain, for example, the work management centre.
It is impossible for me to either confirm or deny what Senator Harradine is asserting because, unlike Senator Harradine, we have not been able to get the information. He may have independent advice. I have certainly never seen that. I do not know where it came from. We have sought information from the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts on many occasions going to precisely the matters that Senator Harradine has raised. It is not on for him to get to his feet and demand that the opposition deny or confirm information when we have not been allowed access to that information. We have in fact attempted, even through Telstra's government liaison department, to get that information.
As I indicated, in absolute desperation the opposition wrote to Minister Alston on 26 March posing a series of questions, attempting to get answers to the sort of thing that Senator Harradine is alluding to. Let me tell you some of the questions that we asked, which we have not got a response to—but here we are being lambasted by Senator Harradine for daring to question the orthodoxy when we do not have any information on which to base any analysis. Let me put on the record a couple of the questions that we asked Senator Alston which he found so difficult that to date he has been unable to respond. They include really tough stuff like how many full-time equivalent staff Telstra currently employs in Tasmania. I would have thought the minister for communications might have known that 
 one. A second one asks for provision of a breakdown of the current full-time, part-time and casual Telstra employment figures in Tasmania by location and by function—not a difficult one if you are the minister for communications, I would have thought. We also asked for a breakdown of full-time, part-time and casual Telstra employment figures in Tasmania by location and by function as at March 1996.
The opposition was attempting to determine whether or not Senator Harradine is correct in his assertion that job losses occurred as a result of the deregulation and to determine what has in fact happened since this government came into power in 1996. We do know, Senator Harradine, and so do you, that a substantial proportion of the job shedding in Telstra happened prior to the first tranche sale, in preparation for the first tranche sale. I know that that is certainly the view of the people on the ground in Tasmania. So it is a bit rich to get up in here and say to the opposition that we are not admitting one particular thing when we have made strenuous attempts to get precisely the information that Senator Harradine is referring to, and we are still in the dark. We still do not have these answers. I am sure Senator Alston would be quite grateful to Senator Harradine for at least providing some illumination in relation to some of the employment consequences of the one area proposal. At least we know now that there is going to be a manager and at least we know now that there are going to be five support staff for that manager. That is good; at least we know that. But in relation to the rest of it, if that is all there is, let us hear that, Minister. But if there is more, we would like to know the answers.
I say again that we have put a number of propositions to you. This is the committee stage in relation to the privatisation of this instrumentality, and the parliament and the people of Tasmania now deserve answers, including answers to correspondence that has remained unanswered for three months. So I ask those questions again.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—I note with interest that 
 Senator Mackay did not respond to several matters that Senator Harradine put on the record. They were, in particular, that Senator Mackay had not tried to protect jobs in Telstra in Tasmania and that she belongs to an organisation which supported the deregulation of the industry. I take her non-denial as quite significant in that context.
I think the more important issue is that we are here debating the merits or otherwise of further privatisation of Telstra. Senator Mackay knows full well that the reduction in employment levels has been an ongoing issue for many years. In fact, back in the early 1990s Telstra had something like 93,000 employees. Well before 1996—I think it was probably about 1994—they set a target of something like 55,000, and they are on track to meet that. The reason they did it was that by independent assessments they were something like 30 per cent off world's best practice, by any of the conventional measures, whether it was the lines per employee or revenue per employee. Telstra, like anyone else who has been corporatised, as Telstra were by Mr Beazley when he was the minister for communications in 1991, are required to operate as efficiently as possible. Like any other corporation, if they are padded and they have inefficiencies in the system, they have an obligation to shareholders to correct those. To the extent that they are required to meet other legislative obligations such as a universal service requirement or customer service guarantee levels or anything else, they have to have those in mind before they proceed with any reductions.
The fact is, of course, that to ask a question about March 1996 is simply to pick a date of convenience which ignores the reality that reductions in employment in Telstra have been ongoing and precede 1996. In fact, Senator Mackay said that; she said that much of the job reductions occurred before the first tranche. But, of course, you like to say that was in preparation for it. It was not in preparation for it at all, and you well know it. Telstra did not know that we were going to win the 1996 election, presumably. They might have had every reason to think that if you won it you would privatise Telstra, but 
 they did not recognise the extent to which Mr Beazley would welsh on his promise.
The fact remains that this has been a growth industry. The communications sector has been growing at something like three times the rate of GNP. There are other carriers who have come into the marketplace in Tasmania. Optus and Vodafone have both been very active there. Indeed, as Senator Mackay would well know, the recently announced Vodafone call centre in Hobart will provide something in the order of 450 jobs in the not too distant future and I think there is a target of close to 700.
—Full time, part time or casual?
—Again, it is convenient for you to characterise call centres as sweatshops, because that is the union line. They obviously resent the fact that a lot of these people are not particularly inclined to take up union membership. Of course, they are not Robinson Crusoe in that regard. It is happening across the board. The fact is that many more jobs have been created in the wider communications sector, so the mere fact that jobs might flow out of Telstra does not mean anything. It simply means that Telstra has become more efficient. Those people may well be taken up in other sectors of the industry and overall job levels in communications may well be rising. So to take a selective snapshot of Telstra's employment tells you absolutely nothing about whether the citizens of Tasmania are better served as a result of that restructuring.
I think I heard Senator Mackay allege that since 1996 there has been a decline of about 350 jobs. That figure is certainly quite inaccurate. I do not know where she gets it from. It is quite irresponsible to get up and quote a figure without any supporting evidence.
—Give us the information, then.
—I can assure you that it is much less than that. I think it is also valid to point to the fact that job losses in Tasmania have been less, as Senator Harradine rightly said, both in actual and percentage terms, than in other states. Again, 
 what is the conceivable relevance of taking that statistic in isolation other than to run your ideological line or simply to filibuster on this legislation?
In relation to the matter of a separate Tasmanian C and C service region, I did receive a letter from Dr Switkowski, Chief Executive Officer of Telstra, dated 24 May. He pointed out to me that Telstra was prepared to give certain commitments. These initiatives were premised on there being a further dilution of government ownership in Telstra and the successful passage of the necessary legislation by 30 June. He did say:
I can also confirm that Telstra will set up a separate Tasmanian C and C service region on par with the other states and separated from the current Vic-Tas region, and as a result a new position of Regional General Manager, reporting to the Managing Director of C and C Service, will be created. There will be five additional staff needed to provide support to the new structure, and these positions will be located in Hobart along with the RGM.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-06-21,"—It is a bit ordinary for the minister to come in here and lambast the opposition for making assertions when he has continually refused to provide this information so that we can make an informed judgment for ourselves. I ask the minister to table two things: first of all the correspondence from Dr Switkowski that he was reading from; and, secondly, the information that we seek. I would ask him to table whatever information he has got.
Minister, if you can assert that the full-time job losses in Tasmania are substantially less than 350, why don't you table the information from which you are making that assertion? It is not good enough to come in here and lambast us when you will not provide us with that information. What the opposition would like is that information for the whole of Australia, state by state, before we proceed in relation to this. It is not good enough.
I would like to ask you another very specific question, Minister, whilst you are hopefully getting that information for us. We understand that there are some proposals in Tasmania, specifically in relation to the field jobs. There have been rumours in Telstra—and I would like you to make sure that they are denied 
 here and now—that somewhere in the vicinity of 30 field jobs in the north of Tasmania and 30 field jobs in the south of Tasmania have been earmarked for redundancy after 30 June this year. Can you please advise the opposition whether that is correct or whether those jobs will be retained?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—I will not table the letter from Dr Switkowski to me. I certainly find it odd in the extreme that Senator Mackay thinks she can demand statistics without attempting to support a figure which she puts on the table and which, as far as I am aware, has absolutely no bearing on reality. If you think you can get up and allege a figure without any supporting evidence, I do not see why—
—You tell me I am wrong.
—I do tell you you are wrong.
—Give me the information, then.
—That will not assist me in knowing how you arrived at your figure. This is a very clumsy charade, because we know that you are not in the slightest bit interested in anything to do with employment levels. You have made up your mind. You are going to vote this legislation down and, quite clearly, you are going to take as long as possible to get yourself into that very awkward position. I have no doubt at all that none of this information is designed to do anything other than string out the debate for as long as you possibly can.
I am not aware of rumours that Telstra has earmarked certain field jobs for redundancy. Once again, if you want to pursue this with Telstra, you should do it. I am not the minister for rumours about Telstra; I am the minister trying to get legislation relating to privatisation through the parliament. If you have some bone to pick with Telstra, or one of your union conduits has got some information, you ought to do your job properly. Write to Telstra and ask them to elaborate on it, instead of just storing it up as distractive 
 ammunition for a debate which has absolutely nothing to do with the issues that you are trying to pursue.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-06-21,"—I would like to follow up a question in relation to the information that is being asked for by the ALP, which has still not been provided by way of this debate. I wonder whether in the guidelines for a minister it says that you provide information based on whether or not you think the person who is asking the question—the member of parliament who is representing their electors—agrees with your position on that portfolio area. Is that part of the guidelines? Or is there are another reason perhaps for your not providing this information about the current employment levels and positions within Telstra?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—As I have said, the fact is that Senator Mackay thinks she can come in  here and make sweeping statements about the levels of jobs. I will give you the figures: 1,376 jobs in February 1999 and 1,497 in March 1996—121 is the difference. Now I would like you in return to explain the basis for your claim of 350.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-06-21,"—Thank you for that, Minister. I would now like those figures disaggregated, please, by full time, part time and casual. Thank you.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—There is a whole swag of statistics that could be provided to Senator Mackay. No doubt she could spend many hours seeking this information, but I say again that it has absolutely nothing to do with the merits of this legislation, because the Labor Party has taken a tactical decision—not on the merits, of course—to simply vote against it, come what may. This information is not relevant to this debate at all, other than that it provides you with a basis for stalling the inevitable. I do not see any basis on which we should be required to provide endless detail about matters which simply do not go to the merits of this debate. Given that we are currently debating a Green amendment in 
 relation to whether or not we should include in section 8AE(1) of the Telstra Corporation Act—
—Whether or not services are going to be reduced.
—What?
—It is about whether or not there is going to be a reduction in services.
—I have not heard a word said by Senator Mackay about whether we ought to include a requirement that the minister be notified about proposals to substantially reduce services. I have not heard a word from Senator Mackay about my response which points out that there are legislative obligations imposed on Telstra, that there are universal service plans that Telstra has to comply with, that there are CSG arrangements and that there are ACA abilities to give directions. I do not know whether Senator Mackay takes the view that they are not tight enough or that they should be tightened or where she thinks this amendment would take her if the minister was simply notified but then ignored that information. In other words, the merits of this amendment are not being addressed in any shape or form by Senator Mackay. What we have here is a very slow trawling exercise which can have no other purpose than to delay the passage of this legislation. If she was fair dinkum about this she would debate the merits of it.
Senator Bishop has already indicated that Labor is opposed to this amendment, so I do not know why Senator Mackay thinks that what she is asking has anything to do with the amendment. On that basis, the government takes the view that this is utterly irrelevant to the matters under discussion.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-06-21,"—Clearly it is not, because the amendment goes to the level of services in regional Australia, the adequacy of reporting mechanisms and the inadequacy or incompetence of the minister in terms of providing information to anybody in relation to staffing levels. Minister, while we are on this, you said that you were not aware that some 60 field jobs in Tasmania had been earmarked for redundancy 
 post 30 June 1999. Can you please confer with Telstra and establish whether that is the case? If you are not prepared to, we will have to pursue that through other avenues. I guess we will have to wait until next Thursday to see whether those jobs actually go.
While you are doing that, can you also please ensure that Telstra has no intention to jeopardise approximately 30 jobs in the data purity area, which is staffed in both the north and the south of the state? We understand that there has been suggestions by Telstra management that the functions and jobs associated with this area should be transferred to a central site in Melbourne, but here again action will be delayed until after the magic date—30 June.
There are two issues that I want confirmed: firstly, that the 60 jobs in the field area are not in jeopardy, irrespective of the date of 30 June; and, secondly, that the 30-odd jobs in relation to the data purity area are also not in jeopardy of redundancy post 30 June. If you get up, as you probably will, and say that that is a matter for Telstra, that you do not know and how on earth are you, as the mere minister for communications, expected to actually have answers to these questions then I have to say, Minister, your entire arrangement with Senator Harradine is questionable, to say the least. Either you know this information or you do not. If you do not know the information, that is fine, but you as minister for communications ought to be able to give me, as a senator for Tasmania—there are a number of senators for Tasmania here—an assurance that those jobs are not in jeopardy. I want responses to those two questions: 60 field jobs and 30 jobs in the data purity area.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—I can see two senators from Tasmania in the chamber.
—I meant in the Senate, not actually here in the chamber.
—That is an interesting statement of the blindingly obvious. It does not follow from that that any other senators have these concerns. If they did, and if they were acting as serious constituent representatives, do you know what they would have 
 done? They would have pursued them with Telstra long ago. They would not have just said, `Righto, I'll put them in the back pocket, throw them in a folder and wait till we resume and then I'll trot them out in the debate,' without, of course, even giving the minister some opportunity in advance, knowing full well that he would not be privy to operational decisions or, as you would put it, `suggestions'—that is what we are talking about. The first is `rumours' and the second is `suggestions'. Why on earth you would expect a minister to be aware of rumours or suggestions, I do not know.
If you were fair dinkum you would have approached my office and asked me in advance to pursue it. I do not think even that would have been particularly appropriate. The fact is you are either too lazy or strategically not interested in pursuing these matters except in the context of delaying this debate. If you want to pursue those matters with Telstra you are perfectly at liberty to do so, but it is certainly not my position to be responding on the run in the context of a debate about whether we should include in a section of the act an additional requirement relating to notification. The matters that you are canvassing have absolutely nothing to do with that. You have no opinion on the subject, so it would seem. All you are interested in is red herrings that do not go to the amendment and are therefore out of order.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I have a question arising out of some of the earlier remarks Senator Mackay made with respect to the establishment of a separate C and C in Tasmania, the result, I understand, of some negotiations between the government and Senator Harradine. In my earlier remarks I made reference to how material and statistics for service standards are collated and published in the bulletin by the ACA every quarter. In your response to Senator Mackay you read from correspondence from the CEO, who indicated that a separate management structure for C and C would be established in Tasmania, that there would be a separate regional general manager placed down there 
 and that an additional five persons would be working in the C and C in Tasmania.
My question goes to the collection of statistics in those quarterly ACA bulletins. Is it the intention that those statistics in Tasmania be collated on the same basis as in every other state—that is, with a three part break-up into metro, regional and remote? Will that same break-up of statistics be applied to Tasmania or will a separate method of collation of statistics for Tasmania be part of the system?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—I am not aware of the precise basis on which the ACA compiles its quarterly quality of service reports or bulletins but I do not see that it would necessarily have any relationship to an organisational decision made by Telstra. In other words, to the extent that the ACA wants to keep records of Tasmania as a separate state then it would already be doing that. This might indeed facilitate that but I do not see, if the ACA were minded to have Tasmania-wide stats, that it could not ask for them and be already using them. So, although I do not have an example of the way in which those statistics are provided, I would be very surprised if this particular decision would make much difference to the ACA. If it wants information on a certain basis, it can require that to be made available.
—The question is that Greens (WA) amendment No. 4 be agreed to.
Question resolved in the negative.
—On schedule 2 we have an amendment from the Greens (WA).",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-06-21,"—Madam Temporary Chair, this goes to the heart of the issue of whether or not we are going to be moving towards the sale of a further 16.6 per cent of Telstra. We had some most extraordinary statements from the minister which it would be interesting to compare with the statements he made, when we were dealing with the sale of the first tranche of Telstra, indicating how ridiculous 
 it would be if people asked questions in the future about what was going on in Telstra and he could not respond, considering that the government had majority ownership. And he has just proven his own point back then, that he actually indicated to the Senate it would be ridiculous if the government did not have some say over the way telecommunications were provided in Australia. The most basic of information, he says, is too difficult because he does not want to provide it and it is something that can only be given by Telstra.
Our amendment removes the sale provisions relating to the further 16.6 per cent on the basis that the Greens are opposed to any further sale of Telstra. But we are fully supportive of the measures to improve customer standards. Consequently, we are supportive of the elements that amalgamate customer service standards. The opposition to the further sale of Telstra is mounting from all fronts. Firstly, under competition, 10 groups including all other major telcos—Cable and Wireless, Optus, AAPT, Macquarie Corporate, Global One, One.Tel, Powertel, Primus, MCI-Worldcom, World Change and BT Australia—have warned that the further sale will exacerbate Telstra's already aggressive and anticompetitive behaviour. That is funny; I thought we were going into markets. We are warned that the market is nowhere near competitive and that market regulation is required to put a brake on this huge near-monopoly exerting immense market power. But of course, in order to make the sale more attractive to possible buyers and shareholders, the government removed a lot of the protections, so instead of re-regulating they removed a lot of regulations.
In terms of economic arguments, there is Telstra's record of recording huge profits. In the six months ending 31 December, it made another record profit of $1.8 billion—12.2 per cent up on the previous corresponding period—and that is even more reason to keep it in public hands so that all Australians can share in these profits and the dividends can be applied to social and environmental programs benefiting all Australians. And with social and customer services, the decline in service since the partial privatisation is, of course, very 
 well documented. It does not take a rocket scientist to work out that this situation is likely to be exacerbated by privatising Telstra in the absence of a highly competitive environment. So the question is: did the government's assertions about the first part of the privatisation come true about our unnecessary fears? Quite frankly, if anything, I suppose our fears were not as bad as they ought to have been.
The Greens (WA) are opposing part of schedule 2 as set out at (5) on sheet 1267:
(5)	 Schedule 2, page 5 (line 2) to page 31 (line 31), TO BE OPPOSED .
Quite frankly, the government's promises, assertions and so on have not come to fruition. This is something that affects all Australia. It is not a matter of little packages for particular areas of Australia; it is about the quality of telecommunications, the quality and ongoing quality of regional and rural Australia's life, and it is about whether or not the government's assurances are worth the paper they are written on. Like last time, it quite clearly does not appear that they are. Therefore, why should the Senate give the government the benefit of the doubt twice when the evidence manifestly has indicated that their reassurances have not been delivered in relation to the last sale of Telstra? So I would seek the support of the chamber in relation to this. I hope the indications that were given earlier by Senator Bishop extend to support for this amendment.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-06-21,"—I want to indicate that the Democrats will not be supporting this amendment. The amendment opposes all of the provisions relating to the sale of a further 16.6 per cent of Telstra, and we do not support this amendment. The reason is that the amendment will delete all of the provisions relating to the social bonus. We take the view that the social bonus is by no means going to solve all of the problems in terms of telecommunications for rural and remote areas but it is a start. So we agree with the opposition to the sale of any more of the government's interest in Telstra but we believe that a social bonus should be paid and that it should be paid out of the dividend 
 stream that the government receives from Telstra.
The Democrats are very concerned about communications in regional and rural Australia and we would like to see a systematic program of upgrading services, governed by a well-planned strategy to as closely as possible reach equality of services between rural Australia and cities. Consequently, we do not think that the social bonus program is ideal—and there are a number of questions that I want to put to the minister about that program—but again it is a start. The next amendment is the Democrat amendment that opposes the further 16.6 per cent sale but which will retain the social bonus and pay that $670 million out of dividends.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-06-21,"—My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. Can the Assistant Treasurer confirm that the government's amendments to its GST legislation to reflect the deal that was done with the Democrats 24 days ago are being shown to the Democrats only today? When does the government propose to share these amendments with the other parties who will be required to debate them? How does the government expect the Senate to debate its GST deal with the Democrats tomorrow—when the bills are listed for debate—when we have yet to see the fine print?

When is the government going to show this chamber the courtesy of tabling those amendments so we can see them and participate in that debate tomorrow? Is the Assistant Treasurer aware that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Campbell, has been ranting in the media this morning about the Senate filibustering and delaying the GST legislation and threatening to use the guillotine?

As the question rolled on and on, it was apparent to me and to others that, coming from Labor Party, it was simply not a serious question. The Labor Party could not care less about the amendments that are coming through because, no matter what those amendments are, the Labor Party will oppose them. It is not the 
 slightest bit interested in the amendments coming forward. Senator Cook, you had your chance to take part in the great project of tax reform in this country. The Labor Party turned its back on tax reform. The Labor Party is completely irrelevant in this whole debate.

Senator Campbell has pointed out on many occasions that the debate on the tax bills is among the longest debates we have had in this chamber. From memory, the debate has stretched over 40 hours already.
—I rise on a point of order, Madam President. You would be aware that Senator Cook asked Minister Kemp if he could outline to the Senate when the amendments would be circulated. He asked it again in the supplementary question. I wonder if you could direct him to try to answer the question.
—I draw your attention to the question asked, Senator Kemp.

The answer read as follows—
Senator Brown asked Senator Vanstone, without notice, on 13 May 1999:
I refer to the potential for a Senate reference to the High Court being required to determine whether Senator-elect Heather Hill has been validly elected. Has the government sought advice on this matter? If so, what are the details? . . . Will the government support my bill for a referendum to amend section 44 of the Constitution, which bans up to five million Australians from standing for parliament? If so, will it do so in time to have a referendum on that matter on 6 November?
Senator Vanstone advised that she would ask the Attorney-General if he has sought any advice on the matter and if he wants to comment on it.
Senator Vanstone—I advise the honourable Senator that I have consulted the Attorney-General. I respond that it has been the general practice of successive governments not to disclose whether specific legal advice has been provided to government for the purpose of making specific government decisions or for the purpose of developing government policy, nor to make available any such legal advice.
In relation to the s.44 issue, I answered the honourable Senator's question relating to his bill. However, I note that the referendums to be held later this year on a change to a republic system of government and a new preamble raise issues of great importance. The Government is taking steps to ensure the Australian people have access to all the relevant information about our system of government and the proposals for change.
The Government's view is that other constitutional reforms should not go to referendum at the same time as the republic and preamble issues.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,"<title>Hill, Senator-Elect Heather: Election</title>",Miscellaneous,2,1,speech

The statement read as follows—
I have great pleasure today in presenting, on behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the Report on Military Justice Procedures in the Australian Defence Force,  together with volumes of evidence and minutes of proceedings.
The current military inquiry and discipline systems of the Australian Defence Force have been in operation for several years and the legislation underpinning the systems has provided a sound framework for the application of military justice. However over the past few years, a number of military inquiries, and disciplinary matters conducted by the Australian Defence Force, have become the subject of considerable public interest and media comment. Predominantly these cases involved the loss of lives of Service personnel or seeming injustices to members of the Australian Defence Force in their dealings with the military disciplinary system.
The considerable public attention focused on such cases has included criticisms of the efficacy of the current military inquiry system and questions of natural justice and human rights. Additionally, there has been considerable public support behind calls for external inquiries, or at the very least external reviews of inquiries, in cases involving the death of an Australian Defence Force member. Less public attention has been focused on the systems of discipline and administrative action employed by the Australian Defence Force although aspects of the Defence Force Discipline Act have been challenged, on several occasions, in the High Court of Australia in recent years.
The Senate, in referring this inquiry to the Committee on 25 November 1997, and re-referring it on 10 March 1999, asked the Committee to examine the existing legislative framework and procedures for the conduct of military inquiries and Australian Defence Force disciplinary processes. During the course of the inquiry, the Committee identified a third, interrelated component of the military justice system: administrative action. The report addresses these three distinct components of the military justice system employed within the Australian Defence Force: military inquiries, military discipline and administrative action.
Each of these components is expansive and the Committee has not attempted an exhaustive examination of every detail of the military justice system. Rather the Committee has sought to examine the existing legislation, policies and framework of the system of military justice employed by the Australian Defence Force and to evaluate their effectiveness and relevance in practice.
Independence and impartiality in the military justice system was a strong theme throughout the conduct of the inquiry. In cases involving the death 
 of an Australian Defence Force member, the Committee was aware of a strong feeling, particularly from some family members of the deceased, that the military justice system lacks independence. While the Committee received no evidence to support an allegation of a lack of independence in the military justice system there is no question that this perception exists in some quarters.
The Committee was cognisant that while the military justice system must, so far as possible, conform with community norms, the Australian Defence Force has unique requirements for the administration of justice commensurate with its role in the defence of the nation. Moreover, these unique requirements exist as constraints and standards additional to the justice system that pertains to all citizens of Australia. Notwithstanding that members of the Australian Defence Force voluntarily accept the imposition of an additional layer of justice when they choose to serve their country, the military justice system must be demonstrably independent, impartial and fair.
The Committee acknowledged the considerable changes, made by the Australian Defence Force, to the military justice system during the course of the inquiry. Indeed the Committee inquiry was conducted in a somewhat dynamic environment with the Australian Defence Force moving to address the recommendations of Brigadier the Honourable A R Abadee's 1997 report, A Study into Judicial System under the Defence Force Discipline Act  and the Ombudsman's 1998 Investigation into how the Australian Defence Force responds to allegations of serious incidents and offences .
Given these circumstances of significant change in the military justice system, it is a persuasive argument that time should be allowed for the benefits of these changes to be realised before further change is contemplated. However the Committee was of the view that Australian Defence Force initiated changes to procedures and practices will not fully address both the perceived  and actual  independence and impartiality of the military justice system.
The principal question confronting the Committee was how to redress this shortfall in the military justice system without impeding the workings of the Australian Defence Force. Indeed foremost in the Committee's considerations was the need for any system of military justice to function effectively across the whole spectrum of conflict in which the Australian Defence Force can be expected to operate.
Madam President, the report tabled today contains 59 recommendations. Forty five of these recommendations relate to the military inquiry system, seven to the system of military discipline and a further seven recommendations relate to the administrative action process employed by the Australian 
 Defence Force. The most consequential of these recommendations relate to the conduct of military inquiries.
The Committee was of the view that the issues of independence and impartiality would not be fully addressed by the changes proposed, by the Australian Defence Force, to the military justice system. To redress this the Committee has proposed a number of significant changes.
Perhaps the most important of these proposals is for a latent power within Defence (Inquiry) Regulations, the prerogative of the Minister of Defence to convene a General Court of Inquiry, to be mandatory for all inquiries into matters involving the accidental death of an Australian Defence Force member. This will serve to remove the Department of Defence from the investigative process thus negating any conflict of interest and ensuring independence in the inquiry. The Committee accepted that the conduct of an inquiry by an authority external to the Australian Defence Force will involve some costs in time, resources and perhaps capability. However, the Committee was of the view that the need to demonstrate the independence of the inquiry outweighs concerns about the conduct of the inquiry by an external authority.
The Committee considered the option of proposing that a General Court of Inquiry be convened by the Minister in all cases involving major capital loss. However, the Committee acknowledged the difficulties in determining what is major capital loss and perhaps more significantly the problems with the operation of such arrangements during conflict. The Committee accepted that in most cases a Board of Inquiry would provide a suitable avenue to investigate major capital loss and that the Minister currently has, under Defence (Inquiry) Regulations, the discretion to convene a General Court of Inquiry where an issue was of such gravity to warrant independence greater than that offered by a Board of Inquiry.
To demonstrate the independence and impartiality of the system of military inquiries, the Committee was of the view that Department of Defence should publicly account for its decisions in discharging the recommendations of General Courts of Inquiry and Boards of Inquiry. In addition, the Committee has recommended that the Australian Defence Force should publicly account for the operation of the military justice system by the provision of an annual report to the Minister of Defence. Furthermore, that the annual report be tabled in the Parliament by the Minister.
With regard to General Courts of Inquiry, the Committee has recommended that following the conduct of a General Court of Inquiry, within the limitations of privacy and secrecy, and at the conclusion of all resultant disciplinary and adminis 
 trative action, the Minister of Defence should table in the Parliament:
a) the inquiry report;
b) the recommendations of the investigating body;
c) details of action taken to adopt those recommendations; and
d) where a recommendation is rejected, the reasons for that action.
The Committee did not believe that the public accountability requirements for Boards of Inquiry should be any less than those for General Courts of Inquiry. To this end, the Committee has recommended that, within the limitations of privacy and secrecy, and at the conclusion of all resultant disciplinary and administrative action, the Australian Defence Force publicly account for its actions and decisions in discharging the recommendations of the Board.
The Committee accepted that the post-Abadee arrangements will significantly improve the impartiality and independence of the military discipline system. While the alternative of an independent prosecution authority was examined in detail, the Committee concluded that the option for the creation of such a body should be re-examined after the impact of the post-Abadee arrangements could be effectively assessed. For this reason, the Committee recommended that, after the proposed post-Abadee arrangements have been in operation for three years, the issue of institutional independence in relation to prosecution in Courts Martial and Defence Force Magistrate trials be reviewed.
The Committee has also proposed some changes to the administrative action process employed within the Australian Defence Force. Perhaps of most significance, the Committee recommended that the Australian Defence Force consider the implementation of a revised framework administrative censure and formal warning that makes the process applicable to all members of the Australian Defence Force and that incorporates a separation between the roles of initiating officer and decision-maker.
The Committee identified that one of the major sources of dissatisfaction with the military inquiry process were next of kin, or close family members of personnel killed while engaged in ADF activities. It was impossible to hear the evidence given by family members who had lost a loved one in such circumstances without gaining a very strong view that the system of military justice needs a degree of fine tuning to allow the next of kin greater access to the inquiry process.
Without doubt these is a strong perception amongst many family members that the present military justice inquiry process lacked independence. We were not provided with any evidence to support this 
 claim. But the fact that the perception persists indicates that some part or parts of the inquiry process are inadequate in terms of demonstrating to family members that: the process is transparent; all necessary steps have been undertaken; and where necessary, accountability measures are instituted.
The Committee acknowledged the need for these families who have lost a husband or wife parent or child to have some closure for their own grief. While the changes recommended in this report will help relatives in the future it will not have a retrospective effect. But families who have already lost a lost one during service in the ADF can take some comfort from having brought about the changes recommended in this report.
Those changes recommended by the Committee include:
.	Attendance at Inquiry.  The next of kin, or other immediate relatives, of an ADF member whose death is the subject of an inquiry, should always be permitted to attend that inquiry regardless of whether the inquiry is conducted in private or is open to the public. Exclusion of these next of kin, or other immediate relatives from the inquiry should only be on a temporary basis, from those sections of the inquiry dealing with matters of national security.
.	Informed of Outcomes.  Next of kin or other immediate relatives of personnel killed in military incidents should, within the provisions of the Privacy Act  and relevant security considerations, be provided with a copy of the inquiry report and advice on all actions taken as a result of the inquiry. Where a recommendation from the inquiry report is not implemented, next of kin should be provided with the reasons underpinning the decision not to adopt that recommendation.
.	Advised Prior to Press Release.  Next of kin or other immediate relatives of personnel killed in military incidents should be warned prior to the release of information to the press regarding the inquiry.
.	Legal Representation.  Where a deceased member of the ADF is likely to be affected by an inquiry, the next of kin or other immediate relative should be afforded the option to have the interests of the deceased member represented, at Commonwealth expense, by Service legal counsel.
.	Counselling Services.  The ADF should establish processes to ensure that counselling services are available to witnesses to a military inquiry and to next of kin and close relatives of ADF members killed in the incident.
While the Committee is of the view that the recommendations of this report will serve to 
 improve the independence, impartiality and overall operation of the system, it is acknowledged that the report will be disappointing for some who saw the inquiry as an avenue of review for individual cases. It should be emphasised that this function was not within the Terms of Reference for the inquiry, nor was it within the powers of the Committee. Where the Committee touched on individual cases it did so solely to examine the procedures employed and the effectiveness of the military justice system.
The inquiry created a lot of public interest, and I would like to thank all of the people who took the time to write submissions, to appear at the public hearings or simply made contact with the secretariat. I would like to acknowledge the hard work of the Defence Sub-Committee in this Parliament and also in the 38th Parliament.
Finally on behalf of all Committee members I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the excellent Secretariat staff so ably led by Joanne Towner and Margaret Swieringa and our military advisers Paul Hislop and Michael Ward.
Madam President, I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee: Joint</title>",Committees,6,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-06-21,"—The report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on military justice procedures in the Australian Defence Force is very important—all reports from the committee are very important. I have been a member of the committee for most of my time in this parliament and I have been a member of the defence subcommittee, which prepared this report on behalf of the joint committee, for most of that time. This may not be a report which the large bulk of the Australian population would find interesting reading or would queue at the government bookshop to purchase, but the issues which it has dealt with are very important for the morale and the operation of the Australian Defence Force in the 21st century.
We have seen consistent controversy over a period of time about the way the Defence Force handles issues where people are stood down while they are charged under various offences. This is an issue where philosophically you have a conflict between the need for a defence force to provide discipline and arrangements to maintain the good organisation of a military unit, and the right of the individual to make sure that, in a civilised and democratic society, even though they are 
 members of the Defence Force, they receive due process and fairness in military tribunals if they have been charged with any number of matters under the military code of Australia. That code is part of an extensive document which has been built up not just over recent years but over decades, beginning with what we inherited from Great Britain.
I want to pay particular tribute to the members of the committee; to David MacGibbon, the chair of the committee, whose interest in defence matters is well known in this place and elsewhere; and also to the Deputy Chair, my colleague Roger Price. This report—as I say, it will not be a best seller—will be very important in outlining arrangements for the military in coming years. At this stage, people in the broader community and particularly in the military community will be able to respond. I think there will be proper debate. Those of us on the defence subcommittee look forward to debate on the recommendations. I do not believe that any of the recommendations in themselves are unduly controversial, though they total nearly 60, nor would they be hard for the Department of Defence to digest and put into practice. Of course, they will respond and we will wait for the government's response on behalf of the Department of Defence in the next three months.
I want to say to the government that I hope that they do respond in a thorough manner to these recommendations within the three months required and not just put this off as too difficult or not as pressing as maybe some other issues. When we get the response of the government, the Senate and House of Representatives can have a further debate about these recommendations.
I am not going to go through these recommendations one by one—I do not have the time—and I am not going to try to just speak to one or two. In my view these recommendations update and make more contemporary the processes of handling justice in the military. They are, as I say, not radical: we do not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Members of the Defence Force can, I think, get a better process and, if they are charged and dealt with, they can believe that they have 
 every right to get full justice and an independent hearing.
It is clear that what we accepted as reasonable in the past in the operation of the military will not be able to be sustained totally in the first decade of the next century and into the future. If we want to attract the best quality young people in our community with tertiary qualifications—and we are going to need them in view of the highly complex and technical equipment now available in the Defence Force—we have to show that they will be treated in the Defence Force in a manner that the rest of the community thinks is reasonable. And that will mean some adjustment. If we do not make these adjustments and improvements in process, on such issues as military justice and the procedures thereof, I think we will run the risk of not being able to attract the best and the brightest into our defence forces. There would be a deficiency in our national security if we could not attract the best into the system.
Certainly I, like other members of the committee who have had dealings with Defence and opportunities to visit Defence establishments, have met both formally and informally with the staff and service people of Defence. All of us have been impressed by their quality, particularly the young people coming through the Australian Defence Force Academy and the various service colleges. We have been impressed by their quality and want that quality to be not only maintained but consistently improved in line with improvements in the community.
As I have said, this is an important document. I think it proves that the standing committees of the parliament can be extremely useful in putting forward recommendations in areas of sensitivity and making recommendations that governments in a measured way can respond to. You should note that in these recommendations, as far as I can see, there is no dissenting report. Clearly, the opposition members have accepted the government's majority view and so, as far as I am aware, there is no dissenting report. I think that is an excellent outcome. I think the minor parties were represented on the committee, as well as— 
—No, I got kicked off, remember.
—Senator Margetts, the full committee of the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee is represented by Labor, Liberal, Democrats and Independents. As far as I can see, there is no dissenting report in the report that has been tabled today.
I want to point out to the government and the Defence Force that the recommendations have quad-partisan or quin-partisan support—whatever the appropriate word is—and therefore they have the full weight of the committee behind them, and I hope the government and the Defence Force accept them in that spirit. This is, I think, a good example of the work of the standing committees of the parliament dealing with sensitive issues. A bi-partisan approach can be reached to the advantage of the Defence Force. I commend the report to the parliament, the government and the defence forces.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee: Joint</title>",Committees,6,1,speech
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I do not want to take up too much time of the Senate today, but I think it is very important for us to understand that processes of justice not only have to be seen but have to be seen to be done fairly and properly. There are many examples in this country, over many years, where the judicial processes which we take for granted in civilian life have not been extended to the military. Mind you, I think one or two of the provisions that apply to the military—and, in fact, recommendations have been made in the report to strengthen them—could be something that the rest of the community needs to deal with as well. Great improvement could be made to many of the issues concerning the justice system in this country which come under scrutiny.
I want to have a look at a couple of the recommendations in the report, namely recommendations 18 to 21, and draw them to the attention of the Senate. One would hope that, with a report as all encompassing as this one—namely, a 60-recommendation report of this type—the military and the minister and his office would take a close look at the recommendations and that in fact we will see 
 considerable progress made on these by the time we get to estimates next year or possibly the year after.
Recommendations 18 through to 21 deal primarily with the processes by which a person is notified if there is a complaint against them and the procedures by which those complaints are dealt with. What it really does is set down some basic principles of natural justice which will apply to soldiers, sailors and airmen—and I use those terms for both male and female these days, because there are large numbers of females in all three arms of our services—so that, if a complaint is made against them, they are properly informed of that allegation and they are told what procedures will follow from that complaint. The principles also mean that, if a report is made which is critical of an ADF member, that person is accorded the proper procedures for answering that complaint and that, ultimately, when it comes to legal recourse within the military, the investigating body thoroughly and properly advises the parties concerned of the course of action that is going to take place and of the entire nature of the allegation against the person.
The report is a full one. Indeed, I think it deals with many aspects of justice within the military which have not been dealt with before. I am only a new member to the committee so I cannot give any historic perspective on that, in the way that, say, my colleague Senator MacGibbon no doubt will in his address here today. From my knowledge, it is the first time that the committee has made recommendations on these points and has dealt with them at all in any manner.
Without saying too much more I would like to draw the Senate's attention to a few other recommendations in the report and then let some of my other colleagues make a couple of comments on it. I think it is rather interesting that recommendations 25 through to 28, respectively, deal with the military's approach with regard to the next of kin of a person who unfortunately has been killed in a military incident. I think it is rather a shame in many respects that it has taken a report of this nature to deal with what is, it must be said, a very difficult but necessary issue. It has been 
 some years since we have had any combat related deaths in the Australian ADF but, as I understand it, each year there are persons who are killed by way of training or other incidents in the Australian Defence Force. Some of these instances lead to charges of negligence against the person concerned and in fact against the person who has been killed or against that person and others.
So I think that these recommendations are commonsense and important and that they really need to be taken up. I suspect that senators from all sides will be keen to ask the Defence personnel when they come before us for estimates about what progress is being made on these recommendations. We look with interest to see how the Defence establishment accepts this report.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee: Joint</title>",Committees,6,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1999-06-21,"—Being a member of the Senate legislation committee which deals with defence matters at estimates, I find that the issues in this report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade are of real concern. I have addressed them in past estimates without the availability of a comprehensive report such as the joint standing committee have put together. On that basis, I firstly put on the record my congratulations to the joint committee for undertaking this vast report and for making it available for someone like me at Senate estimates.
I noticed in the brief time in which I have been able to look at the report that it does get to the fundamentals of basic justice within the military. Of course, that should apply whether it is military or whether it is in the civilian world. In particular, I noted the comments in respect of mischievous allegations and the fact that there was evidence presented to the committee that false accusations are presented in some military tribunals. The report says:
. . . false or misleading accusations were used to the detriment of individuals, even where the resultant investigations failed to prove any offence committed by the individual.
One can see that the military do close ranks in the strictest sense of the terms but, of course, no-one has the right to destroy anyone's career by way of misleading allegations or accusations. One would hope that, as 
 a result of this report, every effort is undertaken to ensure that this practice is eliminated and the careers of some very promising people within the military are not destroyed.
This is a timely report in another sense. The defence forces are undergoing a period of upheaval under the Defence Reform Program, and that sets a lot of things in train which would see people jealous of what others have achieved under the Defence Reform Program by way of promotion or changes in their status whilst others may be standing still marking time. So we need to ensure that the processes that are in place will protect the integrity of those people who have rightfully achieved and to ensure that those people are not subject to any false or wrongful accusation as a result of a process that is turning the Defence Force on its head at the present moment.
The only other issue that I want to comment on is one that I have always been concerned about, and that is the training of Defence Force personnel. The report at paragraph 3.151 specifically refers to the need for there to be a degree of competence of ADF officers, such that:
. . . the effective and efficient conduct of military inquiries calls for considerable knowledge and judgement of those involved. The ADF acknowledged that relatively few officers are called upon to either personally inquire into a matter as an Investigating Officer or to participate as a member of a BOI and there is a lack of experience.
The report goes on to further recognise that there is a need to have these people trained to a degree and level of competence which will enable them to participate in the processes that are necessary within the defence forces.
I believe that the report is a breakthrough. It will be something that will be subject to greater scrutiny at the estimates process—because, at the end of the day, one must be assured that justice is not just being seen to be done but is being done within our defence forces. Where on some occasions defence inquiries can be suppressed, hushed up to protect the interests of a few, that should not be allowed. The processes outlined in this report will undoubtedly guarantee integrity for all.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee: Joint</title>",Committees,6,1,speech
"MacGibbon, Sen David",LP,1999-06-21,"—I would like to thank Senators Schacht, Quirke and Hogg for their enthusiastic and genuine support for this inquiry, which, as Senator Schacht said, produced a unanimous report from all the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and not only of the defence subcommittee. Towards the end of 1997, Senator Schacht moved in this chamber that the subject of military justice be referred to the joint committee and now, some years later, this report is tabled before us.
As a longstanding member of that committee, I can say that I have never been involved in any inquiry as complex as this one. It is a very detailed and technical subject to inquire into, and what is tabled today in the Senate is no light reading before you go to sleep at night. But I believe that it is a very constructive report and that it will be very beneficial to the morale and conduct of operations of the ADF in the years ahead. I believe that the ADF will have no difficulty in accepting all the recommendations that we have made.
At the outset, the committee recognised the need for military justice. Most of the justice that is administered within the Australian Defence Force is administered under civilian law and has been so for many years. Major crimes like rape, murder, theft and things of that nature are always referred to the civilian courts and, wherever possible, if there is a way of referring a matter to the civilian courts the defence department does so. But we do need military justice because we require the defence forces to do perverse actions—actions that have no parallel at all in civilian life.
At the end of the day, the members of the Australian Defence Force are different from all of us in this chamber, because they literally die on orders, and no-one in this room does that. We require them to perform acts of extreme violence but to do so in a very disciplined way, and so the existence of a highly disciplined code of behaviour is essential to a defence force. If you do not have that, then you have such tragedies as befell the Canadian army on its deployment to Somalia, where it became involved in torture, murder and theft. Discipline is absolutely 
 essential. If a force is not disciplined, it is a threat to a democratic society and to the members of its own ranks.
The need for a military justice system to see that discipline is fairly, impartially and independently exercised is absolutely paramount. In the Australian Defence Force, that justice system is mediated through three broad streams: the Defence Force Discipline Act, the Defence (Inquiry) Regulations, and administrative action.
The Defence Force Discipline Act was brought down in 1985 and replaced a hotchpotch of old British military legislation, some of which had in fact been abandoned by the United Kingdom defence forces many years previously. The Defence Force Discipline Act of 1985 was an Australian approach to the legislative requirement for discipline within the Defence Force and it covers, as its name says, matters of discipline, trials of members of the ADF and all the things in the way of penalties from that.
The Defence (Inquiry) Regulations, which came in at about the same time in 1985, really are there to find out why accidents happen. Military training is always dangerous and, sadly, there will always be a mortality rate, because it must get as close to reality as possible. Everything must be done by the Australian Defence Force to make sure that people are not killed or injured on exercises but, with the best of planning, some accidents will occur. What we cannot tolerate is any negligence or incompetence in those administering training exercises which result in the loss of lives or injury or major property loss.
The Defence (Inquiry) Regulations are set up to find out why accidents happen and, therefore, the speed and accuracy of the inquiry are paramount. Because of that, the usual requirements of courts of law with respect to evidence and the fact that you can refuse to answer a question on the grounds that you might incriminate yourself do not apply. In the converse of that, the pay-off is that, if someone answers and incriminates themselves, it cannot be used against them in a subsequent court action as a disciplinary measure. The whole purpose of defence inquiries is to find out why accidents happen 
 so that they can be prevented from happening again and, in some cases, the time span can be quite short.
The defence inquiries operate through a level of inquiries, starting with the board of inquiry, through investigating officers and down to quite minor events. One of the characteristics that is not appreciated by the civilian community is that it has never been a requirement for the inquiry process to blame someone for the accident. The inquiry process has the power to recommend that, if a prima facie case exists for the Defence Force Discipline Act to be applied against someone, that finding can be made if it is in the terms of reference setting up the board of inquiry. In recent years on major boards of inquiry that requirement has not been stipulated and, because of that, there has been a perception in the community that there is a lack of accountability in the ADF.
The final stream, the administrative action pathway, deals with professional and personal development, and it is of lesser importance than the two other streams that I have talked about. Overall, the committee found that the system was very sound—98 per cent of it is working very well and there are no problems. In its 60-odd recommendations, the committee recommended finetuning of the process. Where possible, it has introduced modern practices, some of which have been referred to by previous speakers.
The overriding impression the committee got from hearing witnesses was that there was a perception of a lack of independence from some of the relatives of deceased service personnel and, flowing from that, a lack of accountability. That is very important in a volunteer service because it affects morale and a whole range of other matters. I have to emphasise that the committee found no evidence at all that there was a lack of independence in the process but, as figures in public life, we all recognise that perceptions are very important. We decided that the perception of a lack of independence was a very major shortcoming of the present system, and we set out to find a means to overcome it. That took us a great deal of time.
We came up with the proposition that a latent power in the defence inquiry regulations—namely the ability of the minister to refer an inquiry to a general court of inquiry—be used. This has never been used since the regulations were brought into force in 1985. Referring a matter to a general court of inquiry takes it entirely out of the Department of Defence's control and refers it to either a Supreme Court judge from the states or a Federal Court judge. The process that flows from there is entirely independent of the Department of Defence. We believe that that not only will create the perception of independence in major inquiries but will also create the reality of independence. So one of our significant recommendations was that, where death occurs as a consequence of an ADF activity, the minister must refer the matter to a general court of inquiry.
I am confident that the defence department will accept all the recommendations we have made. They are all constructive; they all operate within existing systems. There is nothing new in what we propose that is radical or will turn anything on its head. There are minimal costs involved, if any costs at all. Most importantly, the preservation of the command authority of officers in the ADF is preserved. We think we have come up with a very pragmatic approach and we are confident that the defence department, having shown a great readiness to implement the recommendations of Mr Justice Abadee in relation to the Defence Force Discipline Act within the last 12 months, will carry on with the good work and implement our findings, which I believe will be for the benefit of all.
Finally, I would like to thank very much my deputy chairman, the Hon. Roger Price, for the support he gave me on the defence subcommittee, and the other members of the committee, some of whom have spoken today. I also thank the staff: the secretary, Joanne Towner, now replaced by Margaret Swieringa, and particularly Michael Ward and Paul Hislop, who were the military advisers to the committee. I commend the report to the Senate.

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1999-06-21,"—On behalf of Senator MacGibbon, I present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on military justice procedures in the Australian Defence Force, together with submissions, Hansard  record and minutes of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to have the tabling statement incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
I have great pleasure today in presenting, on behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the Report on Military Justice Procedures in the Australian Defence Force,  together with volumes of evidence and minutes of proceedings.
The current military inquiry and discipline systems of the Australian Defence Force have been in operation for several years and the legislation underpinning the systems has provided a sound framework for the application of military justice. However over the past few years, a number of military inquiries, and disciplinary matters conducted by the Australian Defence Force, have become the subject of considerable public interest and media comment. Predominantly these cases involved the loss of lives of Service personnel or seeming injustices to members of the Australian Defence Force in their dealings with the military disciplinary system.
The considerable public attention focused on such cases has included criticisms of the efficacy of the current military inquiry system and questions of natural justice and human rights. Additionally, there has been considerable public support behind calls for external inquiries, or at the very least external reviews of inquiries, in cases involving the death of an Australian Defence Force member. Less public attention has been focused on the systems of discipline and administrative action employed by the Australian Defence Force although aspects of the Defence Force Discipline Act have been challenged, on several occasions, in the High Court of Australia in recent years.
The Senate, in referring this inquiry to the Committee on 25 November 1997, and re-referring it on 10 March 1999, asked the Committee to examine the existing legislative framework and procedures for the conduct of military inquiries and Australian Defence Force disciplinary processes. During the course of the inquiry, the Committee identified a third, interrelated component of the military justice system: administrative action. The report addresses these three distinct components of the military justice system employed within the Australian Defence Force: military inquiries, military discipline and administrative action.
Each of these components is expansive and the Committee has not attempted an exhaustive examination of every detail of the military justice system. Rather the Committee has sought to examine the existing legislation, policies and framework of the system of military justice employed by the Australian Defence Force and to evaluate their effectiveness and relevance in practice.
Independence and impartiality in the military justice system was a strong theme throughout the conduct of the inquiry. In cases involving the death 
 of an Australian Defence Force member, the Committee was aware of a strong feeling, particularly from some family members of the deceased, that the military justice system lacks independence. While the Committee received no evidence to support an allegation of a lack of independence in the military justice system there is no question that this perception exists in some quarters.
The Committee was cognisant that while the military justice system must, so far as possible, conform with community norms, the Australian Defence Force has unique requirements for the administration of justice commensurate with its role in the defence of the nation. Moreover, these unique requirements exist as constraints and standards additional to the justice system that pertains to all citizens of Australia. Notwithstanding that members of the Australian Defence Force voluntarily accept the imposition of an additional layer of justice when they choose to serve their country, the military justice system must be demonstrably independent, impartial and fair.
The Committee acknowledged the considerable changes, made by the Australian Defence Force, to the military justice system during the course of the inquiry. Indeed the Committee inquiry was conducted in a somewhat dynamic environment with the Australian Defence Force moving to address the recommendations of Brigadier the Honourable A R Abadee's 1997 report, A Study into Judicial System under the Defence Force Discipline Act  and the Ombudsman's 1998 Investigation into how the Australian Defence Force responds to allegations of serious incidents and offences .
Given these circumstances of significant change in the military justice system, it is a persuasive argument that time should be allowed for the benefits of these changes to be realised before further change is contemplated. However the Committee was of the view that Australian Defence Force initiated changes to procedures and practices will not fully address both the perceived  and actual  independence and impartiality of the military justice system.
The principal question confronting the Committee was how to redress this shortfall in the military justice system without impeding the workings of the Australian Defence Force. Indeed foremost in the Committee's considerations was the need for any system of military justice to function effectively across the whole spectrum of conflict in which the Australian Defence Force can be expected to operate.
Madam President, the report tabled today contains 59 recommendations. Forty five of these recommendations relate to the military inquiry system, seven to the system of military discipline and a further seven recommendations relate to the administrative action process employed by the Australian 
 Defence Force. The most consequential of these recommendations relate to the conduct of military inquiries.
The Committee was of the view that the issues of independence and impartiality would not be fully addressed by the changes proposed, by the Australian Defence Force, to the military justice system. To redress this the Committee has proposed a number of significant changes.
Perhaps the most important of these proposals is for a latent power within Defence (Inquiry) Regulations, the prerogative of the Minister of Defence to convene a General Court of Inquiry, to be mandatory for all inquiries into matters involving the accidental death of an Australian Defence Force member. This will serve to remove the Department of Defence from the investigative process thus negating any conflict of interest and ensuring independence in the inquiry. The Committee accepted that the conduct of an inquiry by an authority external to the Australian Defence Force will involve some costs in time, resources and perhaps capability. However, the Committee was of the view that the need to demonstrate the independence of the inquiry outweighs concerns about the conduct of the inquiry by an external authority.
The Committee considered the option of proposing that a General Court of Inquiry be convened by the Minister in all cases involving major capital loss. However, the Committee acknowledged the difficulties in determining what is major capital loss and perhaps more significantly the problems with the operation of such arrangements during conflict. The Committee accepted that in most cases a Board of Inquiry would provide a suitable avenue to investigate major capital loss and that the Minister currently has, under Defence (Inquiry) Regulations, the discretion to convene a General Court of Inquiry where an issue was of such gravity to warrant independence greater than that offered by a Board of Inquiry.
To demonstrate the independence and impartiality of the system of military inquiries, the Committee was of the view that Department of Defence should publicly account for its decisions in discharging the recommendations of General Courts of Inquiry and Boards of Inquiry. In addition, the Committee has recommended that the Australian Defence Force should publicly account for the operation of the military justice system by the provision of an annual report to the Minister of Defence. Furthermore, that the annual report be tabled in the Parliament by the Minister.
With regard to General Courts of Inquiry, the Committee has recommended that following the conduct of a General Court of Inquiry, within the limitations of privacy and secrecy, and at the conclusion of all resultant disciplinary and adminis 
 trative action, the Minister of Defence should table in the Parliament:
a) the inquiry report;
b) the recommendations of the investigating body;
c) details of action taken to adopt those recommendations; and
d) where a recommendation is rejected, the reasons for that action.
The Committee did not believe that the public accountability requirements for Boards of Inquiry should be any less than those for General Courts of Inquiry. To this end, the Committee has recommended that, within the limitations of privacy and secrecy, and at the conclusion of all resultant disciplinary and administrative action, the Australian Defence Force publicly account for its actions and decisions in discharging the recommendations of the Board.
The Committee accepted that the post-Abadee arrangements will significantly improve the impartiality and independence of the military discipline system. While the alternative of an independent prosecution authority was examined in detail, the Committee concluded that the option for the creation of such a body should be re-examined after the impact of the post-Abadee arrangements could be effectively assessed. For this reason, the Committee recommended that, after the proposed post-Abadee arrangements have been in operation for three years, the issue of institutional independence in relation to prosecution in Courts Martial and Defence Force Magistrate trials be reviewed.
The Committee has also proposed some changes to the administrative action process employed within the Australian Defence Force. Perhaps of most significance, the Committee recommended that the Australian Defence Force consider the implementation of a revised framework administrative censure and formal warning that makes the process applicable to all members of the Australian Defence Force and that incorporates a separation between the roles of initiating officer and decision-maker.
The Committee identified that one of the major sources of dissatisfaction with the military inquiry process were next of kin, or close family members of personnel killed while engaged in ADF activities. It was impossible to hear the evidence given by family members who had lost a loved one in such circumstances without gaining a very strong view that the system of military justice needs a degree of fine tuning to allow the next of kin greater access to the inquiry process.
Without doubt these is a strong perception amongst many family members that the present military justice inquiry process lacked independence. We were not provided with any evidence to support this 
 claim. But the fact that the perception persists indicates that some part or parts of the inquiry process are inadequate in terms of demonstrating to family members that: the process is transparent; all necessary steps have been undertaken; and where necessary, accountability measures are instituted.
The Committee acknowledged the need for these families who have lost a husband or wife parent or child to have some closure for their own grief. While the changes recommended in this report will help relatives in the future it will not have a retrospective effect. But families who have already lost a lost one during service in the ADF can take some comfort from having brought about the changes recommended in this report.
Those changes recommended by the Committee include:
.	Attendance at Inquiry.  The next of kin, or other immediate relatives, of an ADF member whose death is the subject of an inquiry, should always be permitted to attend that inquiry regardless of whether the inquiry is conducted in private or is open to the public. Exclusion of these next of kin, or other immediate relatives from the inquiry should only be on a temporary basis, from those sections of the inquiry dealing with matters of national security.
.	Informed of Outcomes.  Next of kin or other immediate relatives of personnel killed in military incidents should, within the provisions of the Privacy Act  and relevant security considerations, be provided with a copy of the inquiry report and advice on all actions taken as a result of the inquiry. Where a recommendation from the inquiry report is not implemented, next of kin should be provided with the reasons underpinning the decision not to adopt that recommendation.
.	Advised Prior to Press Release.  Next of kin or other immediate relatives of personnel killed in military incidents should be warned prior to the release of information to the press regarding the inquiry.
.	Legal Representation.  Where a deceased member of the ADF is likely to be affected by an inquiry, the next of kin or other immediate relative should be afforded the option to have the interests of the deceased member represented, at Commonwealth expense, by Service legal counsel.
.	Counselling Services.  The ADF should establish processes to ensure that counselling services are available to witnesses to a military inquiry and to next of kin and close relatives of ADF members killed in the incident.
While the Committee is of the view that the recommendations of this report will serve to 
 improve the independence, impartiality and overall operation of the system, it is acknowledged that the report will be disappointing for some who saw the inquiry as an avenue of review for individual cases. It should be emphasised that this function was not within the Terms of Reference for the inquiry, nor was it within the powers of the Committee. Where the Committee touched on individual cases it did so solely to examine the procedures employed and the effectiveness of the military justice system.
The inquiry created a lot of public interest, and I would like to thank all of the people who took the time to write submissions, to appear at the public hearings or simply made contact with the secretariat. I would like to acknowledge the hard work of the Defence Sub-Committee in this Parliament and also in the 38th Parliament.
Finally on behalf of all Committee members I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the excellent Secretariat staff so ably led by Joanne Towner and Margaret Swieringa and our military advisers Paul Hislop and Michael Ward.
Madam President, I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,6,2,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-06-21,"—The report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on military justice procedures in the Australian Defence Force is very important—all reports from the committee are very important. I have been a member of the committee for most of my time in this parliament and I have been a member of the defence subcommittee, which prepared this report on behalf of the joint committee, for most of that time. This may not be a report which the large bulk of the Australian population would find interesting reading or would queue at the government bookshop to purchase, but the issues which it has dealt with are very important for the morale and the operation of the Australian Defence Force in the 21st century.
We have seen consistent controversy over a period of time about the way the Defence Force handles issues where people are stood down while they are charged under various offences. This is an issue where philosophically you have a conflict between the need for a defence force to provide discipline and arrangements to maintain the good organisation of a military unit, and the right of the individual to make sure that, in a civilised and democratic society, even though they are 
 members of the Defence Force, they receive due process and fairness in military tribunals if they have been charged with any number of matters under the military code of Australia. That code is part of an extensive document which has been built up not just over recent years but over decades, beginning with what we inherited from Great Britain.
I want to pay particular tribute to the members of the committee; to David MacGibbon, the chair of the committee, whose interest in defence matters is well known in this place and elsewhere; and also to the Deputy Chair, my colleague Roger Price. This report—as I say, it will not be a best seller—will be very important in outlining arrangements for the military in coming years. At this stage, people in the broader community and particularly in the military community will be able to respond. I think there will be proper debate. Those of us on the defence subcommittee look forward to debate on the recommendations. I do not believe that any of the recommendations in themselves are unduly controversial, though they total nearly 60, nor would they be hard for the Department of Defence to digest and put into practice. Of course, they will respond and we will wait for the government's response on behalf of the Department of Defence in the next three months.
I want to say to the government that I hope that they do respond in a thorough manner to these recommendations within the three months required and not just put this off as too difficult or not as pressing as maybe some other issues. When we get the response of the government, the Senate and House of Representatives can have a further debate about these recommendations.
I am not going to go through these recommendations one by one—I do not have the time—and I am not going to try to just speak to one or two. In my view these recommendations update and make more contemporary the processes of handling justice in the military. They are, as I say, not radical: we do not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Members of the Defence Force can, I think, get a better process and, if they are charged and dealt with, they can believe that they have 
 every right to get full justice and an independent hearing.
It is clear that what we accepted as reasonable in the past in the operation of the military will not be able to be sustained totally in the first decade of the next century and into the future. If we want to attract the best quality young people in our community with tertiary qualifications—and we are going to need them in view of the highly complex and technical equipment now available in the Defence Force—we have to show that they will be treated in the Defence Force in a manner that the rest of the community thinks is reasonable. And that will mean some adjustment. If we do not make these adjustments and improvements in process, on such issues as military justice and the procedures thereof, I think we will run the risk of not being able to attract the best and the brightest into our defence forces. There would be a deficiency in our national security if we could not attract the best into the system.
Certainly I, like other members of the committee who have had dealings with Defence and opportunities to visit Defence establishments, have met both formally and informally with the staff and service people of Defence. All of us have been impressed by their quality, particularly the young people coming through the Australian Defence Force Academy and the various service colleges. We have been impressed by their quality and want that quality to be not only maintained but consistently improved in line with improvements in the community.
As I have said, this is an important document. I think it proves that the standing committees of the parliament can be extremely useful in putting forward recommendations in areas of sensitivity and making recommendations that governments in a measured way can respond to. You should note that in these recommendations, as far as I can see, there is no dissenting report. Clearly, the opposition members have accepted the government's majority view and so, as far as I am aware, there is no dissenting report. I think that is an excellent outcome. I think the minor parties were represented on the committee, as well as— 
—No, I got kicked off, remember.
—Senator Margetts, the full committee of the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee is represented by Labor, Liberal, Democrats and Independents. As far as I can see, there is no dissenting report in the report that has been tabled today.
I want to point out to the government and the Defence Force that the recommendations have quad-partisan or quin-partisan support—whatever the appropriate word is—and therefore they have the full weight of the committee behind them, and I hope the government and the Defence Force accept them in that spirit. This is, I think, a good example of the work of the standing committees of the parliament dealing with sensitive issues. A bi-partisan approach can be reached to the advantage of the Defence Force. I commend the report to the parliament, the government and the defence forces.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,6,2,speech
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I do not want to take up too much time of the Senate today, but I think it is very important for us to understand that processes of justice not only have to be seen but have to be seen to be done fairly and properly. There are many examples in this country, over many years, where the judicial processes which we take for granted in civilian life have not been extended to the military. Mind you, I think one or two of the provisions that apply to the military—and, in fact, recommendations have been made in the report to strengthen them—could be something that the rest of the community needs to deal with as well. Great improvement could be made to many of the issues concerning the justice system in this country which come under scrutiny.
I want to have a look at a couple of the recommendations in the report, namely recommendations 18 to 21, and draw them to the attention of the Senate. One would hope that, with a report as all encompassing as this one—namely, a 60-recommendation report of this type—the military and the minister and his office would take a close look at the recommendations and that in fact we will see 
 considerable progress made on these by the time we get to estimates next year or possibly the year after.
Recommendations 18 through to 21 deal primarily with the processes by which a person is notified if there is a complaint against them and the procedures by which those complaints are dealt with. What it really does is set down some basic principles of natural justice which will apply to soldiers, sailors and airmen—and I use those terms for both male and female these days, because there are large numbers of females in all three arms of our services—so that, if a complaint is made against them, they are properly informed of that allegation and they are told what procedures will follow from that complaint. The principles also mean that, if a report is made which is critical of an ADF member, that person is accorded the proper procedures for answering that complaint and that, ultimately, when it comes to legal recourse within the military, the investigating body thoroughly and properly advises the parties concerned of the course of action that is going to take place and of the entire nature of the allegation against the person.
The report is a full one. Indeed, I think it deals with many aspects of justice within the military which have not been dealt with before. I am only a new member to the committee so I cannot give any historic perspective on that, in the way that, say, my colleague Senator MacGibbon no doubt will in his address here today. From my knowledge, it is the first time that the committee has made recommendations on these points and has dealt with them at all in any manner.
Without saying too much more I would like to draw the Senate's attention to a few other recommendations in the report and then let some of my other colleagues make a couple of comments on it. I think it is rather interesting that recommendations 25 through to 28, respectively, deal with the military's approach with regard to the next of kin of a person who unfortunately has been killed in a military incident. I think it is rather a shame in many respects that it has taken a report of this nature to deal with what is, it must be said, a very difficult but necessary issue. It has been 
 some years since we have had any combat related deaths in the Australian ADF but, as I understand it, each year there are persons who are killed by way of training or other incidents in the Australian Defence Force. Some of these instances lead to charges of negligence against the person concerned and in fact against the person who has been killed or against that person and others.
So I think that these recommendations are commonsense and important and that they really need to be taken up. I suspect that senators from all sides will be keen to ask the Defence personnel when they come before us for estimates about what progress is being made on these recommendations. We look with interest to see how the Defence establishment accepts this report.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,6,2,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1999-06-21,"—Being a member of the Senate legislation committee which deals with defence matters at estimates, I find that the issues in this report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade are of real concern. I have addressed them in past estimates without the availability of a comprehensive report such as the joint standing committee have put together. On that basis, I firstly put on the record my congratulations to the joint committee for undertaking this vast report and for making it available for someone like me at Senate estimates.
I noticed in the brief time in which I have been able to look at the report that it does get to the fundamentals of basic justice within the military. Of course, that should apply whether it is military or whether it is in the civilian world. In particular, I noted the comments in respect of mischievous allegations and the fact that there was evidence presented to the committee that false accusations are presented in some military tribunals. The report says:
. . . false or misleading accusations were used to the detriment of individuals, even where the resultant investigations failed to prove any offence committed by the individual.
One can see that the military do close ranks in the strictest sense of the terms but, of course, no-one has the right to destroy anyone's career by way of misleading allegations or accusations. One would hope that, as 
 a result of this report, every effort is undertaken to ensure that this practice is eliminated and the careers of some very promising people within the military are not destroyed.
This is a timely report in another sense. The defence forces are undergoing a period of upheaval under the Defence Reform Program, and that sets a lot of things in train which would see people jealous of what others have achieved under the Defence Reform Program by way of promotion or changes in their status whilst others may be standing still marking time. So we need to ensure that the processes that are in place will protect the integrity of those people who have rightfully achieved and to ensure that those people are not subject to any false or wrongful accusation as a result of a process that is turning the Defence Force on its head at the present moment.
The only other issue that I want to comment on is one that I have always been concerned about, and that is the training of Defence Force personnel. The report at paragraph 3.151 specifically refers to the need for there to be a degree of competence of ADF officers, such that:
. . . the effective and efficient conduct of military inquiries calls for considerable knowledge and judgement of those involved. The ADF acknowledged that relatively few officers are called upon to either personally inquire into a matter as an Investigating Officer or to participate as a member of a BOI and there is a lack of experience.
The report goes on to further recognise that there is a need to have these people trained to a degree and level of competence which will enable them to participate in the processes that are necessary within the defence forces.
I believe that the report is a breakthrough. It will be something that will be subject to greater scrutiny at the estimates process—because, at the end of the day, one must be assured that justice is not just being seen to be done but is being done within our defence forces. Where on some occasions defence inquiries can be suppressed, hushed up to protect the interests of a few, that should not be allowed. The processes outlined in this report will undoubtedly guarantee integrity for all.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,6,2,speech
"MacGibbon, Sen David",LP,1999-06-21,"—I would like to thank Senators Schacht, Quirke and Hogg for their enthusiastic and genuine support for this inquiry, which, as Senator Schacht said, produced a unanimous report from all the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and not only of the defence subcommittee. Towards the end of 1997, Senator Schacht moved in this chamber that the subject of military justice be referred to the joint committee and now, some years later, this report is tabled before us.
As a longstanding member of that committee, I can say that I have never been involved in any inquiry as complex as this one. It is a very detailed and technical subject to inquire into, and what is tabled today in the Senate is no light reading before you go to sleep at night. But I believe that it is a very constructive report and that it will be very beneficial to the morale and conduct of operations of the ADF in the years ahead. I believe that the ADF will have no difficulty in accepting all the recommendations that we have made.
At the outset, the committee recognised the need for military justice. Most of the justice that is administered within the Australian Defence Force is administered under civilian law and has been so for many years. Major crimes like rape, murder, theft and things of that nature are always referred to the civilian courts and, wherever possible, if there is a way of referring a matter to the civilian courts the defence department does so. But we do need military justice because we require the defence forces to do perverse actions—actions that have no parallel at all in civilian life.
At the end of the day, the members of the Australian Defence Force are different from all of us in this chamber, because they literally die on orders, and no-one in this room does that. We require them to perform acts of extreme violence but to do so in a very disciplined way, and so the existence of a highly disciplined code of behaviour is essential to a defence force. If you do not have that, then you have such tragedies as befell the Canadian army on its deployment to Somalia, where it became involved in torture, murder and theft. Discipline is absolutely 
 essential. If a force is not disciplined, it is a threat to a democratic society and to the members of its own ranks.
The need for a military justice system to see that discipline is fairly, impartially and independently exercised is absolutely paramount. In the Australian Defence Force, that justice system is mediated through three broad streams: the Defence Force Discipline Act, the Defence (Inquiry) Regulations, and administrative action.
The Defence Force Discipline Act was brought down in 1985 and replaced a hotchpotch of old British military legislation, some of which had in fact been abandoned by the United Kingdom defence forces many years previously. The Defence Force Discipline Act of 1985 was an Australian approach to the legislative requirement for discipline within the Defence Force and it covers, as its name says, matters of discipline, trials of members of the ADF and all the things in the way of penalties from that.
The Defence (Inquiry) Regulations, which came in at about the same time in 1985, really are there to find out why accidents happen. Military training is always dangerous and, sadly, there will always be a mortality rate, because it must get as close to reality as possible. Everything must be done by the Australian Defence Force to make sure that people are not killed or injured on exercises but, with the best of planning, some accidents will occur. What we cannot tolerate is any negligence or incompetence in those administering training exercises which result in the loss of lives or injury or major property loss.
The Defence (Inquiry) Regulations are set up to find out why accidents happen and, therefore, the speed and accuracy of the inquiry are paramount. Because of that, the usual requirements of courts of law with respect to evidence and the fact that you can refuse to answer a question on the grounds that you might incriminate yourself do not apply. In the converse of that, the pay-off is that, if someone answers and incriminates themselves, it cannot be used against them in a subsequent court action as a disciplinary measure. The whole purpose of defence inquiries is to find out why accidents happen 
 so that they can be prevented from happening again and, in some cases, the time span can be quite short.
The defence inquiries operate through a level of inquiries, starting with the board of inquiry, through investigating officers and down to quite minor events. One of the characteristics that is not appreciated by the civilian community is that it has never been a requirement for the inquiry process to blame someone for the accident. The inquiry process has the power to recommend that, if a prima facie case exists for the Defence Force Discipline Act to be applied against someone, that finding can be made if it is in the terms of reference setting up the board of inquiry. In recent years on major boards of inquiry that requirement has not been stipulated and, because of that, there has been a perception in the community that there is a lack of accountability in the ADF.
The final stream, the administrative action pathway, deals with professional and personal development, and it is of lesser importance than the two other streams that I have talked about. Overall, the committee found that the system was very sound—98 per cent of it is working very well and there are no problems. In its 60-odd recommendations, the committee recommended finetuning of the process. Where possible, it has introduced modern practices, some of which have been referred to by previous speakers.
The overriding impression the committee got from hearing witnesses was that there was a perception of a lack of independence from some of the relatives of deceased service personnel and, flowing from that, a lack of accountability. That is very important in a volunteer service because it affects morale and a whole range of other matters. I have to emphasise that the committee found no evidence at all that there was a lack of independence in the process but, as figures in public life, we all recognise that perceptions are very important. We decided that the perception of a lack of independence was a very major shortcoming of the present system, and we set out to find a means to overcome it. That took us a great deal of time.
We came up with the proposition that a latent power in the defence inquiry regulations—namely the ability of the minister to refer an inquiry to a general court of inquiry—be used. This has never been used since the regulations were brought into force in 1985. Referring a matter to a general court of inquiry takes it entirely out of the Department of Defence's control and refers it to either a Supreme Court judge from the states or a Federal Court judge. The process that flows from there is entirely independent of the Department of Defence. We believe that that not only will create the perception of independence in major inquiries but will also create the reality of independence. So one of our significant recommendations was that, where death occurs as a consequence of an ADF activity, the minister must refer the matter to a general court of inquiry.
I am confident that the defence department will accept all the recommendations we have made. They are all constructive; they all operate within existing systems. There is nothing new in what we propose that is radical or will turn anything on its head. There are minimal costs involved, if any costs at all. Most importantly, the preservation of the command authority of officers in the ADF is preserved. We think we have come up with a very pragmatic approach and we are confident that the defence department, having shown a great readiness to implement the recommendations of Mr Justice Abadee in relation to the Defence Force Discipline Act within the last 12 months, will carry on with the good work and implement our findings, which I believe will be for the benefit of all.
Finally, I would like to thank very much my deputy chairman, the Hon. Roger Price, for the support he gave me on the defence subcommittee, and the other members of the committee, some of whom have spoken today. I also thank the staff: the secretary, Joanne Towner, now replaced by Margaret Swieringa, and particularly Michael Ward and Paul Hislop, who were the military advisers to the committee. I commend the report to the Senate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,6,2,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-06-21,"—I seek the indulgence of the Senate in relation to an earlier report. All of the Auditor-General reports were presented in a lump. I was listening, but I was listening for the Energy Efficiency in Commonwealth Operations—Department of Industry, Science and Resources: Australian Greenhouse Office  report, and apparently it was all-in-one, so I wondered if we might return to that.
Leave granted.
—I thank the Senate. I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
For a long time, an ongoing interest of mine has been the possibilities of greenhouse gas reductions in the government's own operations and the economic benefits that can be gained.
The report relates to the Department of Industry, Science and Resources' Australian Greenhouse Office. Some issues have been brought up in the performance audit leaflet. There were 12 energy policy requirements. They have been met to varying degrees, and I will talk about some of those in more detail. They did mention that there were significant practical and administrative issues that required resolution before there would be an appropriate level of compliance, and that many systems and procedures of those agencies remain to be developed by both coordinating and other agencies. That is quite serious. Australia unfortunately presented to the world that it could not possibly reduce greenhouse levels any further than we had finally acceded to in Kyoto at the Climate Change Conference and yet, even within the government sector, there seems to be a level of inactivity in relation to its own targets. I will give you some examples of these in relation to the summary of the National Audit Office findings. One is in relation to CEO accountability. The finding says:
There has been a variable standard in the implementation in areas such as adequate policy interpre 
 tation, interagency promulgation, skill and knowledge acquisition and energy policy achievements.
It is at the CEO level where these kinds of policies ought to be implemented. It is not the kind of thing you can just throw off to an environment officer within your department and expect that you are going to get changes within those areas.
Another comes under conduct of energy audits. This is very important. An energy audit is the way in which a body, an organisation and even a business can actually find out where the possible savings exist and what changes they need to make. The finding here was quite concerning. It said:
The current level of energy audit activity is not significant. There is a high risk that the energy auditing requirement of the energy policy will not be complied with unless adequate systems and procedures are developed by both coordinating and other agencies.
If government bodies do not know and are not prepared to look, they are obviously not going to be making the changes.
Let us look at the use of renewable energy technologies. The findings here are also concerning. The summary of the policy statement is that all agencies are to use solar and other renewable energy technologies where relevant and cost effective. At the time of the audit the findings were that DISR had not advised agencies of this component of the energy policy requirements in material distributed to Commonwealth agencies. This is the Department of Industry, Science and Resources and they had not actually advised agencies that they were required to use solar and other renewable energy technologies where relevant and cost effective. Something is wrong here. There is a slip between cup and mouth and it actually goes to the credibility of the government when they say they are unable to do better in relation to these policies. Of course, the Audit Office was not able to examine where there was compliance if there had not actually been a request for these activities to take place.
Once again, let us look at the adherence to Commonwealth building energy use guidelines. We heard of these issues in relation to things like legislation in relation to Common 
 wealth housing and, if I recall, defence housing came up with some great policies. What we need to find out here is whether, in general, these policies are being adhered to. The finding is that, in general, compliance with this requirement is low and there are significant practical problems confronting agencies attempting to comply with this mandatory requirement. So basically, when it comes to purchasing buildings, somehow or other the light is not going on, or perhaps the energy efficient light bulb is not going on, in the minds of those people whose role is to be involved in the purchase of such buildings.
Under section 6 we look at negotiation of particular central services, energy payment arrangements and leases. I am not entirely sure where this fits into it—it seems like it is something entirely different. Basically, they are asking that the building owners are responsible for the energy requirements—that is, the central energy use payments—as part of the lease. That, I assume, would mean that the cost savings would be passed on to the building owners the more energy efficient the building became. I am not quite sure why this is quite like this, but it obviously indicates there is an incentive, or should be an incentive, for the saleability of leases and that building owners should take an active role in reducing the ongoing energy requirements for the central energy services that are required.
Those are brickbats, I suppose. For bouquets, I guess when you turn to page 95 you will see that in Parliament House the total energy consumption reduced quite considerably in 1988-89, and from then on there has been some decrease. I assume that probably meant that there was a considerable energy wastage in relation to 1988-89 and that it might have been involved with the movement to a new building and so on. But in terms of gas use we are looking at around half the gas use between 1988-89 and 1997-98. Electricity use was not quite as impressive but one-third of that electricity use was cut. That is important when you look at the fact that electricity contributes a great deal more than gas to greenhouse gas production. So it is possible that these changes can take place.
On page 97 we see that from the years 1993-94 the Australian Taxation Office made some efforts but were more successful in some states than others. Somehow or other Victoria did not do as well as it might, but states like New South Wales did quite well in relation to reducing energy consumption within the Australian Taxation Office. The ACT was basically using more than it did in 1993-94 but less than it did in 1996-97, so I hope that there are ongoing policies in relation to this. Western Australia seems to be lumped into South Australia and has made some changes in that time.
That is about as central as we can get, I guess. If governments decide there is the potential for taking steps—if you call this the `no regrets policy'—those changes that you can make that actually save you money do not have a net cost because they cut down your energy costs. We are not actually doing as well as we can, even within the government bodies in no regrets policies. We need to do much, much better and the rest of the world, to give us any credibility, has got to see that even at the government level we are taking the issue of global warming, climate change and greenhouse gas production seriously. This does not unfortunately indicate that the government is yet taking it seriously enough, and that the Department of Industry, Science and Resources may have other issues in mind rather than greenhouse gas reductions.

"McKiernan, Sen James",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration entitled `Review of Migration Regulation 4.31B', together with submissions, Hansard  record and minutes of proceedings. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report. 

I wish to put on the record the committee's acknowledgment of the very fine work done by the secretariat staff of the committee. They were, for the record, Margaret Swieringa, Gim Del Villar, Penne Humphries, Rohan Tyler and Margaret Atkin.
The regulation 4.31B was introduced on 1 July 1997 as part of a package of measures to combat abuse in Australia's refugee determination system. Other measures included streamlining processing of primary applications and limiting work rights to applicants who applied within 45 days of entering Australia.
The aim of the package was to deter people who knew they were not refugees but were using the refugee appeal process to prolong their stay here, often for the purposes of obtaining income from employment in Australia. The purpose of regulation 4.31B was, in conjunction with other measures, to deter non-genuine applicants from appealing to the Refugee Review Tribunal after their primary application had been unsuccessful. The regulation imposed a $1,000 fee on applicants whose appeals to the RRT failed. Successful applicants to the RRT were not required to pay the fee of $1,000 and neither were unsuccessful applicants to the RRT who were subsequently granted protection visas on the basis of ministerial discretion. It was not suggested then that regulation 4.31B was a revenue raising measure, nor was it suggested at the time that the revenue raised by the fee was to be used to offset departmental costs in other areas of the portfolio.
The regulation was controversial, and the then shadow minister for immigration, Duncan Kerr, agreed to the package on condition that a number of its provisions be changed. Those changes are already on the public record. One of the conditions imposed which the government agreed to was that the regulation be subject to a sunset clause and that a review of its operations and effect be conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. This report is the result of that review.
I participated in all of the committee's public hearings, and I have read and studied all of the submissions. From this process I 
 have formed my own conclusions on the regulation. My conclusions differ from those of my Labor colleagues on the committee, and I have provided a direct, succinct additional comment at page 45 of the report which elucidates further on the reasons I formed the views that I did. In formulating my conclusions I relied upon the evidence that was presented to the committee—evidence which, I might add, was tested with the witnesses who provided the evidence to the committee. The evidence was tested, sometimes quite vigorously, and cannot therefore be dismissed.
Many of the witnesses—who came with impeccable credentials—agreed that, even now, with the conditions that were put in place two years ago, the internal onshore refugee application system continues to be abused. I have noted in my additional comments some comments from the Refugee Council of Australia—the peak refugee organisation in this country. I have also itemised comments on the matter made by the Secretary-General of the Australian Section of the International Commission for Jurists, Mr David Bitel, and I have drawn attention to the comments of Ms Grace Gardner from the Adelaide Justice Coalition and a number of others.
I particularly want to draw attention to the words of Ms Caroline Graydon from the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre. I will quote what she said. I know it is a duplication, but it is well worth duplicating. Ms Graydon told the committee at the Melbourne hearings:
From my own personal knowledge, I am not aware of any cases where I thought a person had very strong prospects of success but had been deterred by applying due to the $1000 penalty fee. Some people are driven by such strong subjective fear that I do consider it to be unlikely that someone who faces persecution, or has a well-founded fear of persecution, in their home country would be deterred.
On every possible opportunity I asked the witnesses to provide evidence of people who had been deterred from making an application because of this post-decision fee. Nobody was forthcoming. I put it to the Senate—as I put it to the committee when we were deliberating on the report—that, if anybody would know 
 about a deterrent, people such as Caroline Graydon, the Refugee Council of Australia and Mr David Bitel certainly would have known, and I am sure they would have put it on the public record when they had the opportunity to do so at the committee hearings.
We were given some case studies of people who allegedly were suffering because of the fee, and I have noted those case studies in my 3½ pages of additional comment. They are on the public record for anybody to examine. In a sense, I think those case studies actually help the argument for the minister's case that the fee should be retained.
Notwithstanding what I have said, I agree with the majority of the committee and their report that it is probably too early to judge the effectiveness of the measure. Effectively, the measure has been in existence for only 18 months. I know it is now almost a two-year period, but at the time we were examining it and taking evidence it had been in operation for about 18 months to 21 months. Many witnesses to the hearings agreed that it was a very short time frame and that many of the applications that had been before the RRT and were being adjudicated on actually had been in the system prior to the fee coming into operation.
I have agreed with my colleagues that the sunset clause should be extended for a further three years and that, prior to the expiration of that sunset clause, it should be subjected to a more thorough assessment of its effectiveness. Let me at this stage inject a note of caution and a warning. I mentioned earlier that regulation 4.31B was not a revenue raising measure, nor was it an offsetting cost initiative. I now await specific clarification from the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on this matter. This clarification is necessary as a result of a sentence in his press statement MPS/99 dated 11 May 1999 where he said:
If the fee was continued it would provide a partial cost recovery and help offset the cost of a limited extension of the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme.
I have been advised through the office of the shadow minister, Mr Con Sciacca, that a letter 
 will be forthcoming from the minister that gives the assurance that there is absolutely no policy link between the fee and the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme.
I hope that that letter will be forthcoming and I hope the clarification will be forthcoming. If it is not, I state clearly here that I will be arguing in my party room that we support any disallowance motion, if such a disallowance motion is moved, in the event of the minister seeking to continue the fee. There should be no link between this fee and the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme. There never has been and, if there is going to be that linkage now, I for one will not be standing here in this chamber or in my party room supporting such a proposition. It was never the case in the past and it should not be the case now. I certainly await the minister's written reply. I have been assured that that is forthcoming. It would have been easier had we been able to be given that assurance during the Senate estimates committee processes a couple of weeks ago, but I do understand that the public servants could not publicly stand up and contradict their minister. The ball on this matter is clearly in the minister's court, and I have put on the record how I will be arguing if that letter and that assurance are not forthcoming. I commend the report to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Migration Committee</title>,Committees,8,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-06-21,"—I too would like to speak to this report as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. It was quite a useful and thorough inquiry, as many of the inquiries conducted by that committee are. It highlighted again not just issues relating specifically to the $1,000 fee but a lot of other issues that relate more broadly to the operation of our refugee program and our humanitarian program onshore. Subsequent to this inquiry taking place, the Senate has agreed to look more broadly at the operation of our refugee program via the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, which the previous speaker is the chair of. Hopefully, we will be able to look in more detail at some of those issues.
The reason that reference was agreed to is that I think it is recognised by people coming 
 from many different perspectives of the debate surrounding refugee issues that these are complex issues and issues of great importance which involve quite fundamental and vital matters of human rights. It is also a question of addressing those through specific practical mechanisms. Of course, there is the problem of ensuring that those fundamental human rights are addressed using a system which, unfortunately, some people do choose to abuse. I think that does give rise to difficulties in terms of how best to address those problems of abuse. It is obviously not in the interests of genuine asylum seekers to have their access to justice and access to the system affected by other people who are abusing that system. So I think it is in everybody's interests to try and examine mechanisms to minimise abuse. Obviously those mechanisms need to be ones that do not compromise a fundamental necessity for our humanitarian program to address the human rights of genuine asylum seekers.
It is worth making the point in relation to this specific issue, as with any issue relating to the broader humanitarian program, that just because people seeking asylum appeal to the Refugee Review Tribunal and are knocked back, that does not automatically mean that they are deliberately abusing the system. I think that implication was raised a number of times during the course of inquiry—that this somehow or other the number of people who are unsuccessful at the Refugee Review Tribunal could be broadly equated with the number of people who are abusing the system. Quite clearly that is not a fair assessment to make. The legal definition in relation to getting refugee status in Australia is quite narrow and there are many people in what are quite clearly situations of genuine humanitarian need who do not technically fit within that definition. They still go through the system because they have a genuine need to seek asylum. Indeed, that is one of the reasons why the ministerial discretionary power exists—to address some of those people who do not fit neatly into the legal definition but nonetheless have a genuine humanitarian case.
This current minister has been reasonably active in trying to acknowledge some of those 
 special cases. All those people have to go through the Refugee Review Tribunal process to get to the minister and to get him to exercise his discretion. He  obviously does not exercise his discretion in favour of everybody that seeks it, but quite a reasonable number of those people could easily and credibly claim to be genuine asylum seekers, not abusers of the system. All of those people are subject to this $1,000 fee that the committee was investigating. The $1,000 fee was brought in a couple of years ago in conjunction with a number of other measures which were aimed at addressing alleged abuses of the system. The Democrats opposed those measures at the time and voted in favour of a disallowance motion which Senator Margetts moved, from memory. It was before I came into this chamber. I think my colleague Senator Stott Despoja, who handled the matter for the Democrats at that time, supported Senator Margetts's concerns. In many ways some of the other changes that were made that will still remain in place and have no sunset clause have the potential to cause greater injustice than this $1,000 post-decision fee measure which is subject to a sunset clause.
One of the other difficulties with this inquiry was trying to separate the effect the $1,000 post-decision fee might have had on reducing abuse of the system from the effects of all the other measures that were brought in at the time. The committee, and I think even the department, had to acknowledge that it really was not able to be done. It was not possible to separate the impact of the $1,000 from the impact of all the other different measures that were also brought in.
I take the point Senator McKiernan made that, in some respects, the changes have been in operation for such a short length of time that it is a bit difficult to draw conclusive conclusions about the impacts of the measures. It is still taking a while for them to work their way through the system. I would acknowledge that point but turn it around the other way and say that the onus should be on proving that these measures do not impair genuine asylum seekers from seeking asylum. Clearly, it is also a fundamental requirement 
 of our refugee system that we do not unfairly or unreasonably deter genuine asylum seekers. I think that is where the burden of proof must lie and, if we are taking a precautionary approach, that is the approach that we must take. I do not think that that was able to be clearly established either. When we are looking at wanting to get evidence about whether genuine asylum seekers have been deterred by this fee or by genuine hardship, we need to prove it from the other direction just as much as prove that it is having a negative impact. It is for that reason that I lent my name to the minority aspect of this report.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasise and concur with the thanks to the committee secretariat for their role in this inquiry. I emphasise again that the whole aspect of our humanitarian refugee program is an important one and one that there is great public interest in. There are a range of opinions about how best to deal with some of these difficult issues. We recognise the fact that we cannot help every single genuine refugee on the planet, but we do need to make sure that Australia not only plays its part but also does not do anything which acts against genuine asylum seekers and sends genuine asylum seekers back to a situation of danger. That is something else that we need to ensure.
It is obviously important to stop abuse, and the Democrats acknowledge that. We acknowledge that there is a level of abuse, although perhaps it is not as high as is sometimes suggested. But it is also equally important to ensure that the system operates in a way that does not negate our basic human rights obligations. That is the perspective from which I approach this issue. The Democrats approach these issues more broadly in relation to the operation of our refugee program. It is an issue that will be an ongoing one and one that I am sure we will revisit a number of times in this chamber in the future. It is appropriate that we should, given that it is an issue of such public interest and public importance. I look forward to ongoing and constructive debate from all sides as we try, together, to work out the best possible system for meeting our basic human rights obliga 
 tions in relation to refugees and our humanitarian program.

"McKiernan, Sen James",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration entitled `Review of Migration Regulation 4.31B', together with submissions, Hansard  record and minutes of proceedings. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report. 

I wish to put on the record the committee's acknowledgment of the very fine work done by the secretariat staff of the committee. They were, for the record, Margaret Swieringa, Gim Del Villar, Penne Humphries, Rohan Tyler and Margaret Atkin.
The regulation 4.31B was introduced on 1 July 1997 as part of a package of measures to combat abuse in Australia's refugee determination system. Other measures included streamlining processing of primary applications and limiting work rights to applicants who applied within 45 days of entering Australia.
The aim of the package was to deter people who knew they were not refugees but were using the refugee appeal process to prolong their stay here, often for the purposes of obtaining income from employment in Australia. The purpose of regulation 4.31B was, in conjunction with other measures, to deter non-genuine applicants from appealing to the Refugee Review Tribunal after their primary application had been unsuccessful. The regulation imposed a $1,000 fee on applicants whose appeals to the RRT failed. Successful applicants to the RRT were not required to pay the fee of $1,000 and neither were unsuccessful applicants to the RRT who were subsequently granted protection visas on the basis of ministerial discretion. It was not suggested then that regulation 4.31B was a revenue raising measure, nor was it suggested at the time that the revenue raised by the fee was to be used to offset departmental costs in other areas of the portfolio.
The regulation was controversial, and the then shadow minister for immigration, Duncan Kerr, agreed to the package on condition that a number of its provisions be changed. Those changes are already on the public record. One of the conditions imposed which the government agreed to was that the regulation be subject to a sunset clause and that a review of its operations and effect be conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. This report is the result of that review.
I participated in all of the committee's public hearings, and I have read and studied all of the submissions. From this process I 
 have formed my own conclusions on the regulation. My conclusions differ from those of my Labor colleagues on the committee, and I have provided a direct, succinct additional comment at page 45 of the report which elucidates further on the reasons I formed the views that I did. In formulating my conclusions I relied upon the evidence that was presented to the committee—evidence which, I might add, was tested with the witnesses who provided the evidence to the committee. The evidence was tested, sometimes quite vigorously, and cannot therefore be dismissed.
Many of the witnesses—who came with impeccable credentials—agreed that, even now, with the conditions that were put in place two years ago, the internal onshore refugee application system continues to be abused. I have noted in my additional comments some comments from the Refugee Council of Australia—the peak refugee organisation in this country. I have also itemised comments on the matter made by the Secretary-General of the Australian Section of the International Commission for Jurists, Mr David Bitel, and I have drawn attention to the comments of Ms Grace Gardner from the Adelaide Justice Coalition and a number of others.
I particularly want to draw attention to the words of Ms Caroline Graydon from the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre. I will quote what she said. I know it is a duplication, but it is well worth duplicating. Ms Graydon told the committee at the Melbourne hearings:
From my own personal knowledge, I am not aware of any cases where I thought a person had very strong prospects of success but had been deterred by applying due to the $1000 penalty fee. Some people are driven by such strong subjective fear that I do consider it to be unlikely that someone who faces persecution, or has a well-founded fear of persecution, in their home country would be deterred.
On every possible opportunity I asked the witnesses to provide evidence of people who had been deterred from making an application because of this post-decision fee. Nobody was forthcoming. I put it to the Senate—as I put it to the committee when we were deliberating on the report—that, if anybody would know 
 about a deterrent, people such as Caroline Graydon, the Refugee Council of Australia and Mr David Bitel certainly would have known, and I am sure they would have put it on the public record when they had the opportunity to do so at the committee hearings.
We were given some case studies of people who allegedly were suffering because of the fee, and I have noted those case studies in my 3½ pages of additional comment. They are on the public record for anybody to examine. In a sense, I think those case studies actually help the argument for the minister's case that the fee should be retained.
Notwithstanding what I have said, I agree with the majority of the committee and their report that it is probably too early to judge the effectiveness of the measure. Effectively, the measure has been in existence for only 18 months. I know it is now almost a two-year period, but at the time we were examining it and taking evidence it had been in operation for about 18 months to 21 months. Many witnesses to the hearings agreed that it was a very short time frame and that many of the applications that had been before the RRT and were being adjudicated on actually had been in the system prior to the fee coming into operation.
I have agreed with my colleagues that the sunset clause should be extended for a further three years and that, prior to the expiration of that sunset clause, it should be subjected to a more thorough assessment of its effectiveness. Let me at this stage inject a note of caution and a warning. I mentioned earlier that regulation 4.31B was not a revenue raising measure, nor was it an offsetting cost initiative. I now await specific clarification from the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on this matter. This clarification is necessary as a result of a sentence in his press statement MPS/99 dated 11 May 1999 where he said:
If the fee was continued it would provide a partial cost recovery and help offset the cost of a limited extension of the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme.
I have been advised through the office of the shadow minister, Mr Con Sciacca, that a letter 
 will be forthcoming from the minister that gives the assurance that there is absolutely no policy link between the fee and the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme.
I hope that that letter will be forthcoming and I hope the clarification will be forthcoming. If it is not, I state clearly here that I will be arguing in my party room that we support any disallowance motion, if such a disallowance motion is moved, in the event of the minister seeking to continue the fee. There should be no link between this fee and the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme. There never has been and, if there is going to be that linkage now, I for one will not be standing here in this chamber or in my party room supporting such a proposition. It was never the case in the past and it should not be the case now. I certainly await the minister's written reply. I have been assured that that is forthcoming. It would have been easier had we been able to be given that assurance during the Senate estimates committee processes a couple of weeks ago, but I do understand that the public servants could not publicly stand up and contradict their minister. The ball on this matter is clearly in the minister's court, and I have put on the record how I will be arguing if that letter and that assurance are not forthcoming. I commend the report to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,8,2,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-06-21,"—I too would like to speak to this report as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. It was quite a useful and thorough inquiry, as many of the inquiries conducted by that committee are. It highlighted again not just issues relating specifically to the $1,000 fee but a lot of other issues that relate more broadly to the operation of our refugee program and our humanitarian program onshore. Subsequent to this inquiry taking place, the Senate has agreed to look more broadly at the operation of our refugee program via the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, which the previous speaker is the chair of. Hopefully, we will be able to look in more detail at some of those issues.
The reason that reference was agreed to is that I think it is recognised by people coming 
 from many different perspectives of the debate surrounding refugee issues that these are complex issues and issues of great importance which involve quite fundamental and vital matters of human rights. It is also a question of addressing those through specific practical mechanisms. Of course, there is the problem of ensuring that those fundamental human rights are addressed using a system which, unfortunately, some people do choose to abuse. I think that does give rise to difficulties in terms of how best to address those problems of abuse. It is obviously not in the interests of genuine asylum seekers to have their access to justice and access to the system affected by other people who are abusing that system. So I think it is in everybody's interests to try and examine mechanisms to minimise abuse. Obviously those mechanisms need to be ones that do not compromise a fundamental necessity for our humanitarian program to address the human rights of genuine asylum seekers.
It is worth making the point in relation to this specific issue, as with any issue relating to the broader humanitarian program, that just because people seeking asylum appeal to the Refugee Review Tribunal and are knocked back, that does not automatically mean that they are deliberately abusing the system. I think that implication was raised a number of times during the course of inquiry—that this somehow or other the number of people who are unsuccessful at the Refugee Review Tribunal could be broadly equated with the number of people who are abusing the system. Quite clearly that is not a fair assessment to make. The legal definition in relation to getting refugee status in Australia is quite narrow and there are many people in what are quite clearly situations of genuine humanitarian need who do not technically fit within that definition. They still go through the system because they have a genuine need to seek asylum. Indeed, that is one of the reasons why the ministerial discretionary power exists—to address some of those people who do not fit neatly into the legal definition but nonetheless have a genuine humanitarian case.
This current minister has been reasonably active in trying to acknowledge some of those 
 special cases. All those people have to go through the Refugee Review Tribunal process to get to the minister and to get him to exercise his discretion. He  obviously does not exercise his discretion in favour of everybody that seeks it, but quite a reasonable number of those people could easily and credibly claim to be genuine asylum seekers, not abusers of the system. All of those people are subject to this $1,000 fee that the committee was investigating. The $1,000 fee was brought in a couple of years ago in conjunction with a number of other measures which were aimed at addressing alleged abuses of the system. The Democrats opposed those measures at the time and voted in favour of a disallowance motion which Senator Margetts moved, from memory. It was before I came into this chamber. I think my colleague Senator Stott Despoja, who handled the matter for the Democrats at that time, supported Senator Margetts's concerns. In many ways some of the other changes that were made that will still remain in place and have no sunset clause have the potential to cause greater injustice than this $1,000 post-decision fee measure which is subject to a sunset clause.
One of the other difficulties with this inquiry was trying to separate the effect the $1,000 post-decision fee might have had on reducing abuse of the system from the effects of all the other measures that were brought in at the time. The committee, and I think even the department, had to acknowledge that it really was not able to be done. It was not possible to separate the impact of the $1,000 from the impact of all the other different measures that were also brought in.
I take the point Senator McKiernan made that, in some respects, the changes have been in operation for such a short length of time that it is a bit difficult to draw conclusive conclusions about the impacts of the measures. It is still taking a while for them to work their way through the system. I would acknowledge that point but turn it around the other way and say that the onus should be on proving that these measures do not impair genuine asylum seekers from seeking asylum. Clearly, it is also a fundamental requirement 
 of our refugee system that we do not unfairly or unreasonably deter genuine asylum seekers. I think that is where the burden of proof must lie and, if we are taking a precautionary approach, that is the approach that we must take. I do not think that that was able to be clearly established either. When we are looking at wanting to get evidence about whether genuine asylum seekers have been deterred by this fee or by genuine hardship, we need to prove it from the other direction just as much as prove that it is having a negative impact. It is for that reason that I lent my name to the minority aspect of this report.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasise and concur with the thanks to the committee secretariat for their role in this inquiry. I emphasise again that the whole aspect of our humanitarian refugee program is an important one and one that there is great public interest in. There are a range of opinions about how best to deal with some of these difficult issues. We recognise the fact that we cannot help every single genuine refugee on the planet, but we do need to make sure that Australia not only plays its part but also does not do anything which acts against genuine asylum seekers and sends genuine asylum seekers back to a situation of danger.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-06-21,"—I would like to respond briefly to the comments made by Senator Allison in relation to the Democrat objection to my amendment 5. The reason I want to respond is to explain why the inclusion of a so-called social bonus in relation to the sale of a further part of Telstra is inappropriate. We have seen a number of statements by this government over time in relation to bonuses. We heard, leading up to the 1996 election, all sorts of statements in relation to the bonuses to the environment. What is the reality in that case for the environment? The reality is that the government of course pulled money out of the environment fund—and we have seen a huge drop in total environment funding—so all it was doing was basically using the sale of a public asset as a means of removing support for the provision of other services.
I have just received a letter from the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union—the CEPU—who want to talk about the Rural Transaction Centres Program and the sale of Telstra. I will quote from the letter where they are talking about the decline of rural banking services and in Australia Post outlets:
In this light we are concerned at recent statements concerning the Rural Transactions Centre Program and its connection to the further sale of Telstra. While the notion of re-establishing basic services such as banking, telecommunications, post and Medicare services in rural areas is laudable, this union fears that key aspects of the RTC program could in fact see a further reduction in services to these areas.
This is not just a fanciful statement when you look at what happened to the environment program. We objected of course—as many people did—to the fact that you could pick out something that many people support, like a better standard for the environment, and make it contingent on the further sale of part of Telstra. But here we have it again in relation to the provision of social services or the so-called social bonus. I do not believe this government when they indicate that, somehow or other, this is something extra. What I believe is that they will do what they have done before and consider these as 
 optional and only contingent on further sales of assets, such as perhaps the next chunk of Telstra, so I do not wish to give the government credibility on this.
It is not a matter of giving the government pats on the head when they have done something good; I believe it is a further justification for doing what they are doing and what they will be doing in the future. It is not even a matter of making this bill acceptable, as the ALP has indicated in relation to some amendments. It is a matter of justifying the con that we saw in relation to the first tranche of Telstra, which has—quite clearly and demonstrably—simply been an excuse for pulling out funding from areas that most Australians think are important, and quite clearly the government can be shown in the Senate and in the budget papers to have done so.
Here we have a situation where perhaps we are making these important services dependent on this and further sales of Telstra, and therefore the funding for those issues simply falls off if there are no further sales of such assets coming. So it is not just a slip of the mind by the Greens (WA) in not including that contingent on the sale of Telstra. We believe that those issues are things that the community does believe governments have a responsibility to fund. They should not be contingent on the sale of Telstra because, as has clearly been demonstrated, the ongoing revenue from the sale of Telstra and other public assets could in fact be used for the provision of these kinds of services and it does not require the sale to justify these services.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-06-21,"—I want to put some questions to the minister at this point about the social bonus package. I note that the minister's press release of 8 March talks about $150 million in funding which is going to install telecommunications infrastructure for untimed local call access to 37,000 families and households who live in outer extended zones in remote Australia and to replace the pastoral call with a much fairer preferential call rate. I want to ask the minister whether this addresses the criticism which was put by the Isolated Children's Parents Association, who said in their submis 
 sion that isolated families feel as though they have been slighted by the government's social bonus package.
The association will not accept the `ageing Telstra' argument that the provision of untimed local calls within an extended zone between neighbouring extended zones and to local service towns will cause excessive congestion. It says Telstra have never produced documentation to support their argument. It says isolated families living in the outer extended zone will receive very little benefit from this social bonus; they will still have timed calls to their service town, their School of Distance Education, their children boarding at the local boarding facilities, their local doctor, their local banks and their local Internet provider. The list goes on to include virtually every service and social contact that is accessible untimed to their urban counterparts. The association says:
This is not a cost issue—
and it goes on to say—
the issue is one of equity, of comparable benefits, of implementing and enforcing solid legislation reassuring isolated rural/remote dwellers that their interests can be protected by the universal service obligation and that they need not fear further privatisation and sale of Telstra.
I wonder at this point if the minister could respond to that criticism.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—The provision of up to $150 million to provide untimed local calls in remote Australia is a huge breakthrough. Until now there were very significant areas of land occupied by a relatively small number of people who were simply required to pay for long distance calls—and indeed often even the preferential rate was only, I think, four minutes for 25c—and Telstra always ran this argument that, if you were to somehow do what we are now proposing to do, that would clog up the system. We therefore made that money available in order to put the hardware and infrastructure in place so that Telstra does not have that threshold argument to run.
But if you were to go further than that and to effectively advocate, as Senator Allison's quotation seems to do, that there should be 
 local calls between extended zones, you would be effectively ripping up the whole notion of call zones. You would be having calls that might be 1,000 or 2,000 kilometres apart but, because they happen to fall between two defined extended zones, they would become a 25c untimed local call. Whilst there are those who would argue quite radically that the true cost of calls does not come close to the actual calling rate, it is a big step to argue that you should effectively treat Australia as one local call zone, or that you should treat states as one local call zone or large areas of sparse population as one call zone.
Whilst the transmission cost, once the equipment is in place, may be not nearly as high as it is now, the fact is that the rollout is what often costs a lot of the money. Certainly, you defeat the whole notion of call zones if you are able to convert two extended zones into one local call zone. You would certainly do away with the notion of community calls and even a preferential rate. People who were 50 kilometres outside the metropolitan area would say, `This is ludicrous. Why shouldn't we have a local call rate when people who are thousands of kilometres away from each other in extended outer zones are able to have local call rates?' The cascading effect of that sort of comparative justice would cause the collapse of the whole zoning system. What we have done is to make it, we think, a lot fairer. That is quite some distance away from arguing that there should not be any zones at all. From what I heard of your proposal, that is getting pretty close to it.
—Minister, it is not my proposal.

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-06-21,"—The reason I rise to speak—
Senator Alston interjecting—
—Listen, bonehead, you are doing about as well as Collingwood are at the moment, footballwise.
—There can only be one reason why you're here, and that's to fill in time. 
—To try to fill your head in would be a better description, Minister. It is so vacuous at the moment. There are two matters to raise but if the minister keeps provoking me I will think of 25 issues to raise. I will not do so: I will just stick to the two issues. One relates to call zones. The minister responded to Senator Allison on the basis of a suggestion that the Democrats may have made or alluded to that you get rid of all call zones. There is no doubt that there are some areas in Australia—and the technology is making it available—where the cost of the present structure of STD call zones should be rapidly moving in favour of the consumer.
One thing I want to put on record here—unfortunately, Senator Harradine is not in the chamber—is that in the deal that he has done with the government in getting extra funding for everything that apparently moves and does not move in Tasmania the one thing I have not seen in the press is his taking up the suggestion that we made at the last election to have all of Tasmania included as one local call zone. Obviously that proved very popular in Tasmania. We won five seats out of five and we won three senators out of six. It was the worst Liberal Party result, I think, since 1972 or 1974. That was a regional development issue for Tasmania. Of course, we know that Eric Abetz was helping us all the time, just by being there.
Senator O'Brien interjecting—
—Jocelyn was handing him back.
—The help from my Tasmanian colleagues I cannot ignore. It is true that the quality of the Liberal Party in Tasmania did help us significantly in winning the five seats and at least half the Senate seats for Tasmania. The minister may correct me: Senator Harradine may have this on the list and you may have agreed to it. But for all the individual lumps of money that he has got for Tasmania—there is investment overwhelmingly in capital equipment, in one-off projects and in improving the infrastructure for expansion of the Internet and so on—everybody in Australia knows that the fundamental issue about getting people access to the new forms 
 of communication overwhelmingly is the cost, the charging rate. From what we were able to calculate, if the whole of Tasmania became one local call zone it would cost Telstra, in revenue, no more than $25 million a year, from a revenue of $17 billion. We saw this as a way of encouraging economic and regional development for the whole of Tasmania by reducing the costs, in particular, of small business in Tasmania doing their business within Tasmania.
As the minister represents small business in the chamber, I thought that might have resonated with him a little. This is not a large amount of money. When we did our calculation and announced it, I did not see the minister throwing hand grenades or bombs at it as a crazed idea: he just ignored it. I did not see any announcement from Telstra that this would send them broke and that it was a terrible decision on their charging system. I hope I can stand to be corrected, that this is the one thing that Senator Harradine may have got for Tasmania—that is, the abolition of the STD charging zones, that a phone call from anywhere to anywhere in Tasmania will be at the untimed rate of 25c per call.
If Senator Harradine has not got that on his agenda to negotiate with the government, I think he has given Tasmania away very cheaply. This is not a one-off amount that is paid and then disappears: it is $25 million a year for this year and every year thereafter. Every year thereafter there is a significant reduction in communication costs in Tasmania. I am more than a little surprised why Senator Harradine would not put this on the agenda and demand that this be the fundamental benefit that Tasmania would get. He knows how popular this is in Tasmania. He knows that the opposition is still committed to this policy.
In the first shadow ministry meeting held in Tasmania after the election, the first policy that Kim Beazley, on behalf of the Labor Party, recommitted us to for the next election was turning Tasmania into one local call zone. It was very popular policy in Tasmania, and it is extremely important for the economic development of Tasmania to get their cost structure down. I have not yet seen all the 
 details of the deal, but I find it extraordinary that Senator Harradine would have missed this one on the way through. If he had forced it out of you, we may have ground our teeth a little and showed some chagrin that our excellent idea had been taken over by Senator Harradine, but at least the Tasmanian people would have got what undoubtedly would have been an improvement in their communications costs.
Minister, through Telstra, all the regulatory organisations and your own department you have access to more information than all the rest of us on this side, and you know as well as we do that the cost per unit of making a call from anywhere in Australia is rapidly coming down. The real issue is: who is going to benefit from cheaper calls—the shareholders you want to take over the company or all Australians, the whole 18 million? The best way to provide them with cheaper calls is to ensure that the present inherited structure of STD call zones, which has been around now for nearly 30 years, changes. It should not be used as a way of gouging profits out of people in regional Australia to go into the bottom line of Telstra. We want some benefit to go back to the consumer.
The technology has changed rapidly in only the last three or four years to allow this to occur. We do not mind that the Australian people get the benefit. That is why we are in favour of full public ownership of Telstra. Even if they were making some excess profit at the consumer end, it would always come back to the consumer as a dividend to the government which would be reinvested in Australia. With your policy of privatisation you will get 16 per cent out of Senator Harradine. We believe you have to get serious about ensuring that all the telecommunications consumers, particularly in regional Australia, start getting the benefit of what technology can provide in calls around Australia. Although we may not yet be able to agree with some suggestion that the whole of Australia should be one local call zone, there is no doubt that if technology and switching equipment continue to develop at the present pace, the cost of making calls from anywhere to anywhere in Australia will be extremely cheap 
 indeed and those benefits should be available to all consumers.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-06-21,"—I want to follow up my first question. Minister, I was not asking that untimed local calls be available across Australia, although like Senator Schacht I agree it is time we had a good look at that—it ought to be affordable. My question is specifically about rural and remote dwellers. The ask from the Isolated Children's Parents Association—again, I think it is reasonable—was that rural remote dwellers have untimed local calls within the customer's extended zone. That is not anywhere in Australia but between neighbouring extended zones and between their extended zones and their nearest service centre. We are not asking for all calls everywhere to be untimed; simply, we are asking for some of the benefits which those who live in rural areas enjoy over and above isolated dwellers. That was my point.
There are such generous parts of this package for things like continuous mobile phone coverage along 11 of the nation's busiest highways, which again I would argue is of more benefit to urban dwellers, people who travel from city to city and those people in the not so remote regional areas. This is not going to benefit people who are a long distance from any sort of centre. I would argue that we have very generous telecommunications packages for people who already have reasonably good access, but not for this very important group of people for whom the costs of, and the lack of, telecommunications services are really serious problems. I ask the minister for his comment on my first remarks.
The next point in the submission is that the telephone rebate scheme does not address the legislated right of the majority of people who live and work in remote rural areas, unless they personally are the registered subscribers on the phone line on which they make their calls. There are many families in remote areas with children in distance education who will still pay full STD rates to contact their teacher.
The government has accepted Telstra's preferred model of providing a comparable benefit to untimed local calls instead of 
 listening to the people who live in remote rural areas. No other people in Australia have a cap on their local call expenditure, so why should these residents be any different? Many of these isolated remote rural residents are women who  through necessity teach their children via distance education. They can be caring for children with disabilities or medical problems and ageing family members, and are not the actual subscriber on the phone. So they do not receive a rebate and hence no untimed local call, as remote rural residents are experiencing.
It is very important that there can be networking between residents. They should know that they are not alone but are supported in their isolation and need for contact. And they should not have to worry about incurring a high expense. It should be at an untimed local call rate. Minister, can you respond to those very important pleas in this submission from the Isolated Children's Parents Association?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—I am not sure that I fully understand the point but, to the extent that your concerns about distance education revolve around children being able to have access to the Internet at local call rates, the $36 million that we are providing will do just that. In other words, everyone in Australia will have the capacity to hook onto the Internet at local call charges. Indeed, I give credit to Senator Boswell for squeezing the last $11 million out of us on that front to ensure that it was a truly universal scheme. Beyond that, if you are arguing that people in remote areas should simply be able to make local calls irrespective of where the call is, I am afraid that goes against the logic of zones. I am not sure where you draw the line. We certainly have gone a considerable distance in providing this latest capacity, but I am not sure how much beyond that you go, short of effectively abolishing all the zones.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-06-21,"—I will go through it again. I was not talking about abolishing all the zones. The request is that isolated people in remote areas have untimed local calls within the customer's extended zone, between neighbouring extend 
 ed zones, and between their extended zones and their nearest service centre. We are not talking about the whole country; we are just talking about a fairly limited area within which these people are saying they should have untimed calls.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—Within extended zones they do get a local call charge. To the nearest community service town they get the preferential rate, which is now 12 minutes for 25c, as opposed to four minutes under the old community rate. I find it very difficult to accept the proposition that you need to spend more than 12 minutes on the phone to a community service town. If it is an emergency call, you certainly do not have time to spend more than 12 minutes on it. If you cannot accomplish your business with your community service town, which is in theory at least meant to be the place where most of the tradespeople you deal with are located, it greatly puzzles me to think you would argue that you effectively need—
—What is the cost of the 12-minute call on average?
—It is going to be a lot more than 25c, presumably. This is a concessionary rate because otherwise it would be a long-distance call. Traditionally, it has been regarded as a community call, which is four minutes. We are extending a four-minute—
Senator Schacht interjecting—
—There was previously a community call rate of 25c every four minutes. Now it is 12 minutes. Given that the average local voice call is still only three to four minutes, I cannot possibly see why that is not effectively an untimed local call. They are getting an untimed local call within the zones and effectively one to the community service town.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-06-21,"—Picking up on the minister's remarks from a moment ago about the Internet: to what degree will the network of rural transaction centres meet the needs of people in remote areas? I do not know how many of these centres there are going to be in this $70 
 million initiative, but will they be outside regional centres? It seems to me that this does not offer a great deal to those remote families who depend on longer calls. I will just mention an example of one of their needs, that is, for children to talk with distance education teachers. People in remote areas need better access—and many of them do not have access at all—to Internet services because of their isolation.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—The Rural Transaction Centres Program will involve funds being made available to help small communities establish their own centres providing access to basic transaction services, such as banking, postal services, Medicare easy claim facilities, phone and fax. Rural communities with populations of up to 3,000 are eligible for assistance. However, the program is also open to other towns with a strong case. My recollection is that in the order of 500 places are likely to benefit, but the actual detail will be developed by Senator Macdonald as the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government.

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I wonder if I can get an answer about whether you had any consideration from Senator Harradine about turning Tasmania into one local call zone. Senator Bishop has just reminded me that in the package announced by press release yesterday Tasmania got $150 million all up, out of one bill. By our calculation at the last election, which no-one has disputed, we would say to all Tasmanians that turning Tasmania into one local call zone would mean $25 million in total per annum. Within six years that amount would reach the $150 million under your program and after that there would be a net saving. That is the point we wish to make. I am surprised that Senator Harradine has got individual amounts of money out of you—squeezed you very hard—but, in the end, a bigger benefit for all Tasmanians would be to have Tasmania turned into one local call zone. ",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—That clearly is not Senator Harradine's assessment of the situation. It is not a proposal that has been seriously considered in any of our discussions. In fact, I remember when this was put on the table during the election campaign. Indeed, it was accompanied by an outrageous proposition from Mr Beazley, put out selectively in a local press release, that residents of Mandurah—which just happened to be in his electorate—would also get local call charges. Talk about selective treatment! I do not know by what logic that could be extended to Tasmania, other than, as Senator Schacht quite ingenuously says, `It helped us win two seats.' That was presumably about the only logic involved; otherwise it was an outrageous preference for a particular group or location. How you would resist—
—What are you doing now?
—Do you want the answer to your question? What we are doing now is offering a package of benefits that will be enormously more beneficial to creating the right infrastructure and the right educational, economic and social benefits for Tasmania to turn it into an intelligent island. I do not see what is particularly intelligent about giving one group of the population local call rates that no-one else gets, simply because they have a couple of marginal seats on offer. That is basically your logic. That did not appeal to us, I have to say. When you announced it at the time, I saw it as the death knell for your performance and, quite clearly, it was. But it was not something we were going to emulate and I do not think anyone else has seriously emulated it since.
If you want a further testimonial, look at what Premier Bacon had to say in the papers today. He welcomed it as a very constructive package for Tasmania. So whilst you might have thought it was very smart politics to pick up a couple of marginal seats, everyone else obviously saw it for what it was: a grubby little bribe that was trotted out at a moment in time when you did not think you were going to win anyway but you managed 
 to con a couple of people in a few marginal electorates in Tasmania. We are much more interested in taking a national approach to these issues. If you are serious about reforming call zones, you do not do it by looking at where the marginal seats are and you do not do it by preferring one state ahead of all the others; you do it on a logical, rational basis. And I have not heard any evidence that you even understand what that means.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I now wish to turn to something that was raised in estimates two weeks ago and to which I again wish to draw the Senate's attention. On 26 and 27 May the minister said that there were no plans to close any call centres in Australia and that Telstra's plans are to grow the call centre business. Yet at the Senate estimates hearing I was able to provide evidence, which the staff from Telstra did not in any way disagree with, that the Adelaide and Brisbane MobileNet centres would be significantly changed in the way they operated, that the employment levels of the staff would be turned from permanent to temporary and casual and that there was no guarantee that a number of call centres in my own state of South Australia would all be maintained. The best we got from Telstra was that they hoped they would be maintained at such places as Murray Bridge, Mount Gambier, Kadina and Port Pirie—just to name some of them. Minister, where are we at with your promise in late May that no call centres would be closed when, in the estimates, Telstra quite honestly—and I congratulated them on their honesty—could not give that guarantee?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—If ever we needed evidence of a filibuster, we have just had it. This line has got nothing whatsoever to do with anything that is before the Senate. You paddled around on this for about three quarters of an hour in estimates and you got nowhere. You consistently want to run the line that somehow call centres are a downgrading of employment opportunities when you well know they are one of the big growth sectors. But your union mates keep telling 
 you they are sweatshops so you trot out the party line. It has nothing to do with the price of fish, let alone this bill. It is simply demonstrable evidence that you have been sent in here to fill in time.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-06-21,"—Minister, I mention the MobileNet centre in Brisbane in particular as one which would have its staffing conditions changed, according to evidence given by the Telstra staff at estimates. Also, in view of the fact that I understand that Senator Colston has made some remarks that he wants to ensure that employment with Telstra in regional Queensland is not adversely affected, does your statement in late May guarantee Senator Colston and Queensland that all existing call centres, including the 013 regional call centres, are going to be maintained at the present level of employment?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I am aware that we are debating schedule 2 of the bill, which is a significant part of the bill to further privatise Telstra. One of the fundamental issues in the community, Minister, which you may be absolutely deaf to, is that there is a substantial majority of Australians opposed to any further privatisation of Telstra because, when you use the word `privatisation', to them it means reduced services and lost jobs, particularly in regional Australia. You gave an assurance in the Senate in late May that jobs would be protected in call centres, irrespective of the privatisation process. That is why I am asking you now, when you have apparently reached a deal with Senator Colston and Senator Harradine to sell a further 16 per cent, whether your promise of 24 and 26 May still stands—that there would be no job losses in the call centres with the 16 per cent privatisation. That is what I raised in estimates. That is what I raise here. It is absolute 
 ly part of the debate we are now having on this schedule and on other clauses of this bill.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I want to carry on from comments made by Senator Schacht. Minister, we might get more specific and not just talk about South Australia but perhaps talk about Tasmania in relation to the call centres. I want you, if you would, to give some indication to the Senate that there will be no diminution of employment in the call centres in Tasmania into the future—along the lines of the commitment that you gave previously that Senator Schacht has alluded to. Would you also give us a commitment that the directory assistance call centres in both Hobart and Burnie will not be either closed or casualised, given that there are a number of full-time staff there at the moment? We understand—and you are the minister and you may be able to clarify this for us—that there is a desire by Telstra, as Senator Schacht indicated, to centralise these sorts of operations. It is utterly germane to the argument and the discussions we are having now. I ask you those two questions: will the directory assistance call centres in Hobart and Burnie remain under current staffing levels, and will they remain open?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—This is even more outrageous. Senator Mackay well knows, because we canvassed it before lunch, that not only has Vodafone established a brand-new call centre there with the potential for hundreds of jobs but also something like 2,500 jobs have been committed to Tasmania by way of call centres in the last year or two. We are talking about a huge growth area, and you have the cheek to get up and ask me about the likelihood of reductions in employment in relation to call centres. The matter under debate at the moment is whether the social bonus provisions and provisions enabling the sale of Telstra shares beyond one-third should be omitted from the bill. The questions that I have been asked have got nothing to do with that, and I have got nothing to add.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-06-21,"—Let us do a quick summation of where 
 we are at in relation to the questions that the minister will not answer specifically on Tasmania, and Senator Bishop and Senator Schacht can outline their own. We currently have a situation whereby you, Minister, will not provide us with adequate information on staffing levels in Tasmania. We have a situation where you have refused to rule out 60 redundancies post the magic 30 June date in terms of the operational staff. We have a situation where you have refused to rule out a potential further 30 redundancies in the data purity area in Tasmania.
And now we have a situation where you have refused to rule out closure or diminution of the Telstra call centres, the directory assistance call centres in Hobart and Launceston in Tasmania. That is where we are at. You have not answered a single one of the issues that we have raised. I just want to say that so everyone understands where we are in relation to that.
Let us move on to another part of the deal with Senator Harradine which we traversed most inadequately from your perspective previously, and that is the issue of the one-area establishment. Minister, you would be well aware, because you gave the commitment to Senator Harradine in the first place, that the work management centre in Hobart was rationalised out of Hobart because of Tasmania's diminution of status in relation to the area issue. As you would also be aware, there was the abolition of the fault reduction centre in Bendigo and the removal of that fault reduction centre to Launceston, as a result of the Vic-Tas regional initiative. What I would like to know at this point is: as a result of the arrangements made with Senator Harradine, will Tasmania get back the work management centre, in recognition of its new status as a region? Will Bendigo get back its fault reduction centre, as a result of the separation of the Vic-Tas region?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—I am asked about an agreement with Senator Harradine. All I would say is that we made announcements yesterday which are contained in a press release, which I presume Senator Mackay has 
 read. I would not expect Senator Schacht to have got around to reading it, but it spells out the nature and extent of the additions to the Telstra social bonus. On that basis, as I understood what he had to say yesterday and today, Senator Harradine regards that as a big win for Tasmania. So does the Premier of Tasmania, and so does anyone with an open mind on the subject. That is the basis of the way in which we will be proceeding to make commitments to all states, including Tasmania.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I want to clarify that the Premier of Tasmania has made it explicitly clear that he opposes any further privatisation of Telstra in Tasmania. He has made that very clear on a number of occasions—
—He's a boofhead.
—So let us put that one to rest right now. Minister, you again refuse to answer these issues.
—Excuse me, Senator Mackay. Minister, you will withdraw that remark, thank you.
—I am sorry. I was just using a term that Senator Murphy had used about the Premier of Tasmania.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I want to raise a few issues arising out of schedule 2, the matter under discussion before the chamber. In schedule 2 there is an allocation of $1.35 billion to the Natural Heritage Trust. Part 9, clause 43 gives the simplified outline of this part: rural transaction centres—$75 million over five years; extended access to untimed local calls—$150 million over three years; meeting the telecommunications needs of people in isolated island communities in the Antarctic Territory; Internet access for people in rural and regional areas—$36 million over three years; mobile phone coverage along 
 highways—$25 million; and a range of other matters. Later on in schedule 2, divisions 2, 3, 4 and 5 essentially establish the funds and provide authority for allocation of the funds and presumably, in due course, for disbursement of those funds by the relevant agencies of departments that have been given that responsibility.
Yesterday there was a series of press releases: three or four by the minister, one by Senator Ian Campbell, one by the minister for regional affairs, Mr Anderson, joint press releases from three or four government senators from Tasmania and a couple of press releases from joint coalition senators in Queensland. They outlined, from a range of perspectives, the additional $314 million that the government has allocated by way of social bonus in this process. There was a range of descriptions, and the minister's press release is quite comprehensive in the detail of the social bonus. The BITS program gets $158 million; the BARN program, Building Additional Regional Networks, $70 million; Networking the Nation local government fund, $45 million; expanded mobile phone coverage, $3 million—a little sweetie given to South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania for no apparent reason apart from the fact that they did not qualify for other programs, which is a useful precedent; and Trials in Innovative Government Electronic Regional Services—TIGERS—which we will return to.
There will be environmental spending, money for connecting Tasmanian schools and a couple of little beauties down there: an athletics centre in Tasmania is going to have its track upgraded to the value of $600,000, and there will be a couple of other minor allocations of funds in Tasmania. So there is $314 million in addition to the $670-odd million already allocated as part of the social bonus.
I was interested in Senator Margetts's earlier comments when she responded to matters raised by Senator Allison. She hit the nail right on the head when she said that, as far as her party was concerned, no-one seriously quarrels with the proposition that a lot of the programs outlined for funding in the social bonus are worthy programs, and that 
 people in rural and remote areas should have access over time, at sound cost, to the same sorts of programs that we in the cities regard as basic. Indeed, most of the little beauties that have been added down in Tasmania are probably worthwhile programs in their own right.
There is no real reason to be overtly critical of the nature of their programs but probably good reason to be critical of the allocation of funds and why it is so critical to allocate $158 million here and $40 million there to things in Tasmania. I am sure all Tasmanians think it is a wonderful idea, but if the programs do not stand on their own merits, it raises interesting issues of public policy as to why they are being funded. To finish that point, Senator Margetts from the Greens was correct. I think the additional programs outlined in terms of the rural transaction centres, untimed local calls, remote island communities, Internet access for people in rural or regional areas and mobile phone coverage along highways are all worthwhile things. One would have thought that with the ever decreasing cost of technology—the ever decreasing cost of telecommunications around the world and in this country—these relatively modest programs would have been funded by government over time as part of its obligation to the sensible allocation of taxpayers' funds.
—It's a dividend.
—It is indeed the dividend. The government is taking $1.8 billion a year out of Telstra. The opposition does not quarrel with that. Indeed, with the growth in the telecommunications market, the switch and the huge growth in volume of data transference, the huge growth in Internet access, uptake and use both at consumer and business level, it is no surprise that the price of Telstra and other telecommunications shares have risen, continue to rise and will probably rise more so in the next couple of years.
Of the allocation of $1.8 billion—approaching $2 billion—that the government receives in dividends, a modest amount is allocated to a range of modest initiatives. The series of press releases outlined the detail of those yesterday. But I ask the minister: when 
 does the government intend to legislate for that improved package of benefits totalling $314 million? When will we receive the amendments in this chamber, or this parliament, that address the improvements that have been negotiated with Senator Harradine? 	 The current bill reflects government commitments at the last election. They said up-front that there was a social bonus of $671 million. They predicated the implementation of the programs they outlined on the sale of the next 16 per cent, so it is a contingent social bonus, if you like. We say it should have occurred out of normal planning by DCITA and normal allocation of government funds to fairly modest and basic improvements in the telecommunications infrastructure in this country. Nonetheless, the government went down another path. They won the election, and this bill we are discussing now reflects their election commitment. We do not quarrel with that.
In the last two weeks there have been a series of negotiations, presumably between Minister Alston and Senator Harradine. In Senator Harradine's second reading contribution a fortnight or three weeks ago, he indicated a number of markers. He said he was inclined—in fact, he said it more strongly than that—to support the sale of the next 16 per cent. He ruled out the other 51 per cent, and he indicated that either he or someone would move an amendment to delete schedule 3 at the appropriate time. But, in terms of his critical remarks about price—and most things, if not all things, come down to price—Senator Harradine indicated his price was relocation of structural and management functions to Tasmania, and that has been ticked off. He indicated his price was not low paid or low valued or minimum wage jobs in Tasmania but high value jobs in management and administrative fields, and that has been ticked off. He indicated that he wanted Tasmania to receive a significant net additional investment from government—that there were significant economic and structural problems in that state.
He did not say it then but he has said at other times that there is a population decline. Young people leave that state to go to the 
 mainland—to Melbourne and Sydney—to seek careers, homes and families elsewhere because there is perceived to be a lack of opportunity for their careers post the age of 18 when they leave high school in Tasmania. So he indicated that the third thing to be ticked off was allocation of significant funds to universities, research institutions and think tanks in modern new and emerging technologies. Again, the $40 million for the development of Tasmania as an intelligent island has been ticked off.
So all of the markers that Senator Harradine laid down in his second reading comments when the debate closed have been accommodated by the government, and the opposition is not overly critical of that. But what we do want to know is a little more than what is going on by way of press release. The nine or 10 press releases from the joint coalition senators in Queensland, the one from Mr Anderson and a range of others, including one from Parliamentary Secretary Campbell, all rehashed old ground. There was nothing new in those press releases. The press release of consequence was Minister Alston's. Also of consequence, of course, was the joint press release from the coalition senators in Tasmania.
It is interesting to observe the process of negotiations because the social bonus totals in the order of almost $1 billion. Tasmania's population is something less than two per cent of the total of this country—might be a little bit more.
—It is 2.6.
—It is 2.6 per cent, I am told by the Minister. The state's gross state product is also less than 2.5 per cent of Australia's GDP, but the total allocation of funds in the social bonus, to 2.6 per cent of the population, is in excess of 15 per cent of the social bonus. That raises a whole range of equity, access, administrative and merit issues.
The opposition does not quarrel with the upgrading of an athletics track in the city of Hobart to make it modern. If the same principle is to be applied, we would probably like to have new hockey fields in Western Australia, where the bulk of the Australian 
 Hockeyroos come from; we would probably like to have new and additional swimming pools in New South Wales; we would probably like to have new archery fields in Victoria; and we would probably like to have new kayak and other facilities in Queensland, because in each of those states, for whatever reason, the local population has developed expertise or excellence in those particular sports.
If the principle is that you can whack out $600,000 by the Commonwealth to upgrade an athletics track—you beaut, we will be into that and we will have a couple of million dollars here for a hockey field and $5 million for a swimming pool there. It seems to be a new approach to public policy. If that is the name of the game, the opposition is not slow; we will give that some thought and come to you with a range of propositions and I am sure you will adopt them in due course.
What we need to come to grips with is: when will we see the amendments to this bill that provide the structure for the allocation of this additional $314 million? It is a lot of money: $158 million for Building IT Strengths, and $40 million to develop Tasmania as an intelligent island. I notice in passing that in a range of the other programs—Building Additional Rural Networks, BARN (don't we love acronyms in this place?) and Networking the Nation Local Government Fund, $45 million—the funds allocated to each of those programs has simply been divided up. The aggregate total has been divided by the six states and a few extra bob thrown in for the two territories.
In terms of all of those other programs, if the allocation is $50 million, they have given $45 million divided by six for each of the states and the other $6 million divided by two for the two territories, the ACT and the Northern Territory. A different approach appears to apply to BARN, Networking the Nation, the expanded mobile phone coverage, Netwatch, the TIGERS program—although that is in Tasmania only—and the additional environmental spending.
When will the amendments come forward? Do you intend that they be part of the discussion that we are currently engaged in? Sched 
 ule 2 is the appropriate place for those additional amendments to be discussed. Are we, therefore, going to be doing it as part of this process? Or do you simply intend to implement the additional $314 million by administrative action once the programs have been established, or will you bring the amendments to this bill for discussion at a later time?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—That was an interesting, if not extraordinarily discursive, contribution from Senator Bishop. It took all of 15 minutes. It could have been reduced to the one question that he asked at least four times: will legislation be required?
The answer to that is no, we do not think it will be. The BARN program—and I pause to pay tribute to the acronym deviser extraordinaire in my office, Mr Fletcher—and the Networking the Nation Local Government Fund are both going to be dealt with through the existing Networking the Nation program. There may be additional administrative measures that will need to be developed, but generally we do not see a need for legislation. These are clearly commitments that will be honoured in the same way that the package that we took to the last election was honoured.
I should say in passing that, if you want the ultimate example of a pork-barrel, it has to be that Mandurah commitment of Mr Beazley's. I could not believe that he would have the cheek to put that out selectively by local press release or local brief to the media—we could not actually find the press release. What I did find quite extraordinary, to compound the felony, was that when he argued that we should be using the existing Telstra dividend for a range of other initiatives, he conceded that that was money that was already being spent on other social programs. Although this notion of somehow hypothecating the dividend was sold as a new initiative, there was nothing to it. There was no money attached to it because the money was already there.
The Labor Party now seems to have learnt very quickly from Senator Allison's pre-lunch contribution that what Mr Beazley did yesterday was a massive blue, getting out there and 
 bagging the whole concept of helping the bush rather than saying, `No, they are good in principle but you have to find the money from somewhere so we would find it from the dividend.' You would suffer from the same problem. All that money is already allocated. You did not go to the last election promising to spend anything like $671 million. In fact, Senator Schacht's lasting contribution to the Labor Party's defeat was that he went out there and said that they would close down Networking the Nation—
—He did not.
—He did. He absolutely did. We have the press release to prove it. Maybe he was asleep at the wheel and somebody else put it out in his name but the fact is—
Senator Mackay interjecting—
—A moratorium—I see. Get your signals right. What is anyone in the bush meant to read into that: that you were going to put a freeze on our five-year commitment to spend $250 million? In other words, you reserved the right to reappropriate $150 million into something else. They were smart enough to work it out for themselves. You were going to hit this little project on the head. Not only were you not funding any social bonus initiatives, but you were also actually telling them in no uncertain terms that you were not going ahead with our commitment which was worth approximately $150 million.
Here we are with another $314 million—to round it up to $1 billion—and now, belatedly, you say that these are worthwhile initiatives but that you still do not have any source from which you would pay them. If it is new money, we will put that down on the ledger for the next election. If not, then it is not to be taken seriously.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-06-21,"—First of all, I wonder whether the minister knows where Mandurah is and that it is now considered to be a southern suburb of Perth. The reason that Rockingham initially was included in the local call area was that it was in fact a southern suburb of Perth, and it is ridiculous that people actually 
 have to pay more for calls to what in fact becomes a southern suburb.
I have not yet heard what the ALP is likely to do in relation to my amendment. We have had some general debate on it, but I am still curious as to whether this fits within the opposition's `No, no, a thousand times no' category or whether this fits into the category of `We will support those amendments which acknowledge that we do not want to sell Telstra but we will continue on with some of the service benefits of the rest of the bill.'",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I should have said that before, Senator Margetts. This falls into the latter category, and the opposition will be supporting the Greens on this matter.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I want to make it very clear that we find it very interesting that there is no intention on the government's part to have any legislative backing to this package. Presumably, we are required to take the government on trust again in relation to deal 2 of tranche 2 in relation to Tasmania.
Senator Calvert interjecting—
—I notice Senator Calvert interjecting. Senator Calvert knows very well, because he actually did a lot of work behind the scenes to help in relation to this, that the work management centre was part of deal 1, tranche 1. In fact, Senator Harradine got commitments directly from the minister in relation to that. Of course, that closed in January. Not only that, but part of deal 1, tranche 1 was also the retention of the Hobart Telstra store, which is of course now going to close on 30 June. That was strike two for deal 1, tranche 1. Now we are being asked to trust the government in relation to the initiation and implementation of the initiatives, and the minister in a blase manner says, `You can trust us; we had no reason not to do this.' This is the very minister who gave Senator Harradine a personal commitment on the work management centre, which is no more.
—You mean Telstra gave a commitment. 
—No, Minister, you gave Senator Harradine a commitment on the work management centre. Your office gave Senator Harradine a commitment on the work management centre being opened. We can go through that if you want. If you want to waste several hours on the saga of the work management centre, we can go through that.
On 30 June, Senator Harradine loses his powerful position in relation to the Senate and the honouring of this deal for Tasmania. It is an in-joke in Telstra in Tasmania and nationally that they are counting the sleeps until 30 June so that they do not have to be bothered with Tasmania and Telstra anymore. In fact, the CEO of Telstra has made comments to, as I understand it, a group of middle managers—if I am wrong, I am sure the minister will correct me—to the effect that he is not very interested in what happens in the Senate in relation to Telstra and staffing levels in Tasmania and that Telstra will be making the decisions in terms of staffing levels. That is correct. That is why the minister cannot answer any of these questions about staffing levels. He cannot give commitments in relation to prospective redundancies. We know—and it is the worst kept secret in Tasmania—that a number of redundancies have been put on hold until after 30 June.
The question I would again ask the minister is: given that Senator Harradine loses his position of influence on 30 June, how can it be empirically guaranteed that the deal that has been done with him will be carried out, given that deal 1, tranche 1 was not carried out, that we are still waiting for a number of initiatives and that a number of the commitments that were given were breached?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—If there is one thing I ought to make perfectly clear, it is that we are not expecting the Labor Party to take anything on trust because we know their position. They are implacably opposed to this because of union inspired ideology. So this simply does not come into the equation. What is of concern is that those with open minds in the chamber are interested in the sorts of proposals that we make and reduce to writing and 
 to which we will adhere. If that is sufficient to persuade some people to vote for the legislation, then I think that is very much in the national interest. The tragedy is, of course, that you dealt yourself out of the game from the very beginning. You are supposed to be here representing Telstra—I mean representing Tasmania.
—No, you're representing Telstra.
—As the designated shareholder minister, yes, you are right. I am certainly not privy to any of the meetings that you have apparently been a fly on the wall at, and I would be very surprised if there have been any discussions along those lines. I simply say that you had the opportunity to get a better deal for your state, as did all other senators. You chose not to accept that opportunity. We are not asking you to accept anything; we just accept that you are going to blindly vote no, irrespective of what is put up and whatever is moved by way of amendment. That is your right.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I want to pursue this Building on IT Strengths, BITS, program for $158 million. In the minister's press release he advises that, as part of the BITS program, $40 million will be allocated to the development of Tasmania as an intelligent island.
—That should be an `even more intelligent island'.
—An even more intelligent island. That leaves something in the order of $118 million to be allocated to the other six states and the Northern Territory. My question is: how will that $118 million be allocated to the other states and territories? Will we just divide by six or is it going to be done on a population basis or on an application for proposals basis to the relevant department? For example, on what basis will my state get its share of the $118 million?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—The BITS program is divided into three core elements: incubator centres to assist IT&T SMEs, $78 million; 
 test beds and advanced information infrastructures, $40 million; and developing Tasmania as an intelligent island, $40 million. If you want more detail on each of those, I can provide it for you, but essentially it is funding designed to build the strength and competitiveness of the Australian information industry sector, including fostering much stronger commercialisation links with R&D organisations and the creation of clusters of innovative IT&T businesses.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I thank the minister for his comment, but he has not really answered the question. When you look, for example, at the BARN program and Networking the Nation for local government in terms of the BARN program, there will be $10 million allocated to each of the states and in the local government funding for Networking the Nation there will be $6 million allocated to each of the states, with a few bob left over for the territories in respect of both the programs. You just outlined the program establishment process, if you like, dividing BITS into three separate programs. Once you take the $40 million out for the intelligent island program, that leaves $118 million. Do we simply divide the $118 million by six to work out the grant to each of the other states, or is it going to be done on some other basis?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—Essentially this will be done on the merits rather than simply carved up on a state by state basis. You will note from the fact sheet that accompanied the press release that one centre will be funded in each mainland state and territory. The size of the Commonwealth support to a centre may vary broadly in proportion to the size of the information industries and related R&D organisations in the region. The centres will build on and complement existing generally available programs, including R&D Start, the R&D tax concession and the innovation investment funds. The Commonwealth will call for suitably expert agencies, whether they are state government based, private sector, academic institutions or a combination, to operate the centres. The designs will be flexible. It is 
 expected that involvement of relevant tertiary institutions and venture capitalists will form a key element of all centre proposals. Selection criteria for managers will focus on factors such as business skills and experience, knowledge of the information industries, extent of state government and private sector support and involvement, the ability to contribute to regional development objectives and the likely impact of the centres on commercialisation of R&D. So clearly it will involve a fairly sophisticated assessment of the needs and requirements of a whole range of areas.
Under the BITS program, centre managers will be able to respond quickly to requirements. Managers will be able to provide funds of up to $50,000 as one-off assistance for concept development and up to $250,000 for a maximum of two years for seed funding on a three to one, Commonwealth to private funding, basis. One target group for project based concept development funding will be multimedia content developers, who often face greater difficulties than other businesses in attracting finance for their operations because of the nature of their work. Once again there is sufficient flexibility in the program hopefully to address a very significant proportion of the needs in this area.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I thank the minister for that response, because it clearly indicates that the funds are not going to be allocated on the same basis as the other two programs that I identified. If I can summarise what the minister said, funds will be allocated upon a fairly comprehensive application process having to do with the existing strengths, existing infrastructure, existing interest and existing capacities of the states for this allocation of these funds. Minister, there are cooperative multimedia centres in each state, from memory, and I think there are two in New South Wales. How will this allocation of funds mix in with current funding for those multimedia centres?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—It is possible that there may be some overlap. If you take the Software Engineering Australia project, which 
 also serves as an incubator project, the CMCs are principally research driven whereas the incubator centres are designed to assist small businesses to get off the ground and will make available seed funding and the like and provide expert financial management and technical advice. So the incubators are more business focused and I think the CMCs are more research focused.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I think that is fair comment. I notice that in your press release the allocation of funds, minus the $40 million for Tasmania as an intelligent island, is essentially capital allocation for the purposes identified in the two paragraphs under the heading `BITS'. That suggests to me that once the capital has been allocated the program would conclude unless further allocation of funds were to come from government. You might advise us whether there is any capacity for operational costs to be covered by the grants and whether that is intended to be covered from other sources. If the answer to both of those is no, what life in years do we anticipate the BITS program to have?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—There is not a strict time limit on it, because we clearly do not want to spend all the money at once. At the same time it is not intended to be an ongoing, forever and a day support arrangement. The fact is that this is probably a critical time to be providing this sort of assistance because IT&T is really starting to take off, as you would know. Electronic commerce is only in its infancy. It is predominantly business to business but it is likely to move to business to consumer in the near future, and there are enormous opportunities there. You have only got to listen to people like John Chambers from Cisco, who says that less than one per cent of American households currently have high-speed access to the Internet. The prices that are currently being charged are equivalent to the prices charged for cable television, which services something like 70 per cent of households in America.
It is yet another example of the information age only really just starting. You would not 
 want to set aside funds over a 10-year period. I think you would want to be spending the money sooner rather than later, but you would need sufficient discretion to be able to spend it on projects as they emerged and not simply use it all as quickly as possible without being able to respond to a new program. Again, it is intended that there be flexibility in the approach, but we are generally seized by a sense of urgency in the overall attitude we have to these programs.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—Minister, you would be aware more than most of the situation in the two major states of New South Wales and Victoria. Taking Victoria first, the Victorian government has a de facto industry policy, for want of a better description, in terms of the development of multimedia. In New South Wales there has been a significant, indeed a huge, allocation of funds to locate the Fox Corporation there in terms of film manufacturing, film processing and film production. Indeed, the same thing happened to a lesser extent in Queensland. Do you anticipate the funds allocated to the BITS program being able to be accessed by the governments of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland for the funding of particular programs or issues of concern, or are they going to be ruled out in terms of having access to the funding?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—I think we would probably adopt the same approach that we took to Networking the Nation. Whilst it is a Commonwealth program and it is designed to provide direct funding, we certainly do not want to deprive ourselves of access to advice from state governments. We would very much encourage them to give us a statewide view of what their needs might be. In relation to the incubator centres, for example, we say that we will call for suitably expert agencies, whether state government based or others, to operate the centres. They would not be ruled out from a place in that particular element.
I do not envisage that it is simply another means of funding state programs; they are meant to be Commonwealth. The Common 
 wealth Technology Port, for example, at the Docklands in Melbourne, is probably an area that might be of particular interest. Certainly, Melbourne has already established itself as a multimedia centre. There are hundreds of small to medium sized enterprises on the south bank of the Yarra alone, let alone clustering around places like La Trobe University and RMIT. It will very much depend on the level of activity that is already in place. I would think a program like this would actually attract a lot more bids as well. It is much broader than simply state government structures, but that is not to say that we will not want to consult and work closely with the state and territory governments.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—So to paraphrase the minister, you would anticipate ongoing consultation with the relevant state governments that have an interest in this area, but you would not anticipate this huge sum of money replacing state allocation of funds to their own indigenous industries that have developed over the last three or four years. Is that correct?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—Yes, it is essentially a Commonwealth program, so it is not going to be us handing it over. We do value their input.

At the end of the day, we will make those decisions.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—These industries are growing, as you say, in nearly all of the states. There is a whole range of different plans emerging. Senator Harradine has probably correctly identified the location of a lot of these sorts of programs in his own state as being necessary for its economic development in the future. Has the government or the department engaged in any reports, retained any consultancies or done any research that might suggest that this allocation of $158 million is justified in this area? What empirical research does the government have, apart from purely allocating $158 million as part of a social bonus distribution?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—I do not think we have commissioned any formal consultancies because unless and until the legislation is in place the money is not available for any of these projects. We have drawn on the accumulated knowledge and experience of a number of places around the world which have tried to emulate the Silicon Valley experience. Certainly there is no shortage of advice from the venture capital industry, for example. The innovation investment funds that we established are now starting to hit their straps. At different levels and in different ways we are trying to stimulate this sort of activity. This is really giving another major fillip to an embryonic industry and one that most of us are fairly familiar with in terms of the essential ingredients.
You do not really need to do a study of the general structure of support. You may, in due course, need to do that to become more specific about who precisely gets the funds, but at this stage what we are doing is putting down a blueprint which we believe provides a sufficient basis for support of the legislation. I would certainly hope that, once the legislation is through the parliament, we will be in a position to undertake more work on identifying precisely what the needs might be.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—So the government or the department has not to date commissioned any report or research that suggests that we provide justification for this allocation of $158 million?

We have given enormous emphasis to IT and IT related issues and we have looked at what is happening around the world and how people are endeavouring to simulate what is occurring in Silicon Valley. In all sorts of ways we are 
 doing very well, but there is more you can do if you have the money available. We do not have an open-ended chequebook in this area, but we have done the best we can to strike a balance between the various projects. The sum of money that is available under this segment is quite substantial and I have no doubt that it will be very useful. Certainly no-one would suggest that it is far in excess of what is needed; some may say it is not enough. That is always the case in politics. You have to do your best to find the money and apply it usefully.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—Thank you, Minister, for those comments. I refer you to the first paragraph of your press release on the BITS program. It says:
The program will provide $158 million to address current market failures and policy gaps that are preventing the optimal growth of new and developing innovative Australian IT and T businesses.
In the last sentence you make reference to the venture capital sector. We are aware from press reports that you have been to the United States in the last few weeks discussing the issue of venture capital and capital gains tax relief. It has been a topical issue for both parties now for 18 months or so. It arose from a Senate Economic References Committee report on industry policy which, from memory, recommended concessions be made in the area of capital gains tax. Both the government and the opposition are exploring that particular option in their own way.
How does the government see addressing current market failures and policy gaps through the allocation of funds having any impact at all on the venture capital sector when, as I understand the position of the government, the major roadblock to the growth of a significant venture capital sector in Australia, both from local funds and from imported funds from United States pensions, is the fact that there is such a high capital gains tax to be realised when a matter comes to fruition? How will this allocation of funds assist that, or is it not relevant at all?",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—No, it is relevant. You 
 will see in the second sentence of the first paragraph that we say:
Private sector run incubators will be established in each state and territory to provide a range of developmental assistance to IT and T SMEs including mentoring, business management assistance, improved links to universities, research institutions, a venture capital sector, proof of concept grants and seed capital.
Clearly, venture capital is a factor in that area and there are a number of possible approaches one could take, drawing on the Silicon Valley experience, and they are essentially in the area of specific capital gains tax relief, script for script swaps for mergers, or MNAs, and the question of relief for share options and the relative attractiveness of them in encouraging entrepreneurs and those in existing businesses to take a risk and set up their own enterprises.
Venture capital comes into it, but each of those, to the extent that they are able to be provided and would not otherwise be available, are examples of market failures. They are obviously at the early stage and therefore critical to the success of many small and medium enterprises. As a result we think we are addressing all of the needs by tackling those matters.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech

Of course they are market failures because of taxation legislation.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-06-21,"—As the Manager of Government Business in the Senate will know, I oppose this motion. I do not believe that the Senate should be sitting extended hours at this time of its proceedings. I do not agree with these extended sittings because of the political nature of the reasons underlying them; that is, the need for the government to pass legislation, including legislation which is not of an urgent nature. Besides the no doubt long debate that there will be over the GST package and the attendant diesel fuel levy rebate package, which is designed of course to give a massive hand-out to supporters of the government, there is going to be debate on a number of other pieces of legislation which in no way can be seen as urgent.
One of those is one of the most significant pieces of legislation that I will see in my period in this Senate. Other senators may disagree with that because they do not count the environment as being a matter of importance, but I do—and I have the support of greens right around this country when I say that. Among the two pieces of legislation which the government has listed here is a bill to change the whole nature of the administration of environmental law in this country. This bill, which purports to bring up to date—after 20 years of serial environmental change—the laws of this country, is effectively a handover of government powers over the environment to the states and the territories. The salient matter here is that this legislation is not important, it is not urgent, it is not pressing and it does not have to be pushed through the Senate under this sort of change to the ordinary Senate hours. I would ask all 
 other senators, including those on the government benches, to consider this matter. The urgency is not there.
It may well be that the Democrats and the government have struck a secret deal on this legislation—and if so, be that on their heads—but I am not going to be party to allowing an extra day's sitting between now and next Wednesday before the next elected Senate comes in to deal with such matters. I have heard no reason from the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, the Prime Minister or anybody else in government as to why we should be sitting extended hours to push through that sort of legislation. It is going to need—and ought to properly have—extensive review by the public before this Senate debates it. It is not going to get that. I will tell you why it is not going to get it, even though this legislation is there as a priority by the government: because the public does not know what the deal is. No-one out there knows what the secret arrangements between the Democrats and the government are. We do have the legislation, as brought into this parliament, before us but we also know that is not what we are going to be dealing with, that there have been extended and lengthy negotiations between the government and the Democrats on this matter.
Nobody has told me, for example, as a representative of green voters for the Australian Greens, what the details are of this amended document. The government is saying, `Well, we're not going to tell you'—and the Democrats are saying, `We're not going to tell you'—`but we are going to bring this bill in as early as tomorrow and you're going to have to deal with it.' Well, I am not going to be party to that sort of ramrodding and railroading of extremely important legislation through this place, because I hold it in higher regard than that. I hold the national environment in higher regard than that and I hold the importance of being able to inform an electorate before we deal with legislation like that in high regard, so I am not going to support this motion. I am not going to be party to changing the hours to allow that sort of legislative railroading to occur in this place. If there were decency in this process, 
 if an obligation were felt by the government and the Democrats to allow millions of Australians—who will feel, when they get to know about it, that this legislation is important—to understand it, to discuss it and to have feedback on it, we would not be having this process.
Besides that legislation there is the regional forest agreements legislation which is part of this environmental fix, which gives us an indication of the direction that this is taking. What has happened there is that the national government has signed agreements with several state governments to absolve itself of all responsibility as far as the environment is concerned and to lock into place for 20 years the destruction of forests and wildlife around this country, regardless of what the environment so-called protection bill does. That is what we are dealing with here, but the public out there are not aware of the ramifications of that. What the government is saying to me is that we are going to have to accept its dictates and, no matter how important and fundamental this issue is to our constituents, become part and parcel—by amending the hours—of allowing this legislation to be put through.
I will not stand for that. I am not going to be party to that. If the Democrats want to be, let them be. If the Democrats, at the end of this tawdry process, are going to be part of guillotining these pieces of legislation to prevent their proper debate, let that be on their heads as well. But I am not going to go along compliantly with a process which has that end result, because these matters are too important. The government ought to recognise that as far as I am concerned, as an Australian Green standing here, these are top priority matters which cannot be dealt with in a cavalier fashion. Let the government go out and explain to the electorate why it is doing this.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-06-21,"—by leave—I move the following amendment to the motion:
(1) paragraph (1), omit ""and 29 June"".
(2) paragraph (2), omit the paragraph.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,18,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-06-21,"—The opposition supports the motion before the chair. We take the view that at this time of the year there is, inevitably, great pressure upon the legislative program. I think the opposition has demonstrated throughout this parliament, as it did in the last parliament, that we have a very responsible attitude towards the management of the legislative program. We hold the view that the legislative program as circulated by the government is ambitious. In fact, one might suggest that it is grossly ambitious. It is an ambit claim at the very best that clearly demonstrates the government has not thought through some of the consequences of the decisions it has taken in regard to the legislative priorities of this chamber.
We take the view, however, that it is the government's responsibility to determine its own legislative priorities and we will do our best to assess thoroughly and appropriately the measures that are put before this parliament. That is precisely the job that we are undertaking at the moment. Senator Bishop has demonstrated, on behalf of the opposition, that the issues that have been considered in regard to Telstra are matters of great importance to the people of this country and ought be thoroughly examined. Of course, the implications of those ought be understood. We will be seeking the support of this chamber in regard to the positions that have been put forward on behalf of the Labor Party. I understand, however, that there may well be arrangements in place that will not see those matters brought to a successful conclusion, as Senator Bishop has indicated on behalf of the Labor Party.
I say that the legislative program itself is flawed in so far as we are given to believe that the government places great emphasis upon its new tax package and it suggests to us that the issue of the tax reform is the most fundamental facing the government at the 
 moment. We are told that it is probably the largest package ever to come before the parliament in terms of a reform agenda—that is, a reform agenda as defined by a conservative government. Yet we are in a position on Monday night with a legislative program outlining the proposals for discussion tomorrow and have yet to see the amendments that are being placed before this chamber, or allegedly being placed before this chamber. We are told that there might be hundreds of amendments, yet they are not available for us to examine.
We are concerned about the priorities that the government has attributed in terms of its forward program. We note, for instance, that there are two new bills in this package. We have not seen them. This raises serious questions, particularly in view of the suggestions that are being made about proposals to introduce a gag motion. I notice that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate has suggested as of 11 o'clock today—that is, 1½ hours before this chamber commenced its deliberations—that the government was considering a gag motion so that its tax legislation would be considered in its time lines. The Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Ian Campbell, said that he would seek the Democrats support to bring an end to the tax debate if time was running out.
—I didn't say that at all.
—Senator Campbell indicates that he did not say that. What I am quoting from is a news report from the ABC News Online service of today's date at 10 minutes past 11. So an hour and a half before the chamber commenced its deliberations today on the Telstra questions the government was threatening to use guillotines and various other means by which—
—Very sloppy reporting from the ABC.
—The senator indicates that it was sloppy reporting. There is no doubt in my mind that that is what the government 
 intends to do. It intends to use the guillotine to secure the passage of its tax legislation. We ought to understand the context in which these matters are now being proposed—that is, over 100 amendments which we have not seen. We are told that the Democrats themselves have yet to see 15 of these amendments. I can only speculate as to how many they have actually understood. That might be an interesting discussion in itself. But when we are told on the Monday night, the day before this package of bills is supposed to be introduced, that we have a situation where the Democrats themselves have not seen 15 of their own amendments, which go to the heart of this deal that they have entered into, one has to wonder about the appropriateness of asking the Senate to consider these matters in the particular time lines which the government proposes. I say further that two whole new bills are being presented to this parliament and we have yet to see any detail.
I ask senators, when they consider this motion—and I have no doubt that the motion will be carried—to bear in mind the threats that are being made and the positioning that the government is trying to engage in to encourage people who are interested in parliamentary matters to take the view that there has been an undue level of delay in the way in which the Senate is processing the government's legislation. We have a program which is totally unrealistic. We have here various measures being proposed—for instance, legislation on voluntary student unionism. Quite clearly, that is a proposition which is dead in everyone's mind, except the mind of the minister for education. Yet it is listed on this government program as a matter of priority.
We have here various other measures being proposed for consideration which, clearly, the Senate will not have time to consider in the best of all possible worlds with the best of all possible motives of all senators concerned. So we have to ask ourselves: why is such an ambit claim put before the Senate? It is quite clear that it is because the government is seeking to generate an environment in which it can use the guillotine to undermine the 
 capacity of the Senate to examine its tax legislation in particular. I am especially concerned about the tax legislation and will encourage Senator Bishop to continue in his efforts to study carefully the government's proposals in regard to Telstra and the other packages that are associated with the measures designed to consider a new regulatory regime for telecommunications. One cannot get over the fact that this government is seeking to put in place a situation where it can legitimise the use of a guillotine to prevent proper consideration, scrutiny and public accountability of the measures that it is undertaking.
With those remarks, I indicate to Senator Ian Campbell that I appreciate his amendments made to the proposal a few moments ago. I am sure that the opposition will continue to consider the government's measures in a most reasonable and thorough manner and I trust that the level of cooperation will extend across the chamber. I have no doubt that the Senate will ultimately see the wisdom of such proposal, even if the government seeks to move its guillotine.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,18,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-06-21,"—We had not actually voted on my amendment. Do we need to do that?
—No.
—I think I have made a mistake in deleting 29 June. I think the intention of the opposition was that at this stage we not agree to sit at 12.30 p.m. on 29 June. If that is the case, I was going to amend the motion so that we not start sitting at 12.30 p.m. on 29 June, but we are sitting until 11 p.m. on 29 June. Is that so?
—No. I think there will be ample opportunity to consider those matters. My intention was to remove 29 June from this particular motion.
—Remove it altogether. That has been done and is reflected in my amendment. I commend my amendment to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,18,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-06-21,"—I am so glad Senator Ian Campbell sought the leave of the Senate to speak again to the motion!
—I sought leave to discuss my amendment.
—Sure. I rise briefly to indicate that the very fact that there have been amendments negotiated over dinner would indicate that the Senate did need a little bit of time to consider this motion, which came on quite quickly in its final form. Senator Ian Campbell seemed to be very cross before dinner that Senator Brown exercised his right to actually speak to the motion—shock, horror! Fancy speaking to a motion about the way we are going to operate in the next week and a half! However, it has been done.
The Greens have made no secret of the fact that we were not in favour of shoving in all these extra days and weeks when there was no great reason for that. There was certainly no secret in relation to the leaders and whips meeting. I was there and Senator Brown made no secret of the fact that he was not in favour of the extra hours and weeks. Why in his private time Senator Ian Campbell should feel it necessary to have a go at anybody for speaking on this issue, considering these are the issues which have been put quite clearly to the government, I have no idea. Nevertheless, I gather that the numbers are here and this is the reality. Obviously, I am grateful that the Senate is considering the needs of those—myself among them—who will be leaving the Senate, but I also indicate that that does not, in any case, take away the rights of any senator in this place to respond and speak to a motion.

—Why did you gag us if you are going to use all our time?
—I hope to be one minute. On the last occasion, the first tranche of Telstra, the government quarantined the Natural Heritage Trust Fund and the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund from the Commonwealth Grants Commission processes. I wonder whether the government would give a guarantee publicly in the chamber that the funds provided to Tasmania in accordance with this agreement will be excluded from the Commonwealth Grants Commission assessments of the equalisation relativity factors and, further, that the Commonwealth will not treat Tasmania in a disadvantageous manner compared with other jurisdictions in the context of the introduction of new or changes to existing specific purpose payments as a result of Tasmania receiving these funds. I ask that question because it is one that a number of people, including the Tasmanian government, want to know the answer to.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—This issue first arose in relation to the funding decisions made by the government associated with the first one-third sale of Telstra, when the government made available funds of $1.5 billion for the Natural Heritage Trust and the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund. The approach which the government took on that occasion was that it dealt with these matters in the terms of reference which were sent to the Grants Commission for its consideration of financial assistance grants to the states. In those terms of reference, the government instructed the Grants Commission to disregard any allocation which a state had received under the Natural Heritage Trust or the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund in making a determination as to the amount of the grant which the state should receive. The government proposes to take the same approach in relation to the allocation of funds under the social bonus associated with the sale of a further 16.6 per cent of Telstra.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-06-21,"—I have just received a letter from Telstra Information and Connection Services which I think would be useful for this debate. I quote from the letter:
Over the past few months we have looked across the business at initiatives we can put in place to build a better and more sustainable business for the future. This has included business growth and cost reduction initiatives.
Following that review, we have determined that our first priority is revenue growth.
Later on the letter states:
In addition to our focus on revenue growth, we are also looking to improve our existing outsourcing arrangements.
Further, the letter states:
Going through change is always a stressful process and open communication can raise concerns.
I mention that because the motion we are considering is in relation to my amendment to remove that section about the privatisation of Telstra. This would indicate that, according to Telstra, their ambition, their priority, is revenue growth. There is not one word in this letter about a focus on customers. The focus 
 is on revenue and outsourcing. I commend my amendments to the committee.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-06-21,"—by leave—I move amendments Nos 3 to 6 and Nos 8 to 10 on sheet 1255:
(3)	 Schedule 2, page 5 (lines 12 and 13), omit:
.	 The main source of money for the Reserve is $1.35 billion from the partial sale of Telstra.
substitute:
.	 The main sources of money for the Reserve are proceeds from the partial sale of Telstra and Telstra dividends.
(4)	 Schedule 2, page 5 (lines 18 and 19), omit the Note.
(5)	 Schedule 2, page 5 (line 22), omit the heading section 22A, substitute ""$250 million derived from Telstra dividends "".
(6)	 Schedule 2, page 5 (line 25), omit ""proceeds of the sale of shares in"", substitute ""dividends"".
(8)	 Schedule 2, page 14 (lines 20 and 21), omit ""the partial sale of Telstra"", substitute ""dividends received from Telstra"".
(9)	 Schedule 2, page 15 (lines 21 to 30), omit the definition of  proceeds of the sale of shares in Telstra .
(10)	 Schedule 2, page 16 (lines 17 and 18), omit ""proceeds of the shares in"", substitute ""dividends from"".
The effect of these amendments is to provide for the payment of the social bonus out of Telstra's dividends rather than the proceeds of the sale of 16.6 per cent of the share in Telstra. As I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate, the Australian Democrats are of the view that it does not make economic sense to sell any more of Telstra. Furthermore, Telstra's performance in rural and remote areas just is not good enough to make us comfortable about any further privatisation.
We do not believe that the $671 million social bonus is going to solve all of the telecommunications problems for people in rural and remote areas. We think the improvement of those services should be part of an ongoing commitment and should be funded recurrently rather than as a one-off payment. We would like to see a proper plan in place, a systematic program of upgrading services governed by a well planned strategy to, as closely as possible, reach the equality of services between rural Australia and the cities. 
 Consequently, we do not think that the social bonus program is an ideal program, but again it is a start, which is better than nothing. I will be moving amendments later regarding the social bonus distribution committee, which will be an expert committee to deal with the grants that will arise from this bonus.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—On behalf of the opposition, I want to make a few comments concerning Democrat amendments Nos 3 to 6 and Nos 8 to 10. This set of amendments comes within that second category of amendments I addressed earlier in my opening remarks. It seeks to improve the effect of the bill by giving effect to the initial social bonus of $671 million and the latter social bonus of $300 million. When it comes to a vote the opposition will oppose these amendments. The opposition takes the view that the whole issue of the social bonus has become something of a bad dream; it is a trick. To date, something in the order of $671 million has been allocated or promised by the government should the Telstra sale bill go through, that is, if the next tranche—the 16 per cent shareholding—of Telstra should be sold, the government will gross proceeds somewhere in the order of $16 billion to $17 billion. After costs are deducted, the net gain to government will be something in the order of $15 billion to $16 billion.
Out of those net proceeds the government has allocated two tranches, if you like, of social bonus: the $671 million already allocated, $200 million for the Natural Heritage Trust, $70 million over five years for the rural transaction centres, $150 million over three years to allow or improve untimed local call access, $81 million over five years for regional communication needs and $120 million over five years for the television fund. So the first tranche is $671 million of taxpayers' money, to be achieved via the sale of 16 per cent of Telstra and distributed in a rather uneven fashion to certain groups within the community. The opposition takes the view that there is nothing wrong, in principle, with the allocation of those funds to those particular causes, but that allocation should have come out of the normal, routine, day-to-day 
 government operation concerning funds and disbursements. It should have been part of the routine planning processes involved in the telecommunications portfolio. Similarly, the latest tranche of something in the order of $300 million, making a total of $1 billion over the next two to five years, should again be categorised as normal, routine government planning and allocation of funds.
The social bonus in total is something in the order of almost $200 million a year for five years. When you break it down it is about $10 per week for five years for every Australian. We compare that with the huge amount of fees and costs that is to be paid to a range of interests involved in the privatisation of the next 16 per cent of Telstra. If we look at the facts of this issue—and these were discussed in the Senate hearing in February of this year and referred to in the minority report by opposition senators—bankers and brokers received over $260 million in fees from the sale of the first one-third of Telstra, more than the government allocated to its $250 million Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund. The Auditor-General drew attention to a range of improper practices in the disbursement of those funds, slack accounting records, poor internal controls on disbursement of funds and a range of abuses that occurred in many cities of the world as the roadshow went around selling off Telstra.
It is fact that, of the $671 million so-called social bonus, only $351 million over five years is to be spent directly on telecommunications infrastructure. The rest is to be used to boost the Natural Heritage Trust and create the rural transaction centres. As a result of negotiations between the government, Senator Harradine and a range of interests over the last three weeks since we last met, an additional $300 million has been allocated in the form of a social bonus. As I indicated earlier, it is remarkable that of that total of almost $1 billion, something in the order of $150 million is going to be allocated to Tasmania.
Minister Alston indicated earlier, in response to a series of questions, that the government has not gone through any particular planning or processes or commissioned 
 any research in respect of the range of programs it has identified; it simply struck the government as a good idea that the range of programs suggested in negotiations should be implemented. That strikes the opposition as a remarkable way to be running public policy in the allocation of some hundreds of millions of dollars. I think it is fair to categorise the social bonus, particularly the latter part, as a bribe. The way those funds are going to be dispersed raises questions of integrity in public policy.
We recently had an election in New South Wales where the opposition parties went to the people with a proposition to privatise the entire power network in that state. It was suggested that something in the order of $20 billion would be raised through the privatisation of the New South Wales power system. Serious incentives, if you like, or serious bribes, were offered to the electorate in New South Wales. From memory, something in the order of $1,000 plus was offered to every electricity user in New South Wales if they voted for the actual privatisation of the New South Wales power distribution system. The community poured scorn on that idea.
Two or three days after the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales announced her position, the opinion polls and newspapers reflected community opinion—that is, that votes were not up for sale, were not up for grabs. The opposition continued on a downward spiral throughout that election campaign and remains in opposition to this day. The proposition that every voter, every electricity user, in New South Wales could somehow or other receive a bonus of $1,000 by voting for the then opposition, voting for the privatisation of the power network in New South Wales, was rejected by the people.
In terms of some of the programs that are part and parcel of the second tranche, as I said earlier, there is nothing particularly wrong with those programs in isolation. If they were part of on an ongoing plan, an ongoing development of particular states or regions, they would probably have worth on their own. But we find that the allocation of funds simply reflects the perceived needs of 
 the government to privatise the Telstra Corporation.
One program on its own, worth $15 million—connecting Tasmanian schools to the Internet and providing extra capital to provide computers to school students—is, on its own, not an unworthwhile idea. I am sure every state and territory in Australia that runs a public education system would like to have access to a similar amount of funds to provide computers and software to all of their students. But Tasmania, as we all know, is a state where there is a serious and real population decline. The schools have fewer and fewer children every year. That suggests that there is no demand for an allocation of a huge amount of money for computers in the school system because parents are not having children and children are not attending the schools. When children turn 16, 17, or 18, there is no longer employment and they leave Tasmania to go elsewhere seeking employment.
It is similar with the mobile phone coverage. The black spots program to extend mobile phone reception on Australia's major highways is in itself a good idea—no-one quarrels with that. But it should be part of normal government planning, normal government processes, to attend to problems that emerge as new technology emerges and fix them up for all road users and for all mobile phone users. But the government allocate $1 million for mobile phone coverage to Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia. They allocate that $1 million as part of this program on the basis that those three states did not qualify for the other grants. They did not qualify for the other grants, because the black spots problem did not exist in those states. So to keep those states quiet they are all slung an extra $1 million for each of these programs.
So the opposition is not particularly opposed to these programs. They may well have merit. They may well bring benefit in terms of the distribution of the social bonus. But we make the point, as I close my remarks, that the social bonus distribution should be spread all around Australia; it should be spread equally to all of the states and it should be 
 allocated to areas of need on a basis that has been identified by proper planning and allocation of resources. The allocation in total of $150 million to Tasmania out of a social bonus distribution of almost $1,000 million is a misallocation of resources. It is a wrong set of priorities and it just repeats the mistake that was made by the current opposition in New South Wales with respect to the privatisation of the power system. It is nothing less than a gentle bribe. It is something the opposition is not comfortable with. We place on record our opposition to it, and we will continue to maintain that position.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Colston, Sen Malcolm",IND,1999-06-21,"—On the last occasion the Senate considered the sale of Telstra, I had a number of concerns about any further sale of Telstra. In brief, these concerns related to: the corporate culture of labour and customer relations within Telstra; possible deleterious employment effects within rural and regional communities; the provision of telecommunication services to those communities; competition policy; the universal service obligation; and the Commonwealth's proposed use of further sale proceeds.
On that previous occasion, there was insufficient time to negotiate and debate the ramifications of the full sale of Telstra. Indeed, at that time, it could be argued that the government held no mandate relating to those proposals. On this occasion, the government clearly has a mandate to proceed with plans for the full sale of Telstra. It has become apparent, however, that it intends to proceed only with a partial sale, including a further 16.6 percent of the Commonwealth's Telstra asset. Some observers would have noticed that the government fudged its mandate a little. In the election campaign last year, the government said it would first move to increase the public holding of Telstra to 49 per cent. We find that this bill would increase the public holding to 49.9 per cent.
Since the last occasion on which the sale of Telstra was debated, there has been considerable time to negotiate and debate the government's proposals with many stakeholders. Those parties have included the government, Telstra, the CEPU and Telstra's cus 
 tomers, shareholders, employees and competitors. In the course of those negotiations, it has been established that the concerns I raised previously remain as the core issues relevant to this debate. There is evidence that the proceeds of the sale will provide important benefits to Australia, both in terms of debt reduction and the various projects involved in the enhanced social bonus package, an expansion of which has been announced. Those benefits will be shared by my constituents in Queensland, just as they will be by all Australians.
In addition, the competition regime associated with this legislation appears to balance the interests of all communications carriers and provide benefits for consumers. Furthermore, there is a commitment on the part of the government to continue serving the interests of consumers through the universal service obligation with the intention to review and enhance the USO on a regular basis.
The last year has also seen a change in personnel at the highest levels within Telstra. That change has brought a welcome shift in Telstra's corporate approach in a number of areas. For example, I have received assurances from the highest levels within Telstra that the corporation intends to be at the forefront of halting the drift from small rural communities to the capital and regional cities. The indications are that Telstra's approach on this matter includes a commitment to continued provision of new-generation telecommunication products in those regions, in addition to the maintenance and extension of Telstra's existing infrastructure.
Telstra's rural and remote trainee program—in which young Australians from rural and remote communities are trained to become communications technicians—has been provided as another example of Telstra's commitment to employment and skill infrastructure within those communities. One may cite numerous examples of the remarkable change in corporate culture that have been associated with the personnel change to which I have made reference. Two further examples, however, are worthy of note.
The casualties of Telstra issue has been, to some degree, a watershed in terms of custom 
 er relations. Telstra's recent approach to the settlement of the CoT cases is most welcome. So, too, is Telstra's commitment to pursue a multifaceted approach to restructuring. While recognising that change in the telecommunications industry is inevitable, it is clear that better approaches than those used previously are available. Telstra's recent adoption of a culture of consultation and proactive involvement of staff affected by possible changes are beneficial for both the staff and Telstra's financial performance. Further, when restructuring is necessary, Telstra's commitment to offering redeployment, redundancy, or reskilling, retraining and job placement is a productive and welcome approach to labour relations.
Once more, I acknowledge the assistance of the minister, his staff, Telstra officials, the CEPU, Telstra's competitors, shareholders and customers, as well as my own staff, in assisting with my deliberations on this matter. Those deliberations, on balance, indicate that an important and beneficial revision of Telstra's customer and labour relations has occurred and that a further partial sale of Telstra will have lasting benefits for all Australians. Thus I will be supporting the sale proposed by the government, which still leaves the government as a majority shareholder in Telstra.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ronald",NP,1999-06-21,"—I certainly welcome the commitment given by Senator Colston to the sale of the remaining 16.6 per cent of the shareholding. What will remain in government hands will be 50.1 per cent. It is absolutely gratifying to hear Senator Colston give those commitments, because rural and regional Australia needs cheaper, faster and more clever communications, and the social bonus from the further 16 per cent sell-down of Telstra gives exactly that.
Each state stands to gain $150 million from the social bonus, but Queensland should do a lot better than that, because of the decentralisation of regional and rural Australia. Queensland is the most decentralised state in Australia. This $1 billion social bonus is to upgrade telecommunications for regional and rural 
 Australia. Therefore, because most of this bonus will be given out on a needs basis and because regional Queensland is the biggest regional area in Australia, Queensland should do very well out of this.
—It is not actually the biggest.
—Western Australia is bigger, but it has not got the decentralisation that Queensland has. Queensland has the most digital radio concentrators, and the users who stand to benefit from them will get a $150 million network upgrade. We also have many local governments in regional areas. New initiatives that bring the total funding up to $1 billion include $158 million for the Building Information Technology Strengths program; $70 million for the Building Additional Rural Networks, or BARN, program; $45 million to help local governments to get online; an extra $3 million on top of the already announced $25 million to expand mobile phone coverage; and $3 million to fund a network to promote safe Internet content.
We have already announced $686 million, $150 million for untimed local calls and a new preferential call rate of 25c for 12 minutes. Together with the $160 rebate, that gives rural Australians the equivalent of 2.4 hours of local calls per week if their service centre is outside their zone. That is a huge initiative for rural Australia. $36 million will go to installing points of presence in each zone so that all Australians will be able to have access for local calls. Time and time again we have heard, at various points when we have gone around rural Australia, that what is required to ring their neighbour—or sometimes, on their own property, to ring down to the cottage—results in a timed called.
There is $70 million for Rural Transaction Centres to restore services to the bush, like Medicare, banking, post, fax and phone. A $120 million TV fund extends SBS to another one million Australians for the first time and eliminates TV reception black spots for others. Of this, $10 million goes to small self-help towns to subsidise the cost of equipment necessary to receive the second commercial broadcaster. The government has also boosted 
 the universal service obligation to ensure that 64 kilobytes of data downlink speeds will be available on demand to all Australians. Regional Australia also benefit significantly from the $250 million boost to the Natural Heritage Trust.
The package for the bush is historic in size and it follows intensive negotiations by National Party senators with the minister, Senator Alston, and also the Prime Minister. The final package delivers much more than the Queensland National Party asked for in its Bundaberg resolution as a prerequisite to supporting the full sale of Telstra.
I was going to move amendment ER249, which reduces the government's holding in Telstra by 16 per cent down to 50.1 per cent. If that is not in front of the chair at the moment, I will say that if it gets to be the question before the chair, then I will take the advantage of moving it. At the moment it is doubtful whether we will get to it because of the guillotine, but I want to signal that it is my intention to move that amendment when it comes before the chair. The amendment will secure a generational leap forward in communications and assure that all Australians, whether they be in Coen or Kirribilli, have equitable access to it.
—Madam Chair, I rise on a point of order, which goes to relevance. The senator should be speaking to the motion before him, which is the amendments put by the Democrats.
—Madam Chair, on the point of order: Senator Murray would appreciate, if he has been following the debate, that we have had many hours occupied by particularly Senator Mackay and her friends when there has been absolutely no relationship to the matter before the chair. It is particularly important in this instance, where Senator Boswell does wish to put his position on the record in relation to a matter which is unlikely to get before us until the time expires—
—Whose fault is that?
—It is the fault of those who spent 17 hours in fruitless and irrelevant discussions which led to a guillotine being put in place. I simply ask Senator Murray for a 
 short indulgence to enable Senator Boswell to complete his commitment which he would not otherwise be able to put on the record.
—If I may respond to the point of order, Madam Chair: Minister, I was not concerned with your general remarks. My concern is that you are now speaking to a specific amendment which is not before us, and we have our own amendments to deal with.
—My point of order was perhaps not made clearly enough, but Senator Boswell carefully refrained from purporting to speak to another amendment. He simply indicated that, if and when it came on, he would be. So he was foreshadowing an intention to do so. We are technically still considering the Democrat amendment.
—I am sure that Senator Boswell will in some way relate his comments back to the Democrat amendments in due course.
—I will try to take up the challenge to talk to the Democrat amendments, but I say this: I am very pleased that Senator Colston is going to support this bill, because a vote against it would deprive rural Australia of fairness, equity and a future. It is with a great deal of happiness, Senator Colston, that I note that you are going to support this bill, and I welcome it.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—Sometimes, when one listens to debates in this chamber, one could be forgiven for thinking one is in another place. I listened closely to Senator Boswell's comments. As he was making them and outlining the perceived benefits, from his perspective, that would flow to rural Australia and the state of Queensland, I was looking through the media release put out by Senator Alston late yesterday afternoon where he outlined in detail the $314 million involved in the second tranche social bonus. As I listened to Senator Boswell and looked at Senator Alston's press release, there was no correlation at all between the two.
Going through each element of the package one by one, I draw to rural Australia and Senator Boswell's constituency the facts of 
 the matter. They are these: the Building IT Strengths—the BITS—program is going to be allocated $158 million, and $40 million of that will be allocated to Tasmania for development of the intelligent island. That leaves $118 million for distribution in the remainder of Australia. Senator Alston, prior to dinner, was kind enough to tell the chamber that that $118 million outstanding from the BITS program is not going to be allocated on a proportionate basis to each or any of the states but will be broken up into three internal programs and that applications will be solicited and it is anticipated that the bulk of that $158 million will go to the two states, Victoria and New South Wales, that already have active ongoing and developed IT industries and multimedia programs. So that is $158 million out of the $314 million that will not be going to rural and regional Australia and will not be going to Queensland.
In terms of the Building Additional Rural Networks program, the BARN program, $70 million has been allocated. But, again, those funds are going to be distributed proportionately—each of the states will get $10 million. So indeed Senator Boswell is correct in respect of that program—Queensland will get $10 million, but so will each of the others states. For Networking the Nation—the local government fund—$45 million has been allocated but, again, as with the BARN program, it is going to be allocated proportionately to each of the states, and Queensland will get $6 million only—the same as each other state.
The expanded mobile phone coverage program—$3 million goes solely to Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. The NetWatch program—$3 million is simply going to be allocated to the state of Tasmania. The Trials in Innovative Government Electronic Regional Services—the TIGERS program—$10 million will be allocated, again only to Tasmania. Additional environment spending of $9.4 million will be allocated only to Tasmania. Connecting Tasmanian schools, which I referred to earlier—$15 million will be allocated, only to Tasmania. Other infrastructure initiatives—$800,000 will 
 be allocated, only to rebuilding an athletics track in Tasmania.
This new tranche will have application around Australia, but Queensland's share—rural and regional Australia's share—is the same for New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and any other states and territories: $10 million and $16 million respectively. So congratulations are in order to some senators in this chamber because they have achieved a great and bounteous result for their particular states. Tasmania will receive $150 million out of the total of $1 billion. Fifteen per cent of the social bonus will be spent in Tasmania, but in Queensland there will be additional funds provided of only $10 million for the BARN program and $6 million for Networking the Nation.
If Senator Alston's media release is correct—and I have no reason to doubt its veracity—and his earlier comments prior to dinner are correct, there has been little, if any, gain for rural and regional Australia outside of the $671 million that was allocated as the social bonus in the first tranche. That is where we come to the crux of the matter.
—That is allocated now. You are not making sense. You are talking about the first tranche.
—That is right; I am talking about the first tranche. $671 million in the first tranche is to be spent, upon the sale of the 16 per cent, and the bulk of the additional $300 million is to be allocated to Tasmania.
—Each of the states ends up with about $150 million each.
—Each of the states ends up with about $150 million each.
—That's right.
—I accept that. But on a proportionate population basis—on a GSP basis—one or two states do radically better than, radically different to, all of the others. Queensland has a population 10 times that of Tasmania—something in the order of four million to 4½ million people compared to 400,000 in Tasmania. If both states get the $150 million, there is something seriously wrong with that process.
—So you want Western Australia to get less than New South Wales?
—In the same respect, Western Australia and South Australia suffer disadvantage in terms of the social distribution compared to the state of Tasmania. Senator Harradine, congratulations. We are not criticising you. What we say, though, is that for the National Party and Senator Boswell to say that his state or his constituency has done particularly well is an error of fact. That is the only point I am making in this discussion.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-06-21,"—I will be very brief. Unless I misunderstood Senator Bishop, Senator Bishop was talking about the first tranche.
—Both.
—I think what you meant was the first announcement that we were talking about in this bill before the additional $300-odd million was put in. I accept that, but we are really talking about the sale of this tranche; that is, the 16 per cent. Out of the first tranche, Tasmania—if you look at the social bonus minus the natural heritage—was getting only 3.5 per cent. Sure, they are getting a disproportionate whack of the second amount—of the top-up from $671 million to $1 billion—but bear in mind that they were getting only 3.5 per cent.
Senator Bishop, I do not think you would be saying that Western Australia should get less than New South Wales because its population is less. I would not expect that from you as a senator for Western Australia, nor would I expect it from either Senator Colston or Senator Boswell. I think the point made by Senator Boswell was a very important point: that regional Australia has benefited from this particular sale as it would not have done under another formula.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1999-06-21,"—With respect to the RTIF funding and the social bonus that have been spoken about at length this evening, I would like to follow through with the minister a series of questions that were not answered during the more appropriate forum of additional supplementary estimates. These ques 
 tions go to the selection criteria of successful projects under the RTIF. Minister, I would like to draw your attention, if you, in fact, have any intention of participating in this debate at all—
—He's not listening.
—Madam Chair, I am addressing the minister and he is not paying any attention. If you could call him to order, that would be useful.
—The minister is working out what happens at one minute past 10, Senator Lundy.
—Minister, the question goes to the actual process of the selection criteria for successful RTIF funding projects. The question I asked in additional supplementary estimates went to the extent to which Telstra is involved in the decision making process of the board. I would like to draw your attention to the Networking the Nation fact sheet under the heading `Funding priorities and options'. Under the subheading of `Projects and existing commercial services', it states:
The Board intends that Networking the Nation projects should not compete unfairly with existing commercial telecommunications and related services. Therefore the Board will provide funding directly for the provision of infrastructure and services only in areas where that infrastructure and services are not being provided commercially, and where there is no reasonable likelihood of commercial provision in the near future.
I also draw your attention to the criteria contained in further literature circulated under guidelines. At point 8 under the subheading `The effect of the project on the telecommunications industry', it says:
Projects will be assessed for their potential positive or negative impact on existing telecommunications (and related services) businesses in the proposed project market area. The potential of projects to promote development, competition or diversity in the telecommunications (and related services) industries or the acceptance of innovative communications solutions may also be considered.
Minister, I draw your attention to those criteria because I want to ask you quite specifically if Telstra is at all involved in the process of the selection criteria with respect 
 to RTIF projects. If so, what is the extent and nature of that involvement?
The reason I ask this question is that several of the projects, if your rhetoric is to be believed, have the potential—again I can quote from the very same document—to maximise competition, to ensure a level playing field. If what you are saying is in fact correct—and I actually doubt the sincerity of the government in this matter, for reasons that have been put on the public record for quite some time—perhaps you can explain the nature and role of Telstra's involvement in the selection criteria and whether or not they at any point have the opportunity to peruse funding applications.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—The short answer is that the decision making processes of the board are matters for the board, not for Telstra or for the government. It is at arm's length. It does, however, consult with a number of interested parties, including state governments and probably carriers, to explore options, just as it consults very carefully with applicants and advises them on the likelihood of their particular project being supported, even suggesting ways in which it might be better presented. So it does engage in extensive consultation, but at the end of the day it makes the decisions on its own. It certainly does not have Telstra participating in the decision making processes.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1999-06-21,"—Just to follow up on that, Minister, can you get some advice from the board and ask them specifically if Telstra have been asked to directly comment on or peruse applications through the RTIF? The issue is this: right through this debate Labor has said that there is an appropriate place for Telstra in our community in supporting telecommunications and information infrastructure. The government has chosen to attach to the process of the partial or full sale of Telstra the creation of infrastructure of this type through the RTIF. It is contingent on the sale. To make that RTIF funding available contingent on the sale relates back to the ability of these communities to actually 
 enhance their opportunity to participate in the information society. It is the types of projects that this government is seeking to fund through this contingency of the sale of Telstra that presupposes the introduction of further RTIF funding.
If indeed Telstra have any role at all in assessing or vetting RTIF applications in the context of the guidelines I described, is that fair? Surely the RTIF is there to actually break down some of the cost inhibitors that confront rural and regional users of telecommunications particularly and information services like the Internet. Surely that is what it is there for. This is a very important question for the minister to answer and for the RTIF board to answer, because if Telstra do have a say then this whole process and the government's rhetoric about the RTIF actually constituting a social bonus, implying that it will enhance the opportunities for rural and regional Internet telecommunications customers to actually be able to get online and to participate more, are an absolute farce.
It has been completely analysed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, by other studies and by the government's own work demonstrating what the barriers to online participation are in rural and regional Australia. They relate primarily to cost and secondarily to the quality of the services. Both of these issues are almost completely dominated with respect to the services Telstra provide in rural and regional areas. Many of the RTIF grant applications that have come forward from those communities seek to redress the shortfalls of these services in rural and regional areas by virtue of cost and by virtue of quality of service, being applications seeking to implement new technology and to build new infrastructure. Yet here we find in the selection criteria some sort of test that a project cannot mess up any existing services; it cannot play with the entrenched monopolies that are out there putting rural and regional families at what we know is a distinct socioeconomic disadvantage. It costs too much for so many of them to get online.
Surely, Minister, you can provide a decent and in-depth explanation, because we have not received answers to those questions on 
 notice from additional supplementary estimates. We have not seen those answers. I think you owe to this chamber, if not to rural and regional Internet users or indeed those who are hopeful to have that service affordable and available in the future, an explanation as to what exactly is going on in the decision making process of RTIF funding. If indeed we find that the RTIF funding system is able to be manipulated by the very corporation that you stand up and say you are trying to address in the social bonus, that you are trying to facilitate a competitive environment et cetera, you will be exposed not only as being completely hypocritical but also as grossly misleading the Senate and grossly misleading the Australian public. I look forward to your answers, Minister.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—The short answer is that the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund has been a screaming success. It has funded something like 140 projects. I have never heard anyone criticise any of those projects, including the Labor Party. Yet you are the crowd who went to the last election wanting to close it down, knock it off and put $100 million in your pocket. It is absolutely hypocritical. You have never had any criticism of the merits of any of those proposals, and I have made it abundantly clear to you that it is at arm's length from government and it is at arm's length from everyone else. It makes its own decisions. If you want to cast an aspersion that the board is basically a patsy for Telstra and that the board is compromised because it is delegating its decision making capacity to Telstra, you ought to have some evidence before you make those sorts of allegations.

Opposition amendments Nos 1 to 18 deal with the issue of telephone sex. We discussed this last time we met, some two or three weeks ago. The opposition has withdrawn its original amendment and substituted it with amendments Nos 1 to 18. When the Senate last met, I indicated the commitment that Labor has to the amendments we have said we will move with regard to this legislation. In the last few weeks we have received extensive representation from telecommunications service providers and their representative bodies. They have given a great deal of attention to the potential for collateral damage to these industries that might arise from the government's proposals. Today the opposition has circulated further amendments to this bill that we feel both reinforce the position taken by the Labor Party during the previous debate and extend greater certainty to the telecommunications service providers in this country who feel that the government proposal will cause inadvertent damage to their businesses.
Modelling by the industry has indicated that, at best, the entire 1900 telephone service industry may suffer from a decline in revenue of up to $75 million, which represents approximately $13.5 million in lost taxation revenue for the government, and, at worst, the revenue will tumble by $150 million, which would mean taxation revenue cuts of approximately $22.2 million. The damage that these revenue declines may cause to the rest of the 1900 industry could be catastrophic. Many agencies and organisations use 1900 services to inform the public and operate their businesses. These include major media outlets, state 
 and local government agencies and a range of small businesses and information providers. The opposition amendments to this bill will provide common ground between the objectives of preventing the misuse of these services by minors and unauthorised users and minimise damage to industry and loss of revenue and employment opportunities arising from such damage.
Firstly, we reiterate our belief that industry must be given 12 months to prepare for any changes to the access regime for these services in order to allow both carriers and information service providers an opportunity to implement appropriate access mechanisms and to fully inform staff and customers about these changes. The minister has tried to have us believe that Telstra has a different view on the time it will take to implement such changes, stating that it had said it could be done in six months. In fact, Telstra has not moved from its position that it will take it at least 12 months to develop appropriate access mechanisms.
Secondly, we seek to move further amendments which will serve to allow a certain portability of identity authentication in this industry. We will move to allow calls to these services to be made under specific access mechanisms agreed to by the telecommunications service industry and the Australian Communications Authority. For example, the ACA may approve a system where calls to these services may be made from any phone by customers using a unique personal identification number and a phonecard linked to a 1800 based identity verification system.
In conclusion, when we put forward the amendments on the last occasion we indicated that we wanted our amendments to be considered seriously. We circulated further amendments this morning. We have spoken to the background already and will explain it in more detail in a few moments. We indicate to the chamber that the imposition of the guillotine changes the whole situation and the opposition is reviewing its position on the issue of phone sex.
Just fleshing out the amendments Nos 1 to 18 which have been circulated, we have identified three major deficiencies in the 
 government proposal. The opt-in arrangements are inflexible and may unfairly impact on unrelated parts of the telephone information service industry. The opt-in can be undertaken only in writing and does not reflect current technology and accepted practices in terms of identification and services available by telephone, facsimile and email. Also, six months is an insufficient period of time for the carriers to implement the required PIN infrastructure.
The Labor amendments will: extend the period of time before the introduction of the measures in the bill from six months to 12 months to allow carriers and industry to develop authentication mechanisms and to inform the customers of adult telephone services of the change from the 1900 prefix to the 1901 prefix; broaden the method by which customers can opt in to these services by including applications made in writing, by telephone or by other electronic means; provide for a mechanism which allows secure authentication that is portable, which customers can use to access adult telephone information services from any telephone service by use of a unique phonecard and PIN system—this system will be known as an approved authentication means and must be approved by the Australian Communications Authority by way of a disallowable instrument; and, finally, require the Australian Communications Authority to consult with carriers, telephone service providers and information service providers with regard to the technical detail of such an approved authentication means.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I move opposition amendment No. 1 on sheet 1408:

As I said earlier, we have had a number of approaches from industry carriers. We went back to Telstra after the minister advised us last time that 12 months was no longer required by Telstra. Telstra have confirmed to us that 12 months is an absolute minimum to implement changes, get the systems in place and train staff and that if the provision remains at six months, they will simply be unable to comply with the law. It strikes us as a fairly weird situation. If a corporation simply is not physically able to comply with the law, the difference between six and 12 months is minimal.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-06-21,"—The government is opposed to this amendment. We certainly understand that some people would like to delay its operation as long as possible, but in the government's view six months is a very reasonable period of time. If Senator Bishop claims that the difference is minimal, then on 
 that logic six months is as good as 12 months anyway.

	 Question put.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-06-21,"—I want to make a few comments. The opposition engaged in lengthy discussion last time this matter was before us and, but for some slowness of action, the matter would have been resolved last time. Today we circulated a series of amendments to the government and the minor parties, and indicated that we were serious. We believe these amendments provide a middle path through this somewhat treacherous area of telephone sex. We do not believe that these amendments have been treated in a mature fashion by the government. We do not believe that they have been received in the spirit in which they were offered. Our views have been confirmed by the haste with which the government has moved this evening to resolve all the matters in the bills. So when this matter comes on for final resolution, the opposition will be voting against the government's amendments.
—The question is that government amendments Nos 5 and 39 be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1999-06-21,"—Under standing order 195 could the chair read out the amendments?
—Government amendment No. 5:

	 insert:
	 .	 This act regulates telephone sex services.
Government amendment 39:
Page 110 (after line 25), after Part 9, insert:
Part 9A—Telephone sex services
Order! The time being after 10.45 p.m., we shall now proceed to putting the question. The question is that government amendments Nos 5 and 39—
—I raise a point of order, Madam Chair. I do not think that even a guillotine motion overrides standing order 195. I still require the question to be read.
—It is the remaining stages of the guillotine motion, Senator Ray.
—I do not understand that response. Was Senator Ray's request for the amendment to be read out completed, or is the chair saying that it is not to be completed? I understand that Senator Ray is absolutely right, that standing order 195 is not overridden by the guillotine.
—The time for the proceedings of the bill had expired. The question is that government amendments Nos 5 and 39 on sheet ER229 be agreed to.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
—We now proceed to government amendments Nos 37 and 38 on sheet ER229 and government amendment No. 1 on sheet EK225. The question is that the following amendments be agreed to:

		 (d)	 if paragraph (c) does not apply, but it is practicable for the carriage service provider to give the customer the credit within that 14-week period and in time for the customer to be notified of the credit in the second bill sent to the customer during that period—by giving the customer the credit in time for the customer to be notified of the credit in that bill.

—I am sorry, Senator Margetts; I have a running sheet which we have quickly done here, but it has not been circulated.
—Madam Chair, on a point of order: can I ask that the running sheet be distributed so that we know what we are voting on?
—The running sheets are the abbreviated ones bringing the government amendments together. You have got that running sheet.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,1999-06-21,"—It is with great sadness that I rise to pay tribute to the life of the late Aubrey William George Luck, who passed away in 
 Devonport, Tasmania, on 9 June. Aubrey Luck was an outstanding citizen of north-west Tasmania whose long life—indeed, he was 98 when he died—contributed greatly to the wellbeing of his fellow Tasmanians. I was indeed honoured to represent the Prime Minister at the funeral and commemoration for the creative life of the late Aubrey Luck.
Mr Luck was a member of the House of Representatives from 1951 to 1958, representing the north-west Tasmanian seat of Darwin, and he was the member when the electorate changed its name to Braddon in 1955 during the process of redistribution. Aubrey Luck was elected as the Liberal member for Darwin following an eight-year term of that great lady, Dame Enid Lyons, the wife of the only Prime Minister to come from Tasmania. He also inherited the tradition of another famous MHR for Darwin, King O'Malley, who held the seat for 14 years between 1903 and 1917.
In 1955 it was the late Aubrey Luck who suggested to parliament that the name of the electorate should be changed from Darwin to Braddon to avoid confusion raised by the earlier name. During this time, the local MP, Aubrey Luck, was very active in a number of issues which were of particular importance to his north-west Tasmanian seat. One of the most important of these was the improvement to the Bass Strait shipping service by introduction of the first Bass Strait vehicular ferry, the Princess of Tasmania. Although a vastly smaller vessel than the current ferry, the Princess of Tasmania allowed visitors from the mainland to more readily visit Tasmania, accompanied by their cars. This saw the beginning of a steady growth of Tasmania's tourism industry, an industry which has grown into one of the state's main economic contributors.
The late Aubrey Luck was also to the fore in having the new ferry based at his home town of Devonport, beginning the long history of Devonport benefiting from its links with tourism and shipping. Aubrey Luck was also one of the first pioneers to create tree plantations to provide for the future needs of the building industry, another industry which is now to the fore in Tasmania's economy. He was also the prime mover in having the then 
 Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, visit the west coast mining town of Queenstown in the mid-1950s. The Copper Bounty Act was passed, which saved the Queenstown mine. During his period as an MP, Aubrey Luck conscientiously travelled around the electorate in his Chevrolet, which clocked up more than a quarter of a million miles in the days before sealed roads and travel allowances. His term in office also saw him put in much hard work to develop the Devonport airport and to promote the establishment of the Tootals textile factory, which provided many jobs for the people of Devonport.
Aubrey Luck was born in Launceston in 1900 and was an intelligent and enterprising lad as he progressed through his schooling, which was highlighted not only by his good academic achievement but also by his sporting prowess. He was a member of the strong Launceston High School rowing crew, which dominated schoolboy rowing during the years of the First World War.
Fortunately for Aubrey Luck, the war ended just before his 18th birthday, and he was not required to join his brothers in France, one of whom was killed. He had already showed early entrepreneurial skill when, as a mere 14-year-old, he grew vegetables in his family backyard and sold them to neighbours. After the war ended, he suffered from a lack of work at a time when returned soldiers were given preference.
Aubrey was sent to Devonport to work with his uncle, who was reopening a flour roller mill in the town. In 1924 he married, and was to have six children, two of the boys sadly dying in infancy. Following a fire in the roller mill and the subsequent rebuilding, Aubrey Luck had his first experience with the building trade. This work developed into Mr Luck's main lifelong business interest of provision of building supplies and involvement in the construction industry.
Although a successful businessman and strong family man, Aubrey Luck also found the time to pursue a wide range of sporting and community interests. He played football, rowed with the Mersey Club and became involved with the Devonport Racing Club. He was a foundation member of the Devonport 
 Athletics Club and was a volunteer fire brigade member for 21 years. In a fitting tribute, the Mersey Rowing Club formed a guard of honour, complete with oars, as the cortege moved slowly away from St John's Anglican Church in Devonport.
The late Aubrey Luck also contributed much to the community of Devonport—to the show society, the Chamber of Commerce, Rotary, and Parents and Friends. He held high office in the Masonic Order and was President of the local Master Builders Association. Aubrey Luck also served on the Devonport Council and was deputy warden for two years.
However, it was through his business that most people will remember Mr Luck. He spent his entire working life building up his business which provided employment for many people in north-west Tasmania. The present Luck and Haines company remains one of the north-west coast's icon businesses. In later years Aubrey Luck retired to enjoy the pleasures of seeing his grandchildren and his great grandchildren growing up around him.
Aubrey Luck lived a long and productive life. Those who knew him well will mourn his passing, and those of us who can now look back on his amazing contribution to this nation and his community can only give thanks for the life of an amazing man. To his surviving children, Barbara Payne, June Ingles and Mary Jarman, and his many grandchildren, great-grandchildren and other family members, I pass on my condolences. We must be grateful for such a good life.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Luck, Mr Aubrey William George</title>",Adjournment,22,1,speech
