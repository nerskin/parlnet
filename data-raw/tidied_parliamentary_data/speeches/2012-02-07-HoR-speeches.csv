Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:01):  I move:


That the House express its deep regret at the death on 8 December 2011 of the Right Honourable Sir Zelman Cowen AK, GCMG, GCVO, QC, a former Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia from 1977 to 1982, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


On 8 December 2011 Australia lost one of its greatest statesmen with the death of our nation's 19th Governor-General, Sir Zelman Cowen. Born in 1919, Sir Zelman grew up in the marvellous Melbourne of the 1920s where he had two of the finest role models an imaginative and impressionable young boy could have—John Monash and Isaac Isaacs. Like them, he enjoyed the transformative experience of a superb education which took him, as it carried them, to the very summit of achievement and success. Like them, he united innate ability with extraordinary application and hard work, but it was not all seriousness and study. Sir Zelman wrote movingly about long afternoons at the beach, the cricket or the movies, or watching his beloved St Kilda unsuccessfully fight for a flag. It was a very Australian life.


Sir Zelman was awarded a Rhodes scholarship in 1940, which he deferred until 1945 so that he could complete his war service with the Royal Australian Navy. He went on to become a fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, and returned to Australia in 1951 as professor and dean of law at the University of Melbourne, where he was to remain for 16 years. Vice-chancellorships of the University of New England and the University of Queensland followed in what were dramatic years for university leaders around the world. On Bastille Day 1977 came the unexpected but very welcome announcement that Professor Zelman Cowen would be Australia's next Governor-General. It was one of Malcolm Fraser's finest decisions.


Sir Zelman came to office when the role of Governor-General and the fabric of our political system had been placed under enormous duress. He rightly identified the need for a touch of healing and, through his wisdom and dignity, delivered it. The healing continued throughout his 4½ years as Governor-General where he sought to interpret the nation to itself and recognised those whose voice was not always heard. There have been just 25 governors-general since the advent of Australian nationhood in 1901. None has served with more distinction than Sir Zelman Cowen. He set the template for all of his successors.


Sir Zelman's long list of honours and achievements could not alone define him. He was a loving and much loved husband and father, and we are honoured today by the presence in the gallery of Lady Cowen—you are very welcome here—and Sir Zelman's son, Rabbi Cowen. Thank you for being among our number.



Honourable members:  Hear, hear!




Ms GILLARD:
  Sir Zelman was a man of enormous warmth and humour, a music lover and patron of the arts, a humanitarian dedicated to justice and public welfare, a proud member of the Australian community, a proud member of the Jewish community and a leader of both, but above all Sir Zelman Cowen was a good and decent man, open-minded, tolerant and wise. To put it simply, he was a gentleman. I am not sure these terms would have sat well with Sir Zelman because his way was understated and humble. Serving his country, whether in the Navy, as a teacher, an administrator or a viceroy was not a chore; it was an honour. He always understood public service as a vocation.


If we measure a life by the void it leaves, then Sir Zelman Cowen's passing has left our nation with a large gap indeed, but the strength of his legacy ensures that it endures in all those whose lives he touched—in his wife and great support, Anna, and his children and grandchildren, in all of the young people he mentored who now adorn the public life of our country, including the member for Kooyong, and in all those who felt included and inspired by his generosity of spirit during that time of healing. If there was one regret it was the fact that St Kilda never won another flag after that miraculous one-point victory in 1966, held on the Festival of Yom Kippur. The Saints are among many who have mourned the loss of a friend.


A life like this deserves to be remembered not only in our hearts but also through institutional means that will endure. Already there is the Sir Zelman Cowen Centre at Victoria University in Melbourne and the Sir Zelman Cowen Trust Fund for Australians studying at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Since Sir Zelman's passing, there have been a number of new proposals for the recognition of his work. Among these is a scholarship proposed by the General Sir John Monash Foundation to honour Sir Zelman's profound contribution to the law, academia, government and the nation. The government will create such scholarships, working with the foundation. The aim would be to create a prestigious award that would enable further study overseas at the highest level. This would be most appropriate, mirroring the life-changing nature of Sir Zelman's own studies overseas. It is also appropriate because the nation should remember. And we will remember.


Sir Zelman once wrote that his old friend, the American jurist Erwin Griswold, had led a great, a distinguished and an honourable life. He could have been writing about himself. Sir Zelman was indeed a great, distinguished and honourable man. We were enriched by his life and are diminished by his passing. He will be long remembered and very greatly missed. On behalf of the government and the people of Australia, I extend to Lady Cowen and her family our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:08):  I rise to support the fine words of the Prime Minister and to observe that Sir Zelman Cowen's life was one of remarkable achievement and enduring benefit to our country. He was, in turn, a Rhodes Scholar, a naval officer and survivor of the bombing of Darwin, an academic, a vice chancellor, a viceroy, the head of an Oxford college, the head of an important regulator and the chairman of one of our most important public companies. He was truly great and he was truly good, and our country is deeply in his debt.


Sir Zelman appreciated the continuities of our culture but he well understood that often things have to change in order to last. To give just one example, he found Oriel College, Oxford to be the last bastion of single-sex education and he left it as part of the 20th century as a mixed college. Sir Zelman knew when to speak and he knew when to hold his peace. As Governor-General he delivered literally thousands of elegant speeches on almost every subject, but not once did he comment on the dismissal of a prime minister by his predecessor, famously saying that no good purpose would come of answering questions on that subject. It was indeed through his judicious silences that he successfully brought about this vital touch of healing to the highest office in our land.


Sir Zelman was very conscious of his Jewish heritage, although he was not especially religious, as his son Shimon so eloquently pointed out at his funeral service in Melbourne. Sir Zelman was a seeker after truth rather than an expounder of dogma. Perhaps one way in which we could further honour his memory is by seeking the ethical principles which might be regarded as common to all cultures and to all people—principles such as keeping commitments, respecting human life and caring for the vulnerable. Sir Zelman sought always the things men and women had in common and hoped always that they might be their best selves. We miss him, we honour him, we seek to be worthy of him and we extend our condolences to Lady Anna and his family.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:11):  In one of those curious coincidences that life sometimes brings, Sir Zelman Cowen wrote an excellent biography of Australia's first Australian-born Governor-General, Isaac Isaacs, after whom my electorate is named. Isaacs was also the first Jewish Governor-General. Sir Zelman did not imagine that 10 years after the biography was published the Prime Minister would ask him to follow in Isaacs' footsteps and in doing so become Australia's second Jewish Governor-General. Sir Zelman, speaking of the moment at which Malcolm Fraser proposed to him that he should be the successor to Sir John Kerr, said:


Among the thoughts that crowded into my mind was the one that it was an extraordinary thing that I should have been a biographer of Isaacs.


Sir Zelman described his appointment as Governor-General, and service from 1977 to 1982, as 'totally unexpected, but it was the greatest experience of my life'. We are all the beneficiaries of his service to our country. At a media conference after his appointment was announced Sir Zelman was asked what he hoped to do. He said, as always with simple and carefully chosen words:


I hope that I may bring a touch of healing.


He achieved that hope. The Australian newspaper editorialised in 1979:


Call him the healer. Zelman Cowen has achieved in two short years what many Australians believed was impossible after the events of November 1975.


So much of the coverage of Sir Zelman's passing has referred to his healing role in restoring Australians' confidence in the Governor-Generalship, much needed after the involvement of Sir John Kerr in the sacking of the Whitlam government. Some have suggested that Sir Zelman became such a successful Governor-General because he avoided partisanship, but in no sense did he avoid the great issues of public affairs during his life. Sir Zelman had strong, carefully reasoned and clearly expressed views on those issues. He commented frequently in speeches, on radio and on television, opposing the Communist Party dissolution referendum in 1951, opposing capital punishment and the Victorian hangings in the 1960s and defending free speech and the right to protest in the early 1970s. In the 1990s he came to support an Australian republic because he believed the nation was ready for it. He spoke on asylum seekers during the Howard government and his words show us the wonderful man that he was. He said:


I consider that being as generous as we can is the most likely way to get the best result. My background gives me a sense of a powerful urge to find something better. Compared to many nations in the world our circumstances are comfortable, even enviable. We have, I think, an obligation as part of the international community to behave with magnanimity to those who arrive here carrying little else but their hopes for a better life.


Sir Zelman's life was a life of service, both before and after his Governor-Generalship. He served our country in the Navy in World War II. He became the Dean at the Melbourne Law School at 31 and served in that role from 1951 to 1966. He continued to serve the cause of higher education for the rest of his life in the formal roles of Vice-Chancellor of the University of New England, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland and Provost of Oriel College, and in countless other roles. I am very pleased to hear the Prime Minister's announcement of the establishment of scholarships in Sir Zelman's name through the General Sir John Monash Foundation.


Sir Zelman was a great participant in the Jewish community. I saw him from time to time at Temple Beth Israel in Melbourne, the synagogue where his father Bernard was president, the synagogue where in 1945 he married Anna, who is with us here today, and the synagogue where his state funeral was held on 13 December 2011.


He often attended Jewish community events and was always ready to assist the community. Just in August last year he provided a well-written message for the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation Commission for its fundraising appeal, which included, as so often from Sir Zelman, his care for the future. He said:


We must educate both the youth of our own community and the next generation of Australians to know that racism and anti-Semitism must never be tolerated.


I went to visit Sir Zelman on a Saturday afternoon in July 2010 with Irwin Cotler, a current member of the Canadian parliament and former Attorney-General of Canada but also an eminent professor of constitutional and human rights law—someone with a very long association with Sir Zelman. Sir Zelman was watching the football on TV, following another of his passions, the St Kilda Football Club—a passion I regrettably share, because it has meant mostly disappointment since 1966. He interrupted watching the game to immediately engage with his visitors on issues of the day in Canada and in Australia. That was the Sir Zelman I knew, late in his life, always engaging in matters of public concern and still seeking to serve in whatever way he could.


State funerals do not always capture the essence of the public figure they honour but Sir Zelman's funeral was an exception. There were deeply moving eulogies from Rabbi John Levi; from Sir Zelman's son, Rabbi Shimon Cowen, who is also here with us; from Dr Donald Markwell, the Warden of Rhodes House, University of Oxford; from Steven Skala AO; and from the member for Kooyong.


John Levi spoke from the ancient teachings of the three crowns—the crown of learning, the crown of priesthood or faith and the crown of royalty, all of which Sir Zelman bore—and of a fourth crown, the crown of a good name, which excels them all. Steven Skala said, rightly and eloquently, in words that I cannot improve on, that Sir Zelman's 'life's work in public and private reflected the deepest concern for the dignity of every person', that 'he embedded in us a love of learning, the pursuit of ideas and the power of reason in achieving justice, simply by being who he was', and that 'to understand Sir Zelman Cowen is to understand that the public man and the private man were the same: humane, decent, civil, loyal and committed to helping'.


I end with some more of Sir Zelman's own words from his memoirs, reflecting on something that he used to say at citizenship ceremonies—all of us in this House speak at these ceremonies and we all seek to capture in our different ways something of the spirit of our nation. Sir Zelman drew on the background that he shared with Isaacs. He said:


On occasion, when I spoke at citizenship ceremonies, I would recount the story of Isaacs, the son of poor immigrants, who had arrived in Australia only a year before my birth. I could reflect that my own story, while different in some respects, was not so very different, and I said that I believed that this should carry a message to those who participants in such ceremonies, and who could see the evidence of great human opportunity in such life stories. We have reason to be very proud of a country which makes this possible and actual.


We do have reason to be very proud of our country, but we also have reason to be very proud of Sir Zelman Cowen, a truly great Australian. We mourn his passing and we will miss him.

Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra) (14:19):  I commend those who have spoken before me for their very wise and well-chosen words. I believe I am the only member of this House who served while Sir Zelman was Governor-General of Australia. I had the opportunity of meeting with him on numerous occasions but I also had the opportunity of meeting with him afterwards at Oriel College, when he had retired from the role of Governor-General and had taken up a fresh academic appointment. I was there quite uniquely, in a sense, with members of the parliament at that time but also with George Brandis of the Senate, Don Markwell and Tom Harley—all distinguished Liberals who have written on that topic and were at Sir Zelman's feet.


He has been regaled as the great healer. I think it is important to recognise the nature of the events in 1975 for the potential they had to do the Australian democracy enormous harm. We came from those events, notwithstanding those challenges, in a cohesive way. It is by no accident that Sir Zelman Cowen is regaled as the healer, the person who was able to provide very considered leadership in addressing those important issues.


For my own part, I want to simply record that I saw Sir Zelman Cowen as a great Australian, regardless of whether he had been Governor-General or not. To be appointed as a professor of public law and Dean of the Melbourne Law School at the age of 31 years was remarkable in itself. He had been a visiting professor at American universities. Before that time he played a very significant role in modernising legal education. He focused on assimilating legal education with practice. He advised the British Colonial Office on constitutional matters as a dominion liaison officer. He advised governments of Hong Kong and China on legal affairs. It can be seen that even before his leadership roles at the University of New England and as the Vice Chancellor of the University of Queensland his achievements were very considerable.


One matter that has not been noted was that between 1976 and 1977 he was appointed a Law Reform Commissioner and was active in the areas of addressing the need for the law to keep up to date with the times during mass globalisation and of updating law to deal with rapid development in science and technology sectors such as bioethics and, specifically, human transplants and privacy. Later his activities led to the introduction of the federal Privacy Act. I thought it was particularly germane that Michael Kirby wrote of him:


While still Vice Chancellor of the University of Queensland, he agreed to serve with me in the Australian Law Reform Commission. And he did so between 1976 and 1977. What exciting days they were. Two of our projects have grown out his own academic interests. One of them, for the protection of privacy, led to the federal Privacy Act and resulted in my own introduction to the international activities of committees of the OECD. The other concerned bioethics, specifically human tissue transplants. Zelman had also written on the topic. He once let me into his intellectual secret. He urged me to read American law reviews which, he said, would put me ten years ahead of most Australian lawyers.


Michael Kirby said he took his advice. Others may not comment as positively on those matters, but I thought it was of interest.


I conclude my remarks by picking up one of the observations of an earlier speaker, the member for Isaacs. He commented on Sir Zelman having some observations to make about an Australian republic. I conclude with what he had to say about that matter in 1999 when speaking at the National Press Club in Canberra.


He went on to take issue with those who argued for a direct election of a President. He preferred the method offered in a referendum beginning with a public nomination process and ending with a person put forward by the Prime Minister receiving bipartisan support from two-thirds of the parliament.


I might say his comments were particularly perspicacious then and they may at another time be perspicacious again. I am pleased to be associated with this motion of condolence. I regard Sir Zelman as one of the greatest Australians that I have had the pleasure of knowing.

"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2012-02-07,"



Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (14:25):  Sir Zelman Cowen was a second generation Australian. He was born Zelman Cohen in Melbourne in 1919 to a family originally from Belarus, then part of tsarist Russia. Originally from Ballarat, the Cohen family lived in St Kilda, even then a Melbourne suburb with a significant Jewish population. His father was variously employed as a car salesman and manager of an oil company and changed the family surname by deed poll to Cowen in 1922. Like so many of us, he was guided by his mother Sara, who, by his own admission, had strong ambitions for her son, which I would say he more than amply fulfilled.


For all of his national and international repute, Sir Zelman Cowen was a St Kilda man at heart and never forgot the suburb where he was born—a suburb which I am proud, obviously, to represent in this parliament. He never forgot his boyhood on the streets of inner-city Melbourne and his immigrant heritage, as the member for Isaacs so aptly referred to earlier. In his autobiography, Sir Zelman recalls his first day at St Kilda Park Primary School, looking at the blackboard and thinking he would never make sense of what was there. Well, he did, of course, and more than most.


I had the privilege at the end of 2011, just prior to his funeral, of dedicating brand new extensions to St Kilda Park Primary School, just around the corner from my electoral office in Melbourne Ports. I noted the dedication of Sir Zelman Cowen as the school's most distinguished alumni. I know Sir Zelman would have approved of these extensions. His wife, Lady Anna Cowen, told me quite movingly at lunch that, while he was Governor-General, he was actually counted out—Sir Ninian Stephen took the role as his replacement while he was doing his last function at St Kilda Park Primary School.


My friends from the Chabad movement and his son, Rabbi Shimon Cowen, would probably think it is, as they say, beshert—ordained—that that very morning, in a function that was organised long before his death, I would go there to make those extensions and then walk from there to Temple Beth Israel to his funeral service. St Kilda Park Primary School has had many distinguished alumni, including the great cricketers Ponsford, Miller and Johnson, and Sir William Dargie, who won eight Archibald Prizes. But Sir Zelman is the school's most distinguished alumni.


He was a Saints man because the Junction Oval was just across the road, and he was their No. 1 supporter and patron. Lady Cowen very proudly showed me his life membership tag at lunch. Sir Zelman could never be called inconsistent in his lifelong support of the Saints and, until recently, attended St Kilda games. I remember attending one very memorable and sad one with him in the Long Room some years ago against Melbourne. On the Saints football club's obituary page for Sir Zelman, the team has posted a particularly apt and charming photo of Sir Zelman smiling with delight with that great character of Aussie Rules football Kevin 'Cowboy' Neale, who kicked five goals in the 1966 grand final. Perhaps our team, St Kilda, could benefit by inscribing what sometimes was stated in Sir Zelman's philosophy of life: 'the next thing and the next thing'.


I had many experiences with Sir Zelman over the decade since I became active in student politics—including with Steven Skala, who is present in the chamber with the family and Sir Zelman's son Nick—perhaps most memorably during the republic debate, on which the member for Berowra accurately cited Sir Zelman's view in favour of a parliamentary system of electing an Australian head of state. My most memorable encounter with Sir Zelman involved learning about Australian history. One day we fell into deep conversation about the Japanese attack on Darwin, which he was present at as a young naval intelligence officer. He explained to me that perhaps Australians were not quite as brave and as fearless as some of us would like to imagine and that history is perhaps more complicated than we realised. He and Australian naval intelligence played a great role in the defeat of the Japanese naval forces through the signals they sent for the crucial Battle of Midway. Sir Zelman rightly enters the pantheon of great Australians of the character of Monash and Sir Isaac Isaacs.

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2012-02-07,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (14:30):  Zelman Cowen was a giant of a man. His record of achievement as a legal scholar, educator and public intellectual has few parallels in Australian life. As our nation's 19th Governor-General, he set a standard that is the benchmark for all those who have followed. His reputation was impeccable, based on a life lived with honesty and integrity to a degree that is seldom found. Sir Zelman's life and work won equal plaudits from both sides of the political divide. He was always above the rancour of partisanship.


But it was the private man who was so special to those who had the privilege of knowing him. He was humane and decent, humble yet proud. One could not find a more loyal and caring friend, deeply interested as he was in the wellbeing of others. He mentored many of the young people who gravitated into his orbit. Each sought his wisdom and advice, which were always dispensed with a generosity of spirit. Age was no barrier to friendship with Sir Zelman for he would elevate you to his level, making you feel comfortable in his presence.


I vividly remember my first meeting with him, nearly two decades ago, when his humour and wit quickly put this young boy at ease. He never needed to demand respect or command obedience but, by virtue of his very nature and being, he simply earned it. Right to the very end of his life, including the day of his passing, I and many others like me listened intently to his every word, knowing we were in the presence of greatness. He was an example and an inspiration and it is through those whom he mentored and his extended family that his legacy will live on. Sir Zelman's intellectual brilliance and firm moral compass were equally matched by a deep sense of his own identity. It is said that to know where you are going you have to know where you come from. Sir Zelman knew this. He was proud of his immigrant background and his Jewish faith and he never sought to distance himself from his heritage during his long and distinguished career.


He was a devoted family man and one-half of a 66-year-long perfect marriage. Lady Anna Cowen, who is with us in the chamber today, is brilliant in her own right and was the source of much of Sir Zelman's strength. As Governor-General, the touch of healing he brought to the nation was equally hers. His love for Anna knew no bounds and I am not the first to say that, barring a small issue of Jewish tradition, she would be a saint.


Looking back at Sir Zelman's life, it is as if he were destined for greatness from the very beginning, born as he was on the day Alfred Deakin died. As a schoolboy he knew he had special talents and at every step of the way he brought them to bear. He was always grateful for the opportunities that fell his way, describing himself as the most favoured of mortals. It is our nation's good fortune that such a gifted and principled man devoted his life to public service. We are all saddened by his passing but can be proud of his legacy and the many lives he has touched. I am proud to have called such a great Australian my friend.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:36):  On a matter of an entirely different nature and one that is a cause for celebration amongst those of us gathered here today, I move:


That an Address of Congratulation be presented to Her Majesty The Queen, as follows:


Your Majesty. We, the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, express to Your Majesty our warm congratulations at this time of celebration of the Diamond Jubilee of your accession to the Throne. We express our respect and regard for the dedication you have displayed in the service of the Commonwealth and your deep and abiding commitment to Australia and her people.


Since Australia became a federation in 1901, we have had just six monarchs. And for more than half of those 111 years there has been only one: Elizabeth II, whose accession to the throne 60 years ago we honour in this sitting today. As third in line to the throne behind her uncle and father, the young Elizabeth was never expected to become Queen. But with the abdication in 1936 the 10-year-old princess became heir to a mighty empire. Even then, Princess Elizabeth could reasonably have expected decades of time to prepare for her future role as sovereign. But it was not to be. Her father, George VI, died at just 56, exhausted by illness and the accumulated stresses of the abdication and the war years. So today, as we honour the Diamond Jubilee, we also join Her Majesty in remembering a good king.


On 6 February 1952, the Queen took over the burden carried by her father: the task of guiding a nation through the painful work of postwar reconstruction; of adapting the monarchy to a new, less formal era; and of addressing the needs of an empire impatient for change. From the beginning, she never appeared troubled by the burdens of office. Indeed, her very first decision set the course for all that was to follow. She was in Kenya when she heard the news of her father’s death and, even whilst coming to terms with that news and all that it meant in those most difficult of circumstances, when asked what name she would take she answered quickly and calmly: ‘My own, of course.’ It was the crisp, practical, no-nonsense approach we have all come to know and admire—an approach which also embraced, and perhaps sometimes hid, a warm and generous heart.


For Australia, the 60 years of Queen Elizabeth’s reign have been years of remarkable evolution for our society and our economy. The Australia of 1952 was a small agricultural nation whose fortunes were tied to its traditional trading partners on the other side of the world. Her Majesty has seen us grow to be the robust, dynamic multicultural country which proudly takes its place in the Asian region and on the world stage. It has also been a period of remarkable political evolution.


Today we recognise the monarch as Queen of Australia. The power of the British parliament to legislate for our nation and our states has been abolished. The High Court has been affirmed as the pinnacle of our nation’s judicial system. We have created our own system of honours, adopted our own national anthem and appointed Australians to all our vice-regal posts as a matter of course. And throughout all that change and maturation, Elizabeth II has been a wise and encouraging guide, always wanting the best for our nation and its future, ready to allow Australia’s democratic journey to take us where it might. If Australia ever chooses a different constitutional path, it will not be for any deficiency on behalf of our monarch or her predecessors.


Of course, the people of the UK and the Commonwealth want to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee, and they will certainly have that opportunity. Celebrations will be concentrated in the United Kingdom in the coming northern summer, and that is appropriate. There will also be a number of initiatives that will enable Australia to share in the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. Last October, I joined British Prime Minster Cameron in announcing the establishment of Queen Elizabeth’s Diamond Jubilee Trust, which will support charitable organisations and projects across the Commonwealth. The trust will be chaired by a former British Prime Minister, Sir John Major, and will be funded by contributions from Commonwealth partners and private donors. I am proud to announce this week that Australia will contribute up to $5 million to the trust, which will provide a lasting legacy of Queen Elizabeth’s reign. I can also advise that Her Excellency the Governor-General will represent Australia at ceremonial events in London in June. One of the key events will be the lighting of a national beacon by Her Majesty on 4 June, part of a Commonwealth-wide event where beacons will be lit on a chain of hilltops all around the UK and the Commonwealth. That will include Australia, where I will light a beacon on top of Parliament House here in Canberra in support of this celebration.


In addition, Parkes Place, here in the Parliamentary Zone, in accordance with historical protocol, will be renamed Queen Elizabeth Terrace to complement the names of the adjacent streets, Queen Victoria, King Edward and King George terraces. Other commemorative activities will include: a jubilee stamp and coin issued by Australia Post and the Royal Australian Mint respectively; an essay competition for Australian students; and the creation of an annual scholarship or bursary which will focus on women’s leadership and related themes such as service and duty.


Finally, I can also advise that His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales will be visiting Australia in the last quarter of the year as the Queen’s representative for the jubilee celebrations accompanied by the Duchess of Cornwall.


There is nothing valedictory in our Diamond Jubilee celebrations, nor should there be. As we saw here, in the Great Hall of Parliament House, on the streets of Australia and then at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth last October, the Queen retains a remarkable vigour and appetite for hard work. This is, however, a moment to dwell upon records broken and milestones reached, because the Queen is the longest lived monarch in British history, the second longest reigning monarch in British history and only the second to have enjoyed a diamond jubilee.


But beyond the statistics of this reign lies consideration of its quality and character. Today we honour a woman who has conducted herself with utmost propriety and dignity, who has served her people with wisdom, fidelity and an unfailing sense of duty. Elizabeth II has made history and become part of history. Today we honour her indelible place in the story of our nation. And we express thanks for the sense of loyalty and service she has shown as our monarch but also as our friend. On behalf of this parliament and our people, I offer Her Majesty our sincere congratulations and best wishes for this Diamond Jubilee year.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:44):  I rise to enthusiastically echo the most gracious words of the Prime Minister on this important occasion and I join her in my own respectful tribute to our Queen on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee. This is truly a great milestone. Only once before in the 1,000-year history of our monarchy has a queen reigned for more than 60 years. Her first Australian Prime Minister was Sir Robert Menzies. Her first British Prime Minister was Sir Winston Churchill. She is a living link to that age of heroes, a sign of continuity and stability in our national life.


Much has changed in 60 years. Much has stayed the same. We were a great country then and we are an even greater country now. Then, we were still part of an empire. Today, we are part of a dynamic but ever-changing Commonwealth. What has not changed is the Queen's unstinting devotion to those noble ideals of duty and service. What also has not changed is the respect and affection of Australians for the Queen, as demonstrated yet again during the latest royal tour, just last year. This is the paradox of the monarchy: the less actual power the Queen wields the more prestige she has; the fewer the decisions the monarch makes the deeper people's affection becomes.


Much was said earlier today about Sir Zelman Cowen. It is important to remember his comments about the monarchy back in 1966, when he wrote movingly of its role in our system as something 'above and outside politics'. The Crown that was once the embodiment of executive government has become a symbol of all that is best in public service.


I welcome the measures that have just been announced by the Prime Minister. I think they are a most fitting way of marking this important milestone. I particularly welcome the Prime Minister's announcement of a visit later this year to our country by Prince Charles, our future King. May I say, with feeling, something that perhaps is not said often enough in this most modern and contemporary of parliaments: may God save the Queen and may God bless this great country.



The SPEAKER:  To signify their support for the address I invite honourable members to rise in their places.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:49):  On indulgence, since parliament last met we have seen the passing of Peter Veness. It was a sad duty for me, accompanied by my partner, Tim, to attend Peter's funeral earlier this year along with other members of the parliament and, I believe, almost the entire parliamentary press gallery. He was a young man who fought incredibly hard against cancer—a young, young man taken from us and from his family far too soon. Even as he struggled with cancer and continued to come to work he turned his thoughts to fundraising for others. Many here would have participated in those fundraising events. One was participated in by Tim as a 'shave-off' event. Peter's courage was on display as he went about those good works, even as he battled cancer himself.


At the funeral service his young wife, Bec, made a remarkable tribute to him. I think her speech, along with the other contributions that day, will be in our minds and in our thoughts for a long period of time. Our thoughts continue to be with Bec and with his parents, David and Cheryl, in the depths of their grief, as we mourn a young man lost far too soon.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:50):  I join with the Prime Minister to pay my respects and the respects of the coalition to someone who was taken away from us far too soon. The phrase 'respected journalist' is normally a bit of an oxymoron, but Peter Veness was not only a respected journalist; he was also a loved journalist. He was certainly very good at his job, as anyone who was grilled by him at the front doors of this building would know. But there was no edge to it and there was no malice to it, as the tributes that have poured in since his passing show.


I particularly liked the tribute that came from the Director-General of ASIO, David Irvine, who noted Pete's meticulous attention to detail. I have often wondered about the clunk on the phone that sometimes happens, and it is good that ASIO are still listening in to the conversations that journalists have. Death is the ultimate mystery, but Peter Veness wrote about it with insight, pathos and humour. We miss him. We mourn him. We particularly grieve with his widow, Bec, and we acknowledge that, more than just about anyone else who has been in this place recently, he filled the unforgiving minute with 60 seconds worth of distance run.

The SPEAKER
 (14:53):  Honourable members will not be surprised to learn that during the summer adjournment I was asked a number of questions about my intentions as Speaker. I have had discussions with the Leader of the House, the Manager of Opposition Business, Independent members and other members. I am very grateful for support for proposals I have made to reduce the time limits in question time, to extend the opportunities for members to ask supplementary questions and to rename the Main Committee as the Federation Chamber of the House of Representatives. I understand that some proposals may come before the House in the near future with respect to time limits for question time and the renaming of the Main Committee. In the meantime I want to let members know of my intentions in four matters.


First, I intend to adopt the same practice as Mr Speaker Jenkins in respect of divisions. Should an occupant of the chair wish to vacate the chair when a division is called, he or she should send a message to this effect to me. In these circumstances, I would propose to take the chair.


If I am required to exercise the casting vote, it is my intention to follow the principles set out in House of Representatives Practice—that is, that the Speaker should always vote for further discussion; where no further discussion is possible, decisions should not be taken except by a majority; and a casting vote on an amendment should leave the bill in its existing form.


Naturally I wish to ensure that order is maintained in the chamber. In this regard, I seek the cooperation of all members. Without in any way being pessimistic, I confirm that it is not my intention to warn disorderly members before directing them to leave the chamber for one hour in accordance with standing order 94(a). While I would usually expect to warn a member prior to naming the member, this would not always be the case.


Finally, I remind members that standing order 103 limits the scope of questions that may be put to the Speaker at the conclusion of question time to matters of administration for which the Speaker is responsible.


I look forward to working with all members to ensure that the House fulfils what we all know are the reasonable expectations of the people of Australia. Copies of this statement are available on the table.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:57):  My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer her to Treasury modelling that shows that the carbon tax will cause a $32 billion hit to the Australian economy and a $600 a year cut in real wages by 2020. I ask: why did the Prime Minister break the promise she made to the Australian people at the last election—namely: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'?

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (15:01):  Mr Speaker, my supplementary question is to the Prime Minister. It is a very simple question: does she accept that the imposition of a carbon tax will reduce economic growth as the Treasury modelling clearly shows?

",HoR,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,5,1,question
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2012-02-07,"



Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:57):  In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question: it is clear that he means to go on as he did in 2011, with misleading claims and continued negativity, as we ready our economy for the future, including for a clean energy future. The figures referred to in the Leader of the Opposition's question are another attempt by the opposition to mislead the Australian people. Treasury modelling shows—and the opposition is aware of this—that, under a carbon price, our economy will continue to grow. Jobs will grow, with employment to increase by 1.6 million jobs by 2020. Real wages will grow by 20 per cent by 2020 and 50 per cent by 2050. Incomes will grow. Gross national income per person will be $9,000 higher in today's dollars in 2020 with a carbon price in place. Vitally, carbon pollution will fall. By 2050, carbon pricing is expected to reduce Australia's domestic emissions by nearly half of what they would have been projected to be without a carbon price. The price impacts will be modest—a one-off increase of 0.7 per cent in CPI—and of course we also know that the carbon-pricing package comes with the benefit of tax cuts for working people earning less than $80,000 a year, many of them receiving a tax cut of $300.



Mr Pyne interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business will remain silent.




Ms GILLARD:
  Then of course there will be Australians around the nation who no longer pay tax anymore as a result of us increasing the tax-free threshold. There will be increases in pensions and there will be increases in family payments. Behind this debate, Mr Speaker, is the essential question of whether or not you want our nation to stand still or be ready for the future. It is a fundamental choice. We have made it. We are getting our nation ready for the future and that future will require us to have a cleaner energy economy. In getting that cleaner energy economy, we are determined to do it at the lowest possible cost and the lowest possible price. The Leader of the Opposition stands for a policy which would impose a burden of $1,300 on working families—a policy that will not work. He stands for ripping tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases out of the hands of Australians who need that money. This is more of the reckless approach we have seen the opposition take to all of its economic settings. Whenever it faces a choice between getting ready for the future or standing still, it says: stand still. Whenever it faces a choice about running the economy in the interests of working Australians, it says: let's help the privileged few. Whenever it faces a choice about making sure our economy is clean and ready for the future it spreads fear and distortion, and today's question is just more of that.

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2012-02-07,"



Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (15:01):  I accept that the Treasury modelling which I have just relied on and the figures which I have given to the House are the Treasury modelling and should be relied on. I also accept that the carbon pricing package of the government is the cheapest possible way of reducing our carbon pollution. When you want to talk about a drag on our economy, when you want to talk about a burden on working families, you would endorse the policy of the Leader of the Opposition. Let us have a look at the policy of the Leader of the Opposition, seeing he invites the comparison. If he wants to get it modelled, if he actually wants to tell Australians the truth about it, we will happily assist. What we know is that, because the Leader of the Opposition is in the business of subsidising polluters, he would make carbon pollution reductions at a far greater cost than carbon pricing; that is, he would do the most economically reckless thing—a thing that would certainly have a huge impact on economic growth and a huge impact on jobs.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on direct relevance. The Prime Minister was asked a very direct question about the Treasury modelling. She was not asked about the Leader of the Opposition's position.



The SPEAKER:  I would counsel the Prime Minister to be directly relevant to the supplementary question.




Ms GILLARD:
  Mr Speaker, what I would say on comparisons of economic effects of carbon pricing packages is that we are determined to do it in the most efficient way. That is what the Treasury modelling shows. It shows economic growth. It shows income growth. It shows our economy growing. What the Leader of the Opposition is determined to do is do the most costly approach, wrecking economic growth with an impact for jobs and taking benefits off working families.

The SPEAKER
 (15:34):  I inform the House that I have received a copy of a resolution passed by the Western Australian Legislative Assembly on 10 November 2011 relating to GST revenue distribution. I do not propose to read the resolution to the House. Copies are being circulated to members in the chamber and the full text will be recorded in the Votes and Proceedings and in Hansard.




The resolution read as follows—



That this House:


(1) notes that GST revenues are distributed to the States and Territories in accordance with a formula driven by horizontal fiscal equalisation principles and legislated for in the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 (Cth);


(2) notes that for 2010-2011 Western Australia received just 68 per cent of what it would have received if GST revenue were distributed across Australia on a per capita basis - the lowest relativity applied to any State since the formula was introduced;


(3) notes that every other State and Territory, by contrast, received not less than 91 per cent of what it would have received if GST revenue was distributed equally across Australia;


(4) calls on the Federal Government to amend the Act to stipulate a minimum GST revenue-sharing relativity of 75 per cent, which would allow continuing respect for the principles of horizontal fiscal equalisation, but with proper recognition for population and without Western Australia being unfairly penalised for its disproportionate contribution to our national economic prosperity; and


(5) calls on Federal Members of Parliament to support the private Members’ motion as moved by Mr Tony Crook MP, Member for O’Connor, in relation to a fairer GST distribution.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (15:45):  There can be no more important topic for this parliament than the economic future of this country. I regret to say that, having told us earlier today in question time that she wanted to bring on an economic debate, the Prime Minister then shut down question time and, of course, is conspicuously absent from this chamber for the beginning of the economic debate that this country needs to have and which this coalition will most assuredly win. Is it any wonder that we have the Prime Minister fleeing the chamber at the beginning of the economic debate which she says she wants when we had this by way of argument from the Prime Minister in question time today:


I accept that the Treasury modelling which I have just relied on and the figures which I have given to the House are the Treasury modelling and should be relied on.


There we have it from the Prime Minister: the Treasury modelling is the Treasury modelling.



Opposition members:  We are us.




Mr ABBOTT:
  As my colleagues behind me remind me, this is the economic equivalent of the vacuous 'We are us' speech which she gave to the Australian Labor Party conference late last year and which I suspect might mark one of the milestones in this Prime Minister's downfall.


The Australian government has two great responsibilities. One of them is national security, which is a responsibility for another day in this chamber. The other is economic security, and that is the subject which should be covered today. What the Australian people expect from their national government is the circumstances in which can be delivered good pay, low interest rates, strong economic growth and more jobs. That is signally what this government has failed to deliver.


This government is constantly congratulating itself because our economy is not as other economies are. That is no thanks whatsoever to the efforts of this government and all thanks to the reforms of previous governments including—let us give credit where credit is due—the reforms of the former Hawke-Keating government, which was in its own way and by its own light a principled government and a government of genuine economic reform. The comparatively, and it is only comparatively, strong position that Australia is in at this present time owes itself entirely to the reforms of previous governments and not at all to the spending spree of the current one. The Prime Minister has the gall to lecture European leaders on economic responsibility when the clear lessons of the eurozone are that a terrible judgment is ultimately pronounced against those countries and those governments which spend too much, borrow too much and tax too much. This government and this Prime Minister are copying failure. The only difference between many of the countries of Europe and this is that we are not as far down that fateful and ill-starred path.


This is a government which has an evil genius for destroying value. This is a government which is proposing to spend $2 billion of taxpayers' money buying back perfectly good power stations in Victoria and closing them down. This is a government which is proposing to spend $11 billion of taxpayers' money buying back Telstra's copper wire network and closing it down. This is a government which is proposing to invest what will ultimately be more than $50 billion of borrowed money that we cannot at this point in time afford to build what is called a National Broadband Network which is one technology and one owner—the government—to deliver a service which Australians do not necessarily need, do not necessarily want and certainly do not want to pay more for. This is a government which excels in stultifying economic activity and at repressing the economic entrepreneurial instincts of the Australian people. The most extraordinary, the most remarkable, the most scandalous case is of course the live cattle trade of the Northern Territory. It was closed down by this government in a panicky overreaction to a television program. But there is more. There is the Tasmanian forestry industry, which is slowly being strangled by this government at the behest of the real deputy prime minister of this country, Senator Brown. There are the oceans which are increasingly being locked up by this government, again at the behest of the green movement. And then there is Senator Brown's proudest monument, the great deception perpetrated by this Prime Minister against the citizens of this country: the carbon tax. This is the worst possible time to introduce the world's biggest carbon tax, and it is just going to get worse and worse and worse as the years go on. The Treasury modelling, which is the Treasury modelling, clearly shows that by 2020 the real wages of the workers of Australia will be $600 a year, or about $12 a week, lower thanks to this carbon tax. Treasury modelling clearly shows that the GDP of this country will be a cumulative $32 billion less in 2020 than would be the case without the carbon tax. This carbon tax is a wrecking ball, smashing through our economy. This carbon tax is the great handbrake on what should be the mighty engine of economic growth, which government should be fostering, not restraining.


It just gets worse. That is how bad it is at $29 a tonne. By the time the carbon tax gets up to $131 a tonne in 2050 there will be a cumulative $1,000 billion—$1 trillion—worth of lost production to our economy because of the carbon tax, and a $4,000 real decrease in the wages of the workers of this country. Do you call yourselves a Labor government, members opposite? What a scandal! What an embarrassment to any decent Labor voter that this government first tells untruths about a carbon tax and then introduces a carbon tax that over time will reduce the real wages of the decent, hardworking people of this country by upwards of $80 a week. Shame! The first impact of the carbon tax, economic modelling shows, is a 10 per cent hit on power prices that have already increased by more than 50 per cent since this government came to office. The next impact of a carbon tax: a nine per cent increase in gas prices, which have already increased by more than 30 per cent since this government came to office.


What a contrast with the record of the Howard government. John Howard would stand up in this parliament and say that the Howard government was the best friend that the workers of Australia ever had. On the record, he was exactly right, because what the Howard government delivered was a 20 per cent increase in real wages, two million-plus more jobs and an increase in the net wealth of every Australian of 100 per cent—a doubling of the net wealth of every Australian. By contrast, what have we seen since 2007 under the Rudd-Gillard governments? We have seen wealth destruction on a scale unparalleled in modern times. We have had stagnating productivity. The greatest embarrassment of all, which none of the braying interjections opposite can cover up: 2011 was the first year since Labor's recession of 1992 when there was no net increase in jobs in our economy—not a single new job in our economy.


Why did we have this? We had this because you could trust the Howard government with money. The Howard government was prudent and frugal with the dollars of taxpayers, which it knew and understood how to husband. The Howard government inherited a $10 billion budget black hole. It turned it into a $20 billion surplus. Over the life of the Howard government, for almost 12 years we had surpluses averaging 0.9 per cent—almost one per cent of gross domestic product. We inherited $96 billion worth of Commonwealth debt and we turned it into $70 billion worth of Commonwealth assets. Look at the contrast. Members opposite have turned a $20 billion surplus into the four biggest deficits in Australia's history. In 2008, Wayne Swan said, 'Peter Costello is just an amateur'—Peter Costello delivered a $20 billion surplus—'I am Wayne Swan, the ""me Tarzan"" of the Australian economy. I will deliver a $22 billion surplus.' What did our hero, Wayne the wonderful, deliver in that year?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The Leader of the Opposition will refer to members by their appropriate titles.




Mr ABBOTT:
  A $27 billion deficit, that is what he delivered. But I tell you what: that is his best result so far. That is as good as it gets so far because it was followed by a $55 billion deficit.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  Now that's what I call a deficit.




Mr ABBOTT:
  That is right. We all saw the Paul Hogan movie—'That's not a deficit; this is a deficit!' And it was followed by a $49 billion deficit. This year, first of all he said there was going to be a $12 billion deficit; then he said, 'Oops, sorry. Got that wrong. It is actually going to be a $23 billion deficit. But, sorry, got that wrong too.' Now he tells us it is going to be a $37 billion deficit—one of the four biggest deficits in Australia's history. Now he tells us that next year—always somewhere beyond the horizon—we will finally get a surplus. Someone might have said this before, and I would hate to be guilty of the Leader of the House's plagiarism, but we will believe it when we see it.


The Prime Minister said she wants this year to be a year of debate about the economy. Please, please, please bring it on. Every minute, every hour, every day, every week, every month let us debate the economy, because every time she mentions the economy we will say 'carbon tax', the economy-destroying carbon tax that this Prime Minister lied about before the election and now is inflicting on the decent, honest workers of Australia. This is a Prime Minister who has monumentally failed in many respects, but there is one respect, above all others, where she has most clearly failed—and that is in her judgment. Today's demand that all of the debate should be about the economy is yet another failure of judgment—like her failure of judgment in challenging Prime Minister Rudd, her failure of judgment in having an early election, her failure of judgment in announcing an East Timor detention centre without first talking to East Timor, her failure of judgment when confessing that there was no such thing as 'the real Julia' and her failure of judgment in doing a deal with Andrew Wilkie which she never intended to honour. This is a Prime Minister who has failed in judgment, who has failed in honesty and who has failed in commerce. Let us debate that every day between now and— (Time expired)

That is what that speech was all about. Every single statement he made was full of things that this Leader of the Opposition continues to say no to at every turn.


This matter of public importance debate is supposed to be about things that are important to families and yet on this very day the member for Mayo, who is also leaving the chamber, has said—and this really bells the cat about what the Liberals are all about—that family payments, childcare support, pensions and disability support are 'the dead hand of government'. That is what the great thinker of the Liberal Party, the member for Mayo, has said—that all of these supports for families are 'the dead hand of government'. On the 200th birthday of Charles Dickens, you want to take this country back into the Dickensian age. That is what a Liberal government would do to this country—

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Higgins needs to listen in silence or she will not get to listen inside.




Ms MACKLIN:
  and, as we have just seen from the Leader of the Opposition, they do not have one new idea for the future. All they want to do is say no and take this country backwards.


I found it extraordinary that the Leader of the Opposition said that the test for this debate was which government would deliver good pay and low interest rates—an extraordinary test. But he had no intention of addressing how he would deliver that in government and he refused to acknowledge that he was a minister in the government which delivered Work Choices. The Labor government abolished Work Choices so that families in this country could have the security that they need more than anything—the security of knowing not only that they have a job but that the good working conditions of that job are protected. It is this government which has delivered 700,000 additional jobs over the four years it has been in office. Just recently we were very pleased to see a very important pay rise delivered to some of the lowest paid workers in this country—150,000 community sector workers who, at long last, are getting a decent pay rise because of the changes that this government made to the Fair Work Act. This would never have been possible under those opposite.


The Leader of the Opposition also talked about the importance of low interest rates. How important would it have been for him to tell the truth that, as a result of this government's good economic management, families are now paying less on their mortgages than they were when the Liberals were in government? Families know that under the Liberals they faced 10 interest rate rises in a row and that now, under the Labor government, families with mortgages are paying less.


All that said, this government does understand that families continue to be under financial pressure. That is why, instead of filling this debate with abuse as the Leader of the Opposition has—filling it with the ways he intends to say no to everything that this government puts forward—I intend to take the House through all the positive things that this government is doing and has done for families. I will start with the most recent change—never delivered by the National Party or by the Liberal Party—to recognise the importance of family payments for parents who have teenagers over the age of 16. Under the Liberal government, when your child turned 16, family payments went down. It is this Labor government which has fixed that. Those families can now expect to see an increase of up to $4,200 in their budgets each year to help them meet the costs associated with having teenagers. All of us know that teenagers do not get cheaper as they get older—as, somehow, the Liberals seem to think. Of course, it was this Labor government that delivered Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme. Now we know what the Leader of the National Party actually thinks about paid parental leave. We know what he particularly thinks about the Leader of the Opposition's paid parental leave scheme. He totally opposes it. This government did not take any notice of their silly internal bickering. We got on with delivering a national paid parental leave scheme and now we have around 130,000 Australian families actually benefiting from 18 weeks of pay at the minimum wage, which is currently around $590 a week. And it will be this government that also delivers dad and partner pay so that dads and partners can make sure that they too spend some time at home with mum and baby after the baby's birth.


We also understand how important it is to make sure that parents get support when they go back to work and they need to meet the costs of child care. These changes were made by this Labor government, not by those opposite but by a Labor government that understands the costs of child care, a Labor government that understands that parents need help when they go back to work. We have increased the childcare rebate to 50 per cent. What that means is that half of parents' out-of-pocket costs, up to $7½ thousand per child, are now being paid—never done by those opposite; never delivered by them but delivered by this government. What we have also done is speed up the delivery of that help to parents as to the costs of child care so that parents are getting that childcare rebate more frequently to help with their fortnightly bills.


It is this government that has also introduced the education tax refund—never done by those opposite. These are real changes delivered by this Labor government because we understand that having a strong economy needs to be in the interests of families. That is why we are making all these changes. The education tax refund is delivering real payments, real money, to parents when they need it. As the children are going back to school right now, all parents understand that this is an expensive time. Australian families can get as much as $397 for every child at primary school and up to $794 for every child in high school. One of the important changes that this government has made is that it is also allowing families to claim for approved school uniforms as well as other education costs. All of these changes mean real increased support for families.


We have also recognised that it is not only families that need increased support. Our older Australians need it too, those Australians who have done a lifetime of work and want to make sure that as they go into old age they will be able to manage on the pension. It is this government that delivered the historic reforms—reforms never delivered by those opposite—that mean a single pensioner on the maximum rate is now $148 a fortnight better off than they were under the Liberal government. If you are a pensioner couple on the maximum rate you are $146 better off—never done by the Liberals.


This government is also delivering a much-needed boost to superannuation so that families can have security in retirement. It is this government that has delivered the tax cuts, and we know how critical it is to continue to do that. We want to see families have more money in their pockets. I will take you through what this actually means to individual families. Someone on $30,000 is paying $750 less in tax than they were when the Liberals were in government. Someone on $50,000 is paying $1,750 less in tax than they were under the Liberals. All of these changes have been made by this Labor government. When you look at what those opposite did you see they did not deliver to pensioners and they did not deliver these childcare changes. It was the Leader of the Opposition who said paid parental leave would be delivered over his dead body. These are all the things that are on the record as facts. It is not about hurling abuse, as the Leader of the Opposition is so wont to do. They are the facts, and we will continue to deliver to pensioners and families.


As we meet the challenges of the future by making sure that we have a clean energy economy, this government will make sure that nine out of 10 households get help as to the modest price rises that will come about as the economy changes. We know how important it is to deliver the tax cuts, the increases in family payments and the increases in pensions. All of these things will be done to make sure that families and pensioners get the help that they need. We also know, and this became very clear in the Leader of the Opposition's statements last week, and families know—and they will be reminded regularly by all of us on this side—that you cannot rely on the Liberals. What was very clear from the Leader of the Opposition's remarks at the Press Club last week is that if they ever get into government they will rip out of the purses and wallets of pensioners and families all the money that this government intends to deliver starting in May and June this year. Given what we have also heard from the Leader of the Opposition, they cannot even decide whether or not—and this became very clear today—they are going to deliver a surplus. Are they going to deliver a surplus in their first term? Asked whether that would be the case, the shadow finance minister replied, 'It depends.' That is what the shadow finance minister has said. Obviously, as to whether or not he can find the $70 billion that they know they have got to find, he is saying: how would you know? We have seen today the member for Mayo, and I will go back to where I started my remarks, saying that all the things that families and pensioners depend on—the family payments, the childcare support, the disability support and the support for older Australians—are, according to Liberal Party philosophy, just the dead hand of government. So, is this where the Liberal Party will find the cuts necessary to fill their $70 billion black hole? Are they going to take it from the pockets of pensioners and families? We know that that is the Liberal Party's philosophy. They are the ones who say that that is where they will take the money from, because they have never delivered for pensioners and they have never delivered for families.


I also made it clear that for those Australians who are some of the most vulnerable, the people who are looking forward to a Labor government delivering a national disability insurance scheme, all the Leader of the Opposition wants to do is put that on the never-never: never give any hope whatsoever to those people with a disability or their carers and families, who know how desperately in need they are. They know that they can rely on a Labor government to deliver a national disability insurance scheme. It was a Labor government that built Medicare—in fact, we had to do it twice, after a Liberal government destroyed it—and it will be a Labor government that has to deliver a national disability insurance scheme.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2012-02-07,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (16:16):  At the beginning of the federal parliamentary year Australians are increasingly alarmed about the Gillard government and its lack of an agenda. The Prime Minister's authority is clearly in tatters. Her cabinet is split. The rank and file are bitterly divided, both philosophically and politically. If you throw in the Greens and a handful of Independents you have all the ingredients for a directionless, dysfunctional government that has no idea what it wants to do. It is completely out of ideas and it is bereft of an agenda.


They were so out of ideas that this past weekend they decided to bring the caucus together in a new-ideas forum to set a new agenda for Labor in the year ahead.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr TRUSS:
  And, yes, as the honourable member said, 23 of them did not even bother to show up. They did not have any ideas at all. But I have a bit of an idea that there was not too much love at this love-in. They had the butchers paper out, and also the butchers knives. They were sharpening them up and there is no doubt at all it is the Prime Minister's leadership that was on the chopping block.


This is a government without ideas. Indeed, after the event we seem to have heard no new ideas put forward. They had to bring back former Prime Minister Bob Hawke to give them some ideas—a blast from the past. They did not go to the popular former Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs; they went back a further generation to Bob Hawke to try to give them just a few ideas, but nothing came forward.


We should be thankful that at least the current Prime Minister only brought together her caucus for the barbecue at the Lodge. Her predecessor brought together a cast of hundreds and hundreds for his ideas summit. Labor was elected without any ideas and then they had to bring in people from all over the countryside. They came up with a thousand ideas, and four years later fewer than 10 are still breathing, let alone there being any kind of activity that might change the country. Labor is unable to develop ideas of its own and is now even unable to take ideas from others.


The Prime Minister simply cannot be trusted or relied upon. Labor's national conference was just as bad. Labor forgot all about struggling families and the things that matter to them. Instead, Labor tore itself apart over gay marriage and uranium sales and so on. It is not just the issues themselves; it is also that they represent more broken promises from the Prime Minister and from Labor. Then, as the new year began, there was another broken promise. The written agreement with the honourable member for Denison in relation to poker machines has just been torn up. No wonder the Australian people do not trust this Prime Minister and this government. Then, today, the Prime Minister walked away from the commitment to the member for Melbourne and the Greens about dental reform. Another broken promise. Her word is simply worthless. She cannot be trusted. The Australian people are well and truly aware of that—the government cannot be trusted.


The Treasurer told us that last year was to be the year of jobs. The Treasurer said this in his budget speech and said it repeatedly at the Press Club and at other places. The theme for the year was going to be jobs, jobs, jobs. He said 500,000 new jobs would be created. Labor's primary emphasis in 2011 was creating jobs. And what was the final result? Nil. Labor created no new jobs. For the first time for almost two decades, no new jobs were created in Australia. Labor put all of its effort for the year into creating jobs, and they got none. Indeed, the situation is clearly getting worse. Already this year we have heard of Westpac retrenching 400 people; the Bank of Scotland, 200 jobs gone; the ANZ, 130 jobs gone, with another 700 yet to go; Holden, 100 jobs gone; Toyota, 350 jobs gone; BHP, 155 jobs gone; Reckitt Benckiser, 190 jobs gone; Manildra, 70 jobs gone; the Hydro Aluminium plant near Newcastle, 150 jobs gone; Tomago Aluminium, 100 jobs gone; Thales, 50 jobs gone; Don Smallgoods, 31 jobs gone; Heinz, 146 jobs gone; and, today, at Macquarie Bank, 1,000 jobs gone. This is the government that says it is about creating jobs, but that is a list of some of the job losses that have been announced for this year. Also, bear in mind that this is only a small glimpse at the jobs being lost. Almost every small business is laying someone off, but that is not in the newspapers. Almost every manufacturing business is laying people off. Labor's record in the manufacturing sector—the people they purport to represent and understand—is 130,000 jobs lost in manufacturing under the Labor government. Indeed, if we have a Labor government for too much longer, will we have any manufacturing industry left at all?


All of these just sound like numbers, but each one of these jobs lost is a job for a worker. It is a family without somebody who can meet the bills, a family that has lost a job because of this government's incompetence.


Today we had the announcement of what Labor's theme is going to be for this year: they want an economic debate. This is the year for the economy. The Prime Minister called upon all of us to participate in a debate on the economy. Aren't we so pleased to do this. This is the government, after all, that took Australia from surpluses, from having funds in the bank, to massive deficits. The world's greatest Treasurer produced our country's four greatest deficits. He has no idea how to run the country. Labor inherited $70 billion in the bank. Now we have a net debt of $136 billion. The Treasurer is always running out there complaining about the banks not reducing interest rates as much as they should. I think the banks should reduce their interest rates more as well, but one of the reasons why the banks cannot reduce interest rates is that the cost of borrowing money is going up. One of the primary reasons why the cost of borrowing money is going up is that the government is out there borrowing more, $100 million every day. So when somebody is trying to get a home loan from their bank, they are actually competing with the government, which is there in the marketplace on the same day borrowing $100 million. If this government is serious about reducing interest rates, then it must borrow less. It must start balancing its budget. It must start being responsible and putting together an economic agenda that demonstrates this country can pay its way and can balance its own budget—set an example rather than criticise others.


We are leading up to a budget in May. That is going to be a really dodgy document because the government has already announced that billions of dollars worth of expenditure that was supposed to be in 2011 is being brought forward to this year. Other expenditure is being delayed until 2013-14. What they are trying to do is create one little year, one little window, when the budget might actually be balanced, but that is at the expense of a higher deficit this year and a higher deficit in subsequent years. They have diverted a whole stack of money for road funding into this financial year from the next financial year. There will not be any new roads sooner. It is just paying money across to the states so that they can shovel it out and it is not included in next year's budget. There is a similar story with the mental health program and a similar story with the carbon tax. Even though the carbon tax only starts in 2012, the big compensation payout to pensioners is going to be in this financial year. So they pay out billions of dollars worth of compensation this financial year and then collect the tax from the next financial year.


This is a dodgy surplus, if ever it happens. In fact it will not happen. This government is not competent enough to put together any kind of logical budgeting. When they do put together a program, it is dogged by waste and mismanagement. Now everything is going to have to carry the extra burden of a carbon tax, adding to the cost of everything we do, adding to the cost of living, adding to the cost of manufacturing and making our economy uncompetitive. This is a government with no ideas. The ideas it has had have turned to lemons. They have been a dismal failure. (Time expired)

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-02-07,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:26):  Speaking of ideas, I recently read a biography of Michael Foot, who was the opposition leader and Deputy Prime Minister of Great Britain. He said, 'When making a speech, always surprise.' I was waiting for a surprise from those opposite—an idea, a policy or a purpose. I was waiting for some economic credibility, but all we got was economic negativity. I was waiting for the shadow Treasurer to speak and I was waiting for the shadow finance minister to speak. If they had any economic credibility they would be here, but they are off having an argument amongst themselves over the economic circus that we saw in the last 48 hours. When it comes to supporting Australian families, I think the record of those opposite is quite blank. The Leader of the Opposition talked about the golden age of Howardism, but one of the things he did not talk about is Work Choices. We saw a bit of that today with the member for Mayo. I think he has got a new philosophy. We will call it Briggsism. Pensions, family tax benefits and assistance to families are all the dead hand of government. I am waiting for those opposite to endorse Briggsism. We could have Hockeyism, where the member for North Sydney says he agrees with the last person he spoke to. If he says it loud enough, people might believe him. Or we could have Robbism from the member for Goldstein. He waxes lyrical and thinks aloud but he gets himself in trouble. We have got Robbism, Hockeyism and Briggsism amongst those opposite, but there is no economic credibility at all because those opposite have not got any ideas.


We heard about roads from the potential Deputy Prime Minister, were he to sit over here. Roads! It is a bit rich. The Warrego Highway, the Ipswich Motorway and the Blacksoil interchange: those opposite voted against all of these road funding projects that are so important for South-East Queensland. They opposed the Redcliffe railway. For over 100 years we have been wanting a railway in South-East Queensland to Redcliffe, but those opposite opposed it. The member for Wright is over there. He knows how important the Warrego Highway is for his area, but he, like all those opposite, opposed the road funding in South-East Queensland. So we have economic credibility writ large on this side and completely absent on that side. All we hear is negativity and nay-saying. That is what they are on about.


When it comes to what we have done, we have created more than 700,000 jobs. We have got rid of Work Choices so that people have fairness in the workplace. This is so important because those opposite occasionally slip it out when they use the word 'flexibility'. I want the families of Australia to know that flexibility means driving down wages. That is what it means. It means taking away people's pay and conditions. It means penalty rates, long service leave and other things going. Why do we say that? Because it was Labor that built the living wage. It was Labor that built the pension system and the aged care system in this country. It was Labor that built the universal healthcare system in this country. It was Labor that built Medicare—twice, as the minister said—and Labor brought in compulsory superannuation. Those opposite talked with jeremiads about this—alarmist rhetoric—when they were there. They said that this would bring about the ruination of Australian business and the ruination of Australian companies. We did it because we wanted to support Australian families. We did it during this government. We did things like the Paid Parental Leave Scheme. We brought it in. Those opposite never did. The Leader of the Opposition, famously or infamously, said he would never do it; it would be over his dead body. We brought in an education tax refund.


Also, we increased the childcare rebate. We know how important this measure is for electorates. For example, in my electorate of Blair, in South-East Queensland, 7,250 families benefited from childcare payments totalling over $27.9 million in the year 2009-10. The architect of Briggsism, the member for Mayo, in his electorate had 4,800 families benefitting from the childcare payments, totalling almost $12 million in that same year. This is the bloke that describes this as 'a cycle of dependency' and 'the dead hand of government'. We are about supporting families. We are about supporting individuals. We want to keep the country strong. And we want to make sure, as we did during the global financial crisis, that we support jobs.


The Leader of the Opposition was literally asleep at the wheel when we were bringing in the economic stimulus package that saved 200,000 jobs. Last year, when we wanted to spread the wealth of the mining boom to benefit Australian families, he was sitting there dosing with the member for Leichhardt, who nudged him just in time to say no and to vote no. On bill after bill after bill after bill, he voted no. When it came to extending superannuation to help families and to make sure that a 30-year-old gets more than $100,000 more in compulsory superannuation when they retire, he said no. On regional infrastructure funding of $2 billion in my electorate in South-East Queensland as well as across Queensland, those opposite, including all those LNP members, should hang their heads in shame because they voted against it and also other projects.


Why should we be surprised? They have opposed infrastructure spending in my home state, election after election after election—including the Ipswich Motorway, the most important infrastructure project in South-East Queensland. For three elections in a row they have opposed the funding for it. We know that all the mayors and their councils in South-East Queensland support it, as they do all the infrastructure. They have been down here many, many times. Even Campbell Newman supported the Ipswich Motorway upgrade while those opposite opposed it for three elections in a row. I look forward to seeing what their attitude will be towards it at the next election.


There is also the Blacksoil interchange. The member for Wright sits opposite. He knows how important it is, because Steve Jones, the mayor of the Lockyer Valley, which is in his electorate, has told me how important that project is. We know how important that project is for the Lockyer Valley and the Brisbane Valley—the Somerset region. But those opposite opposed it. In South-East Queensland, 40,000 vehicles a day go through that intersection. Mums and dads are driving their kids to schools like WestMAC, to the grammar schools in Ipswich and up to Lowood high school and primary school. At Fernvale is the fastest growing primary school in my electorate. We know how important this intersection is for mums and dads. They and their families use that intersection at the Ipswich Motorway and the Warrego Highway each and every day to drive to work and to school as well as for reasons of recreation or business. The farmers need it as well.


Families are crucial. We know how important families are in the life of this country. Children are a blessing and a heritage but they also cost money. We know that and that is why we brought in the education tax refund. That is why we increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. We know how important it is to help families. That is why personal income taxes are lower under this government. That is why there is an historic increase in pensions. We increased pensions during the global financial crisis to make sure that people had the money they needed. We know that about 1.5 million Australians work in the retail sector. We wanted to make sure that their jobs were supported. That is why we gave out the stimulus money.


We also know that about 250,000 people work in construction across this country. That is why we did projects like the BER. And those opposite—and I have seen some of them—actually turn up to BER ceremonies, saying how great they are, because this is where school kids go for their education. Those opposite opposed the BER funding that was so important across length and breadth of this country. And not only that, but, during the flood crisis in Queensland, the BER halls acted as evacuation centres. Some of them were used before they were officially opened. We know how important they were.


We know how important families are, and we have supported families. We have supported families historically. It has been Labor governments which have supported families. This Labor government supports families and it will continue to do so. I come back to what Michael Foot said: those opposite never surprise us because they are always on the side of the privileged rather than the many. They are always on the side of the few. There is no utilitarianism at all about them. They really will not help working families or the working class, because they always believe in their divine right to rule.


You only have to listen to the speeches of those opposite—the hard right-wing Thatcherism of those opposite. Michael Foot knew all about it, because he opposed it for years. If they come to this side of the chamber, we know that they will do it. We know that Work Choices will be back and that will impose pressure on working families. We support working families. We know how important they are for this country.


We want to keep this economy strong, and we have done so. We have low inflation, low unemployment and our economy is the envy of the world. When the Leader of the Opposition goes overseas he talks us up. When he comes back here he talks us down. He cannot tell the truth when it comes to the economic credibility of this country, because the Leader of the Opposition has no ideas, no notions, no policies, only aspirations—no commitment, only aspirations. We are going to deliver the NDIS. Those opposite have no aspiration. They should hang their heads in shame because they have no credibility with working families. (Time expired)

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2012-02-07,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (16:36):  I am always pleased to rise after I have been forced to listen to diatribe from members opposite about how the Labor Party has some kind of moral monopoly on the working class people of Australia. For some unknown reason—I should say for some reason only known to members of the Labor Party—it seems to be only people of the Labor Party in this chamber who are concerned with the lifestyles and the cost of living for Australia's working families.


Here is a little secret for the Australian Labor Party: it is not about the rhetoric; it is not about the glossy language; it is not about the glossy brochures; it is not about whether or not Kevin Rudd's photo is big this week and Julia's photo is small or whether in fact it is Julia's photo that is big this week and Kevin's photo is small. What actually matters to those people out there who employ us to make a difference in their lives is what you deliver. It is results that count. It is the difference that you make in their lives that matters to them. What they know about the Australian Labor Party is that it is a complete and utter fraud. It is a fraud on any measure that you are prepared to use. On any measure that you are prepared to benchmark government performance on, the Australian Labor Party is a fraud because its rhetoric does not match the results. What we know is that the Australian Labor Party likes to talk about working families. Who could forget the election of the Rudd Labor government back in 2007? Granted, there are many who would like to on that side, but that notwithstanding who could forget it when we saw Kevin Rudd looking earnestly down the barrel of the TV cameras across the land saying, 'I am here for Australia's working families.' They believed him in large measure and that is why he was elected. What we know, though, is that promises that he would be 'just like John Howard but with a softer heart' and promises that he was an economic conservative meant nothing and they were followed through with nothing. 


When you look at Labor's performance in office, it has been abysmal. They have taken Australia from a $70 billion surplus position—from budget surpluses in virtually every single year of the Howard government—to now being $132 billion in debt. Labor members like to say, 'You are misguiding the Australian people because you do not take into account that we have had the GFC; you do not take into account that we have been so adversely affected.' The reality is that simply does not accord with the truth, because the Asian region has been through much greater economic tumult than the GFC. It was called the Asian financial crisis and affected our area of the world much more than the GFC ever did. Dr Emerson, an economist who is sitting at the table, has suddenly gone silent because he knows the truth, and he knows that Peter Costello's economic stewardship of the Australian economy ensured that, despite those economic headwinds, despite severe economic turbulence, the coalition was able to make strong effective decisions that led Australia to the lowest unemployment rate in 33 years, delivered a $70 billion surplus and ensured that we had productivity growth that left Labor's record for shame.


What is more, we have heard Labor Party promises from mountain to seaside all over the country about how the Labor Party is concerned about Australian workers. Think back to 2007 and how Labor was going to make a difference to Australian families. There is one truly important measure on that, and that is what is happening to grocery prices, what is happening with people's budgets and the food they can put on their tables. We recall that at that time the Labor Party promised us this you-beaut initiative, this new policy pronouncement, called GroceryWatch. We all know that Labor walked away from GroceryWatch. It is very unfortunate that the minister responsible is the person sitting at the table there. I did a little Google search on the words 'GroceryWatch' and it was interesting to see that the first result that came up under 'GroceryWatch' was grocerywatch.com.au. It said: 'Hello world! Welcome to WordPress. This is your first post.' This was a $13 million initiative that the Australian Labor Party tipped down the drain and all you have got is a WordPress site that says, 'This is your first post.' The fourth result was much more interesting. The fourth result was an article that ran in the Age by Kelly Burke on 27 June 2009. This was quite telling. It said:


…the Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, Craig Emerson, made the decision to scrap the grocery price monitoring website, just six days before its scheduled launch.


The article said:


The Federal Government's $13 million election promise to force grocery prices down lies in tatters.


I thought how apt because it is not just GroceryWatch you could apply that sentence to; there are so many from this Labor Party. You could say the federal government's election promise to introduce FuelWatch lies in tatters, the federal government's election promise to install pink batts lies in tatters, the federal government's decision to remove pink batts lies in tatters, the federal government's election promise to build school halls lies in tatters, the federal government's promise to deliver a surplus lies in tatters, the federal government's election promise to keep interest rates down lies in tatters, the federal government's election promise to introduce mandatory precommitment lies in tatters; and the most important of all election promises, the federal government's election promise not to introduce a carbon tax, lies in tatters. On every single measure, this is a government that has betrayed the working people of Australia. 


Unemployment is up under this government. Debt is up under this government. Let us look at some facts on the Holy Grail that the Labor Party likes to focus on—that is, interest rates. Although the Labor Party is very fond of claiming that interest rates are lower under it, we know in reality that interest rates are actually lower under the coalition. We also know that inflation is lower under the coalition. The reason these things happen is that the coalition controls spending. We do not go on $136 billion spending sprees. We actually make meaningful and considered decisions that deliver solid stewardship when it comes to the Australian economy and deliver results in productivity, inflation and interest rates.




Mr Stephen Jones:
  The worst productivity in years.




Mr CIOBO:
  I hear members opposite talking about productivity now, saying we had the worst productivity. That is fascinating. Under the coalition government from 1996 to 2007, there was 1.2 per cent productivity growth and in the same corresponding period for Labor in government it was minus 0.9 per cent. Under the coalition government from 1996 to 2007, average annual labour productivity growth was 2.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent for the corresponding period that Labor was in office. So, once again, we see the facts simply unmask the truth about how this government is completely inept when it comes to economic stewardship.


However, my concern is that real Australian families out there who are trying to put food on the table, trying to service their mortgage and trying to meet all the expenses associated with raising kids in Australia today have been left worse off as a result of this government's policies. We know that inflation is increasing at what seems to many families to be an exponential rate. Electricity prices are up 51 per cent from 2007; gas prices are up 30 per cent; water and sewerage rates are up 46 per cent; health costs are up 20 per cent; education costs are up 24 per cent; and rents on average are up 20 per cent. And it is going to get worse. When Labor introduces the world's biggest carbon tax, midway through this year, we will see that. Expectations are that electricity prices will go up by a further 10 per cent in the first year alone and that there will be a nine per cent increase in gas bills. On Labor's own figures, families will have to fork out an extra $515 a year under the carbon tax—and that is before any of the hidden costs start to wash through the economy.


We also know that Labor is attacking other areas in the cost of living for the Australian population. Labor promised not to do anything to private health insurance. Now it is attacking that large proportion of the population that relies on the 30 per cent rebate to ensure that private medical cover is affordable for them and for their family. We have seen the price of child care escalate, up by an estimated $80 a week, as a direct consequence of Labor's policy decisions. On every measure, this is a government that is big on one thing and one thing only: it is big on talk. But when it comes to real action, real results and providing hope, reward and opportunity for Australia's working families, this government delivers nothing. It delivers higher unemployment. It delivers lower real wages. It delivers higher inflation and higher interest rates. It is Australian working families which have suffered as a direct consequence of this Labor Party being in government. (Time expired)

Mrs D'ATH
 (Petrie) (16:46):  There seems to be a lot of reminiscing and talking about the good old days from the opposition today—and, by the sound of it, how keen they are to get back to those 'good old days' of the Howard government. We have heard a lot of bragging about the surplus of the Howard government, bragging about being friends of the working people and bragging about their fiscal policies. I would like to finish off what the member for Moncrieff started. Let us look at some comparisons between the Howard government and the current Labor government.


Let us look at the unemployment rate, which was 6.4 per cent under the Howard government. Let us look at the participation rate, which was 63.5 per cent under the Howard government. Under the Labor government unemployment is 5.2 per cent and participation is 65.5 per cent. Let us look at taxes as a percentage of GDP. Under this government it is 22.3 per cent. Under the Howard government it was 24.1 per cent. That is what they are proud of—being the highest taxing government in Australian history. Let us look at this Labor government's real government spending. In the next five years it will be one per cent per annum, the lowest since the 1980s. During the Howard government's last five years it was 3.7 per cent per annum. Underlying inflation under this government is 2.3 per cent, whereas at the end of the Howard government's term it was 3.5 per cent. So, if we are going to talk statistics and facts, let us talk real facts. Let us stop the fear campaign that we know the opposition is so proud of and let us start talking about real facts. Let us start talking about the surplus of the Howard government and how they achieved that surplus by flogging off government assets. Selling Telstra—that is what it really was. That is what we need to talk about.


But let us not talk just about the past; let us talk about now. Let us talk about what the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer would do to get back into surplus if they were in government. We heard it again last night from the shadow Treasurer: they would sack 12,000 public servants. That is where they would start. The MPI that the opposition put forward today is about helping Australian families and the day-to-day concerns of Australian families. Their solution to dealing with the day-to-day concerns of Australian families is: let us cut 12,000 jobs straightaway. That will fix the problem. If we look at the shadow Treasurer's idea of where those 12,000 jobs might come from, where did he target on Q&A last night? He said, 'Let's take 12,000 jobs out of health.' That will fix the system! That will look after Australian families!


We heard from the member for Moncrieff that Australia families want results. He said it is results that count; it is delivery. Let us look at some of the results that Australian families got under the Howard government. Let us look at what they did to Australian families. By putting in Work Choices, they did not just rip away penalties and take away job security; they attacked the most disadvantaged in the working community, the casual workers, who are predominantly non-English-speaking workers and women. That is how they looked after Australian families. In question time today we heard how the Leader of the Opposition looked after Australian families when he was the Minister for Health and Ageing: he took money out of health. But he did not just strip money out of health; he did away with the Commonwealth dental scheme. That is helping Australian families! Of course, let us not forget the absolute lack of investment in education and skills or in trades. Look at the burden that this country was left with at the end of the Howard era in relation to the skills shortage in this country, due to the lack of investment in infrastructure and job opportunities.


I am happy to talk about the Howard years. I am happy to talk about the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition as a whole and what their future plans are. They oppose the NBN. They oppose supporting jobs through the financial crisis. They oppose any investment in schools, whether it be halls, libraries, computers or trade training centres. In anything to do with schools, they oppose any sort of reform. They oppose the minerals resource rent tax. Of course they do not want to give companies, predominantly small business, company tax cuts. They certainly do not want to increase superannuation to look after workers in their retirement.


But they do want to do one thing. What they do want to do is take money back from families and business and give it to those hardworking mining owners. Let us look after Gina Rinehart and Clive Palmer because they are really struggling! They are the Australian families that the opposition really want to look after. Gina's family will be looked after. Clive Palmer's family will be looked after. But when we talk about the real day-to-day concerns of Australian families you certainly will not see those on the other side putting their hands in their pockets and saying, 'We need to support these people with jobs, with future opportunities, with health, with education.' It is this government that delivered on tax cuts. It is this government that will increase the tax-free threshold and provide further tax cuts for those earning up to $80,000. It is this Labor government that introduced the historic Paid Parental Leave scheme and it is this government that increased the childcare rebate. It is this government that filled the gap left by the Howard government in relation to family tax benefits and assistance for teenagers. It is this government that is investing in university places and trade training to give our kids opportunities and career paths after school. It is this government that is helping through the education tax refund.


In my electorate alone there are over 10,000 families benefiting from the childcare benefits—over $25,000 in the 2009-2010 year. It is my electorate that is benefiting through the Moreton Bay Integrated Care Centre—our superclinic where for the first time we will be training GPs, as well as bringing dental training to the area and bringing specialists to the area. It is this Labor government making sure that the youth in the electorate of Petrie are being looked after with new youth facilities at North Lakes.


It is this government who has finally stood up and invested in public urban rail across this country. It is only a Labor government that would do that. How much did the Howard government invest in urban rail? It is easy: zero. Absolutely nothing. Not one cent. It is this government that is delivering, in coordination with the Moreton Bay Regional Council and the Queensland state government, with Anna Bligh and her team, the building of the Redcliffe rail link. Those on the other side would never have done it and never did do it; it is this government that is delivering.


It is this government that is not just providing the 35 schools in my electorate of Petrie, and schools all across the country, with important infrastructure but also introducing a national curriculum. The Howard government could not do it in 11 years. This government has done it. For the first time ever in Australia's history, whether you are learning at Mango Hill State School in the electorate of Petrie or at a school in Moreton, whether you are going to school in Tasmania, in Western Australia or in South Australia, you will be following the same curriculum. That is about giving opportunities, lifting skills in education and increasing productivity for the future of this country.


Liberal is about tearing down hopes and dreams; Labor is about building hopes and opportunities and is dedicated to long-term reform. We have seen what happens with Liberal governments in the states. Look at what is happening already in Victoria, in New South Wales and in Western Australia—attacking the most disadvantaged, attacking education, attacking health, attacking essential services and attacking police and nurses. We will see it in Queensland under Campbell Newman and his team if they get in: they will attack the most disadvantaged in Queensland.


It is this Labor government that understands the day-to-day concerns of Australian families, and it is this Labor government that is facing up to the challenges for those Australian families now and into the future. It is this Labor government that makes the tough decisions to create a stronger economy and a fairer society for Australian families. The Liberal Party is about fear and negativity. It always will be. Whether it is Tony Abbott or any other Leader of the Opposition, we will continue to see negativity and we will continue to see fear. It can continue with that campaign because that is what it is about. Labor is about hope and opportunity. It is about caring for Australian families. It has done it since it got into government in 2007, it has done it throughout history and the Labor government will continue to look after Australian families into the future.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (16:55):  I rise to enter this debate on the matter of public importance and talk about some of the families that those on the other side do not have the guts to talk about. They do not have the guts to talk about these families because they are doing them in the eye. They cannot look them in the eye because they are doing them in the eye. I will start with the families of the auto workers in this country. These are the 46,000 families around the country who rely on the automotive industry to sustain a living and to bring a wage home to look after their families and their kids. There are 46,000 workers—200,000 workers when you look at the downstream supply chain involved in the automotive industry—and those on the other side want to shut this industry down. They use weasel words, but we know what their real agenda is and the member for Mayo has belled the cat: they see this as useless government assistance to an industry that adds no value. We stand for these families in the auto industry because we believe in the value that they bring to the Australian economy. 


There is another group of families that those on the other side will not talk to. That is the group of families who work in the steel industry. Those on the other side want to rip out $300 million from the Steel Transformation Plan because they do not believe in the steel industry in this country—$300 million that is going to keep open the doors of the two companies that are our two principal steel producers in this country. Those on the other side voted against the Steel Transformation Plan. Is it any wonder that those on the other side will not talk about the families of the steel workers in this country. But it does not stop there. There are the 12,000 public servants whose jobs they want to cut and send to the unemployment scrapheap. They will not talk about those families and the families of those workers—12,000 Australians who they want to make unemployed to fill the $70 billion black hole in their budget. 


I will tell you about another group of families—and this is an eternal shame—that they will not talk about. That is the families of disabled kids. To their eternal shame, their Liberal brothers and sisters in the New South Wales parliament cared so little about the families of disabled kids that they left the kids stranded at the bus stop. They did not even organise a bus to take these poor kids to school on the hottest day in New South Wales this summer. Is it no wonder that those on the other side will not talk about the families of disabled kids. They do not even have the ability to say, 'The National Disability Insurance Scheme is something that we believe in and we are going to put into place.' Those on this side of the House stand for the families of disabled kids—families struggling to give those kids some semblance of normality in their lives. 


And what about the families who have opened their doors to poor disadvantaged kids to provide a foster service for them? They will not talk about those families either, because their brothers and sisters in New South Wales are doing exactly the same thing. It is the most heartless policy of slashing the payments made to those families in order to divert that money to some other Liberal boondoggle in the state of New South Wales. We on this side of the House in this parliament stand for those families. You will not hear it from those on the other side of the House, because there are so many families they cannot look in the eye because they are so busy doing them in the eye. While they are doing those families in the eye, we are busy creating decent jobs with decent wages, we are busy keeping interest rates low and unemployment low and we are busy ensuring that we are building the economy for the future so that these families have jobs for themselves and jobs for their kids. That is the stark contrast between those on this side of the House and those on that side of the House.

"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2012-02-07,"



Mr RUDD
 (Griffith—Minister for Foreign Affairs) (17:01):  by leave—This, the first sitting day of the parliament for this year, provides me with an opportunity to inform the House of recent developments in our neighbour Papua New Guinea. Australians were shocked to learn of the terrible loss of life that occurred on 2 February with the sinking of the Rabaul Queen. I offer to the government and to the people of Papua New Guinea our deepest sympathy as they deal with the trauma of this great national tragedy.


As might be expected of a close neighbour and friend, Australia has been heavily involved in support for the PNG-led response to this disaster. Australians can justifiably be proud of our rapid and effective response. Within minutes of the incident, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, AMSA, passed on the distress signal to transiting ships, which responded quickly, and played a key role in coordinating search assets. Within a few hours, two AMSA rescue aircraft were deployed, one from Cairns and the other from Darwin. The aircraft from Cairns was able to drop life rafts into the sea to assist survivors while they waited to be rescued by merchant vessels. They were joined in the search on the first day by a Royal Australian Air Force P3 Orion aircraft. An Australian Border Command Dash 8 also contributed to the search and rescue operation.


AMSA also engaged three helicopters and two civilian aircraft in the search, including a Queensland Careflight jet. These aircraft continued to search for several days after the sinking. AMSA also deployed several Australian rescue and recovery personnel to Lae to assist. The Australian High Commission in Port Moresby deployed a naval officer to the PNG Maritime Safety Authority. Another Defence member of the High Commission staff, based in Lae, coordinated with local agencies there and arranged refuelling of the search and rescue aircraft.


Not long after the first reports of this tragedy, I made clear to my counterpart, PNG Foreign Minister Ano Pala, that Australia will make all assistance available to PNG to deal with this disaster. I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her statement of support for this position on the same day. We are proud of the joint PNG-Australia effort in rescuing 246 survivors. But none of this can take away the awful fact that many did not survive.


The ferry tragedy came in addition to a large landslide in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea on Tuesday, 24 January. Australia immediately offered assistance to the PNG government following the landslide and has been in constant contact with authorities since the incident occurred. It appears from reports from the local community that at least 23 people are missing, presumed dead, from this incident. We mourn their passing, as we do those who have died tragic deaths in the ferry disaster, and we renew today our condolences to all their families.




Political Situation



PNG has been, and always will be, a key priority for Australian foreign policy. It has been a key focus of the Prime Minister, of mine, of the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs and of the wider Australian government. Our engagement with PNG and its key government figures has been deep and close. I visited PNG from 30 September to 1 October 2011, the third visit that I have made to PNG over the last several years. I co-chaired with PNG Foreign Minister Pala the Australia-PNG Ministerial Forum on 12 October 2011 involving 19 ministers and parliamentary secretaries, including Parliamentary Secretary Marles, who visited PNG from 18 to 21 October on his fifth visit to that country. Of the many phone contacts I have had in recent months, I last spoke to my PNG counterpart, Minister Pala, on 2 February concerning the ferry disaster.


The Prime Minister also spoke to her counterpart, Prime Minister O'Neill, on 5 February. Prime Minister O'Neill was welcomed to Australia for official visits in October and again, of course, for CHOGM. He had a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Gillard at the Pacific Island Forum meeting on 8 September.


PNG is a proud nation with strong economic prospects underpinned by their rich endowments in natural resources. Nonetheless, it is a country that has recently faced constitutional, political and legal challenges. Papua New Guinea is a sovereign country. In its almost 37 years of independence, it has established a record of vigorous democracy. It is for Papua New Guineans to resolve, therefore, their political differences. The ultimate resolution of political differences in a democracy is through the constitutional and electoral processes of that country. Australia respects PNG's sovereignty.


As our closest neighbour, however, and with the historical and contemporary close links between our countries and our peoples, Australia has an abiding and strong interest in PNG's political stability and its economic development. Since the decision of the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea on 12 December, the political situation in Papua New Guinea has been highly contested. Legal action is being taken by both sides of politics in support of their claims.


During the first crisis in December, both the Prime Minister and I conveyed messages through diplomatic channels to the parties concerned on the fundamental importance of resolving constitutional, parliamentary and other political difficulties peacefully. At the same time, and again consistent with the advice of our high commissioner and as approved here in Canberra, both Australian Federal Police and Australian military personnel were actively engaged with their PNG counterparts in urging and in maintaining calm. The Papua New Guinea Defence Force remained in barracks. And, after some initial tensions, the internal divisions within the PNG police force were also resolved peacefully. Together with political communications through our high commissioner, these combined efforts contributed to the effective settlement of the situation in December.


The same approach was applied in the broad to the January crisis, which involved the temporary detention of the Commander of the PNG Defence Force. Once again, both the Prime Minister and I were in close contact with High Commissioner Kemish on the best response to the crisis. Both the high commissioner and the ADF once again engaged with PNG counterparts. Their efforts contributed to the progressive diffusion of the situation during the course of 26 and 27 January.


The engagement of our key officials in PNG was done in a calm, measured and respectful way, taking advantage of Australia's deep engagement with PNG across all arms of government. It was a dialogue of equals: Australian police spoke to Papua New Guinea police and soldiers spoke to soldiers. I would like to play particular tribute to our high commissioner in Port Moresby, High Commissioner Kemish, and the staff in the high commission for their effective work throughout this period. The calm and effective way they went about their business was a case study in quiet diplomacy.


I spoke to High Commissioner Kemish earlier today to get an update on developments in PNG over recent days. I reiterated to him the strong confidence that both the Prime Minister and I have in the high commission during what has been a sensitive and challenging time. I would emphasise that, throughout these incidents, both the Prime Minister and I have sought continued guidance on the most effective form of engagement with these incidents. The high commissioner's consistent advice, mindful of Australia's historical relationship with PNG as a former colonial power and mindful therefore of PNG's political sovereignty, has been for Australia to adopt a low-key public approach while working intensively behind the scenes.


At this time, the high commissioner has cautioned against high-profile political visits to the country or high-profile political communications with PNG political leaders—for fear that such actions would fuel rather than ease the situation. It is impossible to rule out further political turbulence in the lead-up to PNG's general elections, due in the middle of this year. Our diplomatic, AusAID, defence and police personnel and other government officials in Port Moresby remain vigilant. And, in the spirit of constructive dialogue with their PNG counterparts, they are doing whatever is necessary to support continued stability in what all analysts agree is a difficult, complex and evolving political environment.


The messages that we are sending to our friends in Papua New Guinea as they deal with the challenging issues that they face are as follows: we respect your sovereignty; as your friend and partner, we take a close interest in developments and are there to help in whatever way we can; and it is important that the issues are resolved with restraint and in a way that gives assurance to the international community about the stability of your country.


I want to be clear that the government has for some time now been working closely with PNG to support election preparations. The forthcoming elections are very important. We are providing election assistance and are ready to do more. We have provided support to the PNG Electoral Commission—including in logistics, operations support, voter awareness and twinning between the PNG Electoral Commission and the Australian Electoral Commission—and we are responding positively to a PNG government request for additional operational and logistical support. Australian police are supporting the role of PNG police in election security with communications, training and additional recruitment. Defence is funding the commercial lease of two helicopters for the PNGDF to support the elections process as well.


As PNG works through its current political challenges, we continue to pursue our deep and broad bilateral relationship with the country. Our development program in PNG is our second largest globally—some $482 million in 2011-12—focusing on PNG's greatest development challenges in education, health, transport infrastructure, and law and justice.


Two-way trade between our countries is now some $7 billion. Australia is providing technical assistance to support the establishment of a PNG sovereign wealth fund for its $15 billion liquefied gas project. Our police and defence forces have longstanding and productive partnerships. We have deep people-to-people links. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the Kokoda campaign and the Battle of Milne Bay. Australia will continue to stand by our friends in Papua New Guinea in managing the many challenges that lie ahead.

"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2012-02-07,"



Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (17:12):  Papua New Guinea is our closest neighbour and one of our dearest friends. Our deep friendship stretches back particularly to the dark days of World War II, when the people of both of our countries came together in pursuit of a shared and noble end. The bonds that were forged have carried our two countries forward, bridging any and all differences that may have stood momentarily in our way. The coalition is deeply committed to building on the close ties that exist between Australia and Papua New Guinea as two nations with a shared interest in upholding peace and prosperity in the Pacific.


It is the enduring friendship that exists between our two countries that has made the past few months in Papua New Guinea so difficult and, in the case of recent tragedies, that much more distressing to watch. The coalition was deeply saddened to hear the news of the latest tragedy to strike the people of Papua New Guinea. The sinking of the MV Rabaul Queen in waters off Lae shocked not only a nation but all those who have spent time in Papua New Guinea and enjoyed the warm hospitality of its people. As of yesterday, 246 people had been rescued. Sadly, five people on board the ferry did not share their good fortune. Little hope is left for those still unaccounted for. The coalition offers its heartfelt sympathies to those who lost loved ones in the incident.


The people of Papua New Guinea can be assured that the thoughts and prayers of all Australians are with them at this difficult time. We wholeheartedly support the Australian government in its efforts to assist the government and people of PNG in the days and weeks that follow. I particularly pay tribute to the work of our High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea and his staff, who have coordinated our efforts. That this tragedy followed so soon after a disaster in the Southern Highlands, where a landslide destroyed a small village community as it slept, makes it even more distressing.


These incidents have come at a time of heightened political instability in the country. The decision of the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court on 12 December last year, that the removal of Sir Michael Somare from office in August was unlawful, continues to cause confusion and instability in a country that is in desperate need of stability. So complicated had the situation become that at one point the country had two governors-general, two prime ministers and two police chiefs. At that time Papua New Guinea's defence force was to be commended for remaining outside of the political street fight that was taking place all around it. However, this situation took a confronting turn on 26 January 2012 when 20 soldiers, led by Colonel Sasa, entered Murray Barracks in Port Moresby, taking the head of the military hostage in a desperate attempt to reinstate Sir Michael Somare as Prime Minister. Claiming that he had been duly appointed as commander by Sir Michael, Colonel Sasa ordered the Prime Minister, Peter O'Neill, to step down from office or he would 'take all necessary actions to protect and uphold the integrity of the constitution'.


While this stand-off has largely been resolved, the broader issue of PNG's government remains hotly contested, with little prospect at the moment for compromise. The political situation must be resolved within their parliament, within their courts if necessary and ultimately at the ballot box. As Papua New Guinea's national election approaches, it is essential that political stability is restored as soon as possible so that free and fair elections can take place reflecting the will of the people of Papua New Guinea.


In all the confusion that has taken place, one policy before the Papua New Guinea parliament worthy of greater attention is a bill that will set aside 22 seats for female representatives. I congratulate the supporters of the bill, who have worked so tirelessly to get it before the parliament. I had the honour of meeting Dame Carol Kidu, the inspiration and driving force behind the bill, when I was in Port Moresby last year. Dame Carol is the Queensland-born wife of the late PNG Chief Justice, Sir Buri Kidu. As the only female representative in the PNG parliament, she faces challenges that women members of parliament in Australia can barely comprehend. Australia looks to the Papua New Guinea parliament in the hope that it can unite around this common good and deliver the change that is needed for this worthwhile bill to take effect. The women of Papua New Guinea have an enormous contribution to make to the peace, order and good government of PNG, and I look forward to their enhanced participation in PNG political life.


All this comes at a unique stage in Papua New Guinea's national history. The development of its oil and gas industry looks set to transform its economy, with the PNG LNG project alone expected to double the country's gross domestic product and triple its exports. According to an economic impact study by ACIL Tasman:


The project has the potential to transform the economy of Papua New Guinea, boosting GDP and export earnings, providing a major increase in government revenue, royalty payments to landowners, creating employment opportunities during construction and operation, and providing a catalyst to further gas-based industry development.


The project will hopefully help transform PNG and, as a consequence, I hope that the Australia and PNG relationship can move from that of donor-recipient to robust economic partners. It is an ambition that is shared by the government and the people of PNG.


The challenges that come with a booming resource sector are well known. In a country like Papua New Guinea, where the governance institutions are still developing, it can present significant problems as well as benefits. With revenues flooding in through foreign investment, there is also the concern that political will for further reform in other areas may falter. As Aaron Batten has written for the East Asia Forum, 'Those provinces which have recorded the largest earnings from resource extraction have been plagued by the weakest governance, the poorest levels of service delivery and in many cases violence.' It is therefore more important than ever that Australia broaden, deepen and diversify its relationship with PNG. For this to occur, however, greater leadership on Australia's part is needed.


Over the coming months and years ahead Australia will be judged for what it does, not what it says. I am of the view that PNG must be one of our highest foreign policy priorities, and I can state unequivocally that a coalition government will ensure that our relationship with Papua New Guinea is one of our country's highest foreign policy priorities. The coalition believes that Australia must stand alongside the PNG government and its people consistently and unequivocally in their efforts to fulfil the country's immense potential and lay claim to its rightful status as a natural leader in the Pacific Ocean region.


The coalition has been critical of the Australian government for neglecting our near neighbours as it pursues its grand adventure for votes for a temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council. I have repeatedly called on the foreign minister to focus his efforts on our neighbourhood. While there are many pressing issues in the world, as we are seeing on a daily basis in the Middle East, it is within our immediate region that Australia has the greatest influence and can do the most good. As former Foreign Minister Alexander Downer wrote recently, the recent political events in PNG should serve as a wake-up call to Australia. Australia must work to develop a level of intimacy and goodwill in our bilateral relationship that can serve us during times such as these. As the current political crisis has shown us, it is essential that Australia's political leaders, particularly Australia's foreign minister, maintain the closest working relations with our colleagues in Port Moresby. This can only be achieved through close and consistent contact at the highest level.

"Mirabella, Sophie, MP",LP,2012-02-07,"



Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (17:36):  The Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011 is largely an uncontentious bill. I am therefore happy, on behalf of the opposition, to state that we will be supporting it. Providing continued support to the Australian Research Council is of course an inherently good thing, and both sides of politics have long recognised the organisation's importance in contributing to and sustaining Australian research of the highest quality. Indeed, in introducing this bill the government is honouring the longstanding practice of annually amending the ARC Act to apply indexation to existing appropriation amounts and to create an additional forward estimate. The principle was first adopted by the Howard government in 2001 and has been continued on an annual basis ever since.


That said, I am not entirely sure of the reason for the substantial drop in funding for 2014-15 and would therefore welcome some clarification from someone in the government about the precise reasoning behind that. This is a government that has already cut the budget for the highly regarded Cooperative Research Centres program by tens of millions of dollars. It also attracted flak from the CSIRO association for what were described as modest changes to the CSIRO's quadrennial funding that would lead to job losses without growth in external revenue. So I would be keen for an explanation of how this drop in the ARC's funding aligns with all of that as well. Perhaps someone can explain whether it is just an oversight, because it does not really tally with what the newly installed Minister for Industry and Innovation has been implying in media interviews—how the government's whole strategy for industry apparently hinges on spending more on innovation and research.


It would also be nice to hear the government address a problem to which I am alerted over and over again by businesspeople. There is ever-rising discontent in many parts of Australian industry about what is often perceived as a widening gulf between the amount of research produced in Australia and the level of tangible practical benefits of that research for Australian businesses—in other words, the commercialisation of that research. This is a critical problem that I know staff at the ARC well understand, but I am worried that some members of the government are suffering from the misapprehension that it is not a particularly serious issue.


There were some other words in the minister's second reading speech that are probably worthy of note, at least in passing. What was particularly noticeable were his references to 'the big issues of our time', including 'our need to transform our manufacturing industries to create greener, healthier and more resilient processes'. It is a terribly sad day when almost all government ministers, when it comes to innovation, industry, science and research, have only these banal turns of phrases. All they can say about policy are lines like 'innovate or perish' or 'innovation policy is industry policy'.


The importance of businesses becoming more environmentally efficient was self-evident years and years ago. That is why so many of them have made the transition and invested significantly in becoming greener and more efficient. These are not new discoveries or revelations. It is disappointing that the Labor Party continues with such a dismissive attitude towards Australian businesspeople, simply in the name of trying to justify the unjustifiable and to pretend that policies like the introduction of an economy-destroying, job-destroying, competition-reducing carbon tax are a good idea. Manufacturing policy—and the future of it in Australia—should be about so much more than abysmally poor policy and patronising one-liners from ministers and their colleagues on the government benches.


There was at least one other curious part of the minister's speech. I initially thought I must have heard him incorrectly. But then I checked the Hansard and, believe it or not, he did actually say that the ERA is 'a key element of the government's 10-year innovation agenda, Powering Ideas'. Let us not kid ourselves. The government recently made a humiliating backdown on the ERA after digging its heels in for years against sound and widespread advice. There was a complete 180-degree backflip from Senator Carr on this. As for Powering Ideas, even the hand-picked expert author of the review that led to that document has since savaged the government's complete lack of taste and heart for serious reform in the area of innovation.


I will conclude by restating that I am pleased to support the government's introduction of this bill but would hope that the government uses the occasion of the bill's passing to reflect on the fundamental importance of valuing and targeting research spending as wisely as possible, and of course being more serious about forging better linkages between researchers and industry. The coalition strongly supports Australian innovation and research and recognises its inextricable linkages with increased productivity and increased living standards. It will be a cornerstone of our future economic growth. In the face of mounting debt and deficit and with many parts of Australian industry struggling, there has rarely been a more important time for us to be extracting the maximum possible benefits from our national research investments.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (17:43):  I welcome the opportunity to briefly speak on the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011. In a moment I am going to respond to some of the comments just made by the member for Indi. Before I do, I will get to the purpose of this bill. The purpose of the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011 is to amend the Australian Research Council Act 2001 by adjusting the existing funding caps and inserting a new funding cap for the 2014 financial year. This bill provides additional funding to the Australian Research Council as part of the standard budget process.


This is important legislation to ensure that the Australian Research Council can continue to support high-quality research throughout Australia. Of course, it is important that we ensure that this money is well spent. The Australian Research Council not only supports quality research and research careers but also helps the government measure its research investment and assure taxpayers that their money is being invested wisely. The future of our country, our prosperity, our quality of life, our place in the world, our very existence is very much dependent on the quality of education of our people, on the research commitments we make and on the knowledge and innovation arising from that research. Australia has some of the finest research institutions in the world, such as the CSIRO. In my own region, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation is an outstanding example of a research facility. We have wonderful medical research facilities right around the country and we have many people in the private sector simultaneously and equally carrying out very important research. In addition and very importantly we have universities around the country carrying out research every day on different matters affecting the lives of people not only in Australia but also right around the world. It is a strength and an asset which we should not overlook.


Australian research has brought not just important innovation to us all but national pride. Now more than ever we live in a highly competitive world and innovation will become even more critical in giving Australia a competitive advantage. A very clear and real example is the competition faced by Australia's automotive sector. It is with respect to that sector that I want to respond to the comments made by the member for Indi, who talked about manufacturing in this country.


Manufacturing is incredibly important to the livelihoods of so many people in so many communities wherever you go because, quite frankly, it underpins the livelihoods of many other sectors. I am acutely aware of that because in my own region manufacturing is still the largest employer, underpinning many other industries and the advanced manufacturing arising from them. Advanced manufacturing relies on research. In particular the automotive sector in this country, which is part of the manufacturing fabric, employs 46,000 direct jobs nationally and another 200,000 jobs indirectly. This sector is vital to the economy of South Australia, the state I come from. I represent the region where, for over 60 years, the GM Holden plant has underpinned the economy. For the member for Indi to talk about patronising people in the manufacturing sector, when the opposition's policy, if elected, is to cut another $500 million from the automotive sector at a critical time when it is under intense pressure from overseas suppliers to build cars in this country, is hypocrisy at its worst. To say that we are patronising the manufacturing people is absolutely ludicrous.


In recent weeks I have seen total disarray on the coalition side, from state and federal MPs, on their views and policies with respect to the assistance they will provide manufacturers in this country, particularly in the automotive sector. I have listened to debate, comment and interview after interview from members opposite and it is clear that not only do they not have a policy but also they are in total disarray and in conflict with one another with respect to their position on this issue. The fact is that the $500 million which they would cut if elected to office is money that will be used to help vehicle and component makers get cleaner and greener products onto the market, the very thing research and development brings to this country, the very thing that will make manufacturers much more competitive and their products more saleable. Yet the area they are going to cut has a direct bearing on research investment in this country. They come into this chamber and pretend that they are taking a stand on behalf of our manufacturing sector. It really is hypocritical.


Put simply, research is critical if we are to address the challenges that face our nation and the world—climate change, treating and eradicating disease, and improving productivity in the workforce, whether through the application of new technology or industrial arrangements that put workers in a mental 'space' where they will work more efficiently. Research helps us meet the eternal challenge of better understanding the world we live in. Research dedicated to improving our understanding of history helps us define our future by learning from our past. Research also helps us analyse the impact of social and economic policy.


Recent trends in higher education highlight the growing importance of Australian Research Council funding. It has been said that there now appears to be a stronger emphasis on teaching in university, rather than researching. However, scholars also have an important role to play in providing solid, objective information to inform public policy initiatives and programs.


The Australian Research Council is an important element of our higher education system. The 2010-11 financial year marks the completion of the first decade of the Australian Research Council. It is important to provide funding to strengthen Australia's research workforce. In 2001-02, the Australian Research Council administered a budget of $270 million. By 2010-11 that had grown to $714.5 million. Australia has a proud tradition in research of contributing to significant change. The bionic ear, otherwise known as Cochlear implant, is certainly one of our most significant contributions and the Australian Research Council funded the innovative, investigator-driven research that underpinned this invention.


I understand a project started last year examines the effect on language development of children with Cochlear implants being in an oral environment. This research will provide information for parents and professionals to promote the best possible outcomes for children. Research is not just about innovation; it also helps us understand and assess the outcomes of earlier work.


I expect that at some point in the future someone will stand in this House and speak of the breakthrough in medical treatment achieved through stem cell research. In November 2010, then Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator the Hon. Kim Carr announced that Stem Cells Australia had been awarded a $21 million grant under the Special Research Initiative in Stem Cell Science. There is much evidence to suggest that the government's investment in research today will bring improvement to the lives of many people tomorrow.


The Australian Research Council has supported work that has made a difference to the lives of Australians in a diverse range of areas. These include research into the use of chemical residues from bomb blasts, in an era of homemade explosives, which will help catch terrorists; research that will improve predictions of Australian rainfall extremes using Indian Ocean surface temperatures; research that will allow us to successfully manage copyright in the digital age; research of strategies to improve child development and family wellbeing in disadvantaged communities before crime or serious behaviour problems emerge or become entrenched; research that has provided insight into the human appetite for protein, which can predispose us to obesity and other problems; research into the design of offshore structures that can survive catastrophic weather events like Hurricane Katrina; research of strategies to preserve the world's coral reefs; and research of minerals technology being used by global mining giants, saving money and increasing profits. These are just some examples of the research projects currently carried out by the Australian Research Council. I could refer to many more. I am pleased to say that only last week, in a hearing of the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, the Environment and the Arts, we heard from some of the scientists who are carrying out this research. What they are doing and the information they are providing the government, which in turn will be invaluable in assisting us with developing policies for the future, is a credit to them.


I want to talk briefly about some of the research being carried out in my home state of South Australia under Australian Research Council grants. The University of Adelaide was awarded $19.85 million in funding commencing in 2012 for 60 projects, and $47.28 million for 71 projects in 2011. I also note that the Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics is based at the University of Adelaide's Waite Campus, with additional research nodes at the University of Adelaide, the University of Melbourne, the University of Queensland and the University of South Australia. The centre was established in 2002 and is jointly funded by the Australian Research Council and the Grains Research and Development Corporation. Flinders University in South Australia was awarded $3.42 million in funding commencing in 2012 for 12 projects. It is interesting to note that Flinders University hosts the National Centre for Groundwater Research and Training, which is jointly funded by the Australian Research Council and the National Groundwater Commission. This is an area I have a personal interest in, and I understand the importance of this area of public policy. The centre, which also has research nodes at the University of New South Wales, the Australian National University and the University of Queensland, was established in June 2009 with Commonwealth funding of $29.5 million over five years. The ARC has awarded the University of South Australia $6.66 million in funding commencing in 2012 for 22 projects, including a Discovery Indigenous scheme. It is important to note the role the Australian Research Council has been and is playing in attracting more Indigenous Australians to academia, as well as the role that it plays in keeping more women in research careers. To enhance support for world-class female researchers, Prime Minister Gillard announced in 2010 that two new Australian Laureate Fellowships would be offered to highly ranked female candidates. Strong role models undoubtedly help attract people who do not come from backgrounds traditionally associated with research.


I can also talk about the centres of excellence that have been funded under this program. I understand some 25 centres of excellence have been established over the years, ranging from things like climate change to the history of emotions, from cognition and its disorders to plant cell wall biology, and so on. Again, these centres of excellence provide invaluable advice for government policy setting into the future.


In the time I have left to speak on this issue I want to talk about two people associated with these Australian centres of excellence. One is Peter Hoj, who was chief executive of the centres from 2004 to 2007. Peter is now the Vice Chancellor and president of the University of South Australia. Since his appointment to that role, taking over from Denise Bradley in 2007, he has done an outstanding job. I have worked with Peter on a number of different projects in the region and not only am I pleased to see that he is now in South Australia working for the University of South Australia—a university that has a campus in my own electorate—but also I commend him and his team for the work they are doing in engaging so many additional people in university vocations and university education. In particular the work they are doing on community engagement between the university and the broader community is something that they can all be proud of.


The other person I want to comment on is Professor Peter Buckskin, who I understand has now been appointed to the council. I know Professor Peter Buckskin through his work in South Australia, both in the education sector and as an adviser to state and federal governments over the years. I am pleased to see that Professor Buckskin has been appointed to the council. I wish him well in that role and I think he will make a fine contribution. I commend the bill to the House.

"Wyatt, Ken, MP",LP,2012-02-07,"



Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (17:58):  I rise to support the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011. I have been fortunate in my experiences to be a partner with industry, tertiary institutions and researchers in accessing ARC grants that focus on making a difference not only to the quality of life of Australians but also within fields of work that require Australia and Australian society to better position ourselves within a global context. 


I thank the member for Makin for his comments. I acknowledge those that I agree with but there are certainly some that I disagree with—I will not dwell on those; the beauty of democracy is that we have the opportunity to differ in philosophical positioning. I compliment the government on the indexing, at a rate of approximately 3.4 per cent, because that enhances the expectations of researchers that there is a source of funding that will enable them to undertake the work that is absolutely critical in benefiting the society in which we live. The additional financial year will be funded at $795.392 million, which is a reduction of four per cent from the previous financial year. But the expansion of the program through its extension is absolutely critical.


The Australian Research Council's mission is to deliver policies and programs that advance Australian research and innovation globally and that benefit the community. We can develop a mindset about what it is that we should accept within the short planning cycles of terms of governments. Sometimes I wish we could look beyond that and look over a decade, and look at the reality of some of the research that is needed to position Australia globally and enable us to be productive, efficient and a leader through innovation and technology.


As a statutory authority within the Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education portfolio, there is an expectation that the ARC will influence the key areas that form the basis of the way the Australian society moves forward. I have always supported the intent of the ARC. It promotes the highest quality research and research training through national competition in all fields of science, social sciences and humanities. Coupled with the work of the National Health and Medical Research Council, there are two significant avenues through which researchers can access funding in partnership with tertiary institutions and industry to undertake work that is absolutely critical in changing and making life better for all of us. I like the way the ARC brokers partnerships between researchers and industry, governments, community organisations and the international community.


I strongly support the ongoing funding allocated to the National Competitive Grants Program because of the way it encourages Australian researchers. It nurtures the creative abilities and skills of Australia's most promising researchers and provides support for high-quality research leading to the discovery of new ideas and the advancement of knowledge. This is absolutely vital if we are going to be a world leader. Financial assistance for facilities and equipment that researchers need to be internationally competitive is invaluable.


I want to make a few comments concerning the health arena. I have had a lot to do with the Sax Institute in New South Wales and Fiona Stanley's Telethon Institute for Child Health Research in Western Australia. Nurturing the capacity and capability of researchers to build on the social fabric and contribute to reform, change and innovation are very worthy, and something that we should strongly support and always endorse on a bipartisan basis. The ongoing funding will provide incentives for Australia's most talented researchers to work in partnership with leading researchers throughout the national innovation system and internationally, and to form alliances with Australian industry across the following interdisciplinary groupings: biological sciences and biotechnology, where there is much expansion occurring; engineering, mathematics and informatics; humanities and creative arts; physics, chemistry and earth sciences; and social, behavioural and economic sciences.


The member for Makin touched on a number of programs. I will not go into detail on those, but I want to explore the opportunities that we will have from this amended legislation and the programs that it establishes. The ARC is important because of the changing world in which we live and the impact of globalisation on the economy and on industry, and the opportunities that it delivers for our researchers to capitalise on emerging trends that cover every facet of our lives, our industries and our economy. The growing influence of globalisation will continue to increase competition and lower profit margins in many countries whilst at the same time centralising wealth and power in a diminishing number of supernational corporate giants. I see the opportunity for our researchers to look at the way they contribute to international growth and, at the same time, through innovation generate wealth and new jobs within the Australian economy.


Globalisation is a means to the levelling of the playing field for trade and we are progressing the concept of a flat earth for economic development, trade and the sciences. The threat that jobs could go abroad lies behind job insecurity, the erosion of non-wage benefits and the loss of manufacturing in Australia. These are critical issues and I see researchers as being pivotal in creating new industries and new manufacturing opportunities in this country in fields that we have not yet explored, but in their minds they are thinking about the prospects and opportunities.


The digital age and other technologies are triggering a massive increase in productivity along with the rapid downsizing in manufacturing and the deflation of costs. Knowledge management under this funding will make a difference between the growth of Australia and the survival in a virtual future, because that is a reality that we face. The reality that also faces Australia in a global society is access to a sustainable domestic workforce and productivity efficiencies that will mitigate the impact of factors of globalisation, an ageing workforce, inflexible work arrangements, young Australians wanting quality of life, the urban influence not rural and a diminishing manufacturing sector.


I read with great interest the work of Patrick Dixon, the author of Futurewise. I will cite three of his comments because they relate to factors that encourage our researchers and recipients of ARC funding to explore opportunities for our country.


The world has changed in every way. It continues to change at a rapid pace in aspects of our culture …


A key part of this process is understanding the potential future impact of decisions made by individuals, organisations and governments.


Take hold of the future or the future will take hold of you.


Certainly, in those projects that I have been involved in with ARC grants, that has been the thinking of the researchers, so I am extremely supportive of the funding and the increase in funding, and the indexation that the government has proposed in this legislation.


In Visions of the Future: the intelligence revolution, the first of a three-part mini series on the BBC hosted by Michio Kaku, he says:


In this century, we are going to make the historic transition from the 'Age of Discovery' to the 'Age of Mastery', a period in which we will move from being passive observers of nature to its active choreographers.


So there is that element coming within the scope of the work that researchers will do. The fourth of the top five predictions in The Futurist magazine is:


Professional knowledge will become obsolete almost as quickly as it's acquired. An individual's professional knowledge is becoming outdated at a much faster rate than ever before.


The partnerships between industries, tertiary institutions, researchers and the non-government organisations in a sense militate against this because they will look at, and explore, the opportunities for the expansion of knowledge that is applicable to the economy and to the society which we hope to shape.


James Canton in his book The Extreme Future identifies a significant focus and opportunity on the importance of innovation, particularly in globalisation; new technology; IT and networks, such as microchips and computers; biotech—unlocking the DNA to create health discoveries; nanotech—the manipulation of matter at the atomic scale; new fuels, drugs and machines; and neurotech—such as new devices, drugs and materials to heal, manage and enhance mental performance and functioning.


Researchers explore the boundaries that go outside the square. They use the opportunity to look at the 'what ifs' and then turn them into practical application that can become a process by which manufacturing industries and education knowledge acquisition, with skilling, account for different directions that will occur in the future. We only have to hark back to the past to see that labour intensive jobs are no longer required. That all has occurred because of the work that researchers have undertaken. It has enabled us to develop new ways of doing the work that we do, gaining efficiencies, obtaining productivity levels that generate the wealth that gives us and creates the standard of living that we look forward to. 


I read with interest both speeches delivered in the House by the minister. Many of the comments in there underpin the direction that we, in a bipartisan approach, must take if we are to ensure that future generations have the quality and standard of living that we have enjoyed for a number of years. If we project into our thinking for researchers the need to focus not only on 2010 or 2015 or 2020 but on the next 50 years and start to project into the future then we are likely to see the creation of innovative ideas by researchers. They will apply knowledge to the implications and impact on societies and families, and then shape advice to governments at all levels. That then enables the society or community to enjoy the benefits of what it is that we provide and protect. We can give them a solid foundation for the expectations that they would have to bring up families and communities in future years.


I commend the bill and I acknowledge the intent. I certainly look forward to the outcomes that researchers will achieve in the context of the work that they do, and the gains that they will make, that makes life in this country so rich, rewarding and enabling.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (18:12):  I rise to speak on the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011. How will we ensure that making healthier choices gets easier? How will adapting to climate change impact on our health? How will new urban spaces support health? How will children grow into adulthood to embrace new sustainable ways of living? How will communities change to support ageing? How will we relate to each other in a world of new communication technologies? How will safe and supportive communities grow to everyone's benefit in a globally connected world? How will local communities ensure a fair go for everyone as economic and social conditions change? What will a healthy workplace look like in the future?


These are all questions posed by Professor Robert Bush, who is the Director of Healthy Communities Research Centre at the University of Queensland Ipswich campus. I will speak more about that centre a little later. It is a centre which has received funding from the Australian Research Council, as has the University of Queensland generally—and I will talk a bit about that. It is important that we look at questions like that. They are posed to us as questions for the 21st century; not as questions for the 20th century. The adaptations and decisions that people will make in the 21st century are vastly different from those of the 20th century and 19th century. We need to pay particular attention to life span, the multicultural aspect of our community, the fast-growing demographic areas such as my electorate with Ipswich and the Somerset region of South-East Queensland—two of the three fastest-growing areas in South-East Queensland.


We need to pay attention to local government places and spaces, parks and gardens, recreational facilities and infrastructure—places that connect people; places that bring people together for fellowship and friendship. We need to look at our communities and how we can design them better. We need to look at the healthy aspects of our communities. These are all things that do not just happen by chance or happenstance. They happen because we provide funding for research to give us the answers. People like Robert Bush and others deserve the funding. They need it and we need to provide it for them. One of the projects being undertaken by the University of Queensland's Ipswich campus is the Ipswich Study and I will talk a bit more about that later.


This bill makes amendments to the Australian Research Council Act 2001. As other speakers have said, this amendment to the act to is to apply indexation to the funding administered by the ARC. The Research Council does important work and, through the National Competitive Grants Program, supports quality research—research which has applicability and an impact on communities, families and individuals. It includes research in areas such as the bionic ear, which the member for Makin talked about. Ongoing research will make a big difference not only to local communities but to higher education. Not only will it provide employment but it will provide answers to the questions posed by Professor Robert Bush.


There are a range of initiatives and innovations funded by the ARC through the NCGP and we have to make sure that research is provided so that we do not lag behind. Many years ago Lee Kuan Yew, the former Prime Minister of Singapore, said that Australia would become the white trash of Asia. That has not happened because we have taken steps to transform the economy and this government is now transforming our economy in a way that is cleaner and greener. We are making a difference to the future. We are making decisions for the 21st century, not for the high-pollution, high-carbon 20th century.


The ARC supports high-quality research. It provides grants to organisations. One of those institutions, which I am proud to say I attended and proud to say happens to be in my electorate, is the University of Queensland—the Ipswich campus. Recently, the University of Queensland received $430,000 in research funding for the Healthy Communities Research Centre based at Ipswich campus. That project is being funded through the National Competitive Grants Program and the funding for it is an example of what this legislation covers and it shows why indexation is critical. This particular successful proposal is titled Averting the extinction of experience and was submitted in collaboration with Dr Richard Fuller from the University of Queensland's School of Biological Sciences and the CSIRO's Climate Adaptation Flagship project. The research focuses on how changes to urban biodiversity affect health and is just one of the many projects funded by the Health Communities Research Centre at the University of Queensland's Ipswich campus. That campus is known, and that particular research centre is known, for its headline project, the Ipswich Study. I would hope that projects like the Ipswich Study will advance our knowledge, build our research capability and enhance international collaboration. It is important that we harness the creativity of our whole people and enhance the creative abilities and skills of our most promising researchers at places like the University of Queensland's Ipswich campus. The $430,000 I mentioned will enable the best and brightest researchers to make exciting and critical discoveries, will help forge those kinds of international partnerships and will showcase our region.


Over 1,000 projects were funded in this round of Australian Research Council major grants and they will share in about $310 million. The University of Queensland received over $38 million for 120 different projects. That included nearly $29.8 million for 92 projects under the Discovery Projects scheme, nearly $2 million for six projects under the Linkage Infrastructure Equipment and Facilities funding scheme and nearly $6.3 million for 22 projects under the Linkage Projects scheme. The University of Queensland is one of the sandstone universities and the campus at Ipswich has a medical school, a nursing school and allied health professional education. It is also the location of the University of Queensland's own GP superclinic, run by UQ, which was a great assistance to my local community during the floods last year. This research will make a difference to my community and to communities around the world. Robert Bush, whom I mentioned before, said that this project is really important and that he backed it 100 per cent. He described the funding as fantastic—to see the local centre achieve such a prestigious award and obtain research funding through the grants process. He talked about the potential for this sort of work to contribute to the health of Ipswich and beyond.


The Healthy Communities Research Centre clearly has runs on the board and can do a lot of good. Neighbourhoods, whether in Australia or abroad, influence the way communities operate, particularly in the critical area of health. I am always struck by the fact, when I jog around my neighbourhood at Flinders View and up around Raceview, Ripley and places like that, that there are many pathways. I see plenty of people jogging or walking their dog or just going for a walk themselves on those pathways. But, in other parts of Ipswich, I do not see the same pathways and I do not see people exercising. How can communities and local governments make a difference to reducing the problems of obesity and diabetes? These are the sorts of issues and questions that the University of Queensland's Ipswich Study will look into. Ipswich is a microcosm—it is a fast-developing area. Most of Ipswich is rural and many people do not realise that. It has a big manufacturing base in central Ipswich and the eastern suburbs, but most of it is rural. It has a very diverse community. There are about 175,000 people or a bit more—perhaps 180,000—and the member for Oxley and I share the care of it in representing it here in this place. We have implemented in Ipswich a number of projects to improve health and wellbeing and this government has put a lot of money into assisting Ipswich, including Ipswich General Hospital, which has close linkages to the University of Queensland. We have put $7 million into the redevelopment of Ipswich General Hospital and recently we have put in $16 million towards palliative care and other assistance in terms of rehabilitation. The now Attorney-General, a former Minister for Health and Ageing, was with me when we looked around at that particular project. So we have put a lot of money into that, but it is those partnerships between the University of Queensland's health research centre and the teaching facility at Ipswich General Hospital and the ARC, with the funding, that will make a difference in my local community.


Sometimes we come to this place and talk about big picture issues, but I want to narrow it all down and say what this will do and what this type of funding will do for my local community. I look forward to more than 10,000 Ipswich families taking part in this 10-year study. That will benefit not just the Ipswich community but also business, government and international research. Robert Bush tells me that the last time that a study of this longitudinal nature and research were really undertaken was in the US about 40 or 50 years ago. So this Ipswich study, which already has funding from the Ipswich Hospital Foundation, Bendigo Bank, Ipswich City Council, chambers of commerce and research grants, is really important and I am urging the government to consider this sort of funding. It is done on a bipartisan basis and it is really important that we get behind this.


Sir Llew Edwards, a former state member for Ipswich born and bred in Ipswich and a former Liberal Deputy Premier of Queensland and a former Chancellor of the University of Queensland, is a real backer of the Ipswich Study. He has made the point that the city 'is on the move' and 'heading towards a population boom'. He has said:


This … study goes beyond simply recognising that neighbourhoods influence health and into understanding exactly how.


I think that comment of his says it well, and I think that is the benefit of the research. It is about how we can build a sustainable Australia, how we can build communities that are not ghettos on the urban fringe and periurban areas of our country, and how we can look at taking advantage of what we have got in terms of mineral resources and making it all fairer and also making our local communities connected to each other. So I am very pleased to support this legislation. I am pleased to support the ARC and I am glad it has made a commitment to the University of Queensland and I am glad it has made a commitment to the research centre in my electorate and as, I am glad that it is located there, I urge the government to consider the Ipswich Study as something worth funding in the future.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (18:25):  On a personal note, I would like to thank the member for Blair and the member for Moreton for the job that they do on the committee looking at insurance that went to Townsville. They have done a great job up there along with the coalition guys. I rise to speak on the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011. The prime purpose of this bill is to apply indexation to the Australian Research Council's—or ARC's—existing funding schemes.    Specifically, this bill involves the changing of three current financial year funding figures to account for an indexation of roughly 3.4 per cent. As with the member for Blair, I have a university and lots of training centres and lots of ARC schemes in my electorate and I would love to support them. So, if you have anything to do with it, Madam Deputy Speaker Bird, I would discount everything that the member for Blair has said, because my stuff is going to be so much better. This bill will also extend the forward estimate period to include the financial year beginning 1 July 2014.


While this is a routine bill to index the ARC's funding schemes, it is nevertheless important to Australia, particularly to Townsville, which has become a vital research hub for regional Australia and the tropics. My first experience with the ARC on a committee basis was here in Parliament House when we sat around a table with the ARC people. When I asked them what they did, one of the things that they came up with was this. A business came to them and said, 'Where a building is not structurally damaged by fire the biggest expense is rewiring it.' So the ARC people had gone away and said, 'Okay, how do we do this?' What they came up with was a casing for the wiring when it goes into a building that under intense heat will turn into a ceramic, thus protecting the wiring. My head exploded and I said, 'Who could come up with that? Where do you think of these things?' As the member for Hasluck said, we train these people and these people are special in our society because they can think outside of the box, they can think about what can happen and throw things up in the air and see what stays there. That is what is great about the ARC schemes. People like me have no vision as to that whatsoever. I have absolutely no ability for thinking outside the box at all. I can fix the box, I can fix anything inside the box, I can tinker with it and I can change it, but if it is outside the box I am gone! That is why the ARC schemes are so important. If we are to be the smart country, if we are to be the innovators and really add to the Asian century, we must do it through research and development. As the member for Indi said, research and development must become the cornerstone of our economic growth. We must find new ways and new products, as the member for Makin said, and the cochlear implant is a fantastic example of what an ARC scheme can bring.


In Townsville we have the main campus of James Cook University. It is a world renowned body for its marine biology research and also for its focus on life in a tropical world. With around half of the world's population living in the tropics, JCU's work in the fields of tropical health, biodiversity and science is a central part of the university and of Townsville's contribution to the international community. It is important to note, on the 60th anniversary of the accession of the Queen to the throne, that it is the only university in Australia to have its proclamation physically signed by the Queen. James Cook University is the only university in Australia which has at its core life in a tropical world, so everything that is done at James Cook University is aimed at life in a tropical world to the extent that there is a wholly owned campus in Singapore which attracts university students from Europe wanting the Asian experience but with an Australian university degree.


One of the examples of the research that can come out of James Cook University is this. It is a field accident injection unit, which instantly clots blood. It was designed with the battlefield in mind. If someone is injured on the battlefield they are given an injection, like Nebupent, and it slows down the bleeding, it clots the blood, allowing you to transport them. Its implications for battle were obvious, but the implications for the farm, where the most dangerous implements are the chainsaw and a PTO instrument, are very well known to everyone. Distance is the killer and a piece of equipment like this injection unit is so handy. It should be developed throughout Australia. That they are struggling for funding shows just how vital this funding becomes, because we do have people out there wanting to do the work.


The ARC is a major source of funding for university based research, including at JCU through its grants programs, such as the Future Fellowships scheme and the Linkage Projects, which partner industry up with the research community. James Cook University has a great history of and passion for PhD students, because that is the research and those are the programs that are funded and bring research dollars into town. In places like ATSIP, the Australian Tropical Sciences and Innovation Precinct, practical and tangible research is bringing real progress to everything from the better use of our water resources to cattle and food production in a tropical environment.


While looking at this bill I have been in touch with Professor Chris Cocklin, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Research and Innovation, at JCU. Professor Cocklin emphasised the significance that indexing in ARC funding has to universities to ensure that they are able to maintain their level of research. In particular, he pointed out the burden that increased administration costs have had on universities and their ability in recent times to deliver maximum benefits from research funding.


Similarly, whilst the Australian Institute of Marine Science is getting funding for research, their operating expenses are shrinking. So, whilst they are getting more research money to go to sea for research, they are not getting the fuel to power the boats. That is where the cuts have to come. It is critical that we ensure funding for all research programs is spent in actual research and not just caught up in the organisation of these programs.


Townsville and JCU are also the headquarters of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, which joins JCU with the Australian National University, the University of Queensland, the University of Western Australia, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the last two of which are also key research hubs based in Townsville. The ARC's funding of the centre of excellence is of great importance to Townsville and to the Great Barrier Reef. Townsville's proximity to the reef makes it a natural home for coral reef studies and for PhD students and researchers from around the world. I spoke recently with one of the chief scientists at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, who reinforced to me the importance that the centre's research has to the management of the Great Barrier Reef, which is recognised internationally as being one of the best managed marine parks in the world. Much of the work undertaken by the centre of excellence is able to feed back through to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, and it underpins the park's management. This connection between research and frontline operations in Townsville is one of the elements that has made this such a successful program. Every member I have heard speak on this bill has alluded to the fact that we are seeing these practical experiences and examples of what our smarter people are bringing into our economy. As a government and as a parliament we are all speaking with one voice and saying that we do need research for this thing.


In Townsville I also spoke with the director of the centre of excellence, Professor Terry Hughes, about the contribution this program makes to coral reef research, with the centre of excellence's network around the country being the world's largest provider of coral reef training and research. Professor Hughes also mentioned to me that there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the funding of this program into the future. As the member for Hasluck said, it would be fantastic to sit here and say that they have funding for 50 years, or for 10 years, and that we are thinking long term. But we inside this place are all realists and we know that governments have the right to change priorities and change processes. Whilst we ask a lot of people to commit—and we ask them that when they do commit they do so wholly and solely to these things—a lot of the time it is a very hard thing to ask them to do because funding does dry up.


The Australian Institute of Marine Science also plays a major role in Townsville's marine science research community. While their main connection with the ARC is through the centre of excellence, their collaborations with JCU and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority nevertheless mean that they benefit from an increase in funding for research in Townsville. There are some very exciting things happening at the Australian Institute of Marine Science. For example, there is the ocean simulator, which is attracting attention from PhD students and fellows from around the world wanting to see what is happening. We are getting to the stage where we can commercially produce lobsters in-house. We are breeding lobsters in-house and we are getting them from the larval stage to the wriggler stage and then all the way through. This is a fantastic program. It is world-leading research that has the whole world excited.


Funnily enough, when it comes to the Australian Institute of Marine Science, we have the Protect our Coral Sea petition going around. No doubt every member in this House has seen something of it. It is the PEW foundation—and the PEW foundation is not a rabid green organisation that just wants to shut things down—that is pushing for the closure of the Coral Sea and turning it into a national park. Not James Cook University, AIMS or the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority were asked to participate in this research. Given that we are talking about an area of over one million square kilometres, it is something we should be questioning. We should be questioning the motives behind the PEW foundation's research. Even more importantly, there has been very little research done on the Coral Sea. The most quantitative research we ever received was from when we were able to tag rides with the Japanese fishing fleets that operated there through the 1970s and into the 1980s, but that was phased out, starting with the Fraser-Howard government and then into the Hawke-Keating era. Even more importantly, if we are to have the ARC guide us, we really should ensure that they are part of the process. Townsville has become a key centre for research in the tropics, and any measures that affect government funding for research have significant consequences for the city and for our research institutions. We all wish that we had a bottomless pit from which we could pull money for the funding of research. There will always be that line in the sand. It is up to the government of the day to say where that line in the sand is drawn. As much as I would like to quip, 'As long as it is drawn making sure that everything from Townsville is in there,' I do understand that there are priorities that have to be made. I think we are all aware that, whilst there are very, very good causes here which will miss funding, there has to be a line drawn in the sand.


But I would like to go back to what the members for Hasluck, Blair and Makin said, and no doubt the member for Canberra will be saying it as well. If we are to be the truly innovative people that we know we are, if we are to foster Australian researchers who can think outside the box, who can come up with ideas and make them practical, tangible, positive, income-producing schemes, we must make sure that we give people every chance to do their research, to progress their research, to come up with examples. We know that there will be economic benefits in the long term. With that in mind, I commend the bill to the House.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2012-02-07,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (18:38):  It is a great pleasure to be able to speak on the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011 tonight, because the ACT has a very large stake in research. The ANU is one of the greatest research institutions in the world. The University of Canberra is also a great research institution. And I have the Mount Stromlo Observatory in my electorate, which conducts some phenomenal research into what is going on in outer space. This government has made a significant investment in the Mount Stromlo Observatory. When bushfires ravaged the south of Canberra, in my electorate, the observatory was largely burnt out. It was just a shell up there. We have made significant investment in that area now. We have got the greatest technology, new buildings and it is ever expanding, with more and more people driving up that little hill each day to go and do great work for the nation and for the world. So it is a great pleasure to be able to speak on this amendment bill tonight.


As the statutory authority within the innovation portfolio, the Australian Research Council plays an important role in advancing Australian research and innovation globally, while also supporting the highest quality research and training through the fields of science, social sciences and the humanities. The Australian Research Council Amendment Bill will help us continue to support excellence in research and to build our nation's research capacity. We are already at the forefront of the world in great research, particularly in the agricultural sector. 


When I was in Afghanistan early last year—in May, I think it was—it was really interesting talking to a number of people there about what we can contribute in providing advice and assistance in the agricultural sector to build up the local capacity in Afghanistan. They have great skills in growing, developed over centuries and centuries on small plots of land, in really rough conditions. They have stinking hot summers. It is 50 degrees in summer and it is minus 50 degrees in winter, so we are talking pretty rugged conditions. In some parts of Australia we get extreme weather, but we do not usually get extreme hot and extreme cold in the course of the year. In speaking to people there, I learned they have this great capacity to grow almonds, dates and apricots, but they do not have the capacity to make it a large business. We have the ability not just to improve productivity, through the research that we do, but also to give advice on capacity building for businesses.


Australians have great, great research that has allowed this country to prosper, particularly in the agricultural sector over the course of this nation's history. I am thinking particularly of the great research that the CSIRO has done in wheat, to allow enormous boosts in production, by 40 per cent over time. We have great skills in this area and it is great that we have this technology and research capacity that we can export overseas.


Specifically, this amendment bill will alter three existing financial year funding figures for indexation and extend the forward estimates period to include the financial year starting on 1 July 2014, resulting in additional spending of $885 million over the four financial years. As I mentioned, the ARC has a long history and it is something that the Gillard government is proud to continue to support. Although this amendment to administer vital funding occurs each year, it is a great reminder to all of us of the importance of research to our nation's future and of how this research can deliver cultural, economic, social and environmental benefits to all our citizens and—I have just mentioned the case of Afghanistan—the citizens of the world.


We must ensure that Australian researchers, who do such important work, can continue to be internationally competitive. One way the ARC ensures this is through the National Competitive Grants Program, a program that nurtures our future scientists and researchers and ensures they have incentives to stay here in Australia. It is vitally important that we keep these great minds in our country, doing great work for Australia. The program does this by supporting the highest quality research, which leads to the discovery of new ideas and the advancement of knowledge. It also provides financial assistance towards facilities and equipment that our researchers need so they can continue to be internationally competitive. It also supports training and skills development for our next generation of researchers. In addition, it provides incentives for Australia's most talented researchers to work in partnership with leading national and international researchers and to form alliances with Australian industry, which is so important. We do not need people coming up with great ideas in the research area which are then just planted in a Petri dish or become some concept sitting on a shelf; the ideas need to be utilised in some meaningful way, and that is where these partnerships with industry are so important. Australians can be proud of the work our researchers do. Many significant global advances have been achieved by Australians working under the auspices of the ARC. Not only has the ARC supported some of our most well-known innovations, such as the bionic ear—a great invention—and the Jameson Flotation Cell, which continues to save the coal industry billions of dollars each year; the organisation also continues to push the boundaries to discover what is possible, what is unthought-of, what is out there, what is the potential that we will inherit. It is working hard to advance science and research more broadly and to ensure that the abilities and skills of Australia's most promising researchers are nurtured and promoted.


I am pleased to report that in 2012 funding will allow the ARC to continue its Australian Laureate Fellowships Scheme, which reflects the Commonwealth's commitment to support excellence in research by attracting world-class researchers and research leaders to key positions by creating new rewards and incentives for the application of their talents in Australia. I am even more delighted to report that, for funding commencing in 2012, up to 17 Australian Laureate Fellowships will be awarded, including an additional two fellowships for successful female Australian Laureate Fellows. Recipients of these fellowships will be provided with the Australian Laureate Fellowship funding, plus additional funding to undertake an ambassadorial role to promote women in research. This is an issue in which I have become very interested in recent years, more so since I have become the member for Canberra and even more so because of the nature of the population in Canberra and its very strong research community.


My little sister is a research neurologist. She has done some great research on strokes as well as in a range of other areas. One thing that she has highlighted to me, as have her colleagues and other women in Canberra who are in this field, is that women in the early stages of their career find research grants quite accessible. It is when they go into the phase where they have had a few babies and they want some part-time work that their publication rate reflects the part-time nature of their work. They do not have as many publications as their male colleagues who have not had babies, who have not taken a bit of time off work or who have not gone part-time. Of course, you cannot compare a part-time mother and her publication rate with a full-time male researcher. So there is an in-built discrimination in terms of their ability to get grants as a result of their not being able to publish as much as their male colleagues. There are also some other systemic issues here. 


The government has been doing a great deal, as have research councils such as the NHMRC, to improve the number of women, particularly those at that mid-career level, in the research industry and improve their access to grants. It is vitally important that young women go into this field. We need more women in science. We need more women in research. These young women go into this field with bright ideas, great ideas, and with aspirations. So early in their career they need to incentives to stay in the research field and to continue to stay in it right throughout their career. They should not have their careers stopped as a result of their choice to have babies and work part-time. These fellowships are very welcome news, and I applaud the ARC for instituting them.


This measure is important because, at the inception of the Australian Laureate Fellowships Scheme, in 2008, only 12.8 per cent of the applicants were female and, in 2009, 17.5 per cent were female. The ARC continues to work hard to improve the research funding opportunities for women and, as I said, not just at the beginning of their careers but throughout their careers. I believe these additional fellowships will go a long way to promoting women in research.


The Discovery Early Career Researcher Award will also continue this year. This is another way that the ARC is working hard to support and advance our promising researchers who are in the early stages of their careers. Proposals are now open for this funding to commence in 2013. 


The ARC is also working to advance the representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders working in research and innovation. Funding will commence this year for the Special Research Initiative for the ATSI Researchers' Network. The network's core functions will be to build Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research capacity, mentor new researchers and advance research in Indigenous knowledge systems.


As well as supporting Australian research and ensuring incentives for research at home, the ARC is also supporting research that will have a long-term impact on the lives of Australian families. The ARC is working to support our ageing population, which is so important, through its population ageing research. This research will transform thinking about population ageing, inform private and public sector policy and yield outcomes that will improve the wellbeing of the aged and their social and economic environment.


The organisation is also on track to deliver the bionic eye—a breakthrough that will be welcome news for people suffering progressive vision loss. With an ageing population, that number will probably only go up. This initiative was one of many that came out of the government's 2020 Summit here, in Canberra, in 2009. The ARC awarded $50 million for this special research initiative. The technology is now at the point of being tested, and this is just one year after funding began. It just goes to show what our Australian researchers can do with the funding we are providing to them with this bill. 


This year the ARC has committed funding for a total of 778 proposals for Discovery Projects—that is, funding for research projects that can be undertaken by individual researchers or research teams. I am proud to say that 93 of those grants were issued to researchers from the Australian National University and the University of Canberra in the ACT alone. In 2012, more than $327,000 has been granted to researchers at the ANU to examine factors that may improve the mental health of welfare recipients, promote employment outcomes and help the Commonwealth government develop welfare reform policy. 


The ANU has also been awarded $420,000 for research into next-generation tsunami warnings. This project will generate the science for rapid tsunami forecasts to maintain public confidence in tsunami warnings, enabling emergency managers around the world to make well-informed decisions about imminent tsunamis.


Also, $390,000 will be given to the ANU for the very first digital imaging survey of the entire sky of the Southern Hemisphere. It is amazing. This work will underpin a number of significant national science programs of international prominence, and I am sure that it will be one of them. The survey will be carried out using the university's SkyMapper telescope near Coonabarabran. It was built to replace the ANU's previous telescope located at Mount Stromlo Observatory, which was sadly destroyed in the 2003 bushfires. According to the ANU's Professor of Astronomy, the ultimate plan is to create a database that will be accessible for anyone in the world. Astronomers anywhere will be able to learn about the characteristics of the Southern Hemisphere stars and galaxies. It is very exciting. At the University of Canberra, $210,000 has been committed to researchers examining productivity and work-life balance in virtual work environments, helping to unlock the impact technology is having on our ability to have a life outside of work. I would be very interested to see what the outcomes of that research will be. I know none of us are strangers to work interrupting our family, particularly with the technology we have now, so this will be of interest to many people, I am sure.


In all, more than $32 million has been invested in researchers here in the ACT this year. This funding will go towards a range of projects from disciplines as diverse as pure mathematics—which was a huge challenge for me at school—to historical studies and everything in between. This is a significant investment in research and I commend the ARC for making that investment in Canberra. It is important to remember the contribution researchers make to the future of Canberra, and indeed Australia. Our research holds the key to our growing and developing economy. It helps shape our jobs of the future, and ensures we can better protect and understand our natural environment. Through research we can better educate our children, heal our sick and discover new opportunities—new worlds, like we are with the Southern Hemisphere stars—to help our local communities grow in a more sustainable way and to help the world. I commend this bill to the House.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2012-02-07,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (18:53):  I rise today to speak on the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011. Although this is a routine change to the Australian Research Council Act 2001 which occurs annually, the bill continues to update and contribute to the important work that the ARC provides for innovation and research in Australia. This amendment, which the coalition supports, adds indexation to current financial year funding figures and extends the forward estimate period to the year commencing 1 July 2014. Specifically, this bill will add indexation at approximately 3.4 per cent, which will cost $89 million and fund the extra financial year at a cost of $795 million.


The Australian Research Council was established in 2001 under the Howard government as recognition of the need to have a centralised body to coordinate linkages between government, industry, the community and researchers. As the ARC itself states, its mission is to 'deliver policy and programs that advance Australian research and innovation globally and benefit the community'. The ARC runs many very successful initiatives, including the National Competitive Grants Program, which provides support and financial assistance as well as other incentives to form national aid linkages with researchers around the world. In particular, it is a comprehensive program that recognises the different stages at which various researchers may be in their career. Similarly, the ARC supports research and training through the National Research Priorities scheme and Discovery Projects on top of other laureate and future fellowships and Indigenous-specific programs.


As we know, the advancements that can occur from research projects can be quite unpredictable and result from the inherent risk involved with scientific research. This will continue to be the case in the future and, as such, it is certainly one area where the government can make a significant contribution to projects that might have otherwise never found private funding. But it is also an area where government can make gains. As I have noted previously, it is estimated, for example, that for every dollar invested into medical research up to six dollars is returned on top of the initial investment.


Stakeholders were understandably concerned last year when the Gillard government proposed to cut funding to the tune of $400 million as a direct result of their inability to design a responsible budget. I reiterate to the House today my concern at the thought of decreasing funding to what is an integral program for the future of Australia's research, innovation and industry. I do note that over the forward estimates the additional year included in the bill from 2014 is costed at approximately $795 million, which will in fact be a reduction of 4 per cent from the previous financial year. Although the coalition does support the passage of the bill, I and the coalition will always be looking at how we can adequately fund the ARC so that it is able to effectively and efficiently deliver on its mission.


Given the strong support from members on both sides of the House today and their pride in what their local universities are achieving, we are all obviously in furious agreement about the need for guaranteed long-term funding. However, as the member for Indi remarked earlier, this Labor government is notoriously poor at providing linkages between research and industry. This particular aspect is perhaps the most important as it is the area where researchers and organisations are able to make financial and commercial returns from their work, returns that they are then able to reinvest and use to facilitate future research.


Appropriate planning and support for the Australian Research Council is especially important to the people of Ryan, as it is home to the University of Queensland. The University of Queensland is one of the premier research universities in Australia as a member of the Group of Eight. Indeed, it is one of the premier research organisations in the world, as judged by many international ranking publications. Since its inception, the Australian Research Council and the University of Queensland community have had a very strong relationship. Throughout that time, UQ has successfully been approved for many hundreds of projects through the various funding arms of the ARC. What distinguishes the University of Queensland as a leading research university is its depth and diversity across many faculties, from architecture to engineering, quantum physics, biomedical and molecular research as well as marine biology and research on sustainable living and environmental management strategies.


Earlier today, Professor Max Lu, the Senior Deputy Vice-Chancellor, updated me on many exciting ongoing research projects occurring at the University of Queensland. In 2011, the university placed first in the measure of ARC Discovery and Linkage projects outcomes, a wonderful achievement. Moreover, the University of Queensland placed second in the nation for both the Future Fellowships and Discovery Early Career Researcher Award, with 21 out of a possible 203 fellowships and 34 out of 277 discovery awards, each valued at $375,000. This highlights the strength of the many research teams at the University of Queensland. Certainly, the prospects for early career and midcareer researchers are extremely promising.


The University of Queensland has a particular focus on attracting and retaining international quality researchers, which adds further diversity to the pool of ideas that already exists in Australia and also contributes to the development of local scientists. Without these awards, the University of Queensland would simply not be able to attract the right researchers and the right ideas. Professor Lu himself has also received important funding from the ARC—including the very prestigious ARC Federation Fellowships twice, in 2003 and 2008—which has supported his world-class research into nanotechnology, materials chemistry and engineering. We are very fortunate to have Professor Lu at the university, and only with funding and support for research from organisations like the ARC are we able to attract and retain researchers of his ilk. 


I also congratulate the University of Queensland on being awarded funding for two ARC Centres of Excellence, to add to its research in both quantum technology and environmental management solutions. Professor Gerard Milburn is training the next generation of world-class researchers in engineered quantum systems, and his team will be conducting research in conjunction with partners all over the world—in Austria, in Canada, in Germany, in Singapore, in Sweden, in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America. We can all expect to see new devices and technologies which will drive Australia's, and the world's, productivity and economic growth in the future as a direct result of this cooperative research.


As the member for Ryan I will continue to work with the University of Queensland community and all important stakeholders to ensure that the federal government continues to support, always, the crucial scientific industry in this country.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-02-07,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (19:02):  Recently I had the pleasure of meeting with Nobel laureate Professor Brian Schmidt, who was awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. As well as discussing his amazing research on the accelerating and expanding universe, we discussed the importance of science and research to Australia's future. More than anything else, Australia's future economic prosperity will rely on our capacity to harness the knowledge and innovation of our universities and our researchers.


While we are living through an unprecedented mining boom, we must not lose sight of the negative impact the boom has on other sections of the economy. If our economy is to be more than just a quarry for China now and into the future, we must support innovation, science, research and development. The Greens also believe that government investment in research and science is critical to ensure that Australia is well positioned for a postcarbon economy. Innovations in science and technology through research are essential if we are to meet the challenges of addressing climate change and the transition to a sustainable society. So it is with great enthusiasm that on behalf of the Greens I rise to support the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011, which will enable indexation of funding to the Australian Research Council. Unfortunately, the last budget contained cuts to research funding, including $30 million from the cooperative research program, and there was no substantial new increase in funding. But at least the ARC was protected. The ARC plays a crucial and central role in support of research in Australia. It deserves increased support, and the Greens and I will always back its continued funding.


I believe that we need a society where the acquisition of fundamental knowledge and the application of sustainable new techniques are valued in the education system and by Australian business. We need a research and development culture that addresses national goals and prepares Australia for emerging challenges and opportunities. But to achieve such goals we will need adequate support from both business and government. That is why the government needs to set a target for Australia's research and development. It needs to be a target that places us in the top ranks of the OECD, not languishing in the middle. It needs to be a target that sets us up to lead the world. That is why I believe the government needs to make a commitment to increase R&D funding and to have a national goal of at least three per cent of GDP. That will require an increase in public funding and also a greater contribution from the private sector.


There is widespread recognition of the need for a national target of at least three per cent. That is backed by the Australian Academy of Science, which has called for an increase in Australia's research and development expenditure to at least three per cent of GDP by 2020. While there has been an upward trend in overall expenditure on R&D, this has largely been a result of increases in expenditure by the resources and energy sector, and the proportion of the government's contribution to the country's research effort has fallen dramatically from 22.6 per cent of total expenditure in 2000-2001 to 12.3 per cent in 2008-2009. In 2008-2009 this country had an expenditure of 2.21 per cent, which is below the OECD average of 2.33 per cent. That means that we spend as little as $900 per person per year on research and development, which puts us at 14th in the rankings of OECD member countries. We are well behind the next best ranked country, Iceland, which devotes 2.6 per cent of GDP to research and development. At the top of the list is Israel, with 4.6 per cent, followed by Finland and Sweden, each of which spends 3.6 per cent.


To remain competitive internationally we need even greater investment and, if we are to embrace the challenges and developments of this century, we must deliver internationally competitive R&D. Research excellence is precious, but researchers are often in a battle for survival where costs are rising quicker than the level of funding and where career opportunities are limited. We want to encourage people to collaborate with those overseas and to go overseas themselves, but we hope that they will do that to further their scientific knowledge, not because there is no place for them here in Australia. Science research is often a long-term investment, but it is an investment that can pay off in spades. Late last year, the President of the Australian Academy of Science, Suzanne Cory, outlined some commercial successes created by the research of our world-class scientists. She referred in her list to WiFi, the bionic ear and Gardasiil. To focus on WiFi for a moment, she reminded us that the pioneering work of CSIRO scientist John O'Sullivan in radioastronomy led to the invention of WiFi—a beautiful example, she says, of how blue sky research can lead to commercial success in a totally unexpected area. This technology is absolutely integral to the way people all over the world use computers, printers, televisions and telephones. Indeed, it is now hard to imagine a world without WiFi and IT specialists predict that there will soon be more than one billion WiFi devices worldwide. She said that as of mid-2010 the WiFi patent had already netted CSIRO an estimated $250 million, which is being ploughed back into research and development via CSIRO's Science and Industry Endowment Fund. It is predicted to ultimately bring CSIRO upwards of $1 billion.


To create the economic booms of the future we need to increase our investment in research and innovation. But we also need to increase our support for maths and science teaching in our schools and universities. I share the concerns of many that participation in maths and science education is declining and that the government's commitment is flagging. Australia ranks in the bottom half of OECD countries for the number of university graduates with science or engineering degrees. Consequently, I am also very concerned at the measures announced in the MYEFO that would almost double HECS fees for maths and science students. The government recognised the long-term need to encourage students into science and maths by introducing the priority HECS rates for science and maths in 2009. However, they did not take a long-term approach when they cancelled the priority rates last year. How could science and maths be a national priority three years ago and yet not now?


When wealthy mining companies get close to $9 billion a year in handouts and tax concessions we should not be taking $400 million from science and maths education to balance the budget. The $400 million saving is a false economy if it means that science and maths are not taken up by our young people. Following government cuts to the Science in Schools program, the government is taking science education in the wrong direction. I am also concerned that the government used the report of the Bradley review to justify the HECS increase. HECS fees for sciences and maths were lowered in 2009 when they were made a national priority; however, the Bradley review was completed in December 2008.


My concerns regarding the cuts are echoed by Universities Australia and by the Australian Academy of Science, who have noted that Australia's robust economic future depends upon innovation. This is not the time to withdraw support for the next generation of scientists and mathematicians.


Today the CSIRO announced its winners of the annual science awards. Two of the winners were a brother and sister, who won with solar-themed projects. Ethan Butson, 16, and his sister Macinley, 11, took out the high school and primary sections. The awards attracted more than 6,000 entries, with the top 15 students flown to Melbourne for a science workshop with some of the CSIRO's top science minds. It is young people like Ethan and Macinley who are the future of innovation in Australia and we need to nurture their minds and their careers.


We must spend more on research and science, not less. We must invest more in maths and science in our schools. I intend to be a fierce advocate for the importance of scientific research and the need for it to be adequately funded and supported and I will fight for the future of maths and science in our education system. That is why I support this bill and why I will support any move to increase funding to Australian research.

Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (17:36):  The Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011 is largely an uncontentious bill. I am therefore happy, on behalf of the opposition, to state that we will be supporting it. Providing continued support to the Australian Research Council is of course an inherently good thing, and both sides of politics have long recognised the organisation's importance in contributing to and sustaining Australian research of the highest quality. Indeed, in introducing this bill the government is honouring the longstanding practice of annually amending the ARC Act to apply indexation to existing appropriation amounts and to create an additional forward estimate. The principle was first adopted by the Howard government in 2001 and has been continued on an annual basis ever since.


That said, I am not entirely sure of the reason for the substantial drop in funding for 2014-15 and would therefore welcome some clarification from someone in the government about the precise reasoning behind that. This is a government that has already cut the budget for the highly regarded Cooperative Research Centres program by tens of millions of dollars. It also attracted flak from the CSIRO association for what were described as modest changes to the CSIRO's quadrennial funding that would lead to job losses without growth in external revenue. So I would be keen for an explanation of how this drop in the ARC's funding aligns with all of that as well. Perhaps someone can explain whether it is just an oversight, because it does not really tally with what the newly installed Minister for Industry and Innovation has been implying in media interviews—how the government's whole strategy for industry apparently hinges on spending more on innovation and research.


It would also be nice to hear the government address a problem to which I am alerted over and over again by businesspeople. There is ever-rising discontent in many parts of Australian industry about what is often perceived as a widening gulf between the amount of research produced in Australia and the level of tangible practical benefits of that research for Australian businesses—in other words, the commercialisation of that research. This is a critical problem that I know staff at the ARC well understand, but I am worried that some members of the government are suffering from the misapprehension that it is not a particularly serious issue.


There were some other words in the minister's second reading speech that are probably worthy of note, at least in passing. What was particularly noticeable were his references to 'the big issues of our time', including 'our need to transform our manufacturing industries to create greener, healthier and more resilient processes'. It is a terribly sad day when almost all government ministers, when it comes to innovation, industry, science and research, have only these banal turns of phrases. All they can say about policy are lines like 'innovate or perish' or 'innovation policy is industry policy'.


The importance of businesses becoming more environmentally efficient was self-evident years and years ago. That is why so many of them have made the transition and invested significantly in becoming greener and more efficient. These are not new discoveries or revelations. It is disappointing that the Labor Party continues with such a dismissive attitude towards Australian businesspeople, simply in the name of trying to justify the unjustifiable and to pretend that policies like the introduction of an economy-destroying, job-destroying, competition-reducing carbon tax are a good idea. Manufacturing policy—and the future of it in Australia—should be about so much more than abysmally poor policy and patronising one-liners from ministers and their colleagues on the government benches.


There was at least one other curious part of the minister's speech. I initially thought I must have heard him incorrectly. But then I checked the Hansard and, believe it or not, he did actually say that the ERA is 'a key element of the government's 10-year innovation agenda, Powering Ideas'. Let us not kid ourselves. The government recently made a humiliating backdown on the ERA after digging its heels in for years against sound and widespread advice. There was a complete 180-degree backflip from Senator Carr on this. As for Powering Ideas, even the hand-picked expert author of the review that led to that document has since savaged the government's complete lack of taste and heart for serious reform in the area of innovation.


I will conclude by restating that I am pleased to support the government's introduction of this bill but would hope that the government uses the occasion of the bill's passing to reflect on the fundamental importance of valuing and targeting research spending as wisely as possible, and of course being more serious about forging better linkages between researchers and industry. The coalition strongly supports Australian innovation and research and recognises its inextricable linkages with increased productivity and increased living standards. It will be a cornerstone of our future economic growth. In the face of mounting debt and deficit and with many parts of Australian industry struggling, there has rarely been a more important time for us to be extracting the maximum possible benefits from our national research investments.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (17:43):  I welcome the opportunity to briefly speak on the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011. In a moment I am going to respond to some of the comments just made by the member for Indi. Before I do, I will get to the purpose of this bill. The purpose of the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011 is to amend the Australian Research Council Act 2001 by adjusting the existing funding caps and inserting a new funding cap for the 2014 financial year. This bill provides additional funding to the Australian Research Council as part of the standard budget process.


This is important legislation to ensure that the Australian Research Council can continue to support high-quality research throughout Australia. Of course, it is important that we ensure that this money is well spent. The Australian Research Council not only supports quality research and research careers but also helps the government measure its research investment and assure taxpayers that their money is being invested wisely. The future of our country, our prosperity, our quality of life, our place in the world, our very existence is very much dependent on the quality of education of our people, on the research commitments we make and on the knowledge and innovation arising from that research. Australia has some of the finest research institutions in the world, such as the CSIRO. In my own region, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation is an outstanding example of a research facility. We have wonderful medical research facilities right around the country and we have many people in the private sector simultaneously and equally carrying out very important research. In addition and very importantly we have universities around the country carrying out research every day on different matters affecting the lives of people not only in Australia but also right around the world. It is a strength and an asset which we should not overlook.


Australian research has brought not just important innovation to us all but national pride. Now more than ever we live in a highly competitive world and innovation will become even more critical in giving Australia a competitive advantage. A very clear and real example is the competition faced by Australia's automotive sector. It is with respect to that sector that I want to respond to the comments made by the member for Indi, who talked about manufacturing in this country.


Manufacturing is incredibly important to the livelihoods of so many people in so many communities wherever you go because, quite frankly, it underpins the livelihoods of many other sectors. I am acutely aware of that because in my own region manufacturing is still the largest employer, underpinning many other industries and the advanced manufacturing arising from them. Advanced manufacturing relies on research. In particular the automotive sector in this country, which is part of the manufacturing fabric, employs 46,000 direct jobs nationally and another 200,000 jobs indirectly. This sector is vital to the economy of South Australia, the state I come from. I represent the region where, for over 60 years, the GM Holden plant has underpinned the economy. For the member for Indi to talk about patronising people in the manufacturing sector, when the opposition's policy, if elected, is to cut another $500 million from the automotive sector at a critical time when it is under intense pressure from overseas suppliers to build cars in this country, is hypocrisy at its worst. To say that we are patronising the manufacturing people is absolutely ludicrous.


In recent weeks I have seen total disarray on the coalition side, from state and federal MPs, on their views and policies with respect to the assistance they will provide manufacturers in this country, particularly in the automotive sector. I have listened to debate, comment and interview after interview from members opposite and it is clear that not only do they not have a policy but also they are in total disarray and in conflict with one another with respect to their position on this issue. The fact is that the $500 million which they would cut if elected to office is money that will be used to help vehicle and component makers get cleaner and greener products onto the market, the very thing research and development brings to this country, the very thing that will make manufacturers much more competitive and their products more saleable. Yet the area they are going to cut has a direct bearing on research investment in this country. They come into this chamber and pretend that they are taking a stand on behalf of our manufacturing sector. It really is hypocritical.


Put simply, research is critical if we are to address the challenges that face our nation and the world—climate change, treating and eradicating disease, and improving productivity in the workforce, whether through the application of new technology or industrial arrangements that put workers in a mental 'space' where they will work more efficiently. Research helps us meet the eternal challenge of better understanding the world we live in. Research dedicated to improving our understanding of history helps us define our future by learning from our past. Research also helps us analyse the impact of social and economic policy.


Recent trends in higher education highlight the growing importance of Australian Research Council funding. It has been said that there now appears to be a stronger emphasis on teaching in university, rather than researching. However, scholars also have an important role to play in providing solid, objective information to inform public policy initiatives and programs.


The Australian Research Council is an important element of our higher education system. The 2010-11 financial year marks the completion of the first decade of the Australian Research Council. It is important to provide funding to strengthen Australia's research workforce. In 2001-02, the Australian Research Council administered a budget of $270 million. By 2010-11 that had grown to $714.5 million. Australia has a proud tradition in research of contributing to significant change. The bionic ear, otherwise known as Cochlear implant, is certainly one of our most significant contributions and the Australian Research Council funded the innovative, investigator-driven research that underpinned this invention.


I understand a project started last year examines the effect on language development of children with Cochlear implants being in an oral environment. This research will provide information for parents and professionals to promote the best possible outcomes for children. Research is not just about innovation; it also helps us understand and assess the outcomes of earlier work.


I expect that at some point in the future someone will stand in this House and speak of the breakthrough in medical treatment achieved through stem cell research. In November 2010, then Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator the Hon. Kim Carr announced that Stem Cells Australia had been awarded a $21 million grant under the Special Research Initiative in Stem Cell Science. There is much evidence to suggest that the government's investment in research today will bring improvement to the lives of many people tomorrow.


The Australian Research Council has supported work that has made a difference to the lives of Australians in a diverse range of areas. These include research into the use of chemical residues from bomb blasts, in an era of homemade explosives, which will help catch terrorists; research that will improve predictions of Australian rainfall extremes using Indian Ocean surface temperatures; research that will allow us to successfully manage copyright in the digital age; research of strategies to improve child development and family wellbeing in disadvantaged communities before crime or serious behaviour problems emerge or become entrenched; research that has provided insight into the human appetite for protein, which can predispose us to obesity and other problems; research into the design of offshore structures that can survive catastrophic weather events like Hurricane Katrina; research of strategies to preserve the world's coral reefs; and research of minerals technology being used by global mining giants, saving money and increasing profits. These are just some examples of the research projects currently carried out by the Australian Research Council. I could refer to many more. I am pleased to say that only last week, in a hearing of the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, the Environment and the Arts, we heard from some of the scientists who are carrying out this research. What they are doing and the information they are providing the government, which in turn will be invaluable in assisting us with developing policies for the future, is a credit to them.


I want to talk briefly about some of the research being carried out in my home state of South Australia under Australian Research Council grants. The University of Adelaide was awarded $19.85 million in funding commencing in 2012 for 60 projects, and $47.28 million for 71 projects in 2011. I also note that the Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics is based at the University of Adelaide's Waite Campus, with additional research nodes at the University of Adelaide, the University of Melbourne, the University of Queensland and the University of South Australia. The centre was established in 2002 and is jointly funded by the Australian Research Council and the Grains Research and Development Corporation. Flinders University in South Australia was awarded $3.42 million in funding commencing in 2012 for 12 projects. It is interesting to note that Flinders University hosts the National Centre for Groundwater Research and Training, which is jointly funded by the Australian Research Council and the National Groundwater Commission. This is an area I have a personal interest in, and I understand the importance of this area of public policy. The centre, which also has research nodes at the University of New South Wales, the Australian National University and the University of Queensland, was established in June 2009 with Commonwealth funding of $29.5 million over five years. The ARC has awarded the University of South Australia $6.66 million in funding commencing in 2012 for 22 projects, including a Discovery Indigenous scheme. It is important to note the role the Australian Research Council has been and is playing in attracting more Indigenous Australians to academia, as well as the role that it plays in keeping more women in research careers. To enhance support for world-class female researchers, Prime Minister Gillard announced in 2010 that two new Australian Laureate Fellowships would be offered to highly ranked female candidates. Strong role models undoubtedly help attract people who do not come from backgrounds traditionally associated with research.


I can also talk about the centres of excellence that have been funded under this program. I understand some 25 centres of excellence have been established over the years, ranging from things like climate change to the history of emotions, from cognition and its disorders to plant cell wall biology, and so on. Again, these centres of excellence provide invaluable advice for government policy setting into the future.


In the time I have left to speak on this issue I want to talk about two people associated with these Australian centres of excellence. One is Peter Hoj, who was chief executive of the centres from 2004 to 2007. Peter is now the Vice Chancellor and president of the University of South Australia. Since his appointment to that role, taking over from Denise Bradley in 2007, he has done an outstanding job. I have worked with Peter on a number of different projects in the region and not only am I pleased to see that he is now in South Australia working for the University of South Australia—a university that has a campus in my own electorate—but also I commend him and his team for the work they are doing in engaging so many additional people in university vocations and university education. In particular the work they are doing on community engagement between the university and the broader community is something that they can all be proud of.


The other person I want to comment on is Professor Peter Buckskin, who I understand has now been appointed to the council. I know Professor Peter Buckskin through his work in South Australia, both in the education sector and as an adviser to state and federal governments over the years. I am pleased to see that Professor Buckskin has been appointed to the council. I wish him well in that role and I think he will make a fine contribution. I commend the bill to the House.

"Wyatt, Ken, MP",LP,2012-02-07,"



Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (17:58):  I rise to support the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011. I have been fortunate in my experiences to be a partner with industry, tertiary institutions and researchers in accessing ARC grants that focus on making a difference not only to the quality of life of Australians but also within fields of work that require Australia and Australian society to better position ourselves within a global context. 


I thank the member for Makin for his comments. I acknowledge those that I agree with but there are certainly some that I disagree with—I will not dwell on those; the beauty of democracy is that we have the opportunity to differ in philosophical positioning. I compliment the government on the indexing, at a rate of approximately 3.4 per cent, because that enhances the expectations of researchers that there is a source of funding that will enable them to undertake the work that is absolutely critical in benefiting the society in which we live. The additional financial year will be funded at $795.392 million, which is a reduction of four per cent from the previous financial year. But the expansion of the program through its extension is absolutely critical.


The Australian Research Council's mission is to deliver policies and programs that advance Australian research and innovation globally and that benefit the community. We can develop a mindset about what it is that we should accept within the short planning cycles of terms of governments. Sometimes I wish we could look beyond that and look over a decade, and look at the reality of some of the research that is needed to position Australia globally and enable us to be productive, efficient and a leader through innovation and technology.


As a statutory authority within the Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education portfolio, there is an expectation that the ARC will influence the key areas that form the basis of the way the Australian society moves forward. I have always supported the intent of the ARC. It promotes the highest quality research and research training through national competition in all fields of science, social sciences and humanities. Coupled with the work of the National Health and Medical Research Council, there are two significant avenues through which researchers can access funding in partnership with tertiary institutions and industry to undertake work that is absolutely critical in changing and making life better for all of us. I like the way the ARC brokers partnerships between researchers and industry, governments, community organisations and the international community.


I strongly support the ongoing funding allocated to the National Competitive Grants Program because of the way it encourages Australian researchers. It nurtures the creative abilities and skills of Australia's most promising researchers and provides support for high-quality research leading to the discovery of new ideas and the advancement of knowledge. This is absolutely vital if we are going to be a world leader. Financial assistance for facilities and equipment that researchers need to be internationally competitive is invaluable.


I want to make a few comments concerning the health arena. I have had a lot to do with the Sax Institute in New South Wales and Fiona Stanley's Telethon Institute for Child Health Research in Western Australia. Nurturing the capacity and capability of researchers to build on the social fabric and contribute to reform, change and innovation are very worthy, and something that we should strongly support and always endorse on a bipartisan basis. The ongoing funding will provide incentives for Australia's most talented researchers to work in partnership with leading researchers throughout the national innovation system and internationally, and to form alliances with Australian industry across the following interdisciplinary groupings: biological sciences and biotechnology, where there is much expansion occurring; engineering, mathematics and informatics; humanities and creative arts; physics, chemistry and earth sciences; and social, behavioural and economic sciences.


The member for Makin touched on a number of programs. I will not go into detail on those, but I want to explore the opportunities that we will have from this amended legislation and the programs that it establishes. The ARC is important because of the changing world in which we live and the impact of globalisation on the economy and on industry, and the opportunities that it delivers for our researchers to capitalise on emerging trends that cover every facet of our lives, our industries and our economy. The growing influence of globalisation will continue to increase competition and lower profit margins in many countries whilst at the same time centralising wealth and power in a diminishing number of supernational corporate giants. I see the opportunity for our researchers to look at the way they contribute to international growth and, at the same time, through innovation generate wealth and new jobs within the Australian economy.


Globalisation is a means to the levelling of the playing field for trade and we are progressing the concept of a flat earth for economic development, trade and the sciences. The threat that jobs could go abroad lies behind job insecurity, the erosion of non-wage benefits and the loss of manufacturing in Australia. These are critical issues and I see researchers as being pivotal in creating new industries and new manufacturing opportunities in this country in fields that we have not yet explored, but in their minds they are thinking about the prospects and opportunities.


The digital age and other technologies are triggering a massive increase in productivity along with the rapid downsizing in manufacturing and the deflation of costs. Knowledge management under this funding will make a difference between the growth of Australia and the survival in a virtual future, because that is a reality that we face. The reality that also faces Australia in a global society is access to a sustainable domestic workforce and productivity efficiencies that will mitigate the impact of factors of globalisation, an ageing workforce, inflexible work arrangements, young Australians wanting quality of life, the urban influence not rural and a diminishing manufacturing sector.


I read with great interest the work of Patrick Dixon, the author of Futurewise. I will cite three of his comments because they relate to factors that encourage our researchers and recipients of ARC funding to explore opportunities for our country.


The world has changed in every way. It continues to change at a rapid pace in aspects of our culture …


A key part of this process is understanding the potential future impact of decisions made by individuals, organisations and governments.


Take hold of the future or the future will take hold of you.


Certainly, in those projects that I have been involved in with ARC grants, that has been the thinking of the researchers, so I am extremely supportive of the funding and the increase in funding, and the indexation that the government has proposed in this legislation.


In Visions of the Future: the intelligence revolution, the first of a three-part mini series on the BBC hosted by Michio Kaku, he says:


In this century, we are going to make the historic transition from the 'Age of Discovery' to the 'Age of Mastery', a period in which we will move from being passive observers of nature to its active choreographers.


So there is that element coming within the scope of the work that researchers will do. The fourth of the top five predictions in The Futurist magazine is:


Professional knowledge will become obsolete almost as quickly as it's acquired. An individual's professional knowledge is becoming outdated at a much faster rate than ever before.


The partnerships between industries, tertiary institutions, researchers and the non-government organisations in a sense militate against this because they will look at, and explore, the opportunities for the expansion of knowledge that is applicable to the economy and to the society which we hope to shape.


James Canton in his book The Extreme Future identifies a significant focus and opportunity on the importance of innovation, particularly in globalisation; new technology; IT and networks, such as microchips and computers; biotech—unlocking the DNA to create health discoveries; nanotech—the manipulation of matter at the atomic scale; new fuels, drugs and machines; and neurotech—such as new devices, drugs and materials to heal, manage and enhance mental performance and functioning.


Researchers explore the boundaries that go outside the square. They use the opportunity to look at the 'what ifs' and then turn them into practical application that can become a process by which manufacturing industries and education knowledge acquisition, with skilling, account for different directions that will occur in the future. We only have to hark back to the past to see that labour intensive jobs are no longer required. That all has occurred because of the work that researchers have undertaken. It has enabled us to develop new ways of doing the work that we do, gaining efficiencies, obtaining productivity levels that generate the wealth that gives us and creates the standard of living that we look forward to. 


I read with interest both speeches delivered in the House by the minister. Many of the comments in there underpin the direction that we, in a bipartisan approach, must take if we are to ensure that future generations have the quality and standard of living that we have enjoyed for a number of years. If we project into our thinking for researchers the need to focus not only on 2010 or 2015 or 2020 but on the next 50 years and start to project into the future then we are likely to see the creation of innovative ideas by researchers. They will apply knowledge to the implications and impact on societies and families, and then shape advice to governments at all levels. That then enables the society or community to enjoy the benefits of what it is that we provide and protect. We can give them a solid foundation for the expectations that they would have to bring up families and communities in future years.


I commend the bill and I acknowledge the intent. I certainly look forward to the outcomes that researchers will achieve in the context of the work that they do, and the gains that they will make, that makes life in this country so rich, rewarding and enabling.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-02-07,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (18:12):  I rise to speak on the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011. How will we ensure that making healthier choices gets easier? How will adapting to climate change impact on our health? How will new urban spaces support health? How will children grow into adulthood to embrace new sustainable ways of living? How will communities change to support ageing? How will we relate to each other in a world of new communication technologies? How will safe and supportive communities grow to everyone's benefit in a globally connected world? How will local communities ensure a fair go for everyone as economic and social conditions change? What will a healthy workplace look like in the future?


These are all questions posed by Professor Robert Bush, who is the Director of Healthy Communities Research Centre at the University of Queensland Ipswich campus. I will speak more about that centre a little later. It is a centre which has received funding from the Australian Research Council, as has the University of Queensland generally—and I will talk a bit about that. It is important that we look at questions like that. They are posed to us as questions for the 21st century; not as questions for the 20th century. The adaptations and decisions that people will make in the 21st century are vastly different from those of the 20th century and 19th century. We need to pay particular attention to life span, the multicultural aspect of our community, the fast-growing demographic areas such as my electorate with Ipswich and the Somerset region of South-East Queensland—two of the three fastest-growing areas in South-East Queensland.


We need to pay attention to local government places and spaces, parks and gardens, recreational facilities and infrastructure—places that connect people; places that bring people together for fellowship and friendship. We need to look at our communities and how we can design them better. We need to look at the healthy aspects of our communities. These are all things that do not just happen by chance or happenstance. They happen because we provide funding for research to give us the answers. People like Robert Bush and others deserve the funding. They need it and we need to provide it for them. One of the projects being undertaken by the University of Queensland's Ipswich campus is the Ipswich Study and I will talk a bit more about that later.


This bill makes amendments to the Australian Research Council Act 2001. As other speakers have said, this amendment to the act to is to apply indexation to the funding administered by the ARC. The Research Council does important work and, through the National Competitive Grants Program, supports quality research—research which has applicability and an impact on communities, families and individuals. It includes research in areas such as the bionic ear, which the member for Makin talked about. Ongoing research will make a big difference not only to local communities but to higher education. Not only will it provide employment but it will provide answers to the questions posed by Professor Robert Bush.


There are a range of initiatives and innovations funded by the ARC through the NCGP and we have to make sure that research is provided so that we do not lag behind. Many years ago Lee Kuan Yew, the former Prime Minister of Singapore, said that Australia would become the white trash of Asia. That has not happened because we have taken steps to transform the economy and this government is now transforming our economy in a way that is cleaner and greener. We are making a difference to the future. We are making decisions for the 21st century, not for the high-pollution, high-carbon 20th century.


The ARC supports high-quality research. It provides grants to organisations. One of those institutions, which I am proud to say I attended and proud to say happens to be in my electorate, is the University of Queensland—the Ipswich campus. Recently, the University of Queensland received $430,000 in research funding for the Healthy Communities Research Centre based at Ipswich campus. That project is being funded through the National Competitive Grants Program and the funding for it is an example of what this legislation covers and it shows why indexation is critical. This particular successful proposal is titled Averting the extinction of experience and was submitted in collaboration with Dr Richard Fuller from the University of Queensland's School of Biological Sciences and the CSIRO's Climate Adaptation Flagship project. The research focuses on how changes to urban biodiversity affect health and is just one of the many projects funded by the Health Communities Research Centre at the University of Queensland's Ipswich campus. That campus is known, and that particular research centre is known, for its headline project, the Ipswich Study. I would hope that projects like the Ipswich Study will advance our knowledge, build our research capability and enhance international collaboration. It is important that we harness the creativity of our whole people and enhance the creative abilities and skills of our most promising researchers at places like the University of Queensland's Ipswich campus. The $430,000 I mentioned will enable the best and brightest researchers to make exciting and critical discoveries, will help forge those kinds of international partnerships and will showcase our region.


Over 1,000 projects were funded in this round of Australian Research Council major grants and they will share in about $310 million. The University of Queensland received over $38 million for 120 different projects. That included nearly $29.8 million for 92 projects under the Discovery Projects scheme, nearly $2 million for six projects under the Linkage Infrastructure Equipment and Facilities funding scheme and nearly $6.3 million for 22 projects under the Linkage Projects scheme. The University of Queensland is one of the sandstone universities and the campus at Ipswich has a medical school, a nursing school and allied health professional education. It is also the location of the University of Queensland's own GP superclinic, run by UQ, which was a great assistance to my local community during the floods last year. This research will make a difference to my community and to communities around the world. Robert Bush, whom I mentioned before, said that this project is really important and that he backed it 100 per cent. He described the funding as fantastic—to see the local centre achieve such a prestigious award and obtain research funding through the grants process. He talked about the potential for this sort of work to contribute to the health of Ipswich and beyond.


The Healthy Communities Research Centre clearly has runs on the board and can do a lot of good. Neighbourhoods, whether in Australia or abroad, influence the way communities operate, particularly in the critical area of health. I am always struck by the fact, when I jog around my neighbourhood at Flinders View and up around Raceview, Ripley and places like that, that there are many pathways. I see plenty of people jogging or walking their dog or just going for a walk themselves on those pathways. But, in other parts of Ipswich, I do not see the same pathways and I do not see people exercising. How can communities and local governments make a difference to reducing the problems of obesity and diabetes? These are the sorts of issues and questions that the University of Queensland's Ipswich Study will look into. Ipswich is a microcosm—it is a fast-developing area. Most of Ipswich is rural and many people do not realise that. It has a big manufacturing base in central Ipswich and the eastern suburbs, but most of it is rural. It has a very diverse community. There are about 175,000 people or a bit more—perhaps 180,000—and the member for Oxley and I share the care of it in representing it here in this place. We have implemented in Ipswich a number of projects to improve health and wellbeing and this government has put a lot of money into assisting Ipswich, including Ipswich General Hospital, which has close linkages to the University of Queensland. We have put $7 million into the redevelopment of Ipswich General Hospital and recently we have put in $16 million towards palliative care and other assistance in terms of rehabilitation. The now Attorney-General, a former Minister for Health and Ageing, was with me when we looked around at that particular project. So we have put a lot of money into that, but it is those partnerships between the University of Queensland's health research centre and the teaching facility at Ipswich General Hospital and the ARC, with the funding, that will make a difference in my local community.


Sometimes we come to this place and talk about big picture issues, but I want to narrow it all down and say what this will do and what this type of funding will do for my local community. I look forward to more than 10,000 Ipswich families taking part in this 10-year study. That will benefit not just the Ipswich community but also business, government and international research. Robert Bush tells me that the last time that a study of this longitudinal nature and research were really undertaken was in the US about 40 or 50 years ago. So this Ipswich study, which already has funding from the Ipswich Hospital Foundation, Bendigo Bank, Ipswich City Council, chambers of commerce and research grants, is really important and I am urging the government to consider this sort of funding. It is done on a bipartisan basis and it is really important that we get behind this.


Sir Llew Edwards, a former state member for Ipswich born and bred in Ipswich and a former Liberal Deputy Premier of Queensland and a former Chancellor of the University of Queensland, is a real backer of the Ipswich Study. He has made the point that the city 'is on the move' and 'heading towards a population boom'. He has said:


This … study goes beyond simply recognising that neighbourhoods influence health and into understanding exactly how.


I think that comment of his says it well, and I think that is the benefit of the research. It is about how we can build a sustainable Australia, how we can build communities that are not ghettos on the urban fringe and periurban areas of our country, and how we can look at taking advantage of what we have got in terms of mineral resources and making it all fairer and also making our local communities connected to each other. So I am very pleased to support this legislation. I am pleased to support the ARC and I am glad it has made a commitment to the University of Queensland and I am glad it has made a commitment to the research centre in my electorate and as, I am glad that it is located there, I urge the government to consider the Ipswich Study as something worth funding in the future.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (18:25):  On a personal note, I would like to thank the member for Blair and the member for Moreton for the job that they do on the committee looking at insurance that went to Townsville. They have done a great job up there along with the coalition guys. I rise to speak on the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011. The prime purpose of this bill is to apply indexation to the Australian Research Council's—or ARC's—existing funding schemes.    Specifically, this bill involves the changing of three current financial year funding figures to account for an indexation of roughly 3.4 per cent. As with the member for Blair, I have a university and lots of training centres and lots of ARC schemes in my electorate and I would love to support them. So, if you have anything to do with it, Madam Deputy Speaker Bird, I would discount everything that the member for Blair has said, because my stuff is going to be so much better. This bill will also extend the forward estimate period to include the financial year beginning 1 July 2014.


While this is a routine bill to index the ARC's funding schemes, it is nevertheless important to Australia, particularly to Townsville, which has become a vital research hub for regional Australia and the tropics. My first experience with the ARC on a committee basis was here in Parliament House when we sat around a table with the ARC people. When I asked them what they did, one of the things that they came up with was this. A business came to them and said, 'Where a building is not structurally damaged by fire the biggest expense is rewiring it.' So the ARC people had gone away and said, 'Okay, how do we do this?' What they came up with was a casing for the wiring when it goes into a building that under intense heat will turn into a ceramic, thus protecting the wiring. My head exploded and I said, 'Who could come up with that? Where do you think of these things?' As the member for Hasluck said, we train these people and these people are special in our society because they can think outside of the box, they can think about what can happen and throw things up in the air and see what stays there. That is what is great about the ARC schemes. People like me have no vision as to that whatsoever. I have absolutely no ability for thinking outside the box at all. I can fix the box, I can fix anything inside the box, I can tinker with it and I can change it, but if it is outside the box I am gone! That is why the ARC schemes are so important. If we are to be the smart country, if we are to be the innovators and really add to the Asian century, we must do it through research and development. As the member for Indi said, research and development must become the cornerstone of our economic growth. We must find new ways and new products, as the member for Makin said, and the cochlear implant is a fantastic example of what an ARC scheme can bring.


In Townsville we have the main campus of James Cook University. It is a world renowned body for its marine biology research and also for its focus on life in a tropical world. With around half of the world's population living in the tropics, JCU's work in the fields of tropical health, biodiversity and science is a central part of the university and of Townsville's contribution to the international community. It is important to note, on the 60th anniversary of the accession of the Queen to the throne, that it is the only university in Australia to have its proclamation physically signed by the Queen. James Cook University is the only university in Australia which has at its core life in a tropical world, so everything that is done at James Cook University is aimed at life in a tropical world to the extent that there is a wholly owned campus in Singapore which attracts university students from Europe wanting the Asian experience but with an Australian university degree.


One of the examples of the research that can come out of James Cook University is this. It is a field accident injection unit, which instantly clots blood. It was designed with the battlefield in mind. If someone is injured on the battlefield they are given an injection, like Nebupent, and it slows down the bleeding, it clots the blood, allowing you to transport them. Its implications for battle were obvious, but the implications for the farm, where the most dangerous implements are the chainsaw and a PTO instrument, are very well known to everyone. Distance is the killer and a piece of equipment like this injection unit is so handy. It should be developed throughout Australia. That they are struggling for funding shows just how vital this funding becomes, because we do have people out there wanting to do the work.


The ARC is a major source of funding for university based research, including at JCU through its grants programs, such as the Future Fellowships scheme and the Linkage Projects, which partner industry up with the research community. James Cook University has a great history of and passion for PhD students, because that is the research and those are the programs that are funded and bring research dollars into town. In places like ATSIP, the Australian Tropical Sciences and Innovation Precinct, practical and tangible research is bringing real progress to everything from the better use of our water resources to cattle and food production in a tropical environment.


While looking at this bill I have been in touch with Professor Chris Cocklin, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Research and Innovation, at JCU. Professor Cocklin emphasised the significance that indexing in ARC funding has to universities to ensure that they are able to maintain their level of research. In particular, he pointed out the burden that increased administration costs have had on universities and their ability in recent times to deliver maximum benefits from research funding.


Similarly, whilst the Australian Institute of Marine Science is getting funding for research, their operating expenses are shrinking. So, whilst they are getting more research money to go to sea for research, they are not getting the fuel to power the boats. That is where the cuts have to come. It is critical that we ensure funding for all research programs is spent in actual research and not just caught up in the organisation of these programs.


Townsville and JCU are also the headquarters of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, which joins JCU with the Australian National University, the University of Queensland, the University of Western Australia, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the last two of which are also key research hubs based in Townsville. The ARC's funding of the centre of excellence is of great importance to Townsville and to the Great Barrier Reef. Townsville's proximity to the reef makes it a natural home for coral reef studies and for PhD students and researchers from around the world. I spoke recently with one of the chief scientists at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, who reinforced to me the importance that the centre's research has to the management of the Great Barrier Reef, which is recognised internationally as being one of the best managed marine parks in the world. Much of the work undertaken by the centre of excellence is able to feed back through to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, and it underpins the park's management. This connection between research and frontline operations in Townsville is one of the elements that has made this such a successful program. Every member I have heard speak on this bill has alluded to the fact that we are seeing these practical experiences and examples of what our smarter people are bringing into our economy. As a government and as a parliament we are all speaking with one voice and saying that we do need research for this thing.


In Townsville I also spoke with the director of the centre of excellence, Professor Terry Hughes, about the contribution this program makes to coral reef research, with the centre of excellence's network around the country being the world's largest provider of coral reef training and research. Professor Hughes also mentioned to me that there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the funding of this program into the future. As the member for Hasluck said, it would be fantastic to sit here and say that they have funding for 50 years, or for 10 years, and that we are thinking long term. But we inside this place are all realists and we know that governments have the right to change priorities and change processes. Whilst we ask a lot of people to commit—and we ask them that when they do commit they do so wholly and solely to these things—a lot of the time it is a very hard thing to ask them to do because funding does dry up.


The Australian Institute of Marine Science also plays a major role in Townsville's marine science research community. While their main connection with the ARC is through the centre of excellence, their collaborations with JCU and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority nevertheless mean that they benefit from an increase in funding for research in Townsville. There are some very exciting things happening at the Australian Institute of Marine Science. For example, there is the ocean simulator, which is attracting attention from PhD students and fellows from around the world wanting to see what is happening. We are getting to the stage where we can commercially produce lobsters in-house. We are breeding lobsters in-house and we are getting them from the larval stage to the wriggler stage and then all the way through. This is a fantastic program. It is world-leading research that has the whole world excited.


Funnily enough, when it comes to the Australian Institute of Marine Science, we have the Protect our Coral Sea petition going around. No doubt every member in this House has seen something of it. It is the PEW foundation—and the PEW foundation is not a rabid green organisation that just wants to shut things down—that is pushing for the closure of the Coral Sea and turning it into a national park. Not James Cook University, AIMS or the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority were asked to participate in this research. Given that we are talking about an area of over one million square kilometres, it is something we should be questioning. We should be questioning the motives behind the PEW foundation's research. Even more importantly, there has been very little research done on the Coral Sea. The most quantitative research we ever received was from when we were able to tag rides with the Japanese fishing fleets that operated there through the 1970s and into the 1980s, but that was phased out, starting with the Fraser-Howard government and then into the Hawke-Keating era. Even more importantly, if we are to have the ARC guide us, we really should ensure that they are part of the process. Townsville has become a key centre for research in the tropics, and any measures that affect government funding for research have significant consequences for the city and for our research institutions. We all wish that we had a bottomless pit from which we could pull money for the funding of research. There will always be that line in the sand. It is up to the government of the day to say where that line in the sand is drawn. As much as I would like to quip, 'As long as it is drawn making sure that everything from Townsville is in there,' I do understand that there are priorities that have to be made. I think we are all aware that, whilst there are very, very good causes here which will miss funding, there has to be a line drawn in the sand.


But I would like to go back to what the members for Hasluck, Blair and Makin said, and no doubt the member for Canberra will be saying it as well. If we are to be the truly innovative people that we know we are, if we are to foster Australian researchers who can think outside the box, who can come up with ideas and make them practical, tangible, positive, income-producing schemes, we must make sure that we give people every chance to do their research, to progress their research, to come up with examples. We know that there will be economic benefits in the long term. With that in mind, I commend the bill to the House.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2012-02-07,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (18:38):  It is a great pleasure to be able to speak on the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011 tonight, because the ACT has a very large stake in research. The ANU is one of the greatest research institutions in the world. The University of Canberra is also a great research institution. And I have the Mount Stromlo Observatory in my electorate, which conducts some phenomenal research into what is going on in outer space. This government has made a significant investment in the Mount Stromlo Observatory. When bushfires ravaged the south of Canberra, in my electorate, the observatory was largely burnt out. It was just a shell up there. We have made significant investment in that area now. We have got the greatest technology, new buildings and it is ever expanding, with more and more people driving up that little hill each day to go and do great work for the nation and for the world. So it is a great pleasure to be able to speak on this amendment bill tonight.


As the statutory authority within the innovation portfolio, the Australian Research Council plays an important role in advancing Australian research and innovation globally, while also supporting the highest quality research and training through the fields of science, social sciences and the humanities. The Australian Research Council Amendment Bill will help us continue to support excellence in research and to build our nation's research capacity. We are already at the forefront of the world in great research, particularly in the agricultural sector. 


When I was in Afghanistan early last year—in May, I think it was—it was really interesting talking to a number of people there about what we can contribute in providing advice and assistance in the agricultural sector to build up the local capacity in Afghanistan. They have great skills in growing, developed over centuries and centuries on small plots of land, in really rough conditions. They have stinking hot summers. It is 50 degrees in summer and it is minus 50 degrees in winter, so we are talking pretty rugged conditions. In some parts of Australia we get extreme weather, but we do not usually get extreme hot and extreme cold in the course of the year. In speaking to people there, I learned they have this great capacity to grow almonds, dates and apricots, but they do not have the capacity to make it a large business. We have the ability not just to improve productivity, through the research that we do, but also to give advice on capacity building for businesses.


Australians have great, great research that has allowed this country to prosper, particularly in the agricultural sector over the course of this nation's history. I am thinking particularly of the great research that the CSIRO has done in wheat, to allow enormous boosts in production, by 40 per cent over time. We have great skills in this area and it is great that we have this technology and research capacity that we can export overseas.


Specifically, this amendment bill will alter three existing financial year funding figures for indexation and extend the forward estimates period to include the financial year starting on 1 July 2014, resulting in additional spending of $885 million over the four financial years. As I mentioned, the ARC has a long history and it is something that the Gillard government is proud to continue to support. Although this amendment to administer vital funding occurs each year, it is a great reminder to all of us of the importance of research to our nation's future and of how this research can deliver cultural, economic, social and environmental benefits to all our citizens and—I have just mentioned the case of Afghanistan—the citizens of the world.


We must ensure that Australian researchers, who do such important work, can continue to be internationally competitive. One way the ARC ensures this is through the National Competitive Grants Program, a program that nurtures our future scientists and researchers and ensures they have incentives to stay here in Australia. It is vitally important that we keep these great minds in our country, doing great work for Australia. The program does this by supporting the highest quality research, which leads to the discovery of new ideas and the advancement of knowledge. It also provides financial assistance towards facilities and equipment that our researchers need so they can continue to be internationally competitive. It also supports training and skills development for our next generation of researchers. In addition, it provides incentives for Australia's most talented researchers to work in partnership with leading national and international researchers and to form alliances with Australian industry, which is so important. We do not need people coming up with great ideas in the research area which are then just planted in a Petri dish or become some concept sitting on a shelf; the ideas need to be utilised in some meaningful way, and that is where these partnerships with industry are so important. Australians can be proud of the work our researchers do. Many significant global advances have been achieved by Australians working under the auspices of the ARC. Not only has the ARC supported some of our most well-known innovations, such as the bionic ear—a great invention—and the Jameson Flotation Cell, which continues to save the coal industry billions of dollars each year; the organisation also continues to push the boundaries to discover what is possible, what is unthought-of, what is out there, what is the potential that we will inherit. It is working hard to advance science and research more broadly and to ensure that the abilities and skills of Australia's most promising researchers are nurtured and promoted.


I am pleased to report that in 2012 funding will allow the ARC to continue its Australian Laureate Fellowships Scheme, which reflects the Commonwealth's commitment to support excellence in research by attracting world-class researchers and research leaders to key positions by creating new rewards and incentives for the application of their talents in Australia. I am even more delighted to report that, for funding commencing in 2012, up to 17 Australian Laureate Fellowships will be awarded, including an additional two fellowships for successful female Australian Laureate Fellows. Recipients of these fellowships will be provided with the Australian Laureate Fellowship funding, plus additional funding to undertake an ambassadorial role to promote women in research. This is an issue in which I have become very interested in recent years, more so since I have become the member for Canberra and even more so because of the nature of the population in Canberra and its very strong research community.


My little sister is a research neurologist. She has done some great research on strokes as well as in a range of other areas. One thing that she has highlighted to me, as have her colleagues and other women in Canberra who are in this field, is that women in the early stages of their career find research grants quite accessible. It is when they go into the phase where they have had a few babies and they want some part-time work that their publication rate reflects the part-time nature of their work. They do not have as many publications as their male colleagues who have not had babies, who have not taken a bit of time off work or who have not gone part-time. Of course, you cannot compare a part-time mother and her publication rate with a full-time male researcher. So there is an in-built discrimination in terms of their ability to get grants as a result of their not being able to publish as much as their male colleagues. There are also some other systemic issues here. 


The government has been doing a great deal, as have research councils such as the NHMRC, to improve the number of women, particularly those at that mid-career level, in the research industry and improve their access to grants. It is vitally important that young women go into this field. We need more women in science. We need more women in research. These young women go into this field with bright ideas, great ideas, and with aspirations. So early in their career they need to incentives to stay in the research field and to continue to stay in it right throughout their career. They should not have their careers stopped as a result of their choice to have babies and work part-time. These fellowships are very welcome news, and I applaud the ARC for instituting them.


This measure is important because, at the inception of the Australian Laureate Fellowships Scheme, in 2008, only 12.8 per cent of the applicants were female and, in 2009, 17.5 per cent were female. The ARC continues to work hard to improve the research funding opportunities for women and, as I said, not just at the beginning of their careers but throughout their careers. I believe these additional fellowships will go a long way to promoting women in research.


The Discovery Early Career Researcher Award will also continue this year. This is another way that the ARC is working hard to support and advance our promising researchers who are in the early stages of their careers. Proposals are now open for this funding to commence in 2013. 


The ARC is also working to advance the representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders working in research and innovation. Funding will commence this year for the Special Research Initiative for the ATSI Researchers' Network. The network's core functions will be to build Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander research capacity, mentor new researchers and advance research in Indigenous knowledge systems.


As well as supporting Australian research and ensuring incentives for research at home, the ARC is also supporting research that will have a long-term impact on the lives of Australian families. The ARC is working to support our ageing population, which is so important, through its population ageing research. This research will transform thinking about population ageing, inform private and public sector policy and yield outcomes that will improve the wellbeing of the aged and their social and economic environment.


The organisation is also on track to deliver the bionic eye—a breakthrough that will be welcome news for people suffering progressive vision loss. With an ageing population, that number will probably only go up. This initiative was one of many that came out of the government's 2020 Summit here, in Canberra, in 2009. The ARC awarded $50 million for this special research initiative. The technology is now at the point of being tested, and this is just one year after funding began. It just goes to show what our Australian researchers can do with the funding we are providing to them with this bill. 


This year the ARC has committed funding for a total of 778 proposals for Discovery Projects—that is, funding for research projects that can be undertaken by individual researchers or research teams. I am proud to say that 93 of those grants were issued to researchers from the Australian National University and the University of Canberra in the ACT alone. In 2012, more than $327,000 has been granted to researchers at the ANU to examine factors that may improve the mental health of welfare recipients, promote employment outcomes and help the Commonwealth government develop welfare reform policy. 


The ANU has also been awarded $420,000 for research into next-generation tsunami warnings. This project will generate the science for rapid tsunami forecasts to maintain public confidence in tsunami warnings, enabling emergency managers around the world to make well-informed decisions about imminent tsunamis.


Also, $390,000 will be given to the ANU for the very first digital imaging survey of the entire sky of the Southern Hemisphere. It is amazing. This work will underpin a number of significant national science programs of international prominence, and I am sure that it will be one of them. The survey will be carried out using the university's SkyMapper telescope near Coonabarabran. It was built to replace the ANU's previous telescope located at Mount Stromlo Observatory, which was sadly destroyed in the 2003 bushfires. According to the ANU's Professor of Astronomy, the ultimate plan is to create a database that will be accessible for anyone in the world. Astronomers anywhere will be able to learn about the characteristics of the Southern Hemisphere stars and galaxies. It is very exciting. At the University of Canberra, $210,000 has been committed to researchers examining productivity and work-life balance in virtual work environments, helping to unlock the impact technology is having on our ability to have a life outside of work. I would be very interested to see what the outcomes of that research will be. I know none of us are strangers to work interrupting our family, particularly with the technology we have now, so this will be of interest to many people, I am sure.


In all, more than $32 million has been invested in researchers here in the ACT this year. This funding will go towards a range of projects from disciplines as diverse as pure mathematics—which was a huge challenge for me at school—to historical studies and everything in between. This is a significant investment in research and I commend the ARC for making that investment in Canberra. It is important to remember the contribution researchers make to the future of Canberra, and indeed Australia. Our research holds the key to our growing and developing economy. It helps shape our jobs of the future, and ensures we can better protect and understand our natural environment. Through research we can better educate our children, heal our sick and discover new opportunities—new worlds, like we are with the Southern Hemisphere stars—to help our local communities grow in a more sustainable way and to help the world. I commend this bill to the House.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2012-02-07,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (18:53):  I rise today to speak on the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011. Although this is a routine change to the Australian Research Council Act 2001 which occurs annually, the bill continues to update and contribute to the important work that the ARC provides for innovation and research in Australia. This amendment, which the coalition supports, adds indexation to current financial year funding figures and extends the forward estimate period to the year commencing 1 July 2014. Specifically, this bill will add indexation at approximately 3.4 per cent, which will cost $89 million and fund the extra financial year at a cost of $795 million.


The Australian Research Council was established in 2001 under the Howard government as recognition of the need to have a centralised body to coordinate linkages between government, industry, the community and researchers. As the ARC itself states, its mission is to 'deliver policy and programs that advance Australian research and innovation globally and benefit the community'. The ARC runs many very successful initiatives, including the National Competitive Grants Program, which provides support and financial assistance as well as other incentives to form national aid linkages with researchers around the world. In particular, it is a comprehensive program that recognises the different stages at which various researchers may be in their career. Similarly, the ARC supports research and training through the National Research Priorities scheme and Discovery Projects on top of other laureate and future fellowships and Indigenous-specific programs.


As we know, the advancements that can occur from research projects can be quite unpredictable and result from the inherent risk involved with scientific research. This will continue to be the case in the future and, as such, it is certainly one area where the government can make a significant contribution to projects that might have otherwise never found private funding. But it is also an area where government can make gains. As I have noted previously, it is estimated, for example, that for every dollar invested into medical research up to six dollars is returned on top of the initial investment.


Stakeholders were understandably concerned last year when the Gillard government proposed to cut funding to the tune of $400 million as a direct result of their inability to design a responsible budget. I reiterate to the House today my concern at the thought of decreasing funding to what is an integral program for the future of Australia's research, innovation and industry. I do note that over the forward estimates the additional year included in the bill from 2014 is costed at approximately $795 million, which will in fact be a reduction of 4 per cent from the previous financial year. Although the coalition does support the passage of the bill, I and the coalition will always be looking at how we can adequately fund the ARC so that it is able to effectively and efficiently deliver on its mission.


Given the strong support from members on both sides of the House today and their pride in what their local universities are achieving, we are all obviously in furious agreement about the need for guaranteed long-term funding. However, as the member for Indi remarked earlier, this Labor government is notoriously poor at providing linkages between research and industry. This particular aspect is perhaps the most important as it is the area where researchers and organisations are able to make financial and commercial returns from their work, returns that they are then able to reinvest and use to facilitate future research.


Appropriate planning and support for the Australian Research Council is especially important to the people of Ryan, as it is home to the University of Queensland. The University of Queensland is one of the premier research universities in Australia as a member of the Group of Eight. Indeed, it is one of the premier research organisations in the world, as judged by many international ranking publications. Since its inception, the Australian Research Council and the University of Queensland community have had a very strong relationship. Throughout that time, UQ has successfully been approved for many hundreds of projects through the various funding arms of the ARC. What distinguishes the University of Queensland as a leading research university is its depth and diversity across many faculties, from architecture to engineering, quantum physics, biomedical and molecular research as well as marine biology and research on sustainable living and environmental management strategies.


Earlier today, Professor Max Lu, the Senior Deputy Vice-Chancellor, updated me on many exciting ongoing research projects occurring at the University of Queensland. In 2011, the university placed first in the measure of ARC Discovery and Linkage projects outcomes, a wonderful achievement. Moreover, the University of Queensland placed second in the nation for both the Future Fellowships and Discovery Early Career Researcher Award, with 21 out of a possible 203 fellowships and 34 out of 277 discovery awards, each valued at $375,000. This highlights the strength of the many research teams at the University of Queensland. Certainly, the prospects for early career and midcareer researchers are extremely promising.


The University of Queensland has a particular focus on attracting and retaining international quality researchers, which adds further diversity to the pool of ideas that already exists in Australia and also contributes to the development of local scientists. Without these awards, the University of Queensland would simply not be able to attract the right researchers and the right ideas. Professor Lu himself has also received important funding from the ARC—including the very prestigious ARC Federation Fellowships twice, in 2003 and 2008—which has supported his world-class research into nanotechnology, materials chemistry and engineering. We are very fortunate to have Professor Lu at the university, and only with funding and support for research from organisations like the ARC are we able to attract and retain researchers of his ilk. 


I also congratulate the University of Queensland on being awarded funding for two ARC Centres of Excellence, to add to its research in both quantum technology and environmental management solutions. Professor Gerard Milburn is training the next generation of world-class researchers in engineered quantum systems, and his team will be conducting research in conjunction with partners all over the world—in Austria, in Canada, in Germany, in Singapore, in Sweden, in the United Kingdom and in the United States of America. We can all expect to see new devices and technologies which will drive Australia's, and the world's, productivity and economic growth in the future as a direct result of this cooperative research.


As the member for Ryan I will continue to work with the University of Queensland community and all important stakeholders to ensure that the federal government continues to support, always, the crucial scientific industry in this country.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-02-07,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (19:02):  Recently I had the pleasure of meeting with Nobel laureate Professor Brian Schmidt, who was awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. As well as discussing his amazing research on the accelerating and expanding universe, we discussed the importance of science and research to Australia's future. More than anything else, Australia's future economic prosperity will rely on our capacity to harness the knowledge and innovation of our universities and our researchers.


While we are living through an unprecedented mining boom, we must not lose sight of the negative impact the boom has on other sections of the economy. If our economy is to be more than just a quarry for China now and into the future, we must support innovation, science, research and development. The Greens also believe that government investment in research and science is critical to ensure that Australia is well positioned for a postcarbon economy. Innovations in science and technology through research are essential if we are to meet the challenges of addressing climate change and the transition to a sustainable society. So it is with great enthusiasm that on behalf of the Greens I rise to support the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2011, which will enable indexation of funding to the Australian Research Council. Unfortunately, the last budget contained cuts to research funding, including $30 million from the cooperative research program, and there was no substantial new increase in funding. But at least the ARC was protected. The ARC plays a crucial and central role in support of research in Australia. It deserves increased support, and the Greens and I will always back its continued funding.


I believe that we need a society where the acquisition of fundamental knowledge and the application of sustainable new techniques are valued in the education system and by Australian business. We need a research and development culture that addresses national goals and prepares Australia for emerging challenges and opportunities. But to achieve such goals we will need adequate support from both business and government. That is why the government needs to set a target for Australia's research and development. It needs to be a target that places us in the top ranks of the OECD, not languishing in the middle. It needs to be a target that sets us up to lead the world. That is why I believe the government needs to make a commitment to increase R&D funding and to have a national goal of at least three per cent of GDP. That will require an increase in public funding and also a greater contribution from the private sector.


There is widespread recognition of the need for a national target of at least three per cent. That is backed by the Australian Academy of Science, which has called for an increase in Australia's research and development expenditure to at least three per cent of GDP by 2020. While there has been an upward trend in overall expenditure on R&D, this has largely been a result of increases in expenditure by the resources and energy sector, and the proportion of the government's contribution to the country's research effort has fallen dramatically from 22.6 per cent of total expenditure in 2000-2001 to 12.3 per cent in 2008-2009. In 2008-2009 this country had an expenditure of 2.21 per cent, which is below the OECD average of 2.33 per cent. That means that we spend as little as $900 per person per year on research and development, which puts us at 14th in the rankings of OECD member countries. We are well behind the next best ranked country, Iceland, which devotes 2.6 per cent of GDP to research and development. At the top of the list is Israel, with 4.6 per cent, followed by Finland and Sweden, each of which spends 3.6 per cent.


To remain competitive internationally we need even greater investment and, if we are to embrace the challenges and developments of this century, we must deliver internationally competitive R&D. Research excellence is precious, but researchers are often in a battle for survival where costs are rising quicker than the level of funding and where career opportunities are limited. We want to encourage people to collaborate with those overseas and to go overseas themselves, but we hope that they will do that to further their scientific knowledge, not because there is no place for them here in Australia. Science research is often a long-term investment, but it is an investment that can pay off in spades. Late last year, the President of the Australian Academy of Science, Suzanne Cory, outlined some commercial successes created by the research of our world-class scientists. She referred in her list to WiFi, the bionic ear and Gardasiil. To focus on WiFi for a moment, she reminded us that the pioneering work of CSIRO scientist John O'Sullivan in radioastronomy led to the invention of WiFi—a beautiful example, she says, of how blue sky research can lead to commercial success in a totally unexpected area. This technology is absolutely integral to the way people all over the world use computers, printers, televisions and telephones. Indeed, it is now hard to imagine a world without WiFi and IT specialists predict that there will soon be more than one billion WiFi devices worldwide. She said that as of mid-2010 the WiFi patent had already netted CSIRO an estimated $250 million, which is being ploughed back into research and development via CSIRO's Science and Industry Endowment Fund. It is predicted to ultimately bring CSIRO upwards of $1 billion.


To create the economic booms of the future we need to increase our investment in research and innovation. But we also need to increase our support for maths and science teaching in our schools and universities. I share the concerns of many that participation in maths and science education is declining and that the government's commitment is flagging. Australia ranks in the bottom half of OECD countries for the number of university graduates with science or engineering degrees. Consequently, I am also very concerned at the measures announced in the MYEFO that would almost double HECS fees for maths and science students. The government recognised the long-term need to encourage students into science and maths by introducing the priority HECS rates for science and maths in 2009. However, they did not take a long-term approach when they cancelled the priority rates last year. How could science and maths be a national priority three years ago and yet not now?


When wealthy mining companies get close to $9 billion a year in handouts and tax concessions we should not be taking $400 million from science and maths education to balance the budget. The $400 million saving is a false economy if it means that science and maths are not taken up by our young people. Following government cuts to the Science in Schools program, the government is taking science education in the wrong direction. I am also concerned that the government used the report of the Bradley review to justify the HECS increase. HECS fees for sciences and maths were lowered in 2009 when they were made a national priority; however, the Bradley review was completed in December 2008.


My concerns regarding the cuts are echoed by Universities Australia and by the Australian Academy of Science, who have noted that Australia's robust economic future depends upon innovation. This is not the time to withdraw support for the next generation of scientists and mathematicians.


Today the CSIRO announced its winners of the annual science awards. Two of the winners were a brother and sister, who won with solar-themed projects. Ethan Butson, 16, and his sister Macinley, 11, took out the high school and primary sections. The awards attracted more than 6,000 entries, with the top 15 students flown to Melbourne for a science workshop with some of the CSIRO's top science minds. It is young people like Ethan and Macinley who are the future of innovation in Australia and we need to nurture their minds and their careers.


We must spend more on research and science, not less. We must invest more in maths and science in our schools. I intend to be a fierce advocate for the importance of scientific research and the need for it to be adequately funded and supported and I will fight for the future of maths and science in our education system. That is why I support this bill and why I will support any move to increase funding to Australian research.

The SPEAKER
 (21:30):  The agreement reached at the commencement of this parliament for parliamentary reform provided for the Leader of the Opposition or his or her delegate to ask one supplementary question each question time. This proposal was implemented using the flexibility available under standing order 101(b) for the Speaker to permit supplementary questions.


It is my desire to endeavour to make question time more spontaneous, whilst balancing the opportunities available to opposition, government and non-aligned members. With this in mind, from tomorrow I propose to allow up to five supplementary questions on the following basis:


(1) each supplementary question will be limited to 20 seconds notwithstanding the formal time limits;


(2) an answer to a supplementary question will be limited to 1½ minutes notwithstanding the formal time limits;


(3) one supplementary question can be asked by the Leader of the Opposition or his or her delegate specifically, and up to one additional supplementary question can be asked by any opposition member, including the Leader of the Opposition, each day;


(4) up to two supplementary questions can be asked by government private members each day;


(5) when a non-aligned member asks a question, a supplementary question will be permitted;


(6) a supplementary question must not introduce new matter, should not contain any preamble and must arise out of, and refer to, the answer that has been given to the original question;


(7) a supplementary question can be asked in relation to any original question from the same group—that is, opposition, government or non-aligned;


(8) more than one supplementary question can be asked to an original question; and


(9) after any supplementary questions have been asked the call will be given to the side—that is, government or non-government—that did not ask the previous original question.


This proposal will be introduced as a trial to be reviewed at the end of the autumn sittings 2012 with a view to being extended if deemed successful. Copies of this statement are available from the table.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (21:32):  My purpose in speaking tonight is to recognise the winners and the high achievers in the Townsville Australia Day awards. I would like to quickly go through them and tell you who won what and then go back and speak to a couple.


Citizen of the Year was one of the most well deserved recipients in the history of the awards, Garth Harrigan. Community Event of the Year was the fantastic 60th Anniversary of National Service. The Cultural Award was awarded to Connie Hoedt, a ceramic artist. Young Citizen of the Year was Emily Michelle Moore. The Junior Sports Award was to Shelby Green, an 11-year-old BMX rider. The Senior Sports Award went to Penny Palfrey. Sports Administrator Award was to Bill Whitburn, who shared it with Chris Schell, narrowly nudging out Jayne Arlett, who is the managing partner in Townsville Podiatry, and who also saved Townsville Fire, an Australian Women's National Basketball League team, from extinction. That just shows you how good these sports administrators are. The Spirit of Townsville awards went to Warren Hegarty, Gwenda Richardson and Neighbour to Neighbour Townsville.


Australia Day honours in North Queensland also went to Dr Dorothy Gibson-Wilde, who received a Medal of the Order of Australia for services to heritage preservation in Queensland. Anyone who has crossed swords with Dorothy when it comes to the historical village in Townsville will know what they have come up against.


Dr Jon Stephenson, who died a year ago, was awarded a Member in the awards. During the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition in 1958 he became the first Australian to reach the South Pole. Dr Donat Gallagher was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for his services to the arts and education and to the community of Townsville. Finally, Norma Connolly was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for services to the sport of basketball through administration and coaching roles on some 382 occasions. That is what you have to do in Townsville to get nominated for an award.


Citizen of the Year was Garth Harrigan, who serves as chairman of the Townsville and Thuringowa Transport Solutions, or NQ Community Transport. He has been a volunteer since retiring three times in the past 34 years. That we had a nominee in Professor Ajay Rane, who has done women's surgery on a volunteer basis in Tibet and Africa, speaks volumes for what Garth is all about. He is about the community and making it a richer place.


The 60th Anniversary of National Service was a truly great community event, driven locally by local people. Warren Hegarty, who won a Spirit of Townsville Award, is the chairman of the Townsville Nashos. My dad was in the second intake in 1952, when it was only three months. He is still very proud of being a Nasho. Most of the guys there were Vietnam veterans and guys who had served real time and had real experience. It was a great afternoon and a great week. They had a lot to do with it being a truly wonderful community event.


Young Citizen of the Year was Emily Michelle Moore. Not only did she attend the Rotary Youth Enrichment Program and also the International Youth Forum in Missouri, USA, but she also organised, led and contributed in many fundraising events, including those for the Cancer Council, the Leukaemia Foundation and the Abused Child Trust. She was also school captain of Kirwan State High School and a fag paper away from getting an OP1. She is a tremendous girl and she will be someone to watch in future years.


Shelby Green is 11 years old and captain of Australia's BMX squad that went to New Zealand. She was unbeaten in all her rides. She won in Australia but unfortunately lost in New Zealand, but she was captain from Townsville in the sport of BMX.


Penny Palfrey was awarded a Senior Sports Award. Penny holds the world record for the longest ever open water swim, between Little and Grand Cayman islands in June 2011. She also broke the record for swimming the Molokai channel, Hawaii. She has been nominated for the title of World Open Water Swimmer of the year for the fourth year in a row. She also swam between Magnetic Island and Townsville without a cage some 20 times.


Bill Whitburn has worked in Aussie Rules for many years. He is an ADF veteran and a tremendous bloke. Next is Chris Schell, who is involved in netball.



I would like to specifically mention Gwenda Richardson, a tremendous lady who was told by her doctor to get out and walk more. So she went out with her three-legged dog and started picking up rubbish. In a Forrest Gump style of thing she just never stopped. She kept on picking up rubbish and did a wonderful job for Townsville. (Time expired)

Mr Rudd:
 The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:


(1) Yes. Mr Gao was one of Australia's cases of concern submitted to Chinese authorities immediately prior to the 13th Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue, held in Beijing on 20 December 2010. We have not yet received a response from China.


(2) Yes. China's response on (a) was that Mr Gao's case was in the judicial process, and it was therefore not appropriate to comment on his case, and on (b) that Mr Gao was a Chinese citizen and a criminal who had broken Chinese laws, and that China was a country ruled by law and did not welcome outside interference.
