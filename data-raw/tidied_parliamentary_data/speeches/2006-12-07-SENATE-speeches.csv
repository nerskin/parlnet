Leave granted.
—I will only take a minute on this. What we have here again is this government using its numbers in the Senate to crunch through its estimates process. What we still do not have from the government is an indication of the spillover days and those matters. If you look at the program that is being put forward in two estimates hearings by legislative and general purpose, we have maintained both Fridays in the first additional estimates for a spillover day to ensure that the proper processes of the Senate can continue. When you look at the budget estimates, it runs again from the Monday to the Thursday. It appears that the government has maintained its position of ensuring that there will not be a spillover day during that period.
Of course, if you look at the numbers of four committees sitting for two weeks, eight days have been removed from the program. Again, that would have allowed for proper scrutiny in the Senate. Then in the second part of that we also have Wednesdays, for the November period, to Thursdays. Again what we find is that this government is not keen on scrutiny. It is not keen on ensuring that the estimates processes proceed as usual.
The government of course comes back with the tired line that they have increased the available estimates days, but the truth is that they have not. They have ensured that through this process this Senate would have reduced scrutiny available for the estimates in total. I will not take up too much of the Senate’s time on that; I simply wanted to make that point.

Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
This is a very comprehensive report looking into Australia’s capability and capacity to construct bluewater ships for the Royal Australian Navy. Before speaking to the report, may I firstly say a special thank you to the committee secretariat, led by Dr Kathleen Dermody, and also to Ms Lisa Fenn and Dr Richard Grant, who, during the past 12 months, have put an enormous amount of time—into what is a very complex and difficult subject—into preparing what I think is probably the most comprehensive evaluation of Australia’s heavy industrial capability and its capacity to construct large ships that has ever been done.
This comprehensive report looks at the background to naval shipbuilding in Australia, Australia’s capacity to produce large vessels for the Navy, the productivity of Australian naval shipbuilding and repair industry, and the role of state governments and the Commonwealth in assisting that industry. Since the end of the Cold War, the shipbuilding industry right across the world has had to confront many significant challenges, with dwindling demand for naval ships but with increased pressure for more highly sophisticated and expensive systems. Advances in technology are accelerating these changes.
As a nation with an established naval shipbuilding industry, Australia confronts similar problems in sustaining its naval shipbuilding industry. It has been required to address issues created by the fall in demand for ships, the escalating cost of construction and the need to keep pace with advances in technology, as well as the need to develop and retain skilled workers. In a region where there is significant expansion of naval capacity and capability, Australia is looking for an up-to-date naval shipping capability at an affordable price.
The report considers whether Australia’s naval shipbuilding and repair industry can cost-effectively provide the required improved capability at low rates of production. A number of themes dominated the evidence. Over recent decades Australia’s record of the construction of naval vessels has improved quite dramatically. The Anzac class frigate, of which we produced 10, with two for New Zealand, the minehunters and the Collins class submarine, of which we constructed six, are testament to the ability of Australia’s naval shipbuilding industry to produce world-class naval vessels. For example, despite the well-publicised problems with the Collins class submarine, it is now acclaimed and acknowledged as world-class and provides Australia with a technologically, strategically and, may I say, superior asset and deterrent. The recent successes of the Anzacs, the minehunters and the Collins class submarines have established a very solid platform of naval shipbuilding capability comprising, firstly, the prime contractors capable and willing to invest in complex builds and repair projects.
It also includes an extensive and widespread supply network of local industries that have the skills, knowledge, experience and motivation to support the prime contractors. Some are at the cutting edge of world-class developments and are contributing to innovation and driving advances in technology, such as the development of the anechoic tiles for the Collins class submarine, which are substantially unique in reducing noise. All the work is being done by a local Australian firm called CEA, with its high-powered active phased array missile system.
In some cases a defence contract was the stepping stone that set the company on its successful path in opening up export opportunities for further development. A number of naval shipyards located around the Australian coastline have established significant infrastructure. Over many years governments and private enterprise have invested in infrastructure for the naval shipbuilding industry. More recently, there have been substantial investments in infrastructure at Osborne in South Australia and at the Australian Marine Complex at Henderson in my home state of Western Australia. The development of centres of excellence with a common user facility, surrounded by a heavy engineering precinct, point the way forward for the industry.
Australia also has a highly skilled, highly specialised workforce, as required by naval shipbuilding. This base has taken some significant time to develop and is now, more than ever, ready to embark on current and planned projects. Rather than an impediment, forecast labour shortages should be an incentive for innovation and industry investment in training and skills development to ensure that Australia retains and builds on its current knowledge and skills base to support our burgeoning industry.
Built up over time, Australia now has a highly capable naval industrial base that should be preserved and not eroded by short-sightedness or lack of planning. Without doubt, the Australian industry faces challenges, particularly given that overseas countries are unlikely to remove the various forms of assistance, subsidisation and protection that they give to their local naval shipbuilding industries. Put simply, Australia is competing on an unlevel playing field. Even so, the committee found that substantial benefits accrue to an in-country build of future naval ships. Not only does Australia’s naval industrial base have the capacity and potential to contribute to the maintenance of a self-sufficient, self-reliant naval shipbuilding industry but it also contributes in many other ways to Australia’s industrial manufacturing base, the broader economy and Australia’s national defence interest.
To mention just a few of the benefits that accrue from constructing large naval vessels in Australia, I point to the strategic self-reliance for the repair and maintenance of the Navy fleet and commercial shipping. Other benefits include: increased gross domestic product from the capital investment that flows from such projects; enhancement of the labour market; expanded Indigenous research and development, design, production and management capabilities; the acquisition and development of valuable new skills, manufacturing techniques and processes; extensive technology transfers across a broad spectrum of activities; a strengthening belief in Australia’s own capabilities and confidence in its own ability to exploit opportunities as they present themselves; and, finally, an enhanced potential for export.
When taking account of the broad range of factors that are to be considered when acquiring a naval vessel, the committee believes that it is in Australia’s national interest to maintain a viable naval shipbuilding and repair industry here in Australia. This requires a commitment by the government to have Australia’s naval vessels constructed in Australia and for the government and Defence to adopt measures that would ensure that the industry remains efficient, innovative and competitive. The committee, however, was concerned about the lack of data that Defence makes available on its major acquisition projects; thus, it believes that accurate costings on all aspects of a ship’s construction and its through-life support must be done which are measurable, transparent and based on detailed analysis on the best benchmarks available.
The committee suggested that, because of Defence’s dominance in the marketplace, it should recognise and use its influence to assist industry to gain greater efficiencies and perform better. Based on substantial evidence, the committee was of the view that Defence would achieve greater efficiencies through a more coherent and strategic approach to planning. With this in mind, the committee supported the call for a strategic plan that would, in particular, address the peaks and troughs in demand for Australian vessels. The committee rejected the notion that measures cannot be taken to more effectively moderate the fluctuations in demand without adversely affecting Defence capability. Clearly, long-term strategic planning is required to address this problem. The committee also recommended that Defence provide more detail in the Defence Capability Plan and include information that provides a much clearer indication of its future acquisition program and timetable. The committee accepts that the document can only be as good as the quality of the strategic planning it represents, which reinforces the importance of Defence placing the highest priority on strategic planning.
I thank the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and the DMO—in particular, Dr Gumley—for supporting the committee in its investigations. We undertook a substantial investigation into commercial shipbuilding in South Korea and naval shipbuilding across the United States, which was greatly edifying in terms of looking at the capacity and capability of our near neighbours. I thank the members of the committee—in particular, Senator Mark Bishop, Senator Hutchins, Senator Trood and Senator Payne—who participated in a very time-consuming and deep investigation into Australia’s capacity to construct and commission large bluewater naval ships.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee</title>",COMMITTEES,23,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2006-12-07,"—I rise to make a few remarks about the report that has just been tabled by the Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, Senator Johnston. Since this inquiry’s inception, it has been hoped that it would better inform the parliament on a potentially significant part of Australia’s manufacturing industry. The stimulus for the inquiry was the government’s decision to build three air warfare destroyers in Australia. These are to be followed by two amphibious ships which, at this stage, are of unknown construction, design and location. These are very large ships, the likes of which have not been built in Australia for decades, so naturally there are questions about industry capacity and cost relativities. The purpose of the inquiry, however, was not to delve into the strategic decisions to build these types of vessels. Those were government decisions, and they were a given; hence the committee’s strict concentration on its limited terms of reference, which were essentially economic in nature.
I have appended to the report my own views on the subject. Whilst my views are certainly not inconsistent with the broader report, there are some matters of emphasis that are worth considering. I will therefore make the following points for the record. We on this side believe that, just as we have a vibrant small shipbuilding industry, we should also be able to develop more at the heavy or larger end. We have the skills, the workforce and a very capable heavy engineering sector. We also need to boost our manufacturing sector and, in that respect, the defence industry is potentially a key. The nature of shipbuilding has changed. We no longer have big yards, but flexible fabricators of many tasks—some offshore, some small ship fabricators, some involved in ship repair and fabrication, and some that manufacture mining equipment and the like. The old model of large yards doing all work on site is dead all around the world, and few can hope to compete with China, India and South Korea at the large end of the commercial shipbuilding market.
It is also clear that, if we are to have a capacity, it must be limited to one central assembly yard—and modular sections from a competitive supply market. We note that this trend is already emerging, and South Australia, in a de facto sense, appears to be the location chosen by government for this central assembly point—although there are very useful developments in terms of a joint user facility in Western Australia.
One of the most difficult issues in naval shipbuilding is that it is surrounded by a range of assertions and shibboleths, including: that self-sufficiency is needed, that naval ships are somehow different from commercial ships, that defence security justifies all sorts of expense, that all governments protect their naval industry and that there are large ongoing economic spin-offs. These considerations, in my view, are only relevant to a degree. In making a decision to have a local build, several matters need to be considered. Steel fabrication is only 20 per cent of the value of naval ships these days. The biggest portion, by value, is weaponry systems, systems integration and fit-out.
Competitive costs are fundamental, but what is the exact premium if we are going to have a local build? What is the state of the economy? Can it sustain large ad hoc investments? What is the state of the international shipbuilding market? What is the status of our alliances with respect to intellectual property and security? What is the state of our heavy engineering industry? Is it capable? Is it stretched? Is there spare capacity? What is the status of the labour market? Do we have the manpower and do we have the right skills mix, particularly at a technical and engineering level? Putting nationalism aside, these are rational questions that need sensible, calculated and verifiable answers.
The biggest single problem with Defence procurement is that Defence is a monopsony—that is, a single or sole purchaser. The history of Defence procurement is one of industry capture, inefficiency, poor specification, overspending and serious time delays. On top of that, purchases are often ad hoc and of a limited time span. Our past naval shipbuilding is just another example of that, and the responsibility for that poor state of affairs really needs to be sheeted home to government.
In my view, there are three critical factors for a viable industry on a long-term basis: firstly, continuity of Defence demand; secondly, long product runs, which give you economies of scale; and, thirdly, long-term planning. I believe the government has failed all of these critical needs. The decision on new ships should have been made five or even seven years ago. The mix of ships should have been more numerous for economies of scale purchases. Plans should already be on the drawing board for the next generation of ships.
It does seem clear that, with the frigates project at least, a sound level of cost effectiveness might have been achieved, but only because we produced 10 units—that is, we got the savings on the production run through economies of scale because of the volume of production. That again is the experience all around the world with commercial shipping. It applies equally to naval shipping. What we have here is a decision for just three AWDs and two LHDs.
Through sheer experience we know these projects, in isolation, cannot be viable. We would certainly like to see the economic analysis and the benchmarking which has been done, if any has been done. We do not decry the decision to build in Australia. But it is simply tragic that a serious effort has not been made to ensure the re-establishment of a long-term industry as part of that plan. To be blunt, responsibility stops there with the government.
The risk is that these enormous investment decisions, totalling billions of dollars, have been made solely on the ground of local political advantage. If the government is concerned about the excessive premium for local building, that is the direct result of its short-term decision making and limited vision in this area. This inquiry, despite its limitations, has shown that given certain conditions a competitive naval shipbuilding industry might be viable in Australia, and that is assuming that the economic modelling has been done. If it has not, it should be. Taxpayers deserve better than to have billions of dollars thrown at projects of dubious value and excessive cost.
We believe that model should be designed now and applied rigorously to both these projects and future projects. Further, we believe that that model should be totally transparent and subject to full audit and public scrutiny. If we do not knuckle down on this issue now and do that type of analysis, we will continue to be plagued by the same problem for another generation. In that context, the opposition was pleased to sign up to the report and make it unanimous.
My final comments go to the considerable assistance provided by the committee secretary, Dr Dermody, and the two research officers, Dr Richard Grant and Ms Lisa Fenn. They had extensive work to do in preparation, research, analysis and organisation. Their input has been valuable. It should be noted on the public record that they have provided fine support to the chair of the committee and to members of the committee who were, by and large, actively involved in nearly all deliberations. Finally, I wish to also support the comments of the chair and acknowledge the support of the Minister for Defence, the Prime Minister and the head of the DMO, Dr Gumley, who were sufficiently prepared to recommend funding for the committee to visit the United States and South Korea to examine local shipyards on the ground.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee</title>",COMMITTEES,23,1

Before speaking to the report, may I firstly say a special thank you to the committee secretariat, led by Dr Kathleen Dermody, and also to Ms Lisa Fenn and Dr Richard Grant, who, during the past 12 months, have put an enormous amount of time—into what is a very complex and difficult subject—into preparing what I think is probably the most comprehensive evaluation of Australia’s heavy industrial capability and its capacity to construct large ships that has ever been done.
This comprehensive report looks at the background to naval shipbuilding in Australia, Australia’s capacity to produce large vessels for the Navy, the productivity of Australian naval shipbuilding and repair industry, and the role of state governments and the Commonwealth in assisting that industry. Since the end of the Cold War, the shipbuilding industry right across the world has had to confront many significant challenges, with dwindling demand for naval ships but with increased pressure for more highly sophisticated and expensive systems. Advances in technology are accelerating these changes.
As a nation with an established naval shipbuilding industry, Australia confronts similar problems in sustaining its naval shipbuilding industry. It has been required to address issues created by the fall in demand for ships, the escalating cost of construction and the need to keep pace with advances in technology, as well as the need to develop and retain skilled workers. In a region where there is significant expansion of naval capacity and capability, Australia is looking for an up-to-date naval shipping capability at an affordable price.
The report considers whether Australia’s naval shipbuilding and repair industry can cost-effectively provide the required improved capability at low rates of production. A number of themes dominated the evidence. Over recent decades Australia’s record of the construction of naval vessels has improved quite dramatically. The Anzac class frigate, of which we produced 10, with two for New Zealand, the minehunters and the Collins class submarine, of which we constructed six, are testament to the ability of Australia’s naval shipbuilding industry to produce world-class naval vessels. For example, despite the well-publicised problems with the Collins class submarine, it is now acclaimed and acknowledged as world-class and provides Australia with a technologically, strategically and, may I say, superior asset and deterrent. The recent successes of the Anzacs, the minehunters and the Collins class submarines have established a very solid platform of naval shipbuilding capability comprising, firstly, the prime contractors capable and willing to invest in complex builds and repair projects.
It also includes an extensive and widespread supply network of local industries that have the skills, knowledge, experience and motivation to support the prime contractors. Some are at the cutting edge of world-class developments and are contributing to innovation and driving advances in technology, such as the development of the anechoic tiles for the Collins class submarine, which are substantially unique in reducing noise. All the work is being done by a local Australian firm called CEA, with its high-powered active phased array missile system.
In some cases a defence contract was the stepping stone that set the company on its successful path in opening up export opportunities for further development. A number of naval shipyards located around the Australian coastline have established significant infrastructure. Over many years governments and private enterprise have invested in infrastructure for the naval shipbuilding industry. More recently, there have been substantial investments in infrastructure at Osborne in South Australia and at the Australian Marine Complex at Henderson in my home state of Western Australia. The development of centres of excellence with a common user facility, surrounded by a heavy engineering precinct, point the way forward for the industry.
Australia also has a highly skilled, highly specialised workforce, as required by naval shipbuilding. This base has taken some significant time to develop and is now, more than ever, ready to embark on current and planned projects. Rather than an impediment, forecast labour shortages should be an incentive for innovation and industry investment in training and skills development to ensure that Australia retains and builds on its current knowledge and skills base to support our burgeoning industry.
Built up over time, Australia now has a highly capable naval industrial base that should be preserved and not eroded by short-sightedness or lack of planning. Without doubt, the Australian industry faces challenges, particularly given that overseas countries are unlikely to remove the various forms of assistance, subsidisation and protection that they give to their local naval shipbuilding industries. Put simply, Australia is competing on an unlevel playing field. Even so, the committee found that substantial benefits accrue to an in-country build of future naval ships. Not only does Australia’s naval industrial base have the capacity and potential to contribute to the maintenance of a self-sufficient, self-reliant naval shipbuilding industry but it also contributes in many other ways to Australia’s industrial manufacturing base, the broader economy and Australia’s national defence interest.
To mention just a few of the benefits that accrue from constructing large naval vessels in Australia, I point to the strategic self-reliance for the repair and maintenance of the Navy fleet and commercial shipping. Other benefits include: increased gross domestic product from the capital investment that flows from such projects; enhancement of the labour market; expanded Indigenous research and development, design, production and management capabilities; the acquisition and development of valuable new skills, manufacturing techniques and processes; extensive technology transfers across a broad spectrum of activities; a strengthening belief in Australia’s own capabilities and confidence in its own ability to exploit opportunities as they present themselves; and, finally, an enhanced potential for export.
When taking account of the broad range of factors that are to be considered when acquiring a naval vessel, the committee believes that it is in Australia’s national interest to maintain a viable naval shipbuilding and repair industry here in Australia. This requires a commitment by the government to have Australia’s naval vessels constructed in Australia and for the government and Defence to adopt measures that would ensure that the industry remains efficient, innovative and competitive. The committee, however, was concerned about the lack of data that Defence makes available on its major acquisition projects; thus, it believes that accurate costings on all aspects of a ship’s construction and its through-life support must be done which are measurable, transparent and based on detailed analysis on the best benchmarks available.
The committee suggested that, because of Defence’s dominance in the marketplace, it should recognise and use its influence to assist industry to gain greater efficiencies and perform better. Based on substantial evidence, the committee was of the view that Defence would achieve greater efficiencies through a more coherent and strategic approach to planning. With this in mind, the committee supported the call for a strategic plan that would, in particular, address the peaks and troughs in demand for Australian vessels. The committee rejected the notion that measures cannot be taken to more effectively moderate the fluctuations in demand without adversely affecting Defence capability. Clearly, long-term strategic planning is required to address this problem. The committee also recommended that Defence provide more detail in the Defence Capability Plan and include information that provides a much clearer indication of its future acquisition program and timetable. The committee accepts that the document can only be as good as the quality of the strategic planning it represents, which reinforces the importance of Defence placing the highest priority on strategic planning.
I thank the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and the DMO—in particular, Dr Gumley—for supporting the committee in its investigations. We undertook a substantial investigation into commercial shipbuilding in South Korea and naval shipbuilding across the United States, which was greatly edifying in terms of looking at the capacity and capability of our near neighbours. I thank the members of the committee—in particular, Senator Mark Bishop, Senator Hutchins, Senator Trood and Senator Payne—who participated in a very time-consuming and deep investigation into Australia’s capacity to construct and commission large bluewater naval ships.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,23,2
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2006-12-07,"—I rise to make a few remarks about the report that has just been tabled by the Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, Senator Johnston. Since this inquiry’s inception, it has been hoped that it would better inform the parliament on a potentially significant part of Australia’s manufacturing industry. The stimulus for the inquiry was the government’s decision to build three air warfare destroyers in Australia. These are to be followed by two amphibious ships which, at this stage, are of unknown construction, design and location. These are very large ships, the likes of which have not been built in Australia for decades, so naturally there are questions about industry capacity and cost relativities. The purpose of the inquiry, however, was not to delve into the strategic decisions to build these types of vessels. Those were government decisions, and they were a given; hence the committee’s strict concentration on its limited terms of reference, which were essentially economic in nature.
I have appended to the report my own views on the subject. Whilst my views are certainly not inconsistent with the broader report, there are some matters of emphasis that are worth considering. I will therefore make the following points for the record. We on this side believe that, just as we have a vibrant small shipbuilding industry, we should also be able to develop more at the heavy or larger end. We have the skills, the workforce and a very capable heavy engineering sector. We also need to boost our manufacturing sector and, in that respect, the defence industry is potentially a key. The nature of shipbuilding has changed. We no longer have big yards, but flexible fabricators of many tasks—some offshore, some small ship fabricators, some involved in ship repair and fabrication, and some that manufacture mining equipment and the like. The old model of large yards doing all work on site is dead all around the world, and few can hope to compete with China, India and South Korea at the large end of the commercial shipbuilding market.
It is also clear that, if we are to have a capacity, it must be limited to one central assembly yard—and modular sections from a competitive supply market. We note that this trend is already emerging, and South Australia, in a de facto sense, appears to be the location chosen by government for this central assembly point—although there are very useful developments in terms of a joint user facility in Western Australia.
One of the most difficult issues in naval shipbuilding is that it is surrounded by a range of assertions and shibboleths, including: that self-sufficiency is needed, that naval ships are somehow different from commercial ships, that defence security justifies all sorts of expense, that all governments protect their naval industry and that there are large ongoing economic spin-offs. These considerations, in my view, are only relevant to a degree. In making a decision to have a local build, several matters need to be considered. Steel fabrication is only 20 per cent of the value of naval ships these days. The biggest portion, by value, is weaponry systems, systems integration and fit-out.
Competitive costs are fundamental, but what is the exact premium if we are going to have a local build? What is the state of the economy? Can it sustain large ad hoc investments? What is the state of the international shipbuilding market? What is the status of our alliances with respect to intellectual property and security? What is the state of our heavy engineering industry? Is it capable? Is it stretched? Is there spare capacity? What is the status of the labour market? Do we have the manpower and do we have the right skills mix, particularly at a technical and engineering level? Putting nationalism aside, these are rational questions that need sensible, calculated and verifiable answers.
The biggest single problem with Defence procurement is that Defence is a monopsony—that is, a single or sole purchaser. The history of Defence procurement is one of industry capture, inefficiency, poor specification, overspending and serious time delays. On top of that, purchases are often ad hoc and of a limited time span. Our past naval shipbuilding is just another example of that, and the responsibility for that poor state of affairs really needs to be sheeted home to government.
In my view, there are three critical factors for a viable industry on a long-term basis: firstly, continuity of Defence demand; secondly, long product runs, which give you economies of scale; and, thirdly, long-term planning. I believe the government has failed all of these critical needs. The decision on new ships should have been made five or even seven years ago. The mix of ships should have been more numerous for economies of scale purchases. Plans should already be on the drawing board for the next generation of ships.
It does seem clear that, with the frigates project at least, a sound level of cost effectiveness might have been achieved, but only because we produced 10 units—that is, we got the savings on the production run through economies of scale because of the volume of production. That again is the experience all around the world with commercial shipping. It applies equally to naval shipping. What we have here is a decision for just three AWDs and two LHDs.
Through sheer experience we know these projects, in isolation, cannot be viable. We would certainly like to see the economic analysis and the benchmarking which has been done, if any has been done. We do not decry the decision to build in Australia. But it is simply tragic that a serious effort has not been made to ensure the re-establishment of a long-term industry as part of that plan. To be blunt, responsibility stops there with the government.
The risk is that these enormous investment decisions, totalling billions of dollars, have been made solely on the ground of local political advantage. If the government is concerned about the excessive premium for local building, that is the direct result of its short-term decision making and limited vision in this area. This inquiry, despite its limitations, has shown that given certain conditions a competitive naval shipbuilding industry might be viable in Australia, and that is assuming that the economic modelling has been done. If it has not, it should be. Taxpayers deserve better than to have billions of dollars thrown at projects of dubious value and excessive cost.
We believe that model should be designed now and applied rigorously to both these projects and future projects. Further, we believe that that model should be totally transparent and subject to full audit and public scrutiny. If we do not knuckle down on this issue now and do that type of analysis, we will continue to be plagued by the same problem for another generation. In that context, the opposition was pleased to sign up to the report and make it unanimous.
My final comments go to the considerable assistance provided by the committee secretary, Dr Dermody, and the two research officers, Dr Richard Grant and Ms Lisa Fenn. They had extensive work to do in preparation, research, analysis and organisation. Their input has been valuable. It should be noted on the public record that they have provided fine support to the chair of the committee and to members of the committee who were, by and large, actively involved in nearly all deliberations. Finally, I wish to also support the comments of the chair and acknowledge the support of the Minister for Defence, the Prime Minister and the head of the DMO, Dr Gumley, who were sufficiently prepared to recommend funding for the committee to visit the United States and South Korea to examine local shipyards on the ground.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,23,2
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-12-07,"—I seek leave to speak to the motion for the cut-off exemption. I indicate that I will speak only for a very short time, approximately 10 minutes. I also advise that, as a consequence, I will not use my 10 minutes or so for the wheat bill. I withdraw myself from that list of speakers. I regard this motion as a more important issue in chamber management and I am sure there are many from the Labor Party who can deal adequately with the wheat marketing bill debate.
Leave granted.
—Did you want the motion resubmitted for consideration?
—I just want to speak on it. We would normally seek a division on it, but we will not in this instance, given that it is clear we are opposed to the motion. I am sure the Greens and Democrats, and everyone from the opposition, are opposed to the motion.
—So you are not seeking a recommittal?
—No, given that it is more appropriate that the time be used for speaking. Through this motion the government seeks to foreshorten debate through the day on a range of bills. What the time allotment does is ensure that bills that would otherwise take considerable time to deal with are going to be dealt with very shortly with a guillotine motion, and then we will move through each bill. That means that people will not be able to speak on bills that they might wish to speak on and then deal with them in the committee stage in an adequate way.
The government has mismanaged the program again. It seems to be more in sorrow than anything else that I am back here again complaining about the government’s mismanagement and its inability to deal with the legislative program in a realistic way to ensure that people can deal with their legislation and allow senators to move amendments and deal adequately with the committee stage of bills. This government has form in this. Since this government has got control of the Senate from 1 July 2005, it is not the first time they have moved a guillotine motion. They have also moved gags. They have moved the guillotine motion between five and six times—I think this might be the sixth time. I am not going to be hypocritical about the Labor Party. In government it moved similar motions, but it stands in stark contrast to what this government is doing.
This government is ensuring that proper scrutiny in this Senate is not able to take place on a range of legislation at both the second reading and the committee stages, not only in using the guillotine, as they have, but also in the way they now address the committee processes where otherwise time would be able to be utilised in examining a bill in a Senate committee. This government has now collapsed the Senate committees into one committee. They have then taken a process driven by their own need to ensure that Senate committees are foreshortened and we only have a reference for a short time to deal with the committee stage of a bill. There is then inadequate time for proper consideration of the Senate committee before bringing the bill forward to the Senate. In compacting the program, they have ensured that adequate time would not be provided for the committee stage of a bill to deal with the range of amendments.
The government has not only taken that process; there are also a number of other abuses. Not only do we now have short inquiries and short references of committees, but in question time we are now averaging about four or five questions, whereas before 1 July we averaged six or seven questions. They have also ensured that estimates are reduced by up to eight days. Today we have seen the government put out its estimates program for next year—with the same outcome. When you start to pile one Senate abuse upon another you get to a position whereby you have managed to ensure that the proper scrutiny by this Senate of bills and legislation and of references by senators is simply curtailed. You are then turning this place into nothing more than a sausage factory where you grind legislation through.
In the last two weeks the opposition has ensured that there would be ample time. We have given up time on Tuesday nights and Thursday nights, and we sat last Friday. This week we again sat late on Tuesday night, and we will clearly sit late tonight, to ensure that the legislative program is being dealt with. But you are still not managing the program in a fair and effective way to ensure proper scrutiny of bills. That is an abuse of the Senate and you continue commit it again and again.
The Prime Minister’s, words—and I have used his words a couple of times—confirm that Mr John Howard cannot be trusted. When the Queensland Senate result was confirmed—in other words, he got control of the Senate—he said:
I want to assure the Australian people that the government will use its majority in the new Senate very carefully, very wisely and not provocatively.
We intend to do the things we’ve promised the Australian people we would do, but we don’t intend to allow this unexpected but welcome majority in the Senate to go to our heads.
Five days out from 1 July he said:
I am not going to allow this unexpected majority to go to my head. I want to make that clear. I am not going to do that because that would be disrespectful to the public and it will be disrespectful to the robust nature of the Senate even with the coalition majority.
That was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 25 June 2005.
But after taking control of the Senate, the government is doing the range of things I have talked about, procedurally and administratively curtailing the operation of Senate and using the guillotine again to ensure that its legislative program is pushed through the Senate with very little scrutiny. They leave the tougher bills until the end of the program so that those tougher bills, that would otherwise have longer debates, have that debate curtailed. There will be only a short debate on those.
I have complained about the processes of the government a number of times and it is not going to persuade those on the other side. They are going to dutifully fall in line with the government, pass this motion and ensure that it will have its desired effect of reducing proper scrutiny by the Senate. The government will say that it finds time being wasted on committee debates. That is a matter for the government to manage by ensuring that its legislation is good legislation. This government has not been implementing good law. In my portfolio area they have brought bills forward, amended them and then amended them again on the floor, soaking up considerable time which would otherwise be utilised for debates. We now find that we have to spend longer in the committee stage to deal with those issues.
But the time is simply not available, because this government is ensuring that important bills such as the anti-money laundering bill will have very little time available and, similarly, the wheat marketing bill. Unfortunately, the longer I speak will also mean less time for those bills, so I will not go on for my full 20 minutes, as I indicated, because it will foreshorten the debate that people can have on important legislation. It is important that this point be made, though, because this government is abusing its majority and it needs to be reined in. This government needs to stick to the promise Mr John Howard made to the Australian public and this Senate that it would use its majority carefully and respectfully and ensure that the full processes of the Senate would be followed. It is saying one thing in the media and in public, but the processes in here do not reflect that and it should be shamed for it.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,BUSINESS,24,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2006-12-07,"—by leave—I wish to make a short statement. The Australian Greens oppose this motion because it restricts the opportunity for debate, as we have seen so frequently by this government. In particular, I want to address the issue of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006 that is being dealt with in this motion. There are only two hours allowed for debate: one hour for the three opposition parties in here to state their positions and then one hour to deal with 18 amendments. This is a nearly 300-page bill, which gives the power to banks to give all the financial details of every customer they consider to be a risk, including every Arab customer, to government authorities to investigate whether they have been financing terrorism.
This bill overrides antidiscrimination law. It says to banks: ‘It’s okay. You can provide all the info on anyone you think sounds different, anyone who is transferring any money to Iran’, which could be perfectly legitimate for their business. As we have seen, a number of businesses have had all their funding frozen as a result of banks responding to this legislation. This piece of legislation impacts on the privacy of all Australians. It overrides antidiscrimination law, and the government is proposing that we deal with amendments for an hour—one hour to discuss whether all Australians should have their privacy invaded as banks choose to give information about them and their financial transactions to government authorities to investigate whether they are engaged in terrorism; to turn off their bank accounts and stop them accessing their accounts until the government can do these investigations.
We have seen a number of businesses which just happen to have the same name as an obscure former terrorist group in Peru shut down because of this already. We saw it just last week: an Iranian restaurateur’s finances were cut off because her bank had referred her and stopped her accessing her finances. She was just buying dates from Iran. This is the impact that this legislation is going to have on people’s lives. The bill has 300 pages. The financing of terrorism is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with, and we can get it right.
The Australian Greens—and I am sure other parties—are in a position to support legislation that is sensibly regulated to ensure that there is no financing of terrorism. But there are significant amendments that need to be made to this legislation in order for that to occur, and the government is allowing an hour for that. That is what this motion does, and that is why the Australian Greens are opposing it.
I indicate also that this motion allows less than three hours of debate on one of the most significant changes to environment legislation in the Commonwealth. The effect of this legislation is to restrict debate on substantial issues whether they be about the financing of terrorism, the privacy and the rights of customers in banks and financial institutions across this country or the most significant changes and attacks on environment legislation at Commonwealth level ever. That is why the Australian Greens oppose this motion. We are members of parliament who have been elected into the Senate to have debate and discussion on these issues, and to seek to find the best way forward. This motion stops us from doing that, and the Australian Greens oppose it.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,BUSINESS,24,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2006-12-07,"—I am very pleased by the action the government has taken to transfer the veto on the international marketing of wheat from AWBI to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for a period of six months. By so doing, the government has provided a solution to the immediate problem for West Australian wheat farmers, who face financial disadvantage under the current arrangements, whereby the Australian Wheat Board effectively has the power of veto over international sales. As has been said by other speakers, WA largely produces wheat for export. Were the WA farmers to sell their wheat through AWB this year, their financial returns—given the severe drought they face—would be less than would be the case were they able to sell it through the CBH or Co-operative Bulk Handling.
The transfer of the veto to the minister will be for a period of only six months, which will allow the government an appropriate period of time to fully consider the long-term future of AWB’s management of the national wheat pool. As I understand it, the review of the management of the international wheat marketing system will be done in full cooperation with the wheat growers of this country, which will ensure that the final decision arrived at is a consensus of both the government and the growers of Australia.
There has been concern expressed over the last few years about the way Australian wheat is marketed internationally. Earlier this year I attended the annual general meeting of the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia, where the sentiment was very strongly against the maintenance of the single desk marketing operation under the auspices of AWB.
Members of the PGA strongly believed that the single desk was denying the wheat growers of Western Australia the opportunity to sell their wheat at maximum return around the world through other agencies such as CBH. However, subsequently it has become apparent to me that there is a division of opinion amongst wheat growers in Western Australia and that those in the West Australian Farmers Federation, or WAFF, are not necessarily in agreement with the PGA on the subject of the abolition of the single desk as a marketing tool.
Furthermore, in November I received correspondence from the wheat exporters of Australia, a group which represents farmers involved in the wheat export trade, which made some criticisms of both the AWB and AWBI which I do feel warrant further evaluation. This wheat exporters group wrote to express concern about the relationship between AWB Ltd and AWBI in terms of the profit which is derived from providing services to AWBI, as well as concern about the fact that AWBI is exempt under the present regulatory regime from: (1) having to obtain export licences from the Wheat Export Authority, (2) the requirements of the Trade Practices Act and therefore ACCC oversight of its terms in dealings with its client base, and (3) the Financial Services Reform Act. They were also concerned about the fact that, under section 57 of the Wheat Marketing Act, AWBI has a complete veto over the government regulator, which is the Wheat Export Authority, in granting bulk export licences to any other entity, including individual wheat growers seeking to sell their own wheat, and that they must be consulted on container load shipments, thus meaning that advance commercial knowledge is given to them so as to effectively gazump any prospective sale or frighten the potential customer off through the suggestion of future supply problems.
While I do not pretend in any way to be an expert on the wheat industry or the marketing of wheat, it seems clear from the views which have been put to me over this year that there are some problems in this industry. Accordingly I believe the decision of the government to review this industry over a six-month period is a very wise one and will enable a full assessment to be made of the needs of the growers marketing wheat internationally so that, if appropriate, the wheat marketing system can be reformed.
One solution which is fairly consistently put forward by Western Australian growers is that, while the single desk has been a good marketing mechanism and should be retained, at the same time there is a case to be made for some flexibility in its operation to enable growers such as those in Western Australia to sell their wheat in individual spot markets at times. Because of the serious financial consequences which would face Western Australian growers if this legislation were not passed without delay, I urge all my colleagues to support it—bearing in mind that the whole system of wheat marketing is to be reviewed over the next six months by the government. I commend this legislation to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,25,1
"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2006-12-07,"—As a wheat grower from the central west in New South Wales, I am only too aware of how important this issue is to wheat growers right around the state and right around the country. I am a very strong supporter of the single desk. I accept that there are diverse views on this issue, but it is certainly my belief that the majority of wheat growers are very supportive of retaining the single desk. While the majority of growers are supportive of retaining that, I will certainly continue to support retaining the single desk. This is about growers and what growers want.
The reasons that the single desk was set up certainly still exist today. As my leader, Senator Boswell, said yesterday, the single desk is defined by five clear principles. I think it is important that we just take a moment to look at those again. A single desk entity is: grower owned, the operator of the national pool, the holder of the export veto, the buyer of last resort, and it provides security of payment for growers. As my leader also said yesterday, these principles must only be changed with the clear support of a majority of growers.
The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2006 gives the veto power to the minister for six months. It is a very sensible temporary solution to allow us to deal with the issues in Western Australia of drought and the growers’ cash flow requirements over there. I would also point out though that it does not compromise the position of growers who have already delivered to the pool. It is certainly The Nationals who have made sure that growers are able to have their say on the future of the single desk and the future of their industry. There is no doubt that there is a push out there towards complete deregulation. There is also a push out there towards changes to the current system.
I think it is very sensible that The Nationals have now secured a three-month period of consultation where growers can have their say. This is an opportunity for growers to have their say, to say loud and clear what they want for the future of their industry. I urge growers: if you do not want deregulation, if you want to make sure that you keep the single desk, then you have to rise up and tell us. Your future is in your hands—it is you, the growers, out there who now need to come together and tell this government what it is that you want for the future of your industry. The Nationals will absolutely, without doubt, continue to fight for growers. But the growers’ voice, your voice, has to be heard loud and clear. We can fight for you. We can continue to fight for you, and we will do that, but we need to make sure that your voice is heard so that the future of the industry is the future that you want.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,25,1
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2006-12-07,"—The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2006 establishes new arrangements for controlling the export of wheat from Australia. Therefore, as a wheat grower, I declare a personal interest in the legislation.
This bill was flagged by Prime Minister Howard following the tabling last week of the report of the Cole inquiry into AWB Ltd and AWB International’s corruption of the United Nations oil for food program. It puts into place the Prime Minister’s promise that, in formulating its response, the government’s dominant concern would be the interests of Australian wheat growers and that the federal government would consult widely with growers and the industry before finalising any changes to wheat export marketing arrangements.
Australia has a long history of regulating wheat marketing. The Australian Wheat Board operated from 1915 to 1921 and from 1939 to 1947 under wartime emergency provisions to acquire and market the Australian wheat crop under a pooling arrangement to ensure price stability for growers and appropriate management of this vital foodstuff during wartime. However, it was in 1948 that legislation established the Australian Wheat Board to have a similar marketing role for the first time in peacetime.
My late father, who died in 1999 in his 94th year, was instrumental in this postwar establishment of the Australian Wheat Board. As President of the then Australian Wheatgrowers Federation, which more recently has become the Grains Council of Australia, he led the negotiations with the Chifley government in the immediate postwar period for AWB’s establishment and the operation of the single desk for wheat marketing. This was consequent on his role as one of the leaders in establishing, in the early 1930s, an organisation to represent wheat growers in South Australia, devastated by the collapse in wheat prices during the Great Depression, who were further ripped off by market manipulation by grain merchants. He saw the benefit of the single desk and fought hard and successfully for its permanent establishment after World War II.
The release of the Cole report would have been a sad day for him if he were still alive. A principled and ethical man, he would have been devastated by the antics of AWB Ltd and AWB International revealed in that report—organisations he helped create, albeit operating now as listed commercial entities rather than as a statutory authority. The release of the Cole report has clear implications for the operation of the single desk system for Australian wheat exports and this has caused significant concern to growers, both immediately and in the longer term.
The bill transfers from AWB International to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, until 30 June 2007, the right to veto applications for bulk wheat export from exporters other than AWB International. It is a temporary measure to address current concerns in the industry about the wheat marketing arrangements, particularly in Western Australia, where there are fewer domestic marketing options than in the eastern states. It is also an inevitable consequence of AWB’s unacceptable behaviour.
South Australian growers have discussed with me their concerns about the impact of changes to the single desk system on the wheat pool and prices. Their concerns are compounded by the current drought resulting in lower yields this season, rendering it essential that the government’s decisions ensure that maximum and sustained financial stability is available to growers.
Currently, Australia exports wheat to more than 40 countries and, although we grow only about three per cent of the world’s wheat, our total wheat exports represent around 15 per cent of the world wheat trade annually. The Australian government has worked hard to maintain the single desk arrangement as part of all trade agreements, such as those in the World Trade Organisation and the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement, on the grounds that it offers a transparent and commercial operation. The veto powers conferred by this bill do not represent a change to the Australian government’s single desk policy. For the six months to 30 June 2007, during which the minister will hold the veto, AWB International will remain exempt from requiring export consent from the Wheat Export Authority and will continue to be the buyer of last resort.
In a corrupted international wheat market, where most other exporting countries substantially subsidise their growers and where, in a number of instances, there is a single purchasing authority, I believe the single desk continues to provide benefits to Australian wheat growers. This view is reinforced by the fact that growers and marketers from other countries have lobbied hard over many years for the dismantling of the single desk. Clearly they see it as an advantage to Australian growers. Hence, if a majority of growers seek its retention during the next three months of consultation, I will support them. However, careful consideration will need to be given to the way in which the single desk and the veto are to be administered in the longer term. It is no longer tenable for them automatically to be the bailiwick of AWB Ltd.
This legislation will provide the Australian government with the opportunity to address the current and urgent concerns of wheat growers while allowing the government to develop future long-term wheat marketing arrangements, taking into account all of these issues. I commend to the Senate the speedy passage of the bill.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,25,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2006-12-07,"—The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2006 will bring the most significant change to the wheat industry and its selling arrangements since the deregulation of the domestic market back in 1989—legislation which I also spoke to at that time. The purpose of this bill is to amend the act through the transfer, on a temporary basis, of the right to veto bulk wheat export applications from AWB International to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The transfer will be effective until 30 June 2007. This is achieved through including a new part in the act.
These changes do not amend the functions or objectives of the Wheat Export Authority or AWB International’s authority to engage in export activities. The WEA will continue to control the export of bulk wheat, but now requires the agreement of the minister for each application. The changes mean that the WEA will not be required during the period to 30 June 2007 to have written approval from AWB International before making a decision on bulk export applications. In cases where the minister does not agree with the WEA, he is able to direct it to approve or reject the export applications. As the minister’s second reading speech says:
The movement of the veto does not represent a change to the Australian Government’s single desk policy.
As he said:
These temporary arrangements are also intended to address the uncertainty caused by the ongoing debate and consideration of the long term wheat marketing arrangements in light of the Cole Inquiry.
I come to this debate as a single desk purist, a long-time supporter and defender on all grounds—economic, social and political. So, to a purist, the taking away of the veto from AWB International—or the Wheat Board, as we traditionalists would call it—is very hard to accept indeed. In March 2004, when I last addressed the matter of wheat, I said:
… the bottom line is that only within the industry can the single desk be undermined. That is a timely reminder to farmers not to flirt in any way with changes at the edges of the single desk. Do not chip away at this Rock of Gibraltar, for any change no matter how slight or how seductive will bring down the single desk.
—What an erudite quote. Who said that?
—I did, Minister. It was pre the Cole commission of inquiry. I cannot take your interjections, Minister, as I am under such pressure regarding time.
—You just did!
—Anymore, that is. That was pre Cole, but I must say—and the minister should know this—that it is getting harder to remain a pure supporter of the single desk, with the devastating effects of the Cole inquiry on the integrity of the AWB. And there is more to play out on that.
As I say, it is due to the Cole commission of inquiry that these changes have been brought in. Things can simply not stay the change. From the time the Volcker inquiry was handed down, the government has acted speedily and vigorously to expose the truth of the corruption that occurred between the AWB and the then Iraqi regime. We are determined to implement the findings and recommendations of the Cole commission of inquiry. What is being acted out today is a consequence of that culture and that behaviour, and the government has no choice but to make that decision and does not flinch from doing so. I regret that I only have the time allocated to me, but it is for those reasons that I fully support the bill before the Senate.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,25,1
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2006-12-07,"—I would like to thank other members of the chamber for facilitating my participation in the debate on the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2006. As outlined when this debate started yesterday, those of us in this place, from all parties, understand the need to pass this legislation and the need to give some certainty to the wheat growers of Australia. Of course, coming from Western Australia there are some particular issues associated with it. The issues are a bit more complex than perhaps they are in other states, so I rise to make a brief contribution.
Yesterday when Senator Boswell was making his contribution he was heralding the great job that those in the National Party had done in, as he alleges, looking after the needs of wheat growers. I have to say to Senator Boswell that the wheat growers in Western Australia do not vote for the National Party, so I do not know that he can claim a mandate on behalf of all of them. A percentage of them are known to support my side of politics, and of course there are the others who support my fellow Western Australia representatives—people such as Senator Johnston and Senator Adams. But these days there are not too many of them who vote for the National Party, so perhaps Senator Boswell should choose his words a bit more carefully. It is not his mandate and his mandate alone to represent their views in this place.
In Western Australia the wheat industry is a bit more complex than perhaps it is on the east coast. The wheat farmers in Western Australia do not have the same choices that those on the east coast do about where they choose to sell their wheat. Transport and other costs do not make for the ability to decide whether you will export or sell within the internal Australian market. It is not quite as economically smooth for the west coast. The wheat tends to be consumed within Western Australia or it is exported. Therefore, there have been issues concerning wheat farmers who choose to use CBH, and their desire to export their own wheat and the role of AWB in using their veto to exclude them.
There does need to be certainty, but I think there also needs to be some flexibility regarding how wheat farmers in Western Australia market their wheat and who they can sell it to. As I say, if we in Western Australia decide to farm in Western Australia we do not have the luxury of deciding whether we will sell in New South Wales or in Queensland. That is economically prohibitive. In my view, we do need to open up the market a bit more and allow some of the most efficient wheat farmers in the world the flexibility that they deserve and, in doing that, we need to give them certainty.
Labor will facilitate the passage of this legislation, but we also need an open and accountable inquiry into how we will progress this. It cannot just be the fiefdom of one political party. We actually need to get everybody on board. We need to have an open and transparent process, where we consult with all of the players—including the major players in my home state—and come up with certainty and a system in place to guarantee the survival of what is a very efficient industry in my home state. I would say it is more efficient in my home state than in many other places.
We need an open and accountable process and we need to consult with all of the players—not just the players that want to toe the line of any one political party—to ensure that we give wheat growers the certainty and the structures that they need so that they are not disadvantaged, whereby they perhaps have to protect some more inefficient growers. Whilst I am happy to facilitate the passage of this legislation, we do need an open and accountable process. We do need to know where we are going from here. We need to implement the stopgap measures, and we need to consult with everyone in the industry, not just the fiefdom of the National Party.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,25,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2006-12-07,"—On this issue, I am guided by and appreciative of the assistance I get from my Liberal Party colleagues—in particular, Mr Ian Macfarlane, from my home state of Queensland, who, as everyone knows, is very involved in the grains industry and is a wheat grower himself. I also appreciate the assistance of my Liberal colleagues Senator Judith Adams, Senator Grant Chapman and Senator Alan Ferguson, all of whom are wheat growers and have a very close and important interest in this. I also pay tribute to my colleagues Senator Johnston and Senator Adams for putting forward a private member’s bill which has encouraged our government to address this matter urgently, because obviously something had to be done in the very near future.
Time is against us all—which, I agree, is something of a shame—so I will confine my remarks very directly to the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2006. People have spoken in this chamber about everything being done in the interests of wheat growers. I like to think that bills and things done in this chamber and by the government are done in the national interest of Australia. In this issue, that will mean, I think, the interests of wheat growers, but, at times, it is broader. I will not be taking part in the committee stage of this bill but I would like to raise publicly a matter I raised with the minister. In section 63 of the bill, the minister, for the purposes of deciding the things that he does, is required to have regard to the public interest. In understanding how things around this place work, I have a concern—perhaps as a lawyer—that ‘the public interest’ is a very broad term and it is nowhere defined. I certainly hope that, because the whole process of this bill is a narrow six months, it will not involve litigious action by the various interested parties on what exactly the public interest means.
Another issue I want to touch on briefly, which I have raised with many of my colleagues, is my concern that this bill is only for a very limited period of time and that, once this bill concludes—once the sunset clause is reached—if nothing further is done, the initiative will return to AWB. I think everyone agrees that should not happen.
—So support my amendment!
—Thank you, Senator O’Brien. I had not been aware of your amendment—and I will not be supporting it. I have had an assurance from those who are in control of this that something will be done after the three-month period of consultation. I want to place on record my acceptance of that assurance and indicate that I will ensure that the assurance is committed—and I have no doubt that it will be. People on our side do not give assurances without intending to have them met. But it is something that must be addressed, because we cannot allow this to automatically revert to the AWB at the conclusion of the sunset clause. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,25,1
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2006-12-07,"—‘A government grant, by legislation, of a monopoly power confers on the recipient a great privilege. It carries with it a commensurate obligation. The obligation is to conduct itself in accordance with high ethical standards.’ This was on of the most important statements in the recently released Cole report into the AWB’s actions in Iraq. Australian wheat growers, along with the rest of us, were devastated by the revelation of lies and deceit. Australian wheat growers deserve the best international market access without interference from the Australian government or the AWB. I have always believed passionately in this issue and, on behalf of Australia’s wheat growers, I have fought passionately for it during my 10 years in this parliament. During hearings in Perth in 2003 into the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2003, I asked a number of questions about the WEA, the AWB and the impact of the AWB’s corporate dealings on growers. I was not satisfied with the responses that I was given at that time by various AWB executives—and I have felt that way even more strongly as the years have gone by.
I have always believed that the WEA is a toothless tiger, fundamentally flawed in its concept of keeping watch on the wheat board. Just last month we saw the AWB use its veto power to stop the CBH group from exporting wheat to its own flour mills in Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia. This is despite the fact that the CBH group was willing, in principle, to pay to farmers a higher premium than was on offer from the AWB. The Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2006 seeks to amend the Wheat Marketing Act to temporarily transfer the right to veto bulk wheat exports from AWB and AWBI to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. While the WEA will continue to control the bulk export of wheat, agreement with the minister must be reached for each application.
Questions over the actions of the AWB in the international market have intensified following the release of the report of the Cole inquiry into Iraqi kickbacks. While members opposite have used the release of the Cole report to attack the government, it is important to remember that it was the AWB and its executives whose actions were found to require further investigation and possible prosecution. Commissioner Cole found that, had the AWB cooperated with the inquiry by promptly providing the documents it had already assembled, there would have been a considerable saving for Australian taxpayers, not to mention Australian wheat growers. Australian wheat growers and the AWB have not benefited from this inquiry in the sense of costs. AWB presented a facade of cooperation with this inquiry but, in truth, it did not cooperate at all. It should be ashamed of itself.
The Cole inquiry has been a landmark inquiry in terms of the government’s openness to forensic examination of its internal processes. That examination has extended far beyond government departments—to ministers and their offices and to intelligence agencies. Three senior ministers—the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs—were examined, gave evidence, provided sworn statements and were exonerated.
In recent days the South Australian government has announced moves to remove the barley single desk in South Australia and there has been pressure in this parliament to remove the single desk for wheat. That argument is yet to be had. I look forward to watching very closely as the consultative committee moves around the country and to seeing the report that comes back.
There is no doubt that, rightly or wrongly, wheat growers are split on the question of retaining a single desk—a buyer of last resort for wheat—and a debate over the future of the single desk is something that we will undertake at another time. However, at this time, as an imperfect answer to a difficult problem—and particularly bearing in mind my Western Australian colleagues—I commend the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2006 to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,25,1
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2006-12-07,"—I too rise to support the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2006, which is before us today. I have been a wheat grower for most of my working life and in recent times a holder of AWB shares, but I can inform the Senate that, as I no longer own a farm and I have divested myself of my AWB shares, I do not feel as though I have any conflict of interest in representing the interests of wheat growers in supporting this bill.
Australia’s wheat growers have been going through very difficult times, partly brought about because of the drought over most of Australia—in some places that drought has continued now for three or four years—and partly because of the recent activities of the Australian Wheat Board and the necessity of having a full-scale inquiry, which we know now as the Cole commission of inquiry. While that inquiry was being undertaken, there was nothing that could be done to make any definitive moves about the sale of export wheat from Australia to other countries around the world. During the long time that the Cole commission took to report, the government always said—and government members on this side heartily concurred—that nothing could happen until that report was handed down and that an adequate and appropriate response would then be made by the government to the recommendations in the report.
In the meantime, growers in Western Australia, one of the few areas of Australia where reasonable wheat harvest has been gained by growers, have been left in an untenable position; many people did not have faith in the Wheat Board, so they have sought to warehouse their wheat while a decision is made as to what can be done in relation to exporting.
This decision of the government is the only decision that could have been made at this time. It is important for a variety of reasons. One is that we must take the concern out of the minds of the wheat growers as to whether they will get paid for their wheat, how much they will get paid for their wheat and who will be selling it for them. The provisions of this bill allow the veto to be taken away from AWB and put in the hands of the minister and the cabinet. In those hands, judgements can be made as to who should be selling the wheat from this season’s crop.
We also need to take into account the feelings of wheat growers around Australia. I have no statistics to back this up, but I have a view, and the consensus and anecdotal evidence would suggest, that there is still a majority of wheat growers in Australia who would prefer to have their wheat exported through a single marketing authority, whoever that authority might be. Some say it should still be the Wheat Board. That is yet to be determined.
In bringing this bill before the chamber, we have given ourselves some breathing space, some time to consult extensively with industry and with growers around Australia so that we can do what is in the best interests of the growers of Australia. I unashamedly represent those growers and not anybody else, because it is the growers who have to take the risk and it is the growers who, up until now, have had only one opportunity to sell their wheat through the Wheat Board. Some insist that that is the way they would like things to remain, but I know there are many others moving for change, especially amongst the younger generation of wheat growers, those aged 35 and under. They have taken to modern technology and modern communications. A price is offered each day: they can tap into the internet and find out the value of wheat. They have a knowledge and understanding of wheat futures. A whole range of issues that young people and young wheat farmers in Australia now take into account were simply not available to their grandfathers in the 1930s, when the marketing of wheat in Australia became such a shambles through agents varying prices and through the pressure put on growers, particularly smaller growers, at the time of harvest.
I wholeheartedly support this bill, because it gives us time to ask the growers whether they still want to maintain a single desk or whether they would like to move to some other form of marketing. It will give us time to consult the industry itself, apart from the growers, as to what it thinks is the best form of marketing for our grain and for the export of wheat in Australia. The bill in its present form is one that I hope receives the support of everybody in this chamber.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,25,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2006-12-07,"—In the past month, I have received more than 100 emails and telephone calls from wheat growers in Western Australia seeking to explain their views and concerns with respect to export wheat marketing in Australia, particularly with respect to the 2006-07 crop. I have taken considerable time to speak to many personally and to write to them to explain my concern as to the wisdom and propriety of permitting AWB to continue to operate the statutory export wheat marketing monopoly as established by the Wheat Marketing Act 1989, as principally amended in 1998.
I pause to say that AWB has displayed contemptuous corporate culture with wheat growers, with shareholders—both A and B class—and with the general public. Alarmingly, the arrogance and contempt continues to this day, notwithstanding the commissioner’s finding. It seems to me that this company, amazingly and incredibly, harbours a victim mentality to its current status. The real victims in this sorry saga are the courageous and trusting wheat growers, mainly from Western Australia and South Australia, who have relied upon this company to provide stability and reliability in the production and sale of wheat by our country.
I have heard many speakers in this chamber talk about the fear campaign relating to AWB. Let us have a look at this company, which I maintain has not learnt any lessons from the Cole commission. It has conceded, begrudgingly over a long period, that the legal fees associated with the running and defending of its position in the commission amounted to $35 million. I am yet to see proper accounting for that.
Shareholders and growers should be fully informed, as should the market. As you know, Madam Acting Deputy President, a task force will be established as to the prosecution of 11 AWB personalities. I am yet to see a proper accounting of and provisioning for the legal fees associated with that matter—for defence of the likely charges to flow from the task force inquiry. So we have a huge contingent liability rivalling the $35 million on the horizon for this company.
I turn to the taxation situation of this company. This company apparently claimed $A290 million as a tax deduction, which it paid to Alia. Those of us familiar with the laws relating to taxation assessments know that upon reassessment this company will be required to put on the table the cash differential of what it paid and what it should have paid whilst we await the outcome of its objection to the assessment. My estimation of that is somewhere between $100 million and $150 million in cash on the table.
Moving on, I draw the chamber’s attention to the Statoil case in the United States, which was prosecuted under foreign corrupt payments legislation. Statoil had paid $5 million in a bribe to the Iranians to secure an oil and gas contract in Iran. It pleaded guilty to the prosecution case and was fined $21 million. Extrapolating that figure means that, were AWB to be charged and convicted, the fine is likely to be somewhere around a billion dollars. I also mention that there is a class action looming. Those involved are being egged on and encouraged by Senator Harkin and Congressman Peterson from Minnesota. A class action against AWB would involve considerable expense, given the nature of the legal fees to defend it and any outcome.
Even worse than any of those things is this. AWB is currently the largest grain trader on the Chicago board of trade. Were it to lose the right to trade there and were this entity to retain the single desk operating rights, growers would be left without a hedging possibility on the largest grain-trading market in the world. In other words, this single desk monopoly holder would be failing growers if it were to be banished from participating in what would be a risk management exercise in the nature of hedging. Lastly, the Iraqi government wants the $290 million that was apparently paid to Saddam Hussein.
The account I have just given has been said by senators in this place to be fear mongering and part of a fear campaign. Let me say that it is so frightening that AWB Ltd gave an indemnity to AWBI over legal fees and tax. If it is a fear campaign, why would the company that runs AWBI grant an indemnity—an indemnity that has never been fully explained or fully set out? Is it in writing? If so, what are the terms?
The issue of the demerger we saw last week was not adequately explained, which says to me that this whole thing was simply a charade to try to look good and to be seen to be doing something. Even worse than that, and this is in answer to the allegation of a fear campaign, AWB has set up trusts which it brazenly acknowledges are to protect individual pool years from creditors. That is the cat out of the bag. If they have got to set up trusts to quarantine and insulate each annual pool—and they have acknowledged to the Stock Exchange that they have done this—the question is: why? The answer is that the liabilities on the horizon for this company are huge and dangerous. This company has betrayed the trust and faith of wheat growers.
Chapter 5 of the Corporations Law deals with insolvency. The authorities will stroll through these trusts as if they are having a Sunday walk in the park. This is a sham, and it will be seen to be a sham. So, when we see a demerger of AWBI from AWB, what is the end result? No advance explanation for growers and absolutely no assistance to them as to where they stand. In Western Australia growers have voted very accurately according to what their understanding is, and they have not given their wheat to this corrupt company for good reason. This bill solves that problem.",SENATE,<title>WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,25,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2006-12-07,"—It would be fair to say that the matters around the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 2006 have been very well canvassed, so I do not want to go through the reasons the bill should be supported. However, I will briefly deal with one issue that has been raised—that is, the definition of public interest. It is not possible to specify in advance what the relevant matters may be for determining what is in the public interest. That will depend on all the circumstances involved in each industry application that the minister will assess. Some of the issues that the minister may potentially take into account include the interests of growers participating in the national pool as well as the interests of growers in the industry as a whole. We as a government believe that broader considerations need to be taken into account than simply what may be in AWBI’s commercial interests.
In relation to the amendment proposed by Senator O’Brien, I quickly indicate that our view is that the type of review proposed would be time consuming and unnecessary. The government has already committed to extensive consultation with industry, and the minister will be writing to all growers seeking their views. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-12-07,"—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President—that is very observant of you!
—You are very hard to miss, Senator Ludwig!
—I rise to speak on the Royal Commissions Amendment (Records) Bill 2006. The bill deals with amendments to the Royal Commissions Act 1902 concerning access to and custody of royal commission records. Whilst the genesis of this bill was the tabling last week of the report of the Cole Inquiry into Certain Australian Companies in Relation to the UN Oil-for-Food Program, the bill itself is not in any way limited to this single commission. It will, in fact, have a lasting impact on all royal commissions for the future and it applies in its terms to all past royal commissions.
Among the inquiry’s extensive recommendations, Commissioner Cole proposed the establishment of a joint task force to consider possible prosecutions arising from the inquiry. The government argued that the Royal Commissions Amendment (Records) Bill 2006 will provide a framework for the orderly and speedy referral of records from the Cole inquiry to relevant law enforcement bodies. As far as Labor is concerned, however, this bill simply represents a hasty attempt by the government to address one of the recommendations of the Cole inquiry into the oil for food scandal.
Evidently stung by criticisms of its neglect and inaction on AWB in the past, it is clear that the government is now—finally—eager to at least look like it is doing something. Unfortunately, it is far too little, too late, from this government in this regard. Having turned a blind eye to 35 separate warnings over a number of years to AWB’s $290 million in kickbacks to Saddam Hussein’s regime, this small step cannot redeem the government. After so much neglect, the government cannot push through a poorly drafted and ill-considered law on the pretence that it is needed in order to do something urgent to handle AWB matters.
Labor, of course, stands by ready to assist with any changes that are needed to allow our law enforcement agencies to investigate possible crimes committed by AWB and staff. Labor, and our new leader in particular, have after all been at the forefront of pursuing the oil for food scandal. If it had not been for Labor’s dogged persistence, I very much doubt that the community would have understood the extent of AWB’s deceit, or the government’s neglect, apathy and perhaps more. But, whilst we stand ready to assist on the AWB specific matters, we are not going to be railroaded into making an ill-considered law of lasting consequence under the cover of that supposed pressing need.
In this respect, I note my appreciation that my colleagues were able to make constructive suggestions as to the coverage of the original bill when briefed on it late last week. The shadow Attorney-General had the benefit of being able to get information and assistance from her colleagues to ensure that they could put them to government so that government would at least have those matters before them. Labor, through the shadow Attorney-General, urged the government to adopt a different approach: to focus the bill just on this particular inquiry, as was done in the HIH matter.
The second option we urged for consideration was to give a limit to ‘custodian’ in the bill and the purposes for which records could be handed to a custodian. I am pleased to say that the government was prepared to take up the latter suggestion from Labor. As a result, the bill that is now before us is in truth a much more sensible and targeted bill than the original one that was envisaged. Despite this progress, Labor opposes in principle the government’s tendency to engage in rushed law-making. The government’s concessions to Labor’s prudent suggestions on amendments simply demonstrate the traps and risks of hastily making laws that will have a broad and lasting impact.
In the remaining time that I have available I will turn to the detail of the bill. The bill will introduce a regulation-making power to the Royal Commissions Act 1902 to enable regulations to be made to give custody or access to records of royal commissions to other persons and agencies and to be used for other purposes. The bill was originally extraordinarily open-ended; through regulation, it would allow all records held by any royal commission, past or future, to be passed on to any custodian for any purpose.
Fortunately, I can say that, after Labor raised its objections to the breadth of the bill, the government at least came to its senses—perhaps not completely, though—and introduced some rational amendments which specifically identified law enforcement agencies and limited the purposes to law enforcement as well. This is a far more sensible approach and protects against what you might call any silly or extreme outcome that could have been contemplated under the bill.
The bill amends the Royal Commissions Act 1902 to enable regulations to be made which deal with the handling of records and documents of a royal commission. What the bill will allow is that the regulations must identify which person or organisation is to be the custodian of the records and also the use of, and access to, those records. They are valuable records and do require protection.
The bill introduced last week allowed for regulations to be made in relation to specific royal commission records. Those regulations may provide for the custody in which some or all of a royal commission’s records, including copies of those records, are to be kept; specify purposes for which a custodian of royal commission records may use, or must not use, some or all of those; provide for the circumstances in which the custodian of royal commission records must or may give some or all of those records to another; provide for the circumstances in which the custodian of royal commission records must or may allow access to some or all of those records to others; and specify the purposes for which persons or bodies to whom a custodian of royal commission records gives access to those records may use, or must not use, some or all of those records.
The government’s amendments make it clear, in some detail, that regulations made under these provisions are limited to law enforcement agencies for the purposes of administering and enforcing the law. The bill will also allow but in fact not require such regulations to impose conditions to be complied with by the custodian of the records or persons and bodies to whom the records are given or who are allowed access to the records.
The bill makes it clear that the protection against self-incrimination under section 6DD of the Royal Commission Act is maintained and that legal professional privilege is not affected by any regulations that might be made under these amendments—although this is the subject of a separate recommendation by Commissioner Cole in his commission of inquiry report.
The bill also specifies that regulations will apply in respect of the records of any royal commission, including royal commissions which have reported before the commencement of the amendments. We have been advised that this provision is required as the oil for food commission is now technically also a past commission, having completed its work and reported to government. We have been assured by the government, and I would like this to be at least clear on the record, that there is no intention for this regulation-making power to be used for any commission further back in history. It would be helpful if, during the committee stage—if time permits a committee stage—or in the summing-up of this bill, the government made that plain.
The primary feature of the bill, therefore, is to provide a framework to allow royal commission records to be used for law enforcement purposes without needing additional legislation and without any prior need to notify and consult with persons who might be adversely affected by the release and use of the records.
Regulations made under this bill will apparently assist the task force recommended by the Cole commission to investigate and consider possible prosecutions against the persons named who may have breached Australian laws. Labor supports this bill because it puts the handling of these documents beyond doubt and ensures that any task force can deal with these AWB matters expeditiously.
Having described what the bill and the latest amendments do, I also want to make it abundantly clear to the Senate what this bill does not do. This bill will not uncover the whole truth about the government’s involvement in the wheat for weapons scandal. It will not reveal the extent of the government’s cover-up. Nor will the bill uncover what Minister Downer or Minister Vaile really knew about AWB’s kickbacks to the Iraqi regime. And the bill does not rectify the government’s shameful lack of commitment to a full, open and transparent inquiry into what really happened in the Iraq kickbacks scandal.
This bill may assist those now confronting the mammoth task of investigating whether any crimes have been committed or in preparing for prosecution, but it will do nothing to hold the government to account for this whole sorry episode of scandal upon scandal. Despite the bill’s obvious limits, and following the government’s acceptance of Labor’s request to limit this bill to law enforcement matters, as I have said, Labor are prepared to offer our support for the urgent passage of this bill.",SENATE,<title>ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT (RECORDS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,26,1

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2006-12-07,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

The Royal Commissions Amendment (Records) Bill 2006 amends the Royal Commissions Amendment Act 1902, to enable regulations to facilitate provision of custody and use of, and access to, records of royal commissions (including and beyond those involved in the Cole inquiry.)
The regulations are also designed to specify the purposes for which the records are not to be used and any conditions placed on the use of the records by any persons or bodies to whom the records are given or allowed access. This bill also aims to insert a regulation—giving power to enable regulations to be made to give custody or access to records to persons or bodies for investigative and prosecutorial purposes.
Upon introducing the bill, The Hon Malcolm Turnbull, Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister argued that:
The bill is urgent because it will provide the capacity to make regulations concerning the provision of relevant records of the Cole inquiry to appropriate authorities ... The regulations that will be able to be made when the bill has been passed will assist in expediting consideration of whether proceedings should be commenced in relation to the possible breaches of the law identified by the Cole inquiry.
Concerns over the bill’s content were raised immediately by a number of parties and groups as well as the Australian Democrats. Shadow Attorney-General, Nicola Roxon, rightly questioned the Coalition over the broadness of the bill, arguing that this bill, if passed would allow:
The government to order that documents from Royal Commissions 20 years ago should all be given to Fox FM or the Chaser for the purposes of entertainment!
The Australian Democrats were deeply concerned over the potential implications that this bill, in its original form, would have on future Royal Commissions.
We were concerned over the broad discretionary powers that were outlined in the bill, in particular, in relation to the purposes of the proposed regulations.
Had the Government failed to introduce the appropriate amendments, to ensure the regulations were specific, the Democrats, like the Opposition, would have introduced the appropriate measures to prevent any potential misinterpretation or misuse of the legislation.
However, while we support the intention of these amendments, we maintain that this bill should be restricted to deal solely with the recent Cole inquiry.
The Democrats are concerned over the broad nature of Schedule 1, item 2 paragraph 9(11)(a) in the original bill whereby it stated:
If regulations made for the purposes of paragraph 2(a) provide that a person or body is to have custody of Royal Commission records:
the custodian:
May use the records under subsection 6; and
May give the records to another person or body under regulations made for the purposes of paragraph 2(c); and
May allow another person or body access to the records under regulations made for the purposes of paragraph 2(d)
Considering this section could theoretically allow for the custodian to obtain custody of Royal Commission Records for any purpose, the Australian Democrats welcome the Governments amendment to this section, to include a clause outlining the purposes for which the custodian can access records. The amended section now reads:
If regulations made for the purposes of paragraph 2(a) provide that a person or body is to have custody of Royal Commission records:
the custodian may, for law enforcement purposes:
use the records under subsection 6; and
give the records to another person or body under regulations made for the purposes of paragraph 2(c); and
allow another person or body access to the records under regulations made for the purposes of paragraph 2(d)
The inclusion of ‘law enforcement purposes’ in this section, along with a definition of what constitutes law enforcement ensures that documents obtained through a Royal Commission are only used for the prescribed purposes specified in subsection 9(1)
The Government’s Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum outlines the rationale for the introduction of further amendments to the proposed legislation stating:
These amendments amend the bill to restrict the operative provisions of regulations which might be made as a result of the bill.
The principle change effected by the amendments relates to the provisions which allows removal of any requirement to provide procedural fairness to persons who could be adversely affected if documents obtained by a royal commission, for its purposes, were made available to other persons or agencies and used for other purposes.
As a secondary change, the amendments will restrict the persons or bodies to whom custody of the records may be given, addressing concerns that the potential range of custodians might be too broad.
The Democrats also welcome the amendment to subsection 9(3), to limit the range of potential custodians of Royal Commission records. This section, as introduced, originally provided an open ended category of any other person or body that may be prescribed.
The amendments are also aimed at limiting the circumstances in which procedural fairness is removed for law enforcement purposes. The supplementary Explanatory Memorandum highlights the law enforcement purposes as:
the custodian uses the records for the purposes of the purposes of the performance of the custodian’s functions and the exercise of the custodian’s powers;
the custodian gives, or gives access to, the records to another person or body under regulations providing the circumstances in which that may occur; or
a public office holder or public authority to whom the custodian gives, or gives access to, the records for the purposes of the performance of their functions and the exercise of their powers.
In conclusion, the Democrats originally held concerns over the broad nature of the potential range of purposes to which the records may be put.
However, while we welcome the amendments, we believe that they could go further to ensure the bill deals specifically with the Cole inquiry.
As with the HIH Royal Commission in 2003, which facilitated the transfer of information to the Australia Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), we believe that a similar provision in this bill would be far more effective than the current model.
Considering most criminal prosecutions that arise from a Royal Commission generally occur immediately following an inquiry, the need for a general purpose piece of legislation to deal with the recent Cole inquiry seems unnecessary.
As mentioned, the Democrats support the introduction of amendments to narrow the scope of the bill, we believe that the content of the bill should specifically deal with the recent Cole Inquiry.
I stress that while we support the intent of this bill, the Democrats are moving amendments to ensure that this bill only relates to the recent Cole inquiry.
The amendments the Democrats propose, will amend The Royal Commissions Amendment (Records) Bill 2006 to provide a clause that specifically states that this bill is only to be used in relation to the criminal prosecution of factors arising from the Cole inquiry. While the bill in its current form ha been tightened, the Democrats believe it should simply deal specifically with the issue at hand - the inquiry into Certain Australian Companies in relation to the UN-Oil-for-food Programme (The Cole Inquiry.)",SENATE,<title>ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT (RECORDS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,26,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-12-07,"—The Royal Commissions Amendment (Records) Bill 2006 amends the Royal Commissions Act 1902 to enable regulations to facilitate the provision of custody and the use of, and access to, records of royal commissions, including those of the inquiry into certain Australian companies in relation to the United Nations oil for food program.
The main reason for this bill is to remove any argument that there might be a requirement to provide procedural fairness to persons who could be adversely affected if documents obtained by the Cole inquiry or a full royal commission were to be made available to law enforcement agencies and used for other purposes. The government asserts that providing procedural fairness in respect of the use of such documents could be very time consuming and says it is unnecessary and unmeritorious in a law enforcement context. The government therefore wants to legislate, through this bill, to clarify that royal commission records can be used for defined purposes without having to provide procedural fairness. Note the word ‘clarify’, which is meant to convey that this is already the case but needs clearer expression.
The bill allows for regulations to be made in relation to specific royal commission records in certain circumstances. This will do away with the necessity for new bills to be introduced relating to specific royal commissions.
The bill makes it clear that the protection against self-incrimination in section 6DD of the Royal Commissions Act is maintained and that legal professional privilege is not affected by any regulations that might be made under these amendments.
I am speaking to the bill for two reasons. Firstly, I sit on the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which always expresses concern about any bill that attempts to make law that negatively applies retrospectivity. Secondly, I want to take the opportunity to discuss the failure of some of the accountability mechanisms as uncovered by the Cole inquiry.
First to retrospectivity: although the government have now limited to law enforcement agencies the agencies to which the documents collected by a royal commission can be provided, they have not addressed the Scrutiny of Bills Committee’s concern regarding the retrospective application of the law. It has been made retrospective so that it can apply to the recently completed Cole commission of inquiry, but that commission can be considered to be live and still afoot because of the legal consequences flowing from it. However, because of the broad way item 3 in schedule 1 has been drafted, it actually ensures that all the amendments proposed in this bill will have retrospective effect, with no limit on the matters that may be affected by it. So the amendments open up the opportunity for it to be applied to completed royal commissions.
I say for the record that the remarks from the shadow minister, Senator Ludwig, were unusual in that he is normally very particular about these matters. No assurance from the government—no assurance—can overturn this law, and any legal authority that wishes to enforce this law can access records from completed royal commissions. No assurance from the government can stop that happening, and the shadow minister, on behalf of Labor, is very unwise to think that an assurance from the government can overturn the fact of the legislation before us.
For example, there is the chance that documents that were collected as part of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in 1991 or as part of the Royal Commission into the Loss of the HMAS Voyager in 1964 could be resurrected by a law enforcement agency and used against someone to bring about a prosecution. Those matters are deemed to be closed, and rightly so. The people or the agencies that supplied certain documents collected for those enquiries did not envisage those documents being subsequently available to law enforcement agencies—especially not without the right of appeal or even the right to know that they might be used by law enforcement for prosecution purposes later, under retrospective laws. The law applicable at the time of those royal commissions did not enable that to happen, and this amendment should not be able to be used to apply to them retrospectively.
The Australian Democrats are opposed to laws with negative retrospective application that infringe on rights and procedural fairness. Sometimes bills are proposed which beneficially or positively provide for retrospectivity, and we usually support those. This bill offends a long tradition of principle established by all parties in this parliament that we should not support laws which adversely affect individuals and organisations by making unlawful what was previously lawful—and by saying that, by the way, I will draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the Royal Commissions Act has been amended since a number of royal commissions were held, and which are now affected by this law. Retrospective legislation offends against principles of natural justice, as does the fact that this legislation grants the custodian of the records an unfettered discretion with respect to the use of the records regarding the persons or bodies to whom they might be given. They can do this without obtaining the consent of, giving notice to, giving an opportunity to make submissions to, or taking into account submissions made by the owner of the records or any other person.
Item 2 of schedule 1 ensures that a person cannot appeal against a decision ‘of the custodian’ if in fact they find out that their documents are being provided to a law enforcement agency. Retrospectivity can and does trespass upon the basic tenet of our legal system that those subject to the law are entitled to be treated according to what the law says and means at the relevant time, subject to the interpretation of the courts. Retrospective legislation that brings uncertainty is to be avoided. As a general principle, the Democrats do not support the use of retrospective legislation that makes previously lawful activity unlawful or that acts to the detriment of individuals or organisations. I regard this not as a Democrats principle but as a cross-party principle and one of the most important principles in our 100-year-old parliament.
I understand why this bill has come about and the difficulties which Mr Cole experienced in obtaining documents from AWB during his inquiry—and I thought that some of the tactics adopted by their legal advisers, whilst legitimate, were most unsatisfactory. However, it is not appropriate that the frustration caused by an organisation that was being obstructive should manifest itself in a bill with open-ended retrospective application and the elimination of procedural fairness for a section of the community. In my view, this bill should have been quarantined to the Cole commission of inquiry and future royal commissions and, if it had been quarantined in that way, we would of course support it without amendment.
The second point I wish to discuss is accountability. There was no evidence given to the Cole inquiry that any of the relevant ministers were aware of, or had been informed about, the actions of the AWB. There was no written evidence that ministers knew what was occurring in the AWB. Rather than that being something the government should be commended on, it is something which uncovers systemic problems at all levels of government. There was obviously knowledge but it was not being passed on and was not being acted on. Thirty-five times the whistle was blown and 35 times no-one heard it. That is a failure, a great failure, by any measure.
There is no escaping the reality that an unhealthy trend has emerged in our federal government. This is best described as an ‘acute accountability vacuum’ at the ministerial level whereby executive government is shielded by the human armoury of partisan ministerial minders or advisers, or bureaucrats who just do not or will not do their job. Ministerial staffers are an important cog in the demanding work of the executive. Some carry out this vital task with skill, honesty and commitment. Of concern though is their capacity to intervene in departmental processes, to mediate between the political and administrative levels, to drive and skew advice, and to insist upon what the minister wants to know rather than the integrity of the policy process. While all this might serve executive government well, it does so at the expense of the public interest.
The Howard government is not unique in this regard; it has merely built upon trends already evident from its predecessors and already apparent in state government machinery. However, it is the case that this government has carried the trend to a new level. The barriers put up to avoid parliamentary scrutiny include refusing to allow ministerial advisers to be questioned by parliamentary committees. Then it went even further and refused to let bureaucrats be questioned by parliamentary committees. The minister in the estimates committees refused to allow public servants to answer questions which could be construed, on an extremely broad reading, as being within the purview of the Cole commission of inquiry.
It is only through transparent frameworks of accountability that the public can have confidence in their elected representatives and their staffers and advisers. Together with the need for an enforceable ministerial code of conduct, the Democrats have also called for measures to clearly define the role of ministerial staff and, to the great credit of the Labor opposition, they have, too.
It is clear that the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act is no longer adequate as a guideline for good governance. The 2003 Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee report, Staff employed under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984 revealed significant flaws in the management framework for ministerial staff. The report recommended that the government needed to act swiftly to develop and implement a new management framework. Three years down the track and still there has been no substantive response to the recommendations.
I have also long campaigned against ‘jobs for the boys and girls’. The AWB scandal showed that the government has been too close and too trusting of a commercial, self-interested body. The ministers and their advisers did not ask the difficult questions, because their mates—and often they were their mates—were on the AWB, and when their mates told them something they believed them. Maybe that is natural, but it is not good government. Not that there is evidence that anyone in government from the political or the bureaucratic side asked any difficult questions. But that was their duty. It was their duty to do so under our commitments to the United Nations and under international law, and we should have been asking the obvious questions. As Professor Stephen Bartos, the Director of the National Institute for Governance at the University of Canberra, has said:
The key players were all part of the one small agri-political club—they all know each other and are very much inter-related (sometimes literally). Grains Council people go on AWB board, Grains Council people go on WEA, the gun-totin’ Trevor Flugge steps down from AWB but is hired by government to undertake a mission to Iraq ...
So you have an old boys network where, as Professor Bartos pointed out, the hard questions were not asked because that ‘would have been improper, altogether ungentlemanly in this very gentlemanly club’.
The Cole inquiry exposes an atmosphere where accountability and transparency have been diluted. There were no proper systems and procedures to ensure that, whoever was in the job, proper regulation of their actions and reporting systems would occur, and that they would ensure accountability. Unfortunately, because of the limited terms of reference, Commissioner Cole could not make the obvious recommendations that flow from that with respect to how government processes should have been and how they should be in the future.
This government minimises ministerial responsibility. A matter of concern raised by the Cole inquiry was the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. At estimates hearings and during my other committee work, I have dealt with spokespeople from DFAT and, in all of my dealings with them and in the dealings I have observed with them, they have not presented themselves as being stupid, inexperienced, incompetent or corrupt—far from it—which means instead that the processes are poor, the reporting mechanisms are weak and, most of all, bureaucrats have become obeisant to a political culture that deliberately wants to not know.
Questions have to be asked: are the proper accountability and reporting mechanisms in place; are there systems to ensure that the relevant and appropriate information is getting to the people who need to make decisions about it? This is not a political matter; solely, it is about Australia’s interest and Australia’s reputation, which have been harmed because both the political and the bureaucratic side did not do their job.
If we have a culture where bureaucrats no longer provide full and frank advice and are fearful for their jobs, similar to that which we have recently seen exposed in DIMA, then we have a problem. The systems and procedures in place at DFAT need to be thoroughly investigated. I am not looking to blame particular public servants. As was pointed out in the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee report: accountability is about ‘being required to give account’ whereas responsibility is about ‘attracting credit or blame’. Public servants are required to give an account of their action or their inactions and, if the Westminster system is working properly in Australia, the relevant ministers are required to attract credit or blame.
The lack of written evidence on some of the matters which were personally known to some members of Austrade or DFAT, but were not officially passed on, points to a serious systems breakdown. It is also obvious that the sheer volume of information being provided to ministers, some of it very mundane, is difficult for them to manage because it often does not distinguish effectively between the routine and the imperative. These circumstances can be addressed by departments and ministers. They do not require a separate task force; they simply require a willingness to embrace the concept of good reporting, proper accountability and transparency, and of course enforcing the law.
This government has not shown itself under the Cole commission circumstances as having been willing to do this. This government, rather than addressing problems which can be fixed relatively quickly without great expenditure of taxpayers’ money, is setting up a task force which will take a great deal of time to establish and even longer to bring about prosecutions. But that is a matter of the legal consequences that flow from the commission. I am talking about the government getting on with the business of improving its ability to govern through the way in which its agencies report and keep account to the Australian people and the parliament.
The report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee recommended that all departments provide written guidance to staff regarding relations with ministers’ offices and that all senior staff receive adequate training in this area. It further recommended that the level and intensity of training for ministerial staff be increased and given a higher priority by ministers. It also highlighted the need for ministers’ staff to receive training with emphasis on political ethics, the relationship with the Public Service and record-keeping responsibilities.
If all of these recommendations had been implemented by the relevant ministers’ offices, it would have provided a much clearer picture to the Cole inquiry of exactly who knew what and when. Why do I emphasise ministerial staff? Because ministers themselves do not have the time, capacity or opportunity to filter and examine everything that comes through to them. They have to use their staff and advisers to do the relationship job and, in this relationship job under the Cole circumstances, they did not do what they should have been doing. It is a question of having appropriate systems in place so that corrupt, unethical or improper behaviour can be identified and stopped before impacting on the nation in the way that this scandal has.
The recommendations of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee were what I called at the time ‘a work in progress’. The Australian Democrats also proposed the establishment of an office of ethics commissioner, and that suggestion has not been taken up—nor has my Charter of Political Honesty Bill. In the light of the Cole inquiry, the Australian government should lead from the front with meaningful legislative and administrative change, the adoption of the recommendations of the finance and public administration report from 2003, the introduction of an office of ethics commissioner and should shift from a culture of finger pointing, blame shifting and avoiding responsibility to one where we, as parliamentarians, can be certain that departments like Trade or Foreign Affairs are on the job.",SENATE,<title>ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT (RECORDS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,26,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-12-07,"—I thank senators for their contributions. This bill will enable regulations to facilitate provision of custody, use of and access to records of royal commissions, including but not only those of the inquiry into certain Australian companies in relation to the UN oil for food program, which is known as the Cole inquiry. Commissioner Cole made findings that certain breaches of the law might have occurred and recommended referral of specified matters to the appropriate authority for consideration as to whether procedures should be commenced for breaches of the laws. He also recommended the establishment of a joint task force, comprising the Australian Federal Police, Victoria Police and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to consider possible prosecutions in consultation with the Commonwealth and Victorian directors of public prosecutions.
The regulations to be made under the amendments introduced by this bill will remove any uncertainty about the extent to which documents obtained by the Cole inquiry can be used for investigation and prosecutorial purposes. In particular, the bill removes any argument that there might be a requirement to provide procedural fairness to persons who could be adversely affected if documents obtained by the Cole inquiry or any other royal commission for its purpose were made available to other persons or agencies and used for law enforcement purposes. Providing procedural fairness in respect of the use of documents could be very time consuming and would be an impediment to early investigation by law enforcement agencies. It is sensible to legislate to allow royal commission records to be used for law enforcement purposes without having to provide procedural fairness and without any doubt as to the rightness of this approach.
The government is now taking the opportunity to provide a framework which can be used for future royal commissions without needing additional legislation. The bill makes it clear that the protection in section 6DD of the RCA against self-incrimination is maintained. Legal professional privilege is not affected, notwithstanding any regulations that might be made under these amendments.
During the debate I think Senator Ludwig sought an assurance that the government has no intention of using the bill in respect of records of completed royal commissions—other than the Cole inquiry, that is. It is correct that there is no specific present intention to regulate in respect of other past inquiries. However, if in the future there was a case for transferring records for law enforcement purposes, the government would consider that if and when it arose. The bill is not strictly retrospective, as it is not drafted so that regulations could change the legal status of a transfer of records which had already been transferred. It is only to facilitate future transfers of records. This follows the precedent of the HIH Royal Commission (Transfer of Records) Act 2003.
Senator Ludwig said that the amendments in the House limit regulations to law enforcement agencies and law enforcement purposes. I point out to the Senate, as indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister during the debate on the amendments, that the regulations will still be able to prescribe purpose and circumstances for access to records which are not limited to law enforcement purposes and circumstances. However, provision of records for purposes other than law enforcement will continue to be subject to any procedural fairness obligations that presently exist. Those two issues were raised by Senator Ludwig. There is limited time before question time, so I will not take it any further, other than to commend the bill to the Senate.
Question put:
That this bill be now read a second time.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>ROYAL COMMISSIONS AMENDMENT (RECORDS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,26,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-12-07,"—I rise to speak in the second reading debate on the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006 and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006. The object of these bills is outlined in clause 3 and basically aims to bring Australia into lin with international compliance regarding measures to combat money laundering by criminals and the financing of terrorism. This bundle of regulatory action is known more generally as anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorist financing or, in short, AMLCTF.
The bills derive their impetus from the OECD’s financial action task force recommendations which consist of, in two parts, 40 recommendations on anti-money-laundering—these were first released in 1990 and have since been revised a number of times, the latest having occurred in 2003—and nine special recommendations on counter-terrorist financing. The bulk—that is, eight out of nine—of these were released immediately after the September 11 attacks in October 2001. The ninth was released in October 2004.
Clause 3 also lists a number of other international obligations and resolutions which I will not go into in detail. After much delay, the government is legislating to ensure Australia’s compliance with the FATF regime. However, it is still in two tranches. The first tranche is these bills currently before the parliament. They cover financial, gambling and bullion-dealing industries, in addition to lawyers and accountants, but only to the extent that they are in competition with the finance industry. The second tranche, which covers other activities of lawyers and accountants, as well as the jewellery and real estate industries, is yet to be released. The government has not yet announced a target date for completion of the second tranche.
The history of these bills is one of delays, failed consultations and subsequent international embarrassment. The Howard government is negligent in leaving Australia inadequately protected from criminals and terrorists who use our financial system to launder money. Only now, five years after 9-11, has it implemented the special recommendations, eight out of nine which were released in the aftermath of those horrendous attacks.
Let us make no bones about the importance of this legislation. It is needed to fight organised crime and terrorism. In September 2002, Senator Ellison, in a press release, made pointed reference to the fact:
... criminals and terrorists ... will continue to take advantage of jurisdictions where the law enforcement and regulatory powers are the weakest.
That statement was made, as I said, in 2002, and the recommendations were released in 2003. It is now five years since the September 11 attacks, five years since the special recommendations were first released, three years since the revised general recommendations were released and three years since the new laws were promised. Yet we are only now seeing them in their final form—and only the first tranche of that, not finally completed.
It has been a botched consultation process. Just as Senator Ellison’s handling of the Customs cargo management re-engineering project was a lesson in how not to manage an IT project, his handling of the AML/CTF legislation has been a lesson in how not to manage the implementation of a complex new legislative regime such as this. The first serious problem was the botched consultation process undertaken through the 2004 and 2005 years. Industry was not fully consulted, or not consulted properly, about the proposed laws and the government has essentially attempted to jam everything through in a one-size-fits-all approach.
The minister attempted to persevere with this approach but, in mid-2005, faced the humiliating result of being rolled by cabinet after a concerted campaign by industry and told to go back to the drawing board and start again. By then we had, in 2005, a FATF report. It was an international humiliation. There were two reports which slammed our response on money laundering and terrorist financing.
Firstly, you had the release in May of that year of a report by the US State Department in which Australia had the dubious honour of being named as a ‘major money laundering country’ and a ‘country of primary concern’. This government’s status as a soft touch on money-laundering and terrorist financing was confirmed later in that year following an investigation and the release of a country report by the financial action task force, which found that Australia was fully compliant with only 12 of the 40 recommendations—and, even more alarmingly, was not fully compliant with a single one of the nine special recommendations relating to terrorist financing. Two years after Senator Ellison had promised the laws, Australia was given a big fat zero.
In the meantime, between the announcement of the laws and the current bill, the government has been forced to rush through a number of bandaid solutions to keep up the appearance of compliance with the recommendations. This has been, let me say, an excruciatingly painful process, when there was no need for it. It has been compounded by the government’s own errors as well.
The first of the bandaids contained in the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005 was passed last year in what can best be described as a slow panic in response to the FATF report. It implemented a number of the FATF recommendations but, before these even commenced, the government was forced to amend a number of these in a later act, the Financial Transaction Reports Amendment Act 2006. It was forced to introduce these amendments because, to quote directly from the explanatory memorandum:
If the amendment to restrict the application of Division 3A of Part 11 of the FTR Act to ADIs is not made, then certain legitimate non-bank money remitters assert that they could be put out of business.
That is the government in its own words admitting that its legislation was so poorly drafted that it would have put people out of business. It is quite extraordinary, and that is no surprise. The government, in answers to questions on notice from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry into the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No.2) 2005, had admitted that it did not consult with industry on the final version of that act. So it was forced to continue piling bandaid upon bandaid onto its legislation.
The farce of the government’s poor drafting continued even after the legislation was tabled before parliament. We saw one explanatory memorandum released then withdrawn. We then saw another explanatory memorandum released. Finally, we have seen yet another round of amendments to the EM. All in all, there are over 500 changes to the original EM. Even at the 11th hour, the government are still fiddling with their legislation. I suspect they have not really stopped; they have just paused. My guess is they will be back next year, fiddling with it again. They do not even seem to be able to get the explanatory memorandum right. In addition, this is only the first tranche of the legislation. There are serious holes left in the regime which we are told will be fixed by further reforms.
Labor has called upon the government to release the timetable in which it expects to complete the further reforms. Until they are completed, and Australia is compliant with all of the recommendations in all areas, you have what is essentially a maginot line—that is, a set of scary and imposing set of defences which can easily be outflanked and circumvented by a determined enemy. That is what these crooks who launder money can be. While these are long overdue steps in the right direction, it cannot be emphasised enough that they are only part of what is required. Until Australia completes the second tranche, we will be left defenceless.
I will now turn to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and the report into the bill that was completed. There were a range of areas covered and a range of recommendations which the committee made. I do not intend to examine all of those in detail, but some are worth highlighting. I will highlight those that appear to be the most salient and important points. Two areas which the Senate committee report touched on in detail were the issues of consultation and the implementation times for the legislation. That really underscores this whole exercise by the government. On consultation and implementation times, this government stuffs up all the time, in many bills that come before the Senate, particularly the bills in this area. This is another example of that.
For consultation, we saw industry repeating concerns similar to those which it had raised earlier—specifically, I am thinking of the Anti-Terrorism Act. In that case, industry’s concerns were later shown by the amendments to the Financial Transaction Reports Act to be quite valid. They were not properly consulted on the final text. In a similar vein, we saw lacklustre consultation during the early stages of the draft, which resulted in the unusual situation of a minister being rolled in cabinet and told to go back to the drawing board and start again. So consultation problems are not a new concern with this bill, and industry has every right to be wary of any perceived lack thereof. I note from the Senate report, however, that AUSTRAC and the department have taken some steps to allay these concerns. I continue to encourage that.
The implementation period was also of concern. While industry, as noted in the report, was generally happy with the implementation times, an important exception was the use of a staggered approach, particularly as the rules have not yet been finalised for most situations. The report indicates that small businesses and others not currently significantly regulated by the Financial Transaction Reports Act feel especially impacted by this. Certainty is what business needs in this area. I encourage the government to ensure that it can deliver certainty by ensuring that it meets those deadlines and finalises the rules so that business can have certainty and associations and industries can provide advice to their members.
In response, the department has indicated that it will have the rules available by 31 March next year. We can only wait and watch. The Labor Party will continue to monitor this, particularly given the minister’s track record of not giving industry sufficient time to implement required changes, such as was the case in the botched implementation of the Customs cargo management re-engineering project.
Finally, the last area of concern addressed in the report that I will mention—although there were others addressed in the report itself—is the range of sanctions which apply to the offences in the act. Simply put, a number of stakeholders believed these penalties were far too onerous for most of the offences, which were, they said, offences for crimes of omission rather than commission, and that lesser penalties, or other statutory powers for AUSTRAC, were more appropriate.
In its recommendations, the committee and the government backbenchers picked up a lot of the concerns which had been aired by stakeholders during the inquiry. Recommendations 1 to 3 took up the concerns of industry relating to the drafting of rules and other parts of the legislation, as I mentioned earlier, and recommended more consultation in future when AUSTRAC is making or amending rules. What I do not want to see is a Senate committee faced with an Attorney-General’s Department and the minister again saying, ‘We haven’t consulted in respect of this bill’. My recollection is that we have had it more than just once—more than was needed—in respect of this bill and other bills. If the minister can take one lesson from this it is that consultation can avoid a lot of harm and heartache.
Labor supports the other recommendations which call for the government to amend sections of the bill relating to low-risk, low-value solutions; periodic audits of AUSTRAC by the Privacy Commissioner; and to subject portions of the bill to state, territory and Commonwealth discrimination laws, amongst others. Labor supports these recommendations, and we urge the government to adopt them. These are changes which are supported by Labor and supported by the government’s own backbench. In addition, I will foreshadow at this point that I will be moving a range of amendments on behalf of Labor. We will be moving amendments to implement recommendations 4, 5 and 13 as well as additional recommendations that were not in the committee report.
But let me make this point clear: the Labor Party supports this bill. We will be moving amendments to improve it, but we fundamentally support it, as we support all reasonable legislation designed to protect Australia and fight terrorism and crime. Our concerns about this bill arise primarily from the fact that such an important piece of legislation has simply taken so long to reach parliament. Our concerns are about a minister who refused to consult and work with industry to achieve a decent outcome. It is imperative with this style of legislation, where it impacts upon business and requires business to put in systems and processes, that you consult with business about how best to effect it while still maintaining a hard line about what you need to fight terrorism and crime.
Senator Ellison has been a repeat offender at botching consultation with industry, as his efforts to implement the new Customs cargo system showed us at about this time last year. It is important legislation. It is high time it was brought before parliament. It is a black mark against the Howard government that it has taken so long to bring it forward. Along with the amendments that I will move in the committee stage, I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND COUNTER-TERRORISM FINANCING BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,27,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-12-07,"—The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006 and related bill implement changes to Australia’s anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulatory regime regarding identification, management and litigation of money laundering and terrorism financing. The bills introduce reporting obligations for the financial sector in relation to customer due diligence, reporting of certain matters, development and maintenance of money-laundering and counter-terrorism programs and record keeping. The changes are to be phased in over two years and incorporate a risk based approach to compliance. They also expand the regulatory role of AUSTRAC to provide advisory, monitoring and enforcement functions across a range of industry sectors. The bills provide for review of the operation of the provisions, regulations and money-laundering and counter-terrorism rules at the end of seven years.
These bills are the first tranche of the anti-money-laundering legislation to implement reforms which are proposed to cover the financial sector, gambling sector, bullion dealers, lawyers and accountants to the extent that they provide financial services. It imposes obligations on businesses, including customer due diligence, reporting, record keeping and developing and maintaining an anti-money-laundering program.
These bills have been a long time in coming because of slow, ongoing consultation with industry and stakeholders. Of specific concern to the Australian Democrats with respect to the exposure draft of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006 was the lack of appropriate balancing of matters of privacy, matters of security, issues relating to commercial needs and the competitive needs of the business community in international trade. However, as I have said in the past, a less than perfect anti-money-laundering regime is essential and much better than continuing with the present minimalist regime.
Australia must become truly serious about combating corruption and ensuring that criminals cannot live in luxury off the proceeds of their crimes. Recently, we have seen the fallout from corruption and bribery with the AWB scandal, and the Australian people will pay the price for that scandal, not just the wheat farmers of Australia. I will use the right language for a money-laundering bill. With AWB, ministers have washed their hands of any ministerial responsibility. Bribery, corruption, crime and money laundering are irrevocably intertwined, and any steps the government takes to counter that axis of evil will be for the better. This government has not shown itself too keen on implementing effective and wide-reaching domestic legislation against bribery, something which was negatively commented on by the OECD recently, and this failure will no doubt be reflected in whether or not successful prosecutions can be secured against AWB officials under the bribery of foreign officials legislation. It is arguable that stronger antibribery legislation would have allowed much stronger legal action against AWB officials caught in the scandal.
It has to be said that the main reason this government has finally set its mind to money-laundering legislation is international pressure to counter terrorism. It should be remembered that most money laundering has its origins in proceeds of tax evasion, crime and other ill-gotten gains and has been going on for decades. This reminds me of an article I read in the Age a couple of weeks ago about the actions of the Victorian police in attempting to trace the money trail of some of the more high-profile drug traffickers in Melbourne. Detective Superintendent Richard Grant is tracing the proceeds of the convicted drug dealer Tony Mokbel and is reported as saying:
It is no longer enough to just lock up some of these people. Many are prepared to risk long stints in jail if they know that on their release they can live million-dollar lifestyles.
This reminds me of those sleazy well-known Western Australian white collar business crooks of the eighties. There are a number now happily enjoying their criminal gains and some of them, unfortunately, are happily strolling down our beaches.
Detective Superintendent Grant also pointed out that organised crime groups use professionals to assist in concealing assets. Although he did not fully articulate it, professionals in that context means lawyers, accountants and brokers. Every successful crook has a professional or two in his pocket, going all the way back to Al Capone. As their past large-scale failure to put in tax returns shows, many lawyers are unfortunately not exactly model citizens. This legislation attempts to curtail the way that dirty money can be washed through a legitimate transaction. The ways in which such laundering can happen are manifold, from property transactions to gambling. Because of the variety of ways in which a corrupt individual can launder money, it is necessary for the legislation to be far-reaching. However, there should still be checks and balances to ensure that the legitimate right of people to privacy is not impacted too severely, that people are able to appeal decisions and that the parliament has some role in monitoring the effectiveness of the legislation in achieving its goals.
The Australian Democrats welcome this bill. There remain some concerns of industry which have not been addressed since the exposure draft and which were brought up in the truncated committee hearings into the bill. The Attorney-General’s Department and AUSTRAC have apparently worked hard with industry and stakeholders to address concerns and to change a prescriptive regime into a risk based scheme. These efforts have broadly met with approval.
There remain difficulties with the bill. Those difficulties were identified in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the bill and should be addressed by the government through amendments. Certainly, both Senator Ludwig and I have amendments to address the recommendations of the committee. I draw the attention of the Senate in particular to recommendation 5, which recommends that the Office of the Privacy Commissioner conduct periodic audits of the compliance of AUSTRAC with privacy obligations in its administration of the bill. This oversight is essential.
However, the Democrats would go further and suggest that the recommendations of Minter Ellison and Privacy Victoria be considered as a further oversight mechanism. Minter Ellison suggested that AUSTRAC:
... should be subject to the scrutiny of and accountable to a Parliamentary Committee. We also believe that it should be required to consult with other regulators of the financial services industry (such as ASIC and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority), in addition to the industry itself, when making Rules or modifications to ensure that the impact of its proposals are fully considered and understood and to limit any regulatory overlap.
The suggestion has great merit, as it was obvious between the exposure draft and this bill that many of the difficulties which were not foreseen by the drafters were pointed out by industry and have made this a better and more workable piece of legislation.
Privacy Victoria said:
... greater transparency and public accountability should be guaranteed. The Bill should specify the matters that will be examined, establish an independent review committee, compel public consultation, and provide for timely tabling of the review report.
In this regard, I support my committee colleagues from the Labor Party who, in their additional comments to the report, suggested that the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, once it is established, would be an appropriate body to perform this oversight role. This suggestion has merit because it means that a separate and separately financed independent entity does not have to be created to perform the oversight role. On the other hand, a parliamentary committee could fulfil the task as well. Just as there is an ASIC oversight committee—namely, the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services—it would be appropriate to have a similar parliamentary committee overseeing the work of AUSTRAC in relation to this. This legislation allows AUSTRAC a high level of discretion. Oversight is therefore extremely important, whatever form it takes.
It was also clear from the committee hearings that the transitioning period was of concern to a range of businesses. There is no doubt that aspects of the bill put a great deal of pressure on business to check their clients and what they are doing and report suspicious matters. However, business needs to have systems in place before that can be successfully achieved so that customers are not unnecessarily alienated, persons of certain races or ethnic groups are not unnecessarily subjected to increased scrutiny and business is not burdened with the role of detective.
In order to achieve that, the government needs to provide assistance to business and to educate the public about the impact of this legislation on some quite everyday transactions—in particular, on the requirements of customer identification. I have had some sympathy for the government, because it is very obvious that when you are trying to deal with money laundering issues you have to extend the reach so far that ordinary everyday transactions are going to be affected and people who are entirely innocent are going to be annoyed.
Large companies may be able to set in place the appropriate risk based systems required to detect and report on suspicious transactions, but smaller businesses such as suburban accountants or sole practitioners may find it more difficult. In that regard, the government needs to provide tangible assistance to small business, small business associations or professional associations with a small business basis to ensure that they are in a position to implement the changes that this bill requires, rather than telling them what it requires and, if they do not deliver, bringing action against them for not doing so.
Money laundering is an international problem and the remedy therefore must be an internationally coordinated approach. The United Kingdom and the United States have had legislation in place for several years to try to combat it. As many in the Senate know, I have been through an almost decade-long process of actively supporting and campaigning for standard international accounting standards so that there is a common system of reporting accounts all over the world. The same is true of this system: it is only effective if the standards which apply and the enforcement mechanisms that are used are similar internationally.
I have previously spoken about the Financial Action Task Force in relation to the Financial Transaction Reports Amendment Bill 2006, but those comments are relevant to this legislation as well. The FATF are an intergovernmental body designed to establish international standards and develop and promote policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. They conducted an evaluation of Australia’s anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing legislation and wrongly estimated that the value of money laundering offences in Australia was between $2 billion and $3 billion a year. Well over a decade ago, the National Crime Commission estimated the value of drug dealing alone at over $2 billion. I have heard estimates of up to $11 billion as the annual value of laundered money in Australia, which would be about one per cent of our trillion dollar GDP. I think that higher figure is likely to be nearer the mark.
Money laundering was a matter high on the agenda of the previous Labor government, but its importance was lost on the Liberal-National government until after the September 11 attacks. It is now of greater concern, thank goodness. It is recognised that terrorism cannot operate at a high level of activity without a significant injection of funds. Of course, the Democrats strongly support antiterrorism bills like this which seek to restrict or stop the financing of terrorists. This new interest in anti-money-laundering will have useful effects mainly on criminal and drug activity, and the way in which the people involved in those activities move moneys around the world, and on tax evasion.
An evaluation of Australia’s anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws by the financial action task force on money laundering in 2005 found that our system was falling behind the task force standards. These bills, along with the recently passed Financial Transaction Reports Amendment Bill 2006 are part of the government’s long-in-coming response to international pressure to crack down on the potential for money laundering, particularly with respect to the financing of terrorism.
These bills, like several before them, impact on an issue of central and increasing concern in our society—that of privacy. Privacy is a matter which has rightly concerned this government in its nearly 11 years in office, and it is a matter which concerns our society. Privacy concerns were issues strongly highlighted by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report on the exposure draft of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2005, and several submissions to the committee on these bills continued to voice concerns.
The Office of the Privacy Commissioner made submissions to the committee in relation to these concerns. The committee, recognising the importance of this matter to many people in an increasingly watched society, made a recommendation that the Office of Privacy Commissioner conduct privacy audits of AUSTRAC on a regular basis. The Australian Democrats will be moving amendments to reflect that recommendation.
As I pointed out in my speech, in relation to the Financial Transaction Reports Act a great deal of information is required to be collected by banks and all other institutions and professions covered by this legislation. It means that, to fulfil customer identification in compliance with the anti-money-laundering bills, a substantial amount of personal information will be collected. That being the case, the privacy protection measures in these bills should be of paramount importance.
We have already seen that some workers at the tax office think nothing of accessing the tax and financial information of well-known people without authorisation or reason, and this danger should be guarded against when this new regime is set in place. While there is a genuine need for anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws, there is also serious need for an increased campaign of public awareness about what goes on in these respects. The government needs to provide the funding for such an education campaign and assistance to those bodies and businesses that will be charged with the collection of much of the information and the duty to report on suspicious transactions.
In all the various legislative responses that have been implemented in the post-September 11 world, it is important not to forget who these laws are meant to protect: the people of the strong democracy of Australia. Recognising the need for some things to change and that we do need a tighter regulatory environment is, of course, entirely acceptable and proper, but it must be done with a recognition and understanding of the consequences and results and how perfectly innocent people going about their business can be caught up in new bureaucratic systems.
I encourage the government in its efforts to implement a sound legislative framework which minimises money laundering, exposes the financing of terrorist and criminal activities and reduces the evasion of tax. However, it is also of fundamental importance that, in enacting such laws, the competing interests of the privacy of personal information be balanced against the need to outlaw and prohibit activities and actions which run contrary to a safe, civil and enduring society. The Australian Democrats support this bill overall, but we will be moving amendments to reflect the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to ensure the impact of the legislation is carefully monitored for its effects and consequences.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND COUNTER-TERRORISM FINANCING BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,27,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2006-12-07,"—Earlier this year, former Justice Ron Merkel was quoted in the Age as saying:
The move to granting ever-expanding coercive power to the executive arms of state and federal governments, to be exercised behind closed doors and without public scrutiny, carries with it grave risks to the democratic values we are trying to defend. ... One must have serious concern as to whether the political hierarchy is deserving of the kind of trust and integrity that the public are entitled to expect of them in administering that power.
The Howard government, the state governments and the federal Labor Party have cooperated to overturn fundamental human rights in the name of fighting terrorism. The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006 and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 represent another step down that path. They radically change the level and the sort of information that financial institutions must collect on their customers and the manner in which such information will be used by national security agencies and the police. Another way of describing what this legislation does is that it requires banks to spy on their customers for the government.
The Greens accept that some information collected by financial institutions should be made available to government agencies when it relates to criminal behaviour, including terrorism and money laundering. We have always been prepared to support sensible changes to the law to address the threat of terrorism. For example, we supported the government’s legislation which contributed to the strengthening of security at our airports. However, we do not support changes to the law that diminish or that remove the human rights of all Australian citizens, including the right to privacy and freedom from discrimination.
Joo-Cheong Tham from the law faculty of the University of Melbourne described the bill in this way:
While the bill aims to prevent terrorism, its measures are disproportionate and not subject to adequate safeguards. Its excessive character stems from overly broad ‘financing of terrorism’ offences. These offences criminalise conduct that has no link with violence or attempts to commit violence.
The breadth of these terrorism offences comes, in part, from the broad definition of terrorism which was put into Australian law by this government following the September 11 attacks in 2001. The Greens warned at that time that these changes to the law would begin a process of unravelling civil rights in this country, and that is exactly what we are seeing happen here.
Australia deported American peace activist Scott Parkin on the basis of a secret national security assessment by ASIO. Refugees have been detained on Nauru for five years because of secret security assessments by ASIO. In Australia we now have laws allowing for detention without charge or trial, including the detention of those not suspected of any crime but who merely may have information which ASIO wants. Australian law now permits indefinite house arrest based on speculation that somebody may be a terrorism risk. The Attorney-General has banned the Kurdistan Workers Party on the advice of ASIO.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-12-07,"—Mr President, I would like to add to an answer to a question from Senator Fielding in question time today. In October this year the parliament passed the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006—also known as the Dawson bill—with support from Senator Fielding, for which we are grateful. As the government stated at that time, the passage of the Dawson bill allowed the government to move forward with the next stage of its trade practices reforms dealing with the misuse of market power. The government made a commitment to consult with stakeholders on draft legislation in this area. That draft legislation is now in an advanced stage and consultation on it will commence very shortly.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-12-07,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the minister’s response.
It is unsatisfactory to not have an explanation in the Senate as to why there has been no answer to the series of questions which were asked on 4 October.
—Senator Brown, you have asked a question of the minister, he has given you an answer—that he does not have an answer—
—And I have moved to take note of that answer.
—and he has given you an undertaking to find out and get back to you. Now, he cannot do any more than that. Are you continuing to take note of the answer?
—I am. I draw your attention to standing order 74, which provides for that. The matter is an important one. It has become all the more important that these questions be answered since, following the release of the book The Hollow Men: A Study in the Politics of Deception by Mr Nicky Hager in New Zealand, a suppression order was issued by the then Leader of the Opposition in New Zealand to prevent that information—similar to the information being sought in the questions here—being put on the public record in that country. It is now history, only a week old, that the court order was to be lifted and the New Zealand leader of the National Party, the Leader of the Opposition there, resigned before that lifting occurred. What was found out, however, about the very serious intervention by the Exclusive Brethren in the democratic process in New Zealand was that every member of the conservative party in that country had been approached by the Exclusive Brethren and, in all cases except three, money was taken from the National Party members of the New Zealand parliament who were aspiring to government. That is, the colleagues of this Australian government across the Tasman were approached—
—They are not our colleagues. What a load of rubbish!
—What a load of rubbish! They are another country.
—The government members here are now disowning their National colleagues across the ocean, the conservatives in New Zealand. They can do that, but I am prosecuting a case of parallelism between the Exclusive Brethren’s approach to politics in that country and what we have a right to believe may be the case here when we have ministers failing to answer questions which asked them very simply: have you met with the Exclusive Brethren; if so, who; if so, when; and, if so, what matters were discussed? Every minister in this place knows the rules. When a question like that is put on notice, there are 30 days in which to answer. Every minister knows that my office has approached the government to ask why this question has not been answered. I can only assume that there is some form of collectivism going on over there—a defensive collectivism which involves not answering these questions.
The fact is that this Senate has the right to get that answer. We are going away now for a break until February—

Senator Lightfoot interjecting—

—The government members opposite who are interjecting may wish that I was not pursuing this case. They are highly embarrassed and they are seeking cover because of their connections with the Exclusive Brethren. There is no doubt the Exclusive Brethren in this country are the stalking horse for conservative parties when it comes to election campaigning. What we do know is that in this country, in New Zealand, in the United States and elsewhere, this secretive sect—which refuses to allow its members to vote, which despises the democratic system—nevertheless has busied itself with pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into supporting the Hon. Prime Minister John Howard, his government and his counterparts elsewhere in the world.
We Greens say everybody has the right to take part in the democratic process. But let it be on the record. Let it not be covert. Let it not be hidden. Let it not be in back rooms, as happened in New Zealand. Let there not be secret meetings. Let it not be a case where material used to attack the Greens in Tasmania turns up in New Zealand with a slight word change and gloating by the Exclusive Brethren that this is an effective way to ‘fix’ the opponents of the National Party in New Zealand. Of course, what happened in New Zealand was that they were not only spotted; they were discovered. They were discovered because some members of the NZ National Party were so disgusted with what was going on there that they decided they wanted it on the public record. And it now is on the public record.
I ask: what is the relationship between the Prime Minister of this country and the Exclusive Brethren? He has admitted to meeting them, but he will not answer the questions about where, whom and when, and what deals were done. I think the Prime Minister owes it to this country and its democratic system to be honest in this matter. I think every minister in this place owes it to the country to be honest.

Senator Milne interjecting—

—The Prime Minister, as Senator Milne says, talks about fundamental values. But it is a breach of fundamental values when there are covert groups like the secretive, antidemocracy Exclusive Brethren meeting with the Prime Minister and he will not say why. What is the Hon. John Howard’s explanation for not wanting to say whom he met and why, or what matters were discussed with the Exclusive Brethren—whether or not it was the Elect Vessel himself, Bruce Hales, the multimillionaire who lives in the Prime Minister’s electorate and whom he has met; or was it Mr Hales’s brother or some other member of the Exclusive Brethren? Why can’t the Prime Minister say what was discussed? We know what was discussed in New Zealand: it was election campaigning to get at opponents and pour thousands of dollars into a pro-conservative campaign—while hiding that fact from the voters; being dishonest with the voters.
The questions about the last election in this country, about the extensive and hugely expensive advertising by the Exclusive Brethren on behalf of or in the interests of the Prime Minister and the government, have not been answered. It is one thing for the secretive Exclusive Brethren to cover up on that, but it is another thing for the Prime Minister and the ministers of this government to cover up on that. Why has not one minister of the government in this parliament been prepared to answer these very simple questions and has preferred to breach standing orders which say that those questions shall be answered within 30 days? What is the embarrassment that is being covered up here? What secretive dealings are being kept hidden on this side of the Tasman while we await emails to be leaked or some honest person to come out and say, ‘Here is the record.’ All we want is the record of the relationships between this sect and the government. Amongst other things it has given the Exclusive Brethren specific provisions under the Industrial Relations Act to ensure that workplaces controlled by the Exclusive Brethren are no-go zones for unions looking after the rights of workers—30 of them! That is what I call quid pro quo. What I do not know is what the ‘quo’ is—
—Or the quids.
—The member opposite talks about quids. If he has got information about quids, let him put it on the record. That might clear the air a little bit. There is a stench over this relationship between the Exclusive Brethren and senior members of this government—
—Rubbish!
—and that will only be cleared when there is honesty in this place and the record books are opened and the questions are answered. I tell the government opposite: if you think that this is the end of this matter, if you think that all leads have gone to a dead end, think again.
—What about your electoral funding?
—To the member opposite, you ask me questions—I am asking the questions here today, and they are ducking for cover. They cannot wait to get out of this place. But I want them to know that this matter is far from finished—for this reason: you cannot have a fair and honest democracy; you cannot be open and honest with the people of Australia if you hide either in the Prime Minister’s office or in any other minister’s office records of meeting with a non-voting sect which opposes military training, which has a derogatory attitude to women and which bans children from going to university, for goodness sake, and expect that nobody will be concerned about it. These are matters that the government says it stands for: democracy and a fair go for everybody.
The Prime Minister has railed against groups that discriminate against women, but not this group. Never has he mentioned the discrimination, for example, in the workplace where no woman in the Exclusive Brethren sect can hold a position senior to any male in that workplace. What sort of attitude is that in 2006 in this country? What other group would escape Prime Ministerial odium if they banned thousands of children from a right to a university education in this country? This Prime Minister is silent on the matter. Quid pro quo? That is for him to answer.
—What about the schools?
—Senator Milne reminds me that there are thousands of dollars of taxpayers’ money going into a schooling system that offers no tertiary education at the end of it, at least as far as universities are concerned. Tens of thousands, if not millions, of dollars are going to the Exclusive Brethren schooling system, paid for by taxpayers who cannot get answers out of the government to simple questions through this parliamentary system.
This relationship is unhealthy. There is much more to it than meets the eye. We are on the last day here and I have waited for these answers. I am not going to delay the Senate anymore, but let me put this to the government very clearly: it is obliged under the standing orders of this parliament to answer these questions. It should answer them before we close this evening. If not, every member of the Australian public has the right to believe that this government is covering up.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-12-07,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.
Let me be plain about this. The minister for justice was asked about statements from the government regarding the anthrax scare at the Indonesian Embassy last year. Last year’s hoax was a very serious affair but it was not assisted by the Prime Minister’s eagerness to rush out and declare it was an act of murderous criminality without the preliminary testing suggesting it was a biological agent. This government’s eagerness to act as an agent of fear is all the more deplorable for its failure to correct the record once it learnt that its statements were wrong.
It is typical of this government. The principle here is very simple: when you become aware that a past statement is wrong, it is critical that the government correct the record immediately. Hasn’t this government learnt anything in 10 years? When you look at children overboard, it could have learnt a lesson but did not.
This is all the more important when you are dealing with matters of national security and potential terrorist threats. The government should be wary of becoming the boy who cried wolf. Its failure to correct the record in relation to past warnings and claims about something that turns out to be a hoax undermines the credibility of future warnings on similar matters, thus putting Australian lives in danger. That is the premise. This government should learn from that. It is completely unacceptable.
Senator Vanstone, the minister for immigration, is a key figure in the Howard government’s culture of denial. In the AWB scandal, we see them channel funds to one of the world’s greatest criminal terrorists to the tune of $290 million and then beat their chests about how pure they are because they grudgingly held a limited inquiry into this disgraceful conduct. But the culture of denial is rampant through this government and is demonstrated by the following statement. Senator Vanstone, in parliament on 10 May 2005, said:
The short answer is that I think the department do an excellent job. We are talking about 0.2 per cent of the cases.
And the PM, picking up on that I assume, on 26 May 2005, said:
And I’m told that of these 88,000, 201 individual cases fell into the category where a person was released after it was determined they were not here unlawfully and that was 0.2 per cent of the number of people who were located.
So it is this ability to say: ‘It’s a small margin.’ But if there is any doubt about where the source of the problem culture lies, Mr Palmer, when he conducted his inquiry nailed the Prime Minister and Senator Vanstone with this quote direct from the Palmer report, where he said:
It was suggested to the Inquiry that, of the thousands of removals and cases DIMIA deals with each year, the case of Cornelia Rau represents less than 0.001 per cent. The Inquiry considers that this statement, more than most, demonstrates the culture and mindset that have brought about the failures in policy implementation and practices.
There is something seriously wrong with the moral fibre of the Howard government when it relies on that, and it has been clearly outed by the Ombudsman. From answers from the minister given to the Senate today, it is clear that the culture of fear, cover-up and denial are still alive and well in the Howard government. When you look at the Ombudsman’s recent report, the Ombudsman, Professor John McMillan, said he was shocked by the report which highlighted serious administrative deficiencies in the immigration department. He added that the problem could be solved by proper leadership. That is what he said.
The minister is the person who should take the lead and demonstrate leadership. That is where the blame lies: in the inability of this minister to take her ministerial responsibility and accountability properly and deal with it effectively and ensure that we do not use an AWD defence of ‘We held an inquiry. We’ve opened the door.’ You have not corrected the problem; you have left the minister where she is. But I see that that could be corrected this Christmas. Mr Robb might get it yet. (Time expired)

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2006-12-07,"—I rise, on the last take note of answers this year, to talk about the question on the biological agent early in question time today. It seems to me that the criticism, if you analyse it, is not because there was no real fear about the white powder that was discovered at the Indonesian embassy, a country with which we are very closely associated; it was with respect to describing it as ‘a biological agent’. It was certainly biological; the difference in some people’s minds was that this disingenuously caused some fear when the term ‘agent’ was applied to the biology of it. I never knew that the powder at the time was being analysed—and it took several days to analyse it before it was discovered that it was actually flour—but fear is just as genuine when you initially believe something is dangerous and it is subsequently found to be not dangerous.
The Sydney Morning Herald described it as ‘Australia’s biggest terror scare’. That helps sell newspapers, but it is irresponsible for any media outlet, let alone one as significant as the Sydney Morning Herald, to use that phrase. It certainly was not geological, as we now know. Was it pathological? No—not now. Was it mythological? I think it probably was closest to that category. It certainly was not astrological.
But there are some powders that all look the same. It is very difficult, even when feeling them, to test the difference between different forms of white powder to which you could attach a name. Some of those white powders are quite common: flour; talcum powder; calcium carbonate, often referred to as chalk in its solid form; manganese glutamate; niacin, which is referred to commonly as vitamin B; artificial sweeteners; cement—you can get a white form of cement and, although it is dense, it feels like many of those other white powders I have just mentioned; the dust from gyprock after a ceiling has been fixed on new or repaired homes; laundry detergent; and gypsum.
These powders are all innocuous white powders. They are powders I am familiar with and have read about. I have maybe even touched most of them; I have touched some of them. I think the white powder scare at the Indonesian embassy caused us to set up a white powder room here in the basement of this parliament. Some are dangerous powders like anthrax. I recall in America some postal workers died; others became seriously ill because anthrax had been sent through the post. Some nitramines or explosives are white powders. Cocaine is something that, again, I am not familiar with, having never touched or ingested it in any way whatsoever. Diclofenac sodium, used as an anti-inflammatory, is a white powder. Ketoprofen is also an anti-inflammatory. There is boron citrate and lithium carbonate. Cyanide is highly toxic but is used in prolific amounts in the goldmining industry.
The real point I want to make today is not that the Prime Minister and others acted irresponsibly by calling it a ‘biological agent’ instead of a ‘biological’ what I am not sure—as they were accused by those opposite today—but that they would have been irresponsible had they not alerted the correct authorities which had due process, which had been laid down by this government in these matters and if that had not been followed and nothing had been said about it. If it had been a toxic or dangerous white powder then the Prime Minister and others could have been accused of irresponsibility—but not for carrying out their responsibilities in a most proficient and proper fashion, taking all those precautions necessary to ensure that no damage was done to our society.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,32,1
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2006-12-07,"—I rise this afternoon to take note of answers given to questions asked of Senator Vanstone, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Just a few days after we learnt of the compensation payout of $4.5 million to Vivian Alvarez Solon, we find again that we have the minister conceding that compensation is going to have to be paid out to victims of the incompetence of the immigration department. This of course follows the report of the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor John McMillan, as delivered by him yesterday. The report by the Ombudsman found serious deficiencies in the department. He found that it was these deficiencies that led to the wrongful detention of 10 Australian citizens, four permanent residents and four temporary visa holders between 2000 and 2005. Needless to say, all 10 of the people that I have just referred to have a legal entitlement to be in this country.
The most disturbing example is one that has been referred to this afternoon here in the Senate. Of course they are all disturbing, but this one really stands out; it is the case of Mr G. Mr G is a person who came here lawfully in 1975, I understand, from East Timor as a refugee. Unfortunately later in life he developed chronic schizophrenia. At the time that he was taken into immigration detention he had been living on the streets of Fremantle. He was detained by the immigration department for a period of 43 days in the year 2002 even though he had a valid visa.
Professor McMillan said in his report, the one that I was referring to earlier, that Mr G’s schizophrenia was plainly evident to anyone when he was detained. However, immigration department officials apparently did not make the inquiries that you would have thought would follow in such a circumstance. In fact it even went further than that. It is quite concerning, and I referred to this in the question that I asked, that some immigration officers were aware that there could be some, shall we say, problems with this case and they expressed some doubt that Mr G was being unlawfully detained one week after he was detained. He was detained for 43 days, but a week after he was detained immigration officials—some at least—became aware that there could be a problem here. In fact, one immigration officer was reported as having said, and I quote:
I also remain concerned that we have a person in detention who is a permanent resident ... and that we are on very shaking (sic) grounds to continue to hold him here.
This immigration officer went on to say, and this I find so appalling it is beyond words:
Fortunately, Mr G is not educated enough to consider suing us for unjustified detention however, I think we need to be very careful in regard to how long we continue to detain him.
This is an outrageous, appalling situation. We cannot begin to imagine the sort of trauma that Mr G must have experienced. But it was not only Mr G; the report found that eight of those who were wrongfully detained were children. I have spoken on many occasions in this place about children in detention. One of the children who was detained was held in detention for 214 days. When is this government going to acknowledge what it is doing here is just inhumane, unjust and an absolute disgrace? The Prime Minister’s response to this was, and I quote:
No administration is perfect; there are mistakes made.
That response is just an utter disgrace and he should be ashamed.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,32,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2006-12-07,"—The opportunism displayed in this chamber by the opposition is breathtaking. None of these matters would have come to light, none of these cases or indeed the questions asked of the minister for immigration this afternoon in question time would have been possible, had it not been for the action by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to undertake the hard work of confronting a problem within the department. The bouquets go to her. She is the one who has done the right thing.
Extensive departmental restructuring has taken place under the direction of this minister. There have been extensive departmental management changes under this minister. Improved protocols and detailed procedures have been instituted by this minister. She called for the Palmer inquiry and the Comrie report. These are the things that have been undertaken by this minister. May I say that it would be very difficult to find a more dedicated and successful minister. There has been absolutely no prevarication with respect to the problems surrounding Vivian Solon and Cornelia Rau. The government has been upset by and has taken full responsibility for these matters. That stands in stark contrast to what the Labor Party would do in similar circumstances, and I will come to that a little later. It is in absolutely stark contrast.
When Vivian Solon’s position was known, the minister responded and sought a whole-of-government response. She was provided with a support package almost immediately following the Comrie report. A Centrelink assistance officer was taken to the Philippines and put at her disposal. She had free medical and health care, including private services if required, for as long as she required. She had carer support for up to 24 hours a day for as long as required. She had health-related aid and transport to health services as long as required. There was a compassionate, responsive action by the government to do the right thing for this lady, who obviously had her rights transgressed. Other assistance included a $25,000 interim lump sum resettlement package, and free accommodation and transport. These were the things that the government undertook to do as soon as this matter became known.
This minister has been proactive. She called for the reviews that have elicited these 23 cases. But let us just look at a contrast. The minister for immigration, Senator Vanstone, has, at every turn, sought to do the right thing. But let us go back to the 10 Cambodian refugees or asylum seekers who were illegally detained. What did Labor do to address that problem, that scandal? Did they pay compensation promptly? Did they evaluate the rights that had been abused and transgressed of those 10 individuals? No. They legislated to restrict the compensation payable to $1 a day. That is what inmates at state prisons get—a dollar a day.
This was the great human rights touting, public spirited Labor Party at its best! And here they are today, lecturing us in a way that is utterly hypocritical—with the greatest of respect to my learned colleagues across the chamber. Taking people’s rights away and then legislating so you cannot be brought to account is the worst form of ‘good governance’ one could imagine. It does not happen in Cuba, it does not happen in China, but it happens in Australia when the Labor Party have their hands on the chequebook.
That is one of the most classic abuses of parliamentary majority one could imagine. The rights of 10 people were abused, in stark contrast to what has happened to Vivian Solon. The Labor Party sought to obliterate the rights of those people and to abuse their own parliamentary majority and legislate themselves security by squashing and quashing any opportunity for compensation. There is the hypocrisy of what went on under Labor in similar, comparable circumstances. They put aside the human rights of those 10 people and have the audacity to talk about the culture of denial.
There is nothing in these 23 cases that does anything other than indicate that this minister, at every turn of the corner, has done the right thing. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,32,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2006-12-07,"—I rise to take note of the answer given by Senator Abetz to the question I asked of him this afternoon. First of all, can I say how disappointed I was by the minister’s response. Those people who know anything about agriculture and the agricultural industry would know that the issues of invasive species and weeds are taken very seriously by industry all over Australia, and I think the trivial response that we received from Senator Abetz today did him no service at all. It certainly indicated that he really does not understand the issues that are within his portfolio. And to denigrate and trivialise the question to the extent that he did really seemed to me to be an admission of his lack of understanding of how important the issue is.
To remind the minister, and to remind colleagues here, I reinforce that there was a very substantial undertaking in this area by the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee in 2004, reported in Turning back the tide—the invasive species challenge: report on the regulation, control and management of invasive species and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Invasive Species) Bill 2002. The report was a very comprehensive piece of work undertaken in good grace and good spirit by the committee, and it found that invasive species are generally argued to be the second biggest threat to Australia’s biodiversity after land clearing and other forms of habitat destruction. So invasive species are not only of major concern to the agricultural industry; they are also a major concern to our environment and to our environmental movement, and, as I say, a threat to our biodiversity.
In the submissions to the inquiry, some very important evidence came to light. Dr Barry Traill, the President of the Invasive Species Council, said:
... with land clearing hopefully now sorted out as a destructive problem, with controls in Queensland and New South Wales, invasive species are probably now the No. 1 threat to nature in Australia.
And we know that Minister Abetz himself said, only a few days ago, that invasive species and weeds in Australia are probably the No. 1 threat, even above climate change. So it was a bit disingenuous of him to come into the chamber today and trivialise the issue in the way that he did.
I tried to explain to both the minister and to my colleagues in the chamber just how expensive an economic impact invasive species make. Weeds cost about $4 billion every year in lower farm incomes and higher food costs. Commonwealth, state and local governments spend at least $116 million every year on the costs of monitoring, control and management of and research on weeds. The figure of $4 billion is actually a very conservative one because it does not take into account the financial impacts on biodiversity, landscape, tourism, water and on labour costs of volunteers. And as a result of the introduction of pest species to Australia, ecosystems have become much more homogenous and biodiversity has been dramatically affected.
The question that I asked of the minister today was about funding for the proposed Invasive Species CRC. It was an important question because the government has dramatically changed CRC funding guidelines, requiring them to focus much more on industry and the chance of inventing or developing or selling widgets. It has just about wiped out all of the environmental CRCs, and all the existing CRCs that deal with sheep, cattle, pigs or cotton will not be funded under the new guidelines.
The judging CRC committee that rejected the proposal for an invasive plants CRC and a tropical savanna CRC took the view that tens of thousands of grain and livestock producers do not legitimately commercialise the research findings of the agricultural based CRCs. The committee obviously did not understand and does not understand either the science involved or the time scale that is involved in weed research. I understand that Minister McGauran says, ‘Well, no-one is making a fuss about all of this,’ and it is an issue that arose when he was the science minister. (Time expired)

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2006-12-07,"—I present the government’s response to the report of the former Legal and Constitutional References Committee on its inquiry into Australian expatriates, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—

Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee


They Still Call Australia Home: Inquiry into Australian Expatriates


Recommendation 1

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government establish a web portal devoted to the provision of information and services for expatriate Australians. A suggested name for the portal is www.expats.gov.au. The Committee recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade should be the lead agency in the development and administration of the expatriates web portal.

Responsible agency: DFAT


Response: Not supported

The Government does not support the recommendation. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) website (www.dfat.gov.au), particularly the smartraveller consular information website (www.smartraveller.gov.au), currently provides a wide range of information targeted at Australians travelling, living and working overseas. In addition, the government directory websites (www.agd.com.au) and (www.australia.gov.au) provide links to all federal agencies. The latter has a specific index for Australians overseas. An additional portal to be hosted by DFAT would be duplication and of marginal benefit over existing arrangements. DFAT would however welcome suggestions by expatriate groups as to what additional links or information could usefully be included in its existing websites to assist expatriates.

Recommendation 2

The Committee recommends the establishment of a policy unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to facilitate the coordination of policies relating to Australian expatriates. Responsibilities of the policy unit should include:
formulation of a coordinated policy regarding expatriates
consultation with groups from the expatriate community, industry, academia and other stakeholders in the formulation of policy; and
monitoring research developments and opportunities in relation to expatriates

Responsible agency: DFAT


Response: Not supported

DFAT can and does provide an on-ground point of contact for all Australians overseas through its network of diplomatic posts. DFAT promotes the interests of Australian expatriates and of Australia generally in a range of fields including trade, investment and commerce. Australian missions work closely and actively with Australian expatriate communities, organisations and social groups to maintain positive and productive links to promote Australian goods and services as well as information and cultural activities. DFAT’s core responsibility is to protect the interests of Australians internationally including by delivering a professional and wide-ranging consular service in support of Australians who may find themselves in distress overseas or requiring assistance. DFAT will continue to accord high priority to advancing and protecting the interests of Australian expatriates internationally, noting that these interests vary widely according to a range of geographic and demographic considerations.

Recommendation 3

The Committee recommends that the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade should continue to improve the statistical information collected in relation to Australian expatriates, particularly through the use of incoming and outgoing passenger cards.

Responsible agencies: ABS, DIMA and DFAT


Response: Accepted

The Government accepts this recommendation, noting that the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), DFAT and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) will continue to work closely together to improve the collection of statistical information.
The ABS is currently working with the DIMA to improve the statistical information collected through incoming and outgoing passenger cards and other DIMA data sources. These investigations should lead to improved information relating to Australian expatriates. For example, it would be possible to conduct analyses of Australian residents returning to Australia who have been overseas for a period of 12 months or more.
The ABS will continue its involvement in work being coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which may lead to improved information on Australians living in OECD countries.

Recommendation 4

The Committee recommends that the consular role for foreign missions be revised to contain a specific requirement that posts engage with the local expatriate community, in any and all ways possible appropriate to that location.

Responsible agency: DFAT


Response: Accepted

The Government accepts this recommendation noting that this is an existing requirement. Australian missions provide a broad range of services across, inter alia, consular, immigration, trade, cultural and business activities, as part of which there is a continuous process of engagement with local expatriate communities. In numerous posts a warden system is in place to ensure close and speedy contact with the expatriate community. An expansion of consular services, with an additional 15 officers to be posted to Australian missions over the next two years, as well as the appointment of 16 local support staff, will further improve the service delivered to Australians abroad.

Recommendation 5

The Committee recommends that the websites of Australia’s foreign missions should include on-line registration facility to enable local expatriates to register their professional profiles. The profile database will facilitate stronger engagement between missions and expatriates, and will provide a resource for missions in their work of promoting Australia’s interests overseas. It would also be used to notify expatriates of news and upcoming events.

Responsible agency: DFAT


Response: Not supported

DFAT has a responsibility for protecting the interests of Australians abroad and its foreign missions encourage all Australians residing overseas or travelling in high-risk areas to register with the local mission. Many missions have highly active links with their local expatriate community including news letters, social clubs, business groups and, in some instances, warden systems. The missions maintain contacts with local chapters of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, business councils, friendship associations, alumni and other expatriate organisations and their members. Each mission also maintains a website (in addition to the central DFAT website) which can provide information on local events and developments. The Government does not however support the recommendation for a register of professional profiles. Privacy considerations, potential for liability relating to claims by third parties and the need to ensure entries are maintained and up-to-date argue against the practicability of such a register.

Recommendation 6

The Committee recommends that the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 be amended to ensure that children of people who previously lost their citizenship under section 17 of the Citizenship Act are eligible to apply for Australian citizenship by descent.
Responsible agency: DIMA
Response: Accepted in Principle
The Australian Citizenship Bill 2005, which is currently before the Parliament, contains provision for the acquisition of citizenship for those over the age of 18 years, who were born overseas after an Australian citizen parent lost their citizenship under the now repealed section 17, subject to the applicant being of good character.
As these people did not at the time of their birth have an Australian citizen parent, they will have access to citizenship by conferral rather than descent. However, they will not be required to make the Pledge of Commitment and will become Australian citizens on approval of their application.
People under the age of 18 who were born overseas after an Australian citizen parent lost their citizenship under section 17 have been able to access Australian citizenship by conferral since October 2003.

Recommendation 7

The Committee recommends that the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 be amended to ensure that children of people who renounced their citizenship under section 18 of the Citizenship Act are eligible to apply for Australian citizenship by descent.

Responsible agency: DIMA


Response: Not supported

This matter was considered by the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee’s (the Committee) inquiry into the provisions of the Australian Citizenship Bill 2005 (the bill) and the Australian Citizenship (Transitional and Consequential) Bill 2005. In its report of 27 February 2006 the Committee commented “the Committee considers that this matter has been fully considered by the Government over a number of years and that renunciation is properly regarded as a more significant and conscious relinquishing of the bonds of allegiance to Australia. As such, the Committee accepts the proposed provisions” (which do not make provision for these people).

Recommendation 8

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs conduct a review of section 18 of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948.

Responsible agency: DIMA


Response: Not supported

Section 18 of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 was reviewed by the Australian Citizenship Council in 1999-2000. The Council commented “On average, about 112 people each year renounce Australian citizenship. The majority of people who renounce do so in order to retain another citizenship. The Council considers the existing provision appropriate and recommends that the provisions for the renunciation of Australian citizenship in section 18 of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 be retained”. The Government accepted the Council’s recommendation.
The Government also notes that while the majority of Australian Citizens renounce their citizenship in order to retain another, there are some Australian citizens that renounce in order to avoid significant hardship or detriment (for example, in order to obtain a security clearance to secure employment in the country of their other residence).

Recommendation 9

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs establish an advisory committee to review the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 on an ongoing basis to ensure that the legislation appropriately reflects notions of citizenship in the 21st century.

Responsible agency: DIMA


Response: Not supported

The Government has recently completed a review of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 to ensure that it appropriately reflects notions of citizenship in the 21st century. The results of the review are the Australian Citizenship Bill 2005 and the Australian Citizenship (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill 2005 (the bills). The bills were introduced into the Parliament on 9 November 2005 and referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee (the Committee)_ for inquiry. The Committee advertised the inquiry in The Australian newspaper and also wrote to a number of interested individuals and organisations inviting submissions. Information about the inquiry was provided to the Consular Policy Branch of DFAT for distribution to Australia’s overseas missions. The Committee received 67 submissions and held a number of public hearings.

Recommendation 10

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs continually review its website with a view to providing more detailed, accurate and specific advice and information in relation to citizenship issues for Australian expatriates. The web portal for expatriates (proposed at Recommendation 1) should also contain information on citizenship issues, including links to relevant parts of the website of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.

Responsible agency: DIMA


Response: Accepted

The Government accepts this recommendation noting that DIMA has redeveloped its citizenship website, www.citizenship.gov.au. The redeveloped site includes specific information for Australians overseas and informs clients where they can obtain further information.
The Government notes that DIMA regularly reviews and updates its citizenship website to provide accurate and timely information in relation to changes to citizenship law and policy, including for those living overseas.

Recommendation 11

The Committee recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs work together to improve citizenship advice and services at Australian overseas missions, and in particular that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs conduct regular training for staff in overseas missions to enable them to handle queries about citizenship from expatriates.

Responsible agencies: DFAT and DIMA


Response: Accepted

The Government accepts this recommendation. DIMA and DFAT will work on the continuous improvement of citizenship advice and services available at Australia’s overseas missions. The appointment of 15 additional consular staff to missions overseas in the next two years will improve the level of service delivered to Australians in a number of countries.
DIMA conducts training for all of its officers posted to overseas missions; as well as DFAT officers who undertake work on behalf of DIMA. Relevant staff will be given information and training on the changes to citizenship legislation passed by the Parliament.

Recommendation 12

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs provide an internationally accessible phone number for the Citizen Information Phone Line.

Responsible agency: DIMA


Response: Accepted in Principle

DIMA’s strategy for responding to citizenship enquiries from clients overseas is to consolidate enquiries by geographic region. This ensures that information on local arrangements is provided. DIMA has expanded its global contact centre coverage to provide clients with access to information across multiple service channels such as phone, e-mail and fax. The implementation of enhanced overseas telephone handling arrangements in the United Kingdom (which will also be expanded to include Europe) and the Americas provide access for Australian expatriates to citizenship information through both telephone (where they can speak directly to an operator) and e-mail.
In addition, DIMA provides comprehensive information on citizenship through the dedicated website, www.citizenship.gov.au.
Clients in Australia can access citizenship information and services through the Citizenship Information Line, 131 880, from 0830 to 1630 (Mon-Fri).

Recommendation 13


The Committee recommends that the 
Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918
 should be amended as follows to assist expatriate Australians to maintain their electoral enrolment:

Australian citizens moving or living overseas should be entitled to register as an ‘Eligible Overseas Elector’ if they left Australia in the previous three years, or have returned to Australia (for any length of time) in the past three years; and they intend to resume residence in Australia within six years of their departure; and
Australian citizens who have been living overseas for over six years should be entitled to renew their enrolment as an Eligible Overseas Elector if they have returned to Australia (for any length of time) within the last three years.

Responsible agency: AEC


Response: Not supported

The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 was amended in July 2004 to extend the period of time in which an elector may apply to become an eligible overseas elector after leaving Australia from two years to three years. This followed consideration of overseas voting issues by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the 2001 federal election. The Government considers that the provisions for enrolment and voting by Australians living overseas are appropriate and does not see the need to relax the requirements for these electors.
The Government also considers that Australians living overseas need to demonstrate a continued interest in returning to live in Australia to retain the entitlement to participate in its political affairs.

Recommendation 14


The Committee recommends that voting for overseas Australians should continue to be non-compulsory.


Responsible agency: AEC


Response: Accepted

The Government sees no need to change its current policy of exempting eligible overseas electors from the compulsory voting requirements of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.

Recommendation 15

The Committee recommends that the web portal devoted to the provision of information and services for expatriate Australians (proposed at Recommendation 1) should include a page of links to expatriate network websites, to facilitate engagement and information exchange in the expatriate community. The web portal should include a page where expatriate networks can apply to have their websites linked.

Responsible agency: DFAT


Response: Not supported

See response to Recommendation 1.

Recommendation 16

The Committee recommends that Australian non-profit organisations such as universities and arts organisations should pursue philanthropic contributions from expatriate Australians, and should combine their efforts to achieve benefits of scale.

Responsible agencies: DCITA and DEST


Response: Accepted

The Australian Government supports the encouragement of non-profit organisations such as universities and arts organisations pursuing philanthropic contributions from expatriate Australians.
For arts organisations, philanthropic income is an important supplement to government funding and other income and they are under increasing pressure to build and maintain relationships with their supporters to encourage greater giving. A number of arts organisations receive significant support from expatriate Australians with whom they have a strong association.
The Register of Cultural Organisations administered by the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts assists arts organisations to attract support by granting them Deductible Gift Recipient (DGR) status so that they can secure tax deductible donations in their own right in pursuit of their own cultural objectives. Similar arrangements apply to Australia’s public art galleries, museums and libraries. For many arts organisations, there would be limited scope for combining efforts across the not-for-profit sector to achieve benefits of scale, since success in securing philanthropic contributions is dependent on the individual organisation actively engaging supporters in its programs and activities.
The Australia Business Arts Foundation (AbaF), established by the Australian Government to promote private sector support for the arts, could play a role in helping the arts sector maximise opportunities for obtaining support from expatriate Australians. AbaF connects business, the arts, donors and foundations through three programs – Partnering, Volunteering and Giving. Through the Giving Program, AbaF works with donors and grantmakers, artists and cultural organisations to increase donations to Australia’s cultural life.
The Government agrees that the Lowy report presents a compelling case for pursuing philanthropic support from expatriates, and that non-profit organisations such as universities and arts organisations should be encouraged to do so.
The Australian Government is supportive of Australian university philanthropy. Most universities have offices which seek to attract philanthropic income which may include approaches to expatriates. Universities also actively engage expatriates through the development of strong communication strategies and alumni networks, for example some universities run events for expatriate alumni around the world, advertising widely through a variety of media and interested alumni are able to register online.
In support of these activities the Australian Vice-Chancellors’ Committee has developed a ‘Code of Practice for Australian University Philanthropy’.
Philanthropy to Australian higher education institutions is an area of ongoing interest to the Business Industry Higher Education Collaboration Council. In 2005, the Council examined philanthropy in the Australian higher education sector including tax system incentives and disincentives to investment in higher education by the private sector; and issues that present barriers or disincentives to donations and endowments to higher education, particularly from private sector individuals and companies. Although the work to date has not focused specifically on expatriate alumni, one of the findings was that the sector should look at improving communication with possible benefactors including alumni.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Legal and Constitutional Reference Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,33,1

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) website (www.dfat.gov.au), particularly the smartraveller consular information website (www.smartraveller.gov.au), currently provides a wide range of information targeted at Australians travelling, living and working overseas. In addition, the government directory websites (www.agd.com.au) and (www.australia.gov.au) provide links to all federal agencies. The latter has a specific index for Australians overseas. An additional portal to be hosted by DFAT would be duplication and of marginal benefit over existing arrangements. DFAT would however welcome suggestions by expatriate groups as to what additional links or information could usefully be included in its existing websites to assist expatriates.

Recommendation 2

The Committee recommends the establishment of a policy unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to facilitate the coordination of policies relating to Australian expatriates. Responsibilities of the policy unit should include:
formulation of a coordinated policy regarding expatriates
consultation with groups from the expatriate community, industry, academia and other stakeholders in the formulation of policy; and
monitoring research developments and opportunities in relation to expatriates

Responsible agency: DFAT


Response: Not supported

DFAT can and does provide an on-ground point of contact for all Australians overseas through its network of diplomatic posts. DFAT promotes the interests of Australian expatriates and of Australia generally in a range of fields including trade, investment and commerce. Australian missions work closely and actively with Australian expatriate communities, organisations and social groups to maintain positive and productive links to promote Australian goods and services as well as information and cultural activities. DFAT’s core responsibility is to protect the interests of Australians internationally including by delivering a professional and wide-ranging consular service in support of Australians who may find themselves in distress overseas or requiring assistance. DFAT will continue to accord high priority to advancing and protecting the interests of Australian expatriates internationally, noting that these interests vary widely according to a range of geographic and demographic considerations.

Recommendation 3

The Committee recommends that the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade should continue to improve the statistical information collected in relation to Australian expatriates, particularly through the use of incoming and outgoing passenger cards.

Responsible agencies: ABS, DIMA and DFAT


Response: Accepted

The Government accepts this recommendation, noting that the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), DFAT and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) will continue to work closely together to improve the collection of statistical information.
The ABS is currently working with the DIMA to improve the statistical information collected through incoming and outgoing passenger cards and other DIMA data sources. These investigations should lead to improved information relating to Australian expatriates. For example, it would be possible to conduct analyses of Australian residents returning to Australia who have been overseas for a period of 12 months or more.
The ABS will continue its involvement in work being coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which may lead to improved information on Australians living in OECD countries.

Recommendation 4

The Committee recommends that the consular role for foreign missions be revised to contain a specific requirement that posts engage with the local expatriate community, in any and all ways possible appropriate to that location.

Responsible agency: DFAT


Response: Accepted

The Government accepts this recommendation noting that this is an existing requirement. Australian missions provide a broad range of services across, inter alia, consular, immigration, trade, cultural and business activities, as part of which there is a continuous process of engagement with local expatriate communities. In numerous posts a warden system is in place to ensure close and speedy contact with the expatriate community. An expansion of consular services, with an additional 15 officers to be posted to Australian missions over the next two years, as well as the appointment of 16 local support staff, will further improve the service delivered to Australians abroad.

Recommendation 5

The Committee recommends that the websites of Australia’s foreign missions should include on-line registration facility to enable local expatriates to register their professional profiles. The profile database will facilitate stronger engagement between missions and expatriates, and will provide a resource for missions in their work of promoting Australia’s interests overseas. It would also be used to notify expatriates of news and upcoming events.

Responsible agency: DFAT


Response: Not supported

DFAT has a responsibility for protecting the interests of Australians abroad and its foreign missions encourage all Australians residing overseas or travelling in high-risk areas to register with the local mission. Many missions have highly active links with their local expatriate community including news letters, social clubs, business groups and, in some instances, warden systems. The missions maintain contacts with local chapters of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, business councils, friendship associations, alumni and other expatriate organisations and their members. Each mission also maintains a website (in addition to the central DFAT website) which can provide information on local events and developments. The Government does not however support the recommendation for a register of professional profiles. Privacy considerations, potential for liability relating to claims by third parties and the need to ensure entries are maintained and up-to-date argue against the practicability of such a register.

Recommendation 6

The Committee recommends that the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 be amended to ensure that children of people who previously lost their citizenship under section 17 of the Citizenship Act are eligible to apply for Australian citizenship by descent.
Responsible agency: DIMA
Response: Accepted in Principle
The Australian Citizenship Bill 2005, which is currently before the Parliament, contains provision for the acquisition of citizenship for those over the age of 18 years, who were born overseas after an Australian citizen parent lost their citizenship under the now repealed section 17, subject to the applicant being of good character.
As these people did not at the time of their birth have an Australian citizen parent, they will have access to citizenship by conferral rather than descent. However, they will not be required to make the Pledge of Commitment and will become Australian citizens on approval of their application.
People under the age of 18 who were born overseas after an Australian citizen parent lost their citizenship under section 17 have been able to access Australian citizenship by conferral since October 2003.

Recommendation 7

The Committee recommends that the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 be amended to ensure that children of people who renounced their citizenship under section 18 of the Citizenship Act are eligible to apply for Australian citizenship by descent.

Responsible agency: DIMA


Response: Not supported

This matter was considered by the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee’s (the Committee) inquiry into the provisions of the Australian Citizenship Bill 2005 (the bill) and the Australian Citizenship (Transitional and Consequential) Bill 2005. In its report of 27 February 2006 the Committee commented “the Committee considers that this matter has been fully considered by the Government over a number of years and that renunciation is properly regarded as a more significant and conscious relinquishing of the bonds of allegiance to Australia. As such, the Committee accepts the proposed provisions” (which do not make provision for these people).

Recommendation 8

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs conduct a review of section 18 of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948.

Responsible agency: DIMA


Response: Not supported

Section 18 of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 was reviewed by the Australian Citizenship Council in 1999-2000. The Council commented “On average, about 112 people each year renounce Australian citizenship. The majority of people who renounce do so in order to retain another citizenship. The Council considers the existing provision appropriate and recommends that the provisions for the renunciation of Australian citizenship in section 18 of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 be retained”. The Government accepted the Council’s recommendation.
The Government also notes that while the majority of Australian Citizens renounce their citizenship in order to retain another, there are some Australian citizens that renounce in order to avoid significant hardship or detriment (for example, in order to obtain a security clearance to secure employment in the country of their other residence).

Recommendation 9

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs establish an advisory committee to review the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 on an ongoing basis to ensure that the legislation appropriately reflects notions of citizenship in the 21st century.

Responsible agency: DIMA


Response: Not supported

The Government has recently completed a review of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 to ensure that it appropriately reflects notions of citizenship in the 21st century. The results of the review are the Australian Citizenship Bill 2005 and the Australian Citizenship (Transitionals and Consequentials) Bill 2005 (the bills). The bills were introduced into the Parliament on 9 November 2005 and referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee (the Committee)_ for inquiry. The Committee advertised the inquiry in The Australian newspaper and also wrote to a number of interested individuals and organisations inviting submissions. Information about the inquiry was provided to the Consular Policy Branch of DFAT for distribution to Australia’s overseas missions. The Committee received 67 submissions and held a number of public hearings.

Recommendation 10

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs continually review its website with a view to providing more detailed, accurate and specific advice and information in relation to citizenship issues for Australian expatriates. The web portal for expatriates (proposed at Recommendation 1) should also contain information on citizenship issues, including links to relevant parts of the website of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.

Responsible agency: DIMA


Response: Accepted

The Government accepts this recommendation noting that DIMA has redeveloped its citizenship website, www.citizenship.gov.au. The redeveloped site includes specific information for Australians overseas and informs clients where they can obtain further information.
The Government notes that DIMA regularly reviews and updates its citizenship website to provide accurate and timely information in relation to changes to citizenship law and policy, including for those living overseas.

Recommendation 11

The Committee recommends that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs work together to improve citizenship advice and services at Australian overseas missions, and in particular that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs conduct regular training for staff in overseas missions to enable them to handle queries about citizenship from expatriates.

Responsible agencies: DFAT and DIMA


Response: Accepted

The Government accepts this recommendation. DIMA and DFAT will work on the continuous improvement of citizenship advice and services available at Australia’s overseas missions. The appointment of 15 additional consular staff to missions overseas in the next two years will improve the level of service delivered to Australians in a number of countries.
DIMA conducts training for all of its officers posted to overseas missions; as well as DFAT officers who undertake work on behalf of DIMA. Relevant staff will be given information and training on the changes to citizenship legislation passed by the Parliament.

Recommendation 12

The Committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs provide an internationally accessible phone number for the Citizen Information Phone Line.

Responsible agency: DIMA


Response: Accepted in Principle

DIMA’s strategy for responding to citizenship enquiries from clients overseas is to consolidate enquiries by geographic region. This ensures that information on local arrangements is provided. DIMA has expanded its global contact centre coverage to provide clients with access to information across multiple service channels such as phone, e-mail and fax. The implementation of enhanced overseas telephone handling arrangements in the United Kingdom (which will also be expanded to include Europe) and the Americas provide access for Australian expatriates to citizenship information through both telephone (where they can speak directly to an operator) and e-mail.
In addition, DIMA provides comprehensive information on citizenship through the dedicated website, www.citizenship.gov.au.
Clients in Australia can access citizenship information and services through the Citizenship Information Line, 131 880, from 0830 to 1630 (Mon-Fri).

Recommendation 13


The Committee recommends that the 
Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918
 should be amended as follows to assist expatriate Australians to maintain their electoral enrolment:

Australian citizens moving or living overseas should be entitled to register as an ‘Eligible Overseas Elector’ if they left Australia in the previous three years, or have returned to Australia (for any length of time) in the past three years; and they intend to resume residence in Australia within six years of their departure; and
Australian citizens who have been living overseas for over six years should be entitled to renew their enrolment as an Eligible Overseas Elector if they have returned to Australia (for any length of time) within the last three years.

Responsible agency: AEC


Response: Not supported

The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 was amended in July 2004 to extend the period of time in which an elector may apply to become an eligible overseas elector after leaving Australia from two years to three years. This followed consideration of overseas voting issues by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the 2001 federal election. The Government considers that the provisions for enrolment and voting by Australians living overseas are appropriate and does not see the need to relax the requirements for these electors.
The Government also considers that Australians living overseas need to demonstrate a continued interest in returning to live in Australia to retain the entitlement to participate in its political affairs.

Recommendation 14


The Committee recommends that voting for overseas Australians should continue to be non-compulsory.


Responsible agency: AEC


Response: Accepted

The Government sees no need to change its current policy of exempting eligible overseas electors from the compulsory voting requirements of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.

Recommendation 15

The Committee recommends that the web portal devoted to the provision of information and services for expatriate Australians (proposed at Recommendation 1) should include a page of links to expatriate network websites, to facilitate engagement and information exchange in the expatriate community. The web portal should include a page where expatriate networks can apply to have their websites linked.

Responsible agency: DFAT


Response: Not supported

See response to Recommendation 1.

Recommendation 16

The Committee recommends that Australian non-profit organisations such as universities and arts organisations should pursue philanthropic contributions from expatriate Australians, and should combine their efforts to achieve benefits of scale.

Responsible agencies: DCITA and DEST


Response: Accepted

The Australian Government supports the encouragement of non-profit organisations such as universities and arts organisations pursuing philanthropic contributions from expatriate Australians.
For arts organisations, philanthropic income is an important supplement to government funding and other income and they are under increasing pressure to build and maintain relationships with their supporters to encourage greater giving. A number of arts organisations receive significant support from expatriate Australians with whom they have a strong association.
The Register of Cultural Organisations administered by the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts assists arts organisations to attract support by granting them Deductible Gift Recipient (DGR) status so that they can secure tax deductible donations in their own right in pursuit of their own cultural objectives. Similar arrangements apply to Australia’s public art galleries, museums and libraries. For many arts organisations, there would be limited scope for combining efforts across the not-for-profit sector to achieve benefits of scale, since success in securing philanthropic contributions is dependent on the individual organisation actively engaging supporters in its programs and activities.
The Australia Business Arts Foundation (AbaF), established by the Australian Government to promote private sector support for the arts, could play a role in helping the arts sector maximise opportunities for obtaining support from expatriate Australians. AbaF connects business, the arts, donors and foundations through three programs – Partnering, Volunteering and Giving. Through the Giving Program, AbaF works with donors and grantmakers, artists and cultural organisations to increase donations to Australia’s cultural life.
The Government agrees that the Lowy report presents a compelling case for pursuing philanthropic support from expatriates, and that non-profit organisations such as universities and arts organisations should be encouraged to do so.
The Australian Government is supportive of Australian university philanthropy. Most universities have offices which seek to attract philanthropic income which may include approaches to expatriates. Universities also actively engage expatriates through the development of strong communication strategies and alumni networks, for example some universities run events for expatriate alumni around the world, advertising widely through a variety of media and interested alumni are able to register online.
In support of these activities the Australian Vice-Chancellors’ Committee has developed a ‘Code of Practice for Australian University Philanthropy’.
Philanthropy to Australian higher education institutions is an area of ongoing interest to the Business Industry Higher Education Collaboration Council. In 2005, the Council examined philanthropy in the Australian higher education sector including tax system incentives and disincentives to investment in higher education by the private sector; and issues that present barriers or disincentives to donations and endowments to higher education, particularly from private sector individuals and companies. Although the work to date has not focused specifically on expatriate alumni, one of the findings was that the sector should look at improving communication with possible benefactors including alumni.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,COMMITTEES,33,2
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2006-12-07,"—Before question time I was outlining the terrorism laws that have been put forward by this government, to which the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006 and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 that we are debating are adding. I was speaking about the way in which the Attorney-General has banned the Kurdistan Workers Party on the advice of ASIO, using laws that would have allowed the present governments of South Africa and East Timor to also be banned.
What we have before us now are more laws giving enormous powers to another government agency—AUSTRAC—to require banks and other agencies to identify people they perceive to be a terrorism risk. Joo-Cheong Tham, from the University of Melbourne, said in the Age earlier this month:
Arguably, the most egregious feature of the bill is that it opens the way to increased racial and religious discrimination. Representatives of financial institutions have publicly contemplated breaching anti-discrimination statutes so they can comply with the provisions of the bill.
Joo-Cheong Tham gives the example of how the bill would affect Murali, a second generation Sri Lankan Australian who regularly sends money to his relatives in Sri Lanka:
Many of Murali’s relatives—
who live in areas controlled by the Tamil Tigers—
were badly affected by the 2004 tsunami. To assist them in rebuilding their homes, Murali sends thousands of dollars to Sri Lanka. Alerted by Murali’s “ethnic” name and the transfer of funds, a bank employee reports him to AUSTRAC, Australia’s financial intelligence unit. Her report describes Murali as posing a “risk of financing terrorism” and is accompanied by a dossier detailing all his financial transactions. AUSTRAC communicates this to ASIO and the Australian Federal Police, who then raid Murali’s home and charge him under anti-terrorism laws—
for funding the Tamil Tigers. Such racial profiling would normally be against the law, but this legislation overrides antidiscrimination law. By doing so, such immunity will mean that racial and religious profiling of not just Tamils but also many other ethnic and religious communities will become the norm. That is why the Greens will be moving an amendment in the committee stage of this bill to ensure that this bill and any associated guidelines which implement this bill comply with existing Commonwealth, state and territory antidiscrimination law. If we want to remove discrimination in this country, we need to ensure that it applies across the board. We should not remove these fundamental principles of our society and democracy when it comes to legislation dealing with terrorism.
This week the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security tabled a report on Australia’s terrorism legislation. The committee highlighted the negative impact that Australia’s terror laws are currently having on the Arab and Muslim communities. That is something that has also been identified by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the government’s own Sheller review into their terrorism legislation. The Greens have consistently argued that Arab and Muslim communities will be particularly affected by all of our existing terrorism legislation and, indeed, also by this piece of legislation.
Perhaps the worst aspect of this bill is that it not only sanctions discrimination but also provides immunity from legal action in relation to anything done in good faith to comply with the bill. For example, banks can report on you and provide your financial details to government authorities on the basis that you fit a risk profile—in other words, that you look different, sound different or have an ethnic name. That can be perfectly legal under this piece of legislation that overrides our antidiscrimination laws. The risk management strategy of the bank can be used to provide financial details of all of its Arabic customers, if it chooses, to AUSTRAC and through them to the police. This is perfectly legal under this legislation.
The government is effectively outsourcing this profiling to the banking and financial industry and its workers. The industry is required to put in place risk management strategies to identify anybody who is a risk. The problem for the industry, according to Adam Courtenay, writing in the Australian Financial Review, is that this is not being set out in the legislation. The banks are required to put in place a risk management strategy. Some time later, down the track, after this legislation has been dealt with by the parliament, AUSTRAC will develop guidelines about this process. No wonder the banks are worried! AUSTRAC is not accountable to this parliament and its operations are unlikely to be transparent. In the Australian Financial Review Adam Courtenay said:
While individual financial institutions have been left to work out how they are potentially exposed to the threat of money laundering and terrorism financing, and allowed to work out ways to address these risks, they have no idea how the new regulator, Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), will treat them and rate their efforts.
In the same article, Chris Cass, a partner at Deloitte in Sydney, said that he was not sure that ‘Australia’s financial community is mature enough to deal with a risk based approach to anti-money-laundering compliance’. He said:
‘The industry has come out of 18 years of a prescriptive reporting system and now they’re being left do their own thing.’
“A risk-based approach has its advantages but I’m issuing a word of warning to industry—the execution of a risk-based approach is a lot harder than actually saying it.”
The industry does know, however, that it will face penalties of up to $11 million for failure to comply with the new regime. So we should not be surprised when companies zealously implement a risk management strategy, throwing the net wide open and snaring anybody who may fit a terrorism-supporting stereotype.
We have already seen this happening in Australia under existing legislation that relates to the financing of terrorism. The Senate inquiry examining the new terrorism laws of 2002 outlined how a Melbourne businessman had his assets frozen because his record store shared the same name as a relatively obscure Peruvian terrorist group, the Shining Path. As a result, his record store was in limbo, as his accounts were frozen by the Commonwealth Bank. He spent several months pleading for assistance from the bank, the Federal Police, the Attorney-General’s Department and ASIO to try to rectify the situation. But all he experienced was buck-passing. It was only when he went to the media and told his story that someone—I am not quite sure who—gave the order to unfreeze his accounts.
If this had happened now, there could have been far more serious consequences for him. He could have been detained without trial, held for several weeks and prevented from telling his story because he posed a terrorism risk, and any court proceedings could have been held in secret. The government claimed that this was an isolated case. Guess what—it happened again. Just this week, there was a report on the Daily Telegraph entitled: ‘My bank thinks I’m a terrorist’. The report said:
IN the space of just one week—
an Iranian woman—
says she went from well-respected small business owner to terror suspect in the eyes of her bank.
The 32-year-old, who runs Sydney import company … is angry and bewildered at Westpac’s handling of what should have been two routine fund transfers last week, after she was told the bank had “reasonable grounds to believe” she was laundering money to Iran.
She is demanding a written apology from Westpac for the “offensive, explosive” language used by the senior manager who conveyed the decision to her.
Today … she is at a loss to explain why, after eight years of trading, the financial institution suddenlysuspects her of being involved in terrorist activities.
“I have nothing against being asked about my business, I just want it to be done in a professional and respectful manner,” she said. “I’d really like to know what’s going on if they think I’m breaching Australian law. They need to give me some evidence if there’s reasonable grounds for them to suspect me.”
Instead … she was called on to answer a series of increasingly aggressive questions about who she was transferring funds to and why—questions she claims the bank could have avoided by checking her financial history.
She went on to say:
“I’ve had an account with Westpac for eight years and on any one day we’ve got 70 transactions between restaurants, hotels, food stores which they can have a look at,” she said.
“They have all the information they need to establish the fact that we are a legitimate business. The only thing I can think of is that it’s a transfer to Iran.”
She says:
… she is still unable to access the $25,000 she needs to pay suppliers for stock she has imported—a claim the bank denies.
According to the article, a Westpac spokesperson confirmed that her transfers had been halted but said:
… the company was simply complying with antiterrorism legislation introduced in 2002.
So, under the existing legislation, these are the not isolated cases that we see occurring. It is a very real danger with this bill as well—that the banks and financial institutions told to look out for terrorists suddenly discover them in every customer who comes from the Middle East.
This bill will make a bad situation far worse. Well, what should happen with this bill? The Greens believe that we should start again. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, in its report examining an earlier draft of this bill, said:
The committee does remain concerned about the apparent lack of formal consultation with privacy, civil rights and consumer representative groups in the development of the regime to this point. … this may have resulted in some fundamental privacy, consumer and civil rights issues being overlooked.
As I have outlined, that problem remains in this version of the bill. At least earlier versions of the bill adopted a more direct approach in setting out exactly what needed to be done in the legislation. But this bill, after pressure from the industry, now allows a far more deregulated approach. As a result, there are no clear guidelines in the legislation about how this will work and there are no safeguards in place to protect civil rights.
The rules that set out the real boundaries of the law in this area will be set by AUSTRAC, and there is no requirement for them to consult with consumers who will be directly affected by these laws. The parliament is being asked to put in place major changes to the privacy and human rights of Australians, yet how this will all work is being left to an unaccountable agency—one that is not required to report to parliament.
The Greens will be moving amendments that address some of the worst aspects of this bill that threaten human rights. In particular, we will seek to limit the scope of the terrorism offences that will be used as the basis for conducting a risk assessment, as suggested in a submission by Liberty Victoria to the Senate committee inquiry into this legislation. The Greens believe that the scope should be limited to those terrorist offences directly related to violence—namely, those under division 103 of the Criminal Code—and we will move amendments to that end. The Greens want to see balance return to the problems of national security. Once again, the government has gone too far with this bill and got the balance wrong. The result is that people’s rights are threatened.
The Greens believe it is important to keep the threat of terrorism in perspective. Justice Michael Kirby of the High Court, in a speech to security and government officials last year, said that AIDS, poverty, malaria and ethnic violence were ‘more potent dangers for more members of humanity than the terrorism of al-Qaeda’. He went on to say:
If a small proportion of the energy and capital that has been devoted to the dangers following 11 September 2001 had been lavished on the problem of AIDS, I feel sure that the world would be a better and probably a safer, certainly a kinder place.
You could also add to that list the threat of climate change.
The Greens have consistently said that we believe that the longstanding practices and processes of criminal law and of civil rights should underpin our response to terrorism. The Greens will continue to lead a campaign to defend our democracy from terrorism laws that take away our civil liberties and that the coalition and the Labor Party continue to force through both our federal and our state parliaments. The Greens will continue to seek to focus the debate on the root causes of terrorism and the sources of injustice and inhumanity that plague us all.
The Greens would support an appropriate, balanced and sensible approach to dealing with the problem of terrorist financing, but unfortunately this bill is not that approach. It fails to set out in legislation clear guidelines for accountability and it will diminish human rights. As such the Greens cannot support the bill. We are operating in an environment where a guillotine is about to fall on the Senate debate on this bill—this piece of legislation which is 282 pages long and to which there are 18 amendments currently on the table to be debated. We are not able to amend this bill to make it the kind of legislation that achieves that proper balance between strong laws that crack down on terrorist financing and safeguards that ensure that people’s privacy is looked after and that we are not overriding antidiscrimination legislation that exists in state, territory and Commonwealth jurisdictions. That is the sort of legislation that the Greens would be very happy to support—if we were able to bring forward amendments to address those concerns. I will be able to move some of those amendments here on behalf of the Greens; I do not know with how much time, given that a guillotine is about to drop on this debate and all this discussion.
We have this bill before us, 282 pages of it, which says that banks and financial institutions have to come up with their own risk management strategies and then, sometime down the track, government agencies might provide some guidance on this issue. We should be dealing with comprehensive legislation that sets out the detail of what is proposed. It should be underpinned by the antidiscrimination legislation that exists in Australia and it should provide a balanced approach to this very serious issue of financing of terrorism. But we do not have that bill here before us and we do not even have the opportunity to go through the amendments that could ensure that we did have a proper piece of legislation that the Greens would be able to support. As such, I need to indicate that we will not be able to support this legislation, but we will seek to move a series of very important amendments to try to bring some balance back into the way in which this piece of legislation currently operates. They were proposed by people who made submissions to the very brief inquiry into this legislation and I hope they will be supported. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND COUNTER-TERRORISM FINANCING BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,38,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-12-07,"—I thank senators for their contributions. For that dedicated group of people who are anti-money-laundering aficionados and who have followed this very closely, this is an auspicious day. I summarise by saying that the primary purpose of the anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing legislative package is to ensure that Australia has a financial sector that is protected from abuse by those seeking to engage in criminal activity and terrorism—at the outset, a very simple objective and a very important one.
The reforms to be implemented by the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006 and Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2006 before the Senate today strike an important and appropriate balance between the government’s law enforcement and national security objectives on the one hand and the needs and operational reality for business on the other. Achieving this balance has required careful and assiduous policy making and drafting which in turn have been informed by extensive consultation with affected sectors, law enforcement and the wider community. I emphatically reject any suggestion that the government has taken too long in implementing the FATF recommendations. These important reforms respond to increased and more sophisticated criminal and terrorist activities across a wide range of sectors delivering complex products and services.
The need for thorough deliberation of these issues can be illustrated by the progress of FATF itself. Following its release of the revised 40 recommendations on money laundering in June 2003 and the nine special recommendations on terrorist financing in October 2004, the FATF has moved carefully in developing interpretive notes and guidelines. The last of these interpretive notes was only released in February this year. Given the importance and complexity of the issues involved, the government has moved with appropriate speed to introduce comprehensive and well thought out legislation. The breadth and responsiveness of the consultation process has been widely acknowledged and applauded by affected businesses. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has acknowledged these consultation efforts. I do not apologise for the time spent in achieving this balance and limiting the burden on Australian businesses. This has been time well spent and I acknowledge the great work that has been done by the officials of the Attorney-General’s Department in this regard.
During this consultation period the government also had the benefit of the report on the FATF mutual evaluation of Australia’s compliance with the FATF recommendations. The FATF identified several strengths in Australia’s existing AML/CTF system including the effectiveness of AUSTRAC as a financial intelligence unit, the extensiveness and apparently effective confiscation schemes involving criminal and civil confiscation of proceeds of crime, and the comprehensiveness of measures to facilitate a wide range of international cooperation. Australia was only found to be non-compliant in one out of the nine special recommendations on terrorism financing and nine out of the 40 recommendations on money laundering. The special recommendations dealt with capturing information on electronic funds transfers, and this issue has now been addressed by recent amendments to the Financial Transactions Report Act 1988. It is worth emphasising that in making its findings the FATF noted:
The Australian Government recognises the need for an effective AML/CFT regime and is currently updating its legislation to implement the revised FATF Recommendations.
This government criminalised terrorist financing in 2002 as part of the Criminal Code and in 2003 moved the money-laundering offences from the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 to the Criminal Code. The Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006 will provide an updated, more effective and more comprehensive response to these matters.
The extensive consultation on this bill has also included two reports from the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee handed down its second report on 28 November 2006. The committee made 14 recommendations. I want to acknowledge the very good work carried out by that committee in relation to this bill and also acknowledge the work done by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee in relation to its consideration, and I will deal with that shortly.
In recommendation 1 the committee recommended that the bill be amended to delay the first stage of implementation until three months after the date of royal assent. The opposition and Democrats also moved an amendment for delay of commencement, although their proposed amendments will only result in delay of part 1 of the bill. The government does not believe that it is either appropriate or necessary to tie the commencement of obligations under this bill to the finalisation of the rules. Detailed draft rules negotiated with industry have been available since July 2006. All rules required for those provisions which commence the day after royal assent will be available on that date. The timetable for finalisation of the remaining rules will provide industry with sufficient time to reach compliance. In particular, the government is committed to finalising rules required for the definition of ‘designated business group’ by mid-January 2007. All other rules necessary for those provisions which come into effect 12 months after royal assent of the bill will be finalised by 31 March 2007.
The government has also agreed that, for a period of 12 months after commencement of the obligations under the bill, the AUSTRAC chief executive officer will only take criminal or civil penalty action against a reporting entity where that reporting entity has manifestly failed to take steps towards compliance with its obligations. After discussion with industry the government is satisfied that the committee’s concerns about an adequate implementation time for industry can be met by extending this 12-month grace period to 15 months.
The government accepts recommendation 2 of the committee, and AUSTRAC will continue to consult with industry in developing AML/CTF rules under the bill. The government also accepts recommendation 3, which requires a review of the safe harbour provisions for customer identification during the review of the legislation under clause 251.
However, the government is not able to accept recommendation 4, which is that clause 6(7), referred to as the Henry VIII clause, be deleted from the bill. The opposition and Democrats have also moved the deletion of this clause. Clause 6(7) enables the table of designated services to be quickly amended by regulations where it appears that there is a structuring of products to get around items listed in the tables.
The history of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1998 has shown that a lack of ability to respond, other than by amendment of the act, enables products to become entrenched before an amendment can be made. This creates a competitive imbalance in the market, causing greater financial impact if a service is added to the list at a much later stage. Clause 6(7) therefore provides important protection for reporting entities and will also assist AUSTRAC. Regulations must be tabled and are subject to disallowances. The government commits publicly and without reservation clause 6(7) not being used for new designated services which relate to tranche 2 services without consultation with affected parties.
The government notes the concerns raised by the committee that led to recommendation 5, which is that the bill be amended to provide the AUSTRAC CEO with powers to refuse registration as a designated remittance services provider and to de-register providers or to maintain a register of persons who are not permitted to provide remittance services. The government has decided to implement a registration scheme, not a licensing regime.
A registration scheme has a number of advantages, including the fact that it does not confer any authority or seal of approval on providers of these services. Furthermore, by not excluding persons, registration enables AUSTRAC and law enforcement agencies to more easily identify and locate the providers of these services and to take effective action against those who do not register. The committee has, however, raised a legitimate question and it would be appropriate for a review of the registration scheme to be undertaken during the review of the legislation, which is provided for under clause 251.
The government is not able to accept recommendation 6, which is that penalties for the offence of possessing a false document with the intent of using it as customer identification in clause 138(3) and the offence of possessing equipment for making a false document in clause 138(5) should be reduced. The committee’s view is that these offences are far less serious than the offences of making a false document with the intent of using it as customer identification in clause 138(1) and the offence of making equipment for making a false document in clause 138(6).
The government considers that the types of conduct which make up all of the offences in clause 138 are of equal gravity. These offences, therefore, are the fundamental sanctions to the risk based regulatory regime proposed by the bill. The bill has civil penalty provisions only for failure to carry out regulatory obligations. The conduct of possessing false documents or equipment for making false documents with the intent to use them for identification procedures cannot be regarded as less serious than making a false document or making equipment for making a false document.
A person who makes a false document with the intention of producing that false document in the course of an applicable customer procedure under the bill is actively engaged in an illegal activity. The government is happy to continue to work with industry groups and other stakeholders to resolve technical issues as recommended in recommendation 7.
In recommendation 8, the committee recommended that the government consider amending the bill to include threshold value limits to exclude low-risk, low-value services—for example, the provision of travellers cheques and foreign currency transactions—further amending the bill to include those services that I mentioned from the definition of designated services, and that consideration be given to indexing these thresholds every five years. The government agrees to consider threshold limits for low-risk, low-value services, but I want to stress that low value does not necessarily mean low risk, particularly for terrorism financing—and we have seen that in recent events where there have been low amounts of money involved in the financing of terrorist activity.
While products such as travellers cheques, money orders, foreign transactions and bank cheques may appear to be similar products, they can and do present different risk profiles. Amendments to the bill are not required to implement thresholds as these can be implemented by regulations under clause 6(7) and clause 252, which amend items in the tables in clause 6 and AML/CTF rules made under clause 39.
The government is continuing to consult with industry on the need for thresholds and will make regulations or AML/CTF rules where it is agreed that a product is both low value and low risk for money laundering and terrorist financing. The committee has raised the legitimate question of indexing. The government agrees to review the various threshold levels in the review of the legislation to be conducted under clause 251.
In recommendation 9, the committee has recommended that the Office of the Privacy Commissioner conduct audits of AUSTRAC’s compliance with privacy obligations in its administration of the bill. The government notes that, under section 27(1)(h) of the Privacy Act 1988, the Privacy Commissioner has the power to conduct audits of records of personal information maintained by agencies for the purposes of ascertaining whether the records are maintained according to the information privacy principles.
The committee recommended in recommendation 10 that division 4 of part 2 of the bill should be amended to restrict access to AUSTRAC held information for the purposes of responding to money laundering, terrorist financing or other serious crimes. The government is not able to accept this recommendation. The transaction information held by AUSTRAC is a valuable law enforcement resource for the identification of crimes under Commonwealth and state law. The information is collected to protect Australian businesses and the community from not only money laundering and terrorist financing but also the predicate offences to money laundering. Information which suggests that a crime is being committed should be available for use by appropriate authorities in accordance with the laws which govern their operations.
The government supports the principle behind recommendation 11 but does not believe it is necessary to make the amendment to clause 235 which is suggested. The AML/CTF bill does not permit or authorise breaches of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. The explanatory memorandum clearly states that the AML/CTF bill is not intended to override the Racial Discrimination Act, and there is nothing in its operative provisions which could be interpreted to have that effect. Making this amendment could invoke legal interpretation rules which would require all other possible exclusions to be listed.
In recommendation 13, the committee recommended that clause 251 be amended to provide for review of the legislation in four years and for that review to incorporate consultation with industry and other stakeholders. The opposition and the Democrats have moved this as a proposed amendment. It is important to note that the legislation will not be fully operational for three years and three months for tranche 1 sectors. The timetable for tranche 2 sectors is not yet settled. Reducing the period in clause 251 to four years will result in a full-scale review of tranche 1 after only nine months of fully implemented operation and an unknown but almost certainly shorter period of operation for tranche 2 sectors. This could impose unreasonable costs on affected industry sectors in the community. The bill includes in clause 6(7) and the rule-making powers an appropriate mechanism to address any unexpected and unintended impacts which arise within that seven-year period. If major operational issues arise prior to the seven-year review which will require an amendment to the bill, they can be progressed in advance of any review under clause 251.
Labor senators have made an additional recommendation that AUSTRAC be subject to oversight by the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity upon its establishment. The issue of coverage of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity—or ACLEI, as it is known—was extensively considered by the government and the parliament during the passage of the law enforcement integrity act 2006 in June this year. ACLEI covers sworn police officers serving in the Australian Federal Police and sworn police officers working under the auspices of the Australian Crime Commission. The law enforcement integrity act 2006 includes the ability to extend ACLEI’s jurisdiction in the future should a need arise. No present need has been identified to extend these arrangements to AUSTRAC and it is appropriate that any decision to extend be considered in the context of the ACLEI legislation.
I once again thank the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for producing this report in a short period of time. The committee has done a very good job, given the complex nature of these bills. As I said earlier, I also thank the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills for its consideration of a number of matters. That committee has raised some issues about the application of absolute liability rather than strict liability to some elements of offences under clauses 136, 137, 139, 140 and 141. The government intends to amend these clauses to replace the application of absolute liability with strict liability. I believe this addresses the concerns expressed by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. We will address that in the autumn session, early in the new year.
The government is currently discussing with industry some other technical issues which might also result in amendments to the bill. As I have just said, I intend to bring forward a bill making the amendments arising out of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report—and any other technical amendments—in the 2007 autumn sittings of the parliament. I thank senators for their contribution to the debate on these bills. Since commencing the process of implementing reforms to Australia’s anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing reforms, I have been constantly impressed with the interest of industry and its willingness to participate in the consultation process. The level of industry and community participation in the development of these reforms not only has contributed to the development of a workable AML/CTF solution but also has provided a strong platform for ongoing cooperation between industry, the wider community and government in continuing with the detection and prevention of crime and terrorism.
I can assure the Senate that the government is committed to ongoing consultation with industry, as reflected in the legislation itself. Clause 212 requires the AUSTRAC chief executive officer to consult with industry in performing his or her functions. I believe that is further demonstration of the consultative process that we have adopted—and, of course, we stand on our record. The feedback I have had from industry is that they have been satisfied with the process and that they want it to continue. I certainly acknowledge, in the numerous meetings and the roundtables we have had, the constructive approach which has been adopted by industry and others. In that regard I wish to acknowledge the efforts of Tony Burke of the ABA, in particular, in relation to resolving what have been very complex issues.
Finally I might say that, although we have this bill here today, the challenge implementation still lies ahead, and we still have tranche 2. There is much work to be done. But I point out that, from recent visits to the United Kingdom and the USA, they too are undergoing the same process and face much work in this regard. The balance, as always, is to achieve security—appropriate anti-money-laundering measures which will counter terrorism and organised crime—but not to overburden industry with regulation. I commend these bills to the Senate.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2006-12-07,"—by leave—At the request of the Chair of the Selection of Bills Committees, I present the 15th report of 2006 of the Selection of Bills Committee and move:
That the report be adopted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,39,1
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2006-12-07,"—by leave—I move:
At the end of the motion, add “and, in respect of the Removal of Recognition of US Military Commissions (David Hicks) Bill 2006, the bill be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry and report by 20 March 2007”.
I do so because what this piece of legislation seeks to do is to remove from Australian legislation the recognition of US military commissions which were put into Australian law in the Proceeds of Crime Act in 2004 by the government and opposition at the time. These US military commissions have subsequently been found to be unconstitutional and therefore illegal by the US Supreme Court, yet they still exist in the Australian statutes. So this piece of legislation needs to be addressed and referred to committee.
I understand that in the discussion by the Selection of Bills Committee there was an indication that these matters had been dealt with previously, and that is correct, but there has not been an occasion for a Senate committee to look at the issue of whether or not Australian legislation should recognise the US military commissions that have now been found by the US Supreme Court to be illegal and unconstitutional. What the Australian Greens are seeking to do in this referral is ensure that Australian legislation does not legitimise a military commissions process in the United States that has been found by the US Supreme Court to be unconstitutional and therefore illegal. If we do not deal with this issue then Australian law will be the only law in the world that recognises the US military commissions that have been thrown out.
The government and the opposition may object to this legislation, but what I am seeking to do on behalf of the Australian Greens is ensure that it can be looked at by a committee. A committee has not looked at this issue since the US military commissions were ruled unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court. I accept the argument that, yes, this issue has been looked at, but it has not been looked at since the US Supreme Court ruled the commissions unconstitutional. That was a fundamental change and a fundamental shift, I would have thought, in whether or not people chose to recognise the military commissions.
The Australian Greens have never supported the US military commissions that were proposed as a way to try David Hicks, because we recognise that they are a kangaroo court. They are completely unfair. They are designed and set up to convict people such as Australian citizen David Hicks. We think that the parliament should never have recognised them, and in 2004 we voted against that. That was not a time when the government had the numbers, so they only got the motion up because the opposition supported them. The government and the opposition put into Australian legislation a recognition of these US military commissions that now the opposition claim they oppose. I am sorry; they voted for them in 2004 and that is why they are still in our law.
The Australian Greens’ legislation seeks to ensure that that recognition is removed. What I am doing now is ensuring that a Senate committee has an opportunity to look at that. Whether or not people agree or disagree, it is an opportunity for a Senate committee to discuss whether we should have on the statute books in Australia, in Australian law, recognition of a system of US military commissions that has been found to be unconstitutional in the US Supreme Court. They are unconstitutional in the US but they are on the statute books in Australia. Is that the situation we want? It is certainly not the situation the Australian Greens want, and we think the Senate should look at it. All I am moving here is that a Senate committee look at this issue: should we have on our statutes recognition of US military commissions that have been found to be unconstitutional? The Greens do not think so. We want the opportunity to at least look at that matter.
Clearly, we support the bill. It is a bill that I introduced into the parliament this morning in my name and in the name of the Leader of the Australian Greens, Senator Bob Brown, because that is our position. But come on: can’t we at least look at it? The government have said, ‘We don’t want to look at this matter. We’ve dealt with it before.’ I am sorry, but that is wrong. We have not dealt with this matter since the US Supreme Court ruled that the US military commissions were unconstitutional. This is the opportunity to do that. Does the Australian parliament want to look at the matter of whether or not Australian law should recognise the US military commissions that were set up some years ago to try David Hicks and were subsequently found by the US Supreme Court to be unconstitutional? Does the Australian Senate think we should look at the fact that these US military commissions are recognised in Australian law? (Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-12-07,"—On this motion, Senator Nettle, you do have our support. It is a matter of principle that bills can and should be referred from the Senate to committees in the way that you have asked for. The content of the bill is another matter, but in principle we would normally support these references. I think this reference is even more important because of a couple of issues that really do warrant a remark.
This marks the fifth anniversary of Mr David Hicks’s custody. Five years is an extraordinarily long time for anyone to serve in custody, particularly when there has been no charge, no trial and no conviction. The Howard government have abdicated the rule of law. The Howard government are opposing this reference. Why? Because they want to hide behind their culpability for their appalling treatment of Mr David Hicks. Whether this bill will help Mr David Hicks, the opposition does not know, but the purpose of the inquiry is a reasonable request for the government to agree to. On a day when the government have referred a ridiculous number of bills to committees, it really is astonishing that they seek to oppose this one.
The government have sacrificed one of their own citizens to a military commission process. If you take a look at the Supreme Court ruling that Senator Nettle has looked at, you see that we do actually have a bit of a window here that the government could act upon. There are currently, as I understand it, no charges laid under the new military commissions process. The government have asserted that Mr Hicks cannot be returned to Australia because he cannot be prosecuted here. I think that really does not stand up. That is the point now, given this window. The government would have liked that window to close, but it is still open.
Senior US legal officials have made it very clear that they do not require prosecution at home to release detainees from Guantanamo Bay. So there are no charges and no requirement by US officials. Therefore, the impediment is this government; it is not the US. This is an issue that the Australian government can resolve. Australian laws are more than adequate now to deal with any security risks that the government might think Mr Hicks poses. If Mr Hicks is assessed to pose a security risk to the community, I would be astonished to think that after the last five years you have not patched up all the holes in our security laws to such an extent that there would not be a gap. I would be keen to know if you think there is a gap in our security laws. Over the last number of years there certainly has not seemed to be one.
I am not one for generally suggesting ways or means, but there seem to be sufficient laws available to deal with any assessed security risk that Mr Hicks may pose if released into Australian custody. There are control orders that can monitor a person’s movement, but, as I said, I do not like to suggest these types of solutions. This is a government that can come up with a solution if it puts its mind to it. On that note, the opposition supports the reference of the Removal of Recognition of US Military Commissions (David Hicks) Bill 2006 to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,39,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-12-07,"—The Democrats support this motion. We believe that, almost invariably—like the opposition, I probably cannot say always—a senator, a group of senators or, in this case, a party are entitled to have a bill referred to a committee for examination. This is an important and necessary point in the assessment of whether our laws are in conflict with the reality of the laws as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States and as accepted by the President of the United States and the Congress and Senate of the United States. The matter at hand is one of the worst examples of egregious conduct I can think of by this government. That you have deserted an Australian citizen, as you have done, is unfortunately going to be a blight on this government for all time, and history will not judge you kindly. You do lots of good works in other areas but unfortunately this stain will mark this government, and some of you need to do something about it. In the meantime the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which is highly regarded in this place, should be entitled to do look at this matter on its merits.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,39,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-12-07,"—In relation to this matter, the Anti-terrorism Bill 2004 was considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. In that case it was recommended—I think it was recommendation VIII of the committee’s report on the bill—that there be a deletion of the subsections that would have the effect of restricting commercial exploitation by persons who have committed offences triable by a military commission. During consideration of the bill at that time, the government made it clear that it did not support the recommendation that references to US military commissions be removed from the act.
The government continues to believe that the provisions are appropriate. The government believes that this matter has been canvassed previously by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and that it is a relatively straightforward question. The government believes that the amendments enacted to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 which were contained in the Anti-terrorism Act 2004 are reasonable amendments. They ensure that persons who have committed an offence or who may in future be subject to a military commission offence can be prevented from profiting from the proceeds derived from their activities. This has been canvassed. The lawyers acting on behalf of Mr Hicks have filed a claim in the Federal Court of Australia in relation to David Hicks’s case. The government believes that the proposed reasons for the referral could seek to address issues that are now before the courts and that it would be inappropriate to progress an inquiry in the terms proposed. For those reasons, the government believes that this matter should not be referred to the committee as proposed.
As I have said at question time and in other places, the government continues to press the United States authorities for the trial of David Hicks. It has done so for a lengthy period of time and will continue to do so. In this particular case, however, the matter has been dealt with by a Senate committee before, and we have the situation of the legal proceedings which I have mentioned. For those reasons, the government will be opposing Senator Nettle’s motion to amend the report—and that is what leave was given for. I think it is a fairly straightforward matter in relation to the reference. The David Hicks matter, of course, is not a simple one; it is a very difficult and complex one, and we have acknowledged that.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,39,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-12-07,"—What appalling arrogance there is in what the minister has just said! He does not believe that a committee should be left to determine for itself whether it is able to work while steering clear of any legal matters that might be before the courts of this country. Since when did governments dictate that to committees? Never. That is a very specious argument, but it points to the government’s arrogance in believing that, since it has the numbers in the Senate, it therefore has the right. Senator Nettle has moved an amendment to, quite properly, have a committee look at a piece of legislation that she and I have brought into the chamber to remove a reference to—and an inherent subservience to—American military commissions under legislation in this country, which does not exist under legislation in any other country on the face of the planet. It is an extraordinary situation that it used to be in legislation in the United States but it effectively does not exist anymore, because it has been found that the American military commissions were illegal under the US Constitution and US law.
The only place left in the world which recognises this kangaroo court is Australia, under legislation brought in by the Howard government and supported by the then Beazley opposition. It is on the statute books in this country. The minister says: ‘Well, it was looked at in 2004 and the committee recommended against it. But we overruled that committee and we went ahead, so we shouldn’t have to look at it now. We had that advice and ignored it.’ The minister is saying, ‘We will not put this to a committee, because either it will agree with us in keeping recognition of the American military commissions on the statutes or, if it doesn’t, we’ll ignore it anyway.’ What extraordinary arrogance there is in that.
The decency of this situation in democratic terms is simply that this piece of legislation should be looked at by the committee. The world has changed. America has found that the military commissions it has set up are no longer legal. President Bush accepts that; he does not recognise them. Prime Minister Howard does recognise them. Here we have his minister saying that the government does not want to remove that recognition. That is an extraordinary thing of itself. It is tied to the sorry tale of the United States now saying they are not winning the war in Iraq. But our Prime Minister will not go along with that. He is the last leader left standing on the face of the planet who cannot face the reality of the gruesome situation which has unfolded in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq.
Let the proper process take place here and let this matter go to a committee. That is what should happen and that is what the government should be supporting if it thinks its position is tenable.

This marks the fifth anniversary of Mr David Hicks’s custody. Five years is an extraordinarily long time for anyone to serve in custody, particularly when there has been no charge, no trial and no conviction. The Howard government have abdicated the rule of law. The Howard government are opposing this reference. Why? Because they want to hide behind their culpability for their appalling treatment of Mr David Hicks. Whether this bill will help Mr David Hicks, the opposition does not know, but the purpose of the inquiry is a reasonable request for the government to agree to. On a day when the government have referred a ridiculous number of bills to committees, it really is astonishing that they seek to oppose this one.
The government have sacrificed one of their own citizens to a military commission process. If you take a look at the Supreme Court ruling that Senator Nettle has looked at, you see that we do actually have a bit of a window here that the government could act upon. There are currently, as I understand it, no charges laid under the new military commissions process. The government have asserted that Mr Hicks cannot be returned to Australia because he cannot be prosecuted here. I think that really does not stand up. That is the point now, given this window. The government would have liked that window to close, but it is still open.
Senior US legal officials have made it very clear that they do not require prosecution at home to release detainees from Guantanamo Bay. So there are no charges and no requirement by US officials. Therefore, the impediment is this government; it is not the US. This is an issue that the Australian government can resolve. Australian laws are more than adequate now to deal with any security risks that the government might think Mr Hicks poses. If Mr Hicks is assessed to pose a security risk to the community, I would be astonished to think that after the last five years you have not patched up all the holes in our security laws to such an extent that there would not be a gap. I would be keen to know if you think there is a gap in our security laws. Over the last number of years there certainly has not seemed to be one.
I am not one for generally suggesting ways or means, but there seem to be sufficient laws available to deal with any assessed security risk that Mr Hicks may pose if released into Australian custody. There are control orders that can monitor a person’s movement, but, as I said, I do not like to suggest these types of solutions. This is a government that can come up with a solution if it puts its mind to it. On that note, the opposition supports the reference of the Removal of Recognition of US Military Commissions (David Hicks) Bill 2006 to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,39,2
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-12-07,"—The Democrats support this motion. We believe that, almost invariably—like the opposition, I probably cannot say always—a senator, a group of senators or, in this case, a party are entitled to have a bill referred to a committee for examination. This is an important and necessary point in the assessment of whether our laws are in conflict with the reality of the laws as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States and as accepted by the President of the United States and the Congress and Senate of the United States. The matter at hand is one of the worst examples of egregious conduct I can think of by this government. That you have deserted an Australian citizen, as you have done, is unfortunately going to be a blight on this government for all time, and history will not judge you kindly. You do lots of good works in other areas but unfortunately this stain will mark this government, and some of you need to do something about it. In the meantime the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which is highly regarded in this place, should be entitled to do look at this matter on its merits.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,39,2
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-12-07,"—In relation to this matter, the Anti-terrorism Bill 2004 was considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. In that case it was recommended—I think it was recommendation VIII of the committee’s report on the bill—that there be a deletion of the subsections that would have the effect of restricting commercial exploitation by persons who have committed offences triable by a military commission. During consideration of the bill at that time, the government made it clear that it did not support the recommendation that references to US military commissions be removed from the act.
The government continues to believe that the provisions are appropriate. The government believes that this matter has been canvassed previously by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and that it is a relatively straightforward question. The government believes that the amendments enacted to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 which were contained in the Anti-terrorism Act 2004 are reasonable amendments. They ensure that persons who have committed an offence or who may in future be subject to a military commission offence can be prevented from profiting from the proceeds derived from their activities. This has been canvassed. The lawyers acting on behalf of Mr Hicks have filed a claim in the Federal Court of Australia in relation to David Hicks’s case. The government believes that the proposed reasons for the referral could seek to address issues that are now before the courts and that it would be inappropriate to progress an inquiry in the terms proposed. For those reasons, the government believes that this matter should not be referred to the committee as proposed.
As I have said at question time and in other places, the government continues to press the United States authorities for the trial of David Hicks. It has done so for a lengthy period of time and will continue to do so. In this particular case, however, the matter has been dealt with by a Senate committee before, and we have the situation of the legal proceedings which I have mentioned. For those reasons, the government will be opposing Senator Nettle’s motion to amend the report—and that is what leave was given for. I think it is a fairly straightforward matter in relation to the reference. The David Hicks matter, of course, is not a simple one; it is a very difficult and complex one, and we have acknowledged that.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,39,2
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-12-07,"—What appalling arrogance there is in what the minister has just said! He does not believe that a committee should be left to determine for itself whether it is able to work while steering clear of any legal matters that might be before the courts of this country. Since when did governments dictate that to committees? Never. That is a very specious argument, but it points to the government’s arrogance in believing that, since it has the numbers in the Senate, it therefore has the right. Senator Nettle has moved an amendment to, quite properly, have a committee look at a piece of legislation that she and I have brought into the chamber to remove a reference to—and an inherent subservience to—American military commissions under legislation in this country, which does not exist under legislation in any other country on the face of the planet. It is an extraordinary situation that it used to be in legislation in the United States but it effectively does not exist anymore, because it has been found that the American military commissions were illegal under the US Constitution and US law.
The only place left in the world which recognises this kangaroo court is Australia, under legislation brought in by the Howard government and supported by the then Beazley opposition. It is on the statute books in this country. The minister says: ‘Well, it was looked at in 2004 and the committee recommended against it. But we overruled that committee and we went ahead, so we shouldn’t have to look at it now. We had that advice and ignored it.’ The minister is saying, ‘We will not put this to a committee, because either it will agree with us in keeping recognition of the American military commissions on the statutes or, if it doesn’t, we’ll ignore it anyway.’ What extraordinary arrogance there is in that.
The decency of this situation in democratic terms is simply that this piece of legislation should be looked at by the committee. The world has changed. America has found that the military commissions it has set up are no longer legal. President Bush accepts that; he does not recognise them. Prime Minister Howard does recognise them. Here we have his minister saying that the government does not want to remove that recognition. That is an extraordinary thing of itself. It is tied to the sorry tale of the United States now saying they are not winning the war in Iraq. But our Prime Minister will not go along with that. He is the last leader left standing on the face of the planet who cannot face the reality of the gruesome situation which has unfolded in Baghdad and elsewhere in Iraq.
Let the proper process take place here and let this matter go to a committee. That is what should happen and that is what the government should be supporting if it thinks its position is tenable.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2006-12-07,"—I rise to speak on behalf of the Labor Party on the Customs Legislation Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2006, which will amend the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to give effect to an agreement between Australia and New Zealand to amend the rules of origin under the CER trade agreement between our two countries. In particular this bill replaces the current regional value content rules of origin with the change of classification rules. The intent of rules of origin is to determine whether a product can be classified as domestically produced for the purposes of receiving preferential tariff treatment under a trade agreement.
Under existing rules a New Zealand product exported here can receive preferential treatment provided the last production process occurred in New Zealand and a minimum of 50 per cent of the cost of production also occurred in New Zealand. Under the proposed changes a good will receive preferential tariff treatment if it has been substantially transformed, which is defined as a change of tariff classification under the harmonised system of tariff codes, a system defined by the World Customs Organisation. The need for this change is based on the growing complexity in global supply chains, which is rendering the existing value based system irrelevant. Under the current RVC system, should the final process of manufacture occur in a third country, the product will not qualify for preferential treatment, no matter how minor the final process. This is the case if even more than 50 per cent of the cost of manufacture has occurred in Australia or New Zealand.
The Productivity Commission in 2004 completed a report on the Australia-New Zealand rules of origin, which concluded that they were both out of date and imposed unnecessary constraints on trade. In advocating a move towards a change of classification method the commission argued, first, that it would reduce compliance costs; second, that it would remove the impact of price changes or exchange rate movements on origin status; third, it would increase certainty; and, finally, it would require minimal records for Customs audits.
The change of classification method was also adopted under the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement and the Australia-Thailand Free Trade Agreement. Therefore, moving the arrangements between Australia and New Zealand in this direction will deliver greater consistency, and in particular practical benefits for companies that export to two or three of the countries mentioned.
By and large Labor is supportive of these amendments, since they deliver a modern and more consistent method for prescribing preferential tariff treatment. We did have a concern with the government’s inadequate consultation process in relation to these amendments. This is an emerging and continuing problem with this government that is not assisted by the short time that is now being allocated for Senate committee inquiries. In particular, there is at least one company that could needlessly be negatively affected by the change to the point where significant numbers of jobs may be at risk. I understand my colleague Ms Roxon has covered this issue in detail in the other place. We wish to make the point that more effective consultation prior to the introduction of the bill might have helped in this situation, particularly in relation to that company. Other than this, Labor is in support of the changes contained in the bill and we commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (NEW ZEALAND RULES OF ORIGIN) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,41,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-12-07,"—As I undertook earlier, there are a couple of issues that Senator Ludwig raised in relation to the anti-money-laundering bill. I think there was a question in relation to why AUSTRAC could not share information with the United Nations. Section 27(11A) of the Financial Transactions Reports Act permits disclosure of intelligence to a foreign country. This section has been replicated in clause 132 of the AML/CTF bill. That carries through that the exchange of financial intelligence is designed to enable effective action to be taken to prevent the commission of money laundering or predicate offences or to enable effective investigation of those offences by law enforcement agencies. The United Nations is a diverse organisation which is neither a law enforcement agency nor an investigatory body. General disclosure of AUSTRAC information to such a body is an inappropriate approach to the proper use and protection of this information.
Basically, what we are saying is that it is appropriate that AUSTRAC deal with other law enforcement agencies—the authorities of other countries—and this applies domestically to state and territory police and to such a thing as a royal commission. Designated agencies in clause 5 include Commonwealth, state and territory royal commissions. In the event that a similar inquiry is established by the UN in the future, amendments to the act could be considered, but in the meanwhile we do not think it is appropriate that AUSTRAC share that information for those reasons. I think that has dealt with that issue.
The other issue deals with deregistration of providers of remittance services. I think the important point to note here is that, whether or not they are registered, remittance service providers are reporting entities under the bill and are subject to all relevant provisions of the bill. A power to remove providers of designated remittance services from the register under part 10 of the bill is not necessary. The government has decided to implement FTRA special recommendation 6 by establishing a registration scheme for remittance service providers. Registration will not confer any authority or seal of approval on providers of these services. It merely will enable AUSTRAC and law enforcement agencies to identify and locate the providers of these services and to take effective action against those who do not register. That is the rationale for that issue, and I put that on the record.
In relation to the Customs Legislation Amendment (New Zealand Rules of Origin) Bill 2006, I thank Senator Wong for her contribution. The proposed new Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement is the result of a lengthy process. It is a process that included a study by the Productivity Commission, extensive consultations within the Australian government and Australian industry and detailed negotiations with the New Zealand government. The Productivity Commission’s research report on the agreement released on 28 May 2004 concluded that the inserted ROO were outdated and acted as a constraint on further trans-Tasman trade.
The proposed amendments to the closer economic relations agreement allow for a change in tariff classification methods to be used in determining whether the goods meet the rules of origin for CER. Rules of origin—ROO, as they are known—are an important aspect in relation to the CER. The new CTS method, together with the current factory cost method, will allow importers on both sides of the Tasman to have the option of using either method until 31 December 2011, when the factory cost method will cease to operate.
The government and industry are aware of one manufacturer who does not support the change in tariff classification methodology. I am advised that, together with national newspaper advertising by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, they and other departments undertook industry wide consultations. In December 2004 this resulted in the Australian Industry Group advising all its members, including that manufacturer, of potential changes to the CER rules in its newsletter in December 2004.
The amendments will simplify the process of determining whether a good from New Zealand is a New Zealand originating good. The current factory cost method can be administratively burdensome for the manufacturer and can lead to uncertainty because of exchange rates as an example. The proposed amendments will bring greater certainty and be administratively simpler. They will improve efficiency by allowing greater use of inputs not produced in Australia or New Zealand without an adverse impact on the ability to claim origin, and they are consistent with the international trend to use the CDC approach.
I commend the amendments as cementing even further the stronger economic and trade relationship between Australia and New Zealand that has grown significantly since the entry into force of the CER in 1983. I might add that, just recently, I met with my counterpart, the New Zealand Minister of Customs, and we enjoyed a very constructive session of talks. We are both totally committed to enhancing the closer ties between the Customs services of our two countries. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-12-07,"—Given the time, I will deal with just the broad areas that I want to touch upon in the Crimes Amendment (Bail and Sentencing) Bill 2006. In the other place the government has amended this law on the basis that it seems to be better to have bad consistent law than to have bad inconsistent law. But I want to make one thing clear: Labor’s view is that this bill represents bad law. Labor was opposed to the removal of the reference to cultural background in bail and sentencing procedures when we debated the bill previously, and we are opposed to the additional references that will now be removed.
Let me explain. I raised the issue of section 19B when we debated the bill previously. What was exposed, particularly with the minister’s inability to provide anything that resembled an explanation for the inconsistency, was just how rushed this bill and ill-considered this legislation is. What it also exposed was the true motive. The true motive of this bill is to divert attention from the failings of the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and those of the government more widely, specifically in this area. If this exercise were actually about improving the problems in the law, the government would have taken a thorough and consistent approach to drafting the legislation in the first place. It also would have supplied a written explanatory memorandum that laid the case for change and provided evidence to support it. I suspect that it would have also consulted a lot more broadly.
But, of course, that is not what happened. Instead, we witnessed the Minister for Justice and Customs mumbling through a justification for the inconsistency, only for him to turn and around and say, ‘The Attorney-General will address the matter when the bill reaches the House.’ Then, when the Attorney-General did turn to the matter with his amendments, it turned into an even bigger fiasco. The additional three amendments moved in the House of Representatives dealt with forensic procedures and had nothing to do with bail and sentencing. As such, it seems to me that they are unrelated to the primary purpose of this bill.
As the explanatory memorandum states, the purpose of this bill is to amend the sentencing and bail provisions in the Crimes Act 1914 in accordance with the decision made by the Council of Australian Governments on 14 July 2006 following the Intergovernmental Summit on Violence and Child Abuse in Indigenous Communities on 26 June 2006. Yet we now have a bill which actually amends the forensic procedures provisions as well, even though that is not its stated purpose and does not deal with one of those matters that could reasonably come under the heading of the Intergovernmental Summit on Violence and Child Abuse in Indigenous Communities of the Council of Australian Governments. I think that lie has been exposed.
This government does not seem to be able to grasp the concept that forensic procedures are not performed by courts during bail and sentencing procedures. It appears that the Attorney-General, or one of his staff, decided to use a computer to search the Crimes Act for all references to cultural background—which was a little bit over the top—and prepared amendments to remove their effect without employing the most cursory examination as to their context within the legislation. Not only are these amendments unrelated to the bill; they were not considered by the Senate committee. In truth, if he wanted to expand the bill, it should have been referred back to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee to give it an opportunity to amend the bill accordingly—or he could have tried consulting right from the word go.
The amendments should be opposed in any instance, even by the government’s backbench. My colleague in the other place Ms Nicola Roxon, the shadow Attorney-General, did ask the Attorney-General whether he would refer these new measures to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry—a request, as I understand it, he declined. I ask the Minister for Justice and Customs to consider that request again.
As with the introduction of cultural background to the bail and sentencing procedures, it is worth looking at the history of the provisions that the government proposed to amend. These particular references to cultural background which relate to forensic procedures were introduced as part of the Crimes Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill 1997 under the Howard government. That is right—it was the current government that introduced them. Mr Daryl Williams, who was the Attorney-General at the time, had some very interesting things to say about that bill during the debate in the House. In particular, he boasted about its basis on:
... the model Forensic Procedures Bill which was widely circulated for comment to about 600 groups and individuals, representing many interests ...
If the government had consulted on this bill, that would have turned up pretty quickly. It seems to me that it missed it completely. Many of those consulted on the model at that point were not given the same courtesy by the government on this occasion. Indeed, the Senate committee condemned the government for its failure to properly consult, even on the changes.
It really does demonstrate how arrogant and out of touch this government is becoming that it can go from consulting widely to not consulting at all in less than 10 years. When it started this, it consulted widely. It is now at a place where it has decided to junk consultation. It seems to me that the government’s true colours and contempt for the community have been exposed even more since it gained control of the Senate. The Prime Minister said that he would not let control of the Senate go to his head. Clearly, that is exactly what has happened.
Mr Williams also spoke on the many safeguards in the bill to protect the rights of individuals, with particular provisions for Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders. That just about says it all. The Attorney-General of the first Howard government was seeking to promote specific safeguards for Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. Now the Attorney-General and minister for justice of the last Howard government are removing those exact same safeguards.
Further exposing these fraudulent amendments for what they are is the fact that the government has only just passed legislation specifically dealing with forensic procedures, that is, the Crimes Act Amendment (Forensic Procedures) Bill (No. 1) 2006, which was introduced in June and passed by the Senate in October. I ask the government: if these changes are so necessary, why did you not pick them up when making those other changes specific to forensic procedures?
I do not expect the government to attempt to explain themselves in that regard. I almost hope that they do not because, at every turn in this sorry debate that they have opened their mouths and tried to react, their standing has deteriorated even further. They started with a pretty ridiculous position—this bill—and it has just got worse and worse as they try, in their way, to fix it. The only fix is to get rid of it, quite frankly. It is too late for the government or some of their backbenchers to do the right thing and sink this bill. They are not going to shift. This bill does not belong on our statute books. The minister here knows it and Mr Ruddock knows it as well.
At a time when we should be focusing our minds on finding practical solutions to deal with violence and abuse in Indigenous communities, we have instead had to deal with this blatant attempt to divert attention from the failings of Minister Brough. On that basis, the government should truly be ashamed. I am not going to take up too much more time of the Senate. I think this is an appalling position that the government is putting forward and these amendments should be rejected. Quite frankly, this bill should have been rejected.",SENATE,<title>CRIMES AMENDMENT (BAIL AND SENTENCING) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,BILLS,42,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-12-07,"—The question was asked: why are we amending section 19B of the Crimes Act? As Senator Ludwig has pointed out, during the debate that we had in the Senate on 8 November this year, Senator Ludwig asked why the government was amending section 16A of the Crimes Act but not amending section 19B. I took that on notice at the time. That position was considered and examined by the government, which agreed that it is appropriate to amend section 19B as well as section 16A to bring consistency to the sentencing provisions in the Crimes Act.
As well as that, there are amendments on forensic procedure. We are removing the term ‘cultural background’ from the forensic procedure provisions. The reason for that is that the cultural background of a suspect should not be a factor in determining whether or not they provide a forensic sample. It is not acceptable that there be a possibility, even a remote one, that a person from one ethnic group can avoid undergoing a procedure that provides evidence which may lead to their prosecution and conviction when a person from another ethnic group would have no choice but to undergo that forensic procedure.
Of course, when we are looking at forensic procedures such as those to do with DNA, they are often relevant to violence offences. I would suggest that in violent sexual offences and sexual offences generally the forensic evidence is an essential and common feature. Certainly, the question has been asked as to why we are taking out ‘Aboriginal customary beliefs’. The government believes there is no need to keep the current references to ‘Aboriginal customary beliefs’ in the forensic procedure provisions. The government has received legal advice that the term ‘religious beliefs’ is wide enough to pick up any type of religious or customary belief.
By amending these provisions in the Crimes Act, the Commonwealth is demonstrating leadership in an important area and is continuing to improve the criminal justice system for all Australians. I think these issues were canvassed by the Attorney-General in the House of Representatives. It is important, if the government sees that it can improve its legislation, even while it is before the parliament, that that be done, and that is what the government is doing in this case.
Senator Ludwig raised this issue by way of a question in the previous debate we had. The government have looked at it and are of the view that it needs to be amended. Accordingly, we have done that. As I said at the time, cultural background can still be considered under the term ‘antecedents’, which is broad enough for that to be included. We do not believe the term ‘cultural background’ should have that special significance. Having it in the legislation in that manner could lead to it having undue significance.

As such, the safeguards are there. This bill does not change that. I think it is essential that we remember that there are safeguards; it is not as if we are just throwing them away.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-12-07,"—That is a different question, and to that extent I would have to check. I will have to take that on notice. But, certainly, in relation to the question as to whether officials will be able to consider religious beliefs, the answer is yes. A constable, senior constable or magistrate will still be able to consider religious beliefs where appropriate in deciding whether there is a less intrusive way of obtaining a person’s DNA. We believe that covers it. There are a range of options available for collecting forensic evidence. If a person holds a religious belief then that should be a factor in deciding which of those options should be chosen. So that will be considered. This draws an appropriate balance between protecting religious beliefs on the one hand and enforcing the criminal law on the other.

24H What is a large dam?
In the interests of time, I shall make just a few brief comments. This amendment goes to issues similar to those we have talked about in the two previous bursts of debate on this bill. I think we have pretty much talked through those issues. Given that we are operating under a guillotine and we have less than two hours to go in the committee stage of the debate, I simply note that this is a somewhat stronger version of the amendment that has just gone down and seeks to take into account lifetime emissions rather than just emissions over a 12-month period. Given that there are other matters that we have not spent hours debating but that it would be useful for us to spend some time on, I will leave my comments there.

67A After Subdivision F of Division 1 of Part 3
Insert:
Subdivision FA—Offences relating to greenhouse gas emissions
24B Offence relating to greenhouse gas emissions
This is an amendment to insert a greenhouse gas trigger that is equivalent to 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per annum. It would catch medium to large mining operations and other high energy users around the country who would have slipped in under the Labor Party’s 500,000-tonne trigger. It is consistent with what former Senator Hill and, in fact, the Prime Minister agreed to, back in 1999-2000; it just goes further than 500,000 tonnes and is a more stringent measure at 100,000 tonnes. It does not mean that such activities are prevented, but it does mean that those activities would trigger the environmental assessment and approvals process and, during that process, there would be an assessment of whether that project was consistent with the national target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This issue has been canvassed extensively over the last few hours as we have debated this bill, so I will leave my remarks there.

24H What is a large dam?
This amendment relates to triggers for items of national environmental significance—land clearing, large dams and water resources. I will speak about all three triggers. The State of the environment report released yesterday highlighted the rate of clearing in Australia. It found that, between 2000 and 2004, 1.5 million hectares of forest were cleared across the continent and that it is often the case that the replacement vegetation, whether natural regeneration or planted trees, is not like the communities that were previously cleared. Undoubtedly, clearing of native vegetation is the largest cause of biodiversity loss. Australia still has an unenviable record globally of biodiversity loss.
I remind the Senate that 90 species in Australia are listed as threatened, and of concern at a regional level are 39 freshwater fish species, 92 frog species, 253 reptile species, 289 bird species and 209 mammal species. Unfortunately, it is not an enviable record. Globally, we are in the sixth mass extinction of biodiversity in the history of the earth, and it is the first to be driven by human activity. The main causes of diversity loss are habitat destruction and degradation, invasive plant and animal species, and unsustainable levels of harvesting. Habitat destruction and degradation are undoubtedly caused by land clearing.
We believe this needs to be an issue of national significance and that is why we are moving an amendment to insert in this bill a trigger to deal with this. We are also moving an amendment to insert a trigger on water. This issue is in the media every day. Australia is at the moment in a water crisis. This is as a result of drought, climate variation and, I believe, climate change. We believe we need to be regulating the impact of water extraction, because it is an issue of such national importance. We need to be addressing the significant issue of over-allocation around Australia. There are significant difficulties in regulating water across state boundaries. We have different controls in each state.
There is a very strong push to start looking at the development of the north. We are deeply concerned about what this means for our biodiversity and particularly for our water resources. Therefore, we believe there is a definite need to have very strict environmental controls in place before any further unsustainable development in the north occurs. That is another reason that we believe we should have a national trigger on the issue of water.
Just last night I was talking in this place about the dire threat to our wetlands in Australia, particularly our 64 Ramsar wetlands. I am aware that Ramsar is already an issue of national environmental significance, but there are issues around Ramsar, such as the regulation of water, that I believe should become issues of national environmental significance. Another issue that was highlighted in the State of the environment report was our unsustainable use of groundwater and the lack of appropriate regulation of groundwater. Unsustainable water use affects all jurisdictions across Australia. It is a key threat to many of our wetlands, which, as I was saying, are of national and international importance. We have the Gwydir wetlands, which I spoke about extensively last night, Macquarie Marshes and the Coorong. Just two weeks ago the Department of Environment and Heritage in South Australia put out a report highlighting the dire impacts on the Coorong wetland, another wetland of international importance. The Auditor-General in Western Australia has issued a fairly damning report about the management of wetlands there.
We have another amendment to do with the operation and construction of dams. Yet again dams are in the media. Australia has 447 large dams, with a combined capacity of 79,000 gigalitres. That is equivalent to 158 times the volume of Sydney Harbour. These hydrological modifications occur throughout Australia to varying degrees and we are deeply concerned they will have a potentially devastating impact on the Australian environment. We are already seeing the impact on the Australian environment of overallocation of our water resources. Surface water use across Australia is reported to increase annually by 69 per cent or 20,300 gigalitres.
We believe that making large dams an automatic trigger for this act will allow the minister to create much clearer guidelines on how dams are assessed. We believe that it will better enable the minister to assess the environmental impacts of dams. It will reduce uncertainty for proponents if they know that this particular project will be one that comes under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Therefore, we believe it will ensure better environmental protection for our major rivers and their associated ecosystems.
Hopefully by having a water and a large dam trigger in the legislation we will also be able to better manage our riparian vegetation, which, yet again, according to the State of the environment report, is in a very degraded state and much in need of repair. At the moment it is not being fixed, although the excellent environmental management programs that many community organisations carry out are doing an extremely good job. Unfortunately, as is highlighted by the State of the environment report, the success of many of these projects is undermined and easily compromised by unsustainable large-scale land and water use patterns. It is those water use patterns that we in Australia need to get much better regulation and control of. That is why we believe it is very important that the federal government, particularly now, with such a strong focus on water, is provided with a national environment trigger so that it can act much more strongly and clearly to manage water and so that there is no uncertainty about its role and it can show much stronger leadership in the water debate. I will admit that it has made some moves to address the water issue. I personally, along with the Greens, do not think those moves have been vigorous enough or that they address the issues to the extent that is due. By making these issues major triggers we will be able to achieve that.
The biodiversity loss in Australia, both through land clearing and unsustainable land and water use practices, is a major problem—one that needs to be much more seriously addressed. By putting these triggers into the act, the federal government will be able to take much stronger action on these issues. I therefore commend this amendment to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,43,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-12-07,"—I back the amendment moved by Senator Siewert. I would like to briefly ask the minister about the Mary River dam proposed at Traveston Crossing near Gympie in Queensland. The matter has been referred to him for consideration under the act. What is not clear is whether the initial proposal for the dam is to be assessed or whether the potential for a higher dam is going to be the one that the minister looks at. In view of the fact that the Queensland government is making it very clear that it seriously intends if not to go ahead with the higher dam then to make sure there is no impediment to it going ahead in the future—for example, through the purchase of private lands—it would seem to be sensible that the minister consider the proposal as a whole and the impact of the much bigger dam on the Mary River system and the wider ecosystem that will be affected.
Would the minister give an outline of the threatened species and what the impact will be on them? It might be a bit early for this, but I can tell the chamber that my impression is that the impact on the Queensland lungfish, for example, which is internationally regarded as an important link between we vertebrates on land and the marine vertebrates from which we come, will be enormously detrimental. The major breeding grounds of this listed-as-endangered creature are parts of the gravel bottom of the Mary River, where it lays its eggs. The major extent of what is left of its breeding grounds will be suffocated under the dam. Critical to any creature’s survival is the area where it reproduces. There is grave concern about the Mary River turtle, as well as the Mary River cod and a number of other species. There are alternatives to the dam but there are no alternatives to them.
I know it is early days but I wonder if the minister could say over what period his consideration of the impact of this megaproposal will be. I want to know how long it will take and also what the process will be and what circumstances might lead him to decide that this proposal will have too great an impact on the nation’s heritage to allow it to go ahead.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,43,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-12-07,"—Senator Brown is quite right: it is very early days. The Australian government will be taking a very close interest in the terms of reference and the entire process. We want to ensure that the process is done correctly on the first occasion. We do not want to see a repeat of the Meander dam process where the Commonwealth forced the Tasmanian government to go back through another entire 12-month process. We want to make sure that the community are confident that the bilateral agreement will work properly as to all of the issues that are quite properly the purview of the Australian government under this legislation, which Senator Bartlett has most eloquently described as a very powerful piece of environmental legislation—one that the Greens opposed in the past but that was supported by the Democrats.
This legislation does give the Commonwealth power to ensure that those nationally listed species that Senator Brown has referred to can be afforded very high levels of protection. He has mentioned the lungfish and the Mary River cod. Ramsar listed wetlands are also likely to be affected by the construction of this very large dam proposed by the Queensland government. There are also likely to be impacts right across what I believe are called the Great Sandy Straits—that is from my vague memory of geography in my early days in Queensland—and into the western side of Fraser Island, which is obviously a very important World Heritage area that was listed by the coincidentally named Fraser government.
The process will be thorough. Whether there is an assessment of the part A proposal for the dam not fully filled or whether the assessment will be on the impacts of the dam’s second stage proposal when the dam is full to the brim, is potentially a moot point. The assessment will have to look at the indirect impacts, and it is quite clear to me even at this early stage—and I do not want to seek to pre-empt the process; I want to give some general comments—that it is quite likely that because of the way the law is framed we would have to look at the impacts of the dam when it is full to the brim regardless. So I think those impacts will have to be assessed.
I think the assessment process could possibly take some years. This is a very complex process. I will check, Senator Brown. I have just been advised by my adviser that we would not expect a decision on this until around mid-2008, so it will be a detailed and comprehensive process. I have given undertakings to a range of concerned citizens in that area. Just the proposal for the dam has already had a massive social impact. I have had a constant stream of concerned Queenslanders and their representatives through my doors over recent weeks, including Warren Truss and Senators Ian Macdonald, Brandis, Trood, Santoro and Joyce. To his credit, Senator Bartlett has taken a very close interest in this proposal. He has been in my office at least twice, going through the process and having himself briefed on it. This is a very big proposal by the Queensland government and its impacts on those matters of national environmental significance will be thoroughly and comprehensively examined, and I want to make sure that the community members involved feel that the process is robust and that they have a strong voice in that process.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,43,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-12-07,"—I want to indicate, not surprisingly, the Democrats’ support for this amendment. I think it is identical in large part to the ones that were circulated under my name. I will throw one question in at the start, before I make general comments on the amendment, that goes to what the minister has just said. As I think he would be aware, there has already been a lot of activity in the area affected by the Traveston dam, with a fair bit of pressure, quite frankly, being put on local people to sell to the Queensland government. My understanding is that this amendment from what might loosely be called the positive pile, at least from my point of view, makes it clearer that it is inappropriate for action to start on a project until it has been fully assessed by the federal minister. Obviously, that would mean not putting in the bulldozers and not laying the concrete and that sort of thing. I wonder whether there is any wider application of that for action in the broader sense, such as clearing out people, which I think is a bit problematic given some of the trauma that Senator Ian Campbell has rightly identified. I ask if he could give any view on whether those sorts of things are covered in any general way by legislation, either current or pending.
I go to the amendment. As was mentioned by Senator Siewert, the State of the environment report, which was released and tabled yesterday and which Senator Campbell has spoken about and pointed to in the media, included an assessment of the EPBC Act. I noted that the report recognised and acknowledged that the EPBC Act has made an important contribution to environmental protection in Australia during its first five years of operation.
I also note that, in the full report that was done for the committee putting together the State of the environment report, a review was put together by Chris McGrath, a barrister who, as the minister would probably know, has sought to use the EPBC Act a number of times. As I said in my comments in the second reading debate, I think it is a shame that the perhaps unintended consequence of some of the controversy in the environmental movement when the bill was first passed is that some within the environmental movement have not sought to use the act as much as they could have to try to generate positive outcomes, as some people who have, including Chris McGrath, have managed to have some success.
The review that Chris McGrath did for the state of the environment committee concluded not just that the EPBC Act had made an important contribution but also that the absence of a trigger for greenhouse emissions was a very significant gap in the regulatory framework of the matters of national environmental significance. I know we have already dealt with that matter, but I wanted to point to that because, when this legislation was first brought into being in 1999 and the government at the time made promises to go down the path of developing a climate change trigger, that was because the Democrats saw at the time that this was a major issue that needed a lot greater scrutiny and needed to be reflected in our national environmental framework. I note Senator Campbell’s point from the last time we debated this that it was the state Labor governments that were opposed to that being adopted. That is a fair enough point to make, but it was in reflection of the fact that climate change seven years ago—or even well before seven years ago, but in the framework of this much more powerful environmental law that was being put in place—had an appropriate role to play. I think the review that was done for the state of the environment committee recognises that.
I make that point because it is quite clear, particularly with regard to water issues that are covered by the amendment from Senator Siewert relating to water use and large dams, that this is an issue that we all know now is crucial for the nation. The issue of unsustainable water use—to use the heading that was in the Democrat amendments—is an issue that we think ought to have more of a national focus. I know there has been a lot of debate backwards and forwards, particularly by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, about the greater role that the Commonwealth could have. A lot of that at the moment is outside the legislative framework; it is managed through things like the National Water Initiative and some sticks and carrots such as the potential dangling of money and trying to get agreements in meetings. Quite frankly, whilst that is an ideal goal, I do not think it has generated anywhere near as much progress as should have occurred. Putting in place a trigger on unsustainable water use and major infrastructure projects like large dams would clearly be an appropriate legislative measure to give the Commonwealth a role to play. That is why I think it is very timely.
Land clearing is an area where there has been some progress in recent years, but it is progress that has not been as complete as it could have been, and in some of the states it is not as reliable as it needs to be. We need to have much more certainty that backsliding will not occur in that area. Again, I think there is an important role that the Commonwealth could play that was identified by that review, along with climate change as another key major national environmental issue. Land clearing links into climate change, of course, as land clearing is a major emitter of greenhouse gases. But, because it is clearly such a major national issue and because of the success we have had, including in my state of Queensland, Australia has done much better than it would have in meeting its Kyoto targets. I think there is clearly logical consistency here. This is not just a grab of any issue that the Democrats or Greens think would look good to pack into the act for the sake of it. They are clearly central issues of national environmental significance, as is appropriate under this act.
I think the amendment has a lot of merits. In the example of the Traveston Dam, which Senator Brown raised, it has been made clear that that already triggers the act because of matters like endangered species, world heritage, Ramsar wetlands and migratory birds. They are consequential effects, if you like. The minister, as you know, is trying to assess it in terms of whether or not it is a viable piece of water infrastructure. That becomes a bigger issue, with the other dam in south-east Queensland: the Wivenhoe dam, which will obviously still have some environmental impacts, particularly downstream, going into the Moreton Bay Marine Park and some of the Ramsar wetlands around there. Assessing that on its own merits is something that, given the state of water policy in Australia and the lack of progress, is appropriate and I think it is clearly a matter of national environmental significance. That is why it is appropriate for it to be put forward by both the Greens and the Democrats.
I say in conclusion that it is based upon proposals put forward by groups that have sought to work constructively with the act as it stands—that is, the Environmental Defenders Office and groups like WWF, HSI and the Tasmanian Conservation Trust. These groups have sought to engage constructively with the act. They are not just throwing up a wish list. They are positive amendments. They are groups which seek to use the act in conjunction with other constructive campaigns that they are running. WWF has been playing a significant role in trying to find more constructive solutions for water policy issues, for example. So, there is a lot of merit to the amendment. I know we are under a guillotine so I will cease talking now but I think that it needs to be put on the record, even briefly, that the amendments have merit and would further strengthen what, as Senator Campbell has said, is a piece of strong environment law. That is why the Democrats put them forward and why we support the amendment, as moved by Senator Siewert.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,43,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-12-07,"—I thank the minister for his contribution. I just have one further brief question. One of the problems with the Meander Dam proposal in Tasmania was that all the information was not there, available for people from both sides who were concerned about it, to see as it went down the line. I think that led to the unnecessary delays that the minister is talking about. I wonder if he could give an assurance that that will not happen with the Traveston Dam and other proposals, but that there will be transparency of information available to the minister, as it comes to him, so that the public—whichever side of that debate they may be on—can, with knowledge, feed into the process as it goes along.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,43,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-12-07,"—One of the things we insisted on in the second part of the Meander Dam process was that all of that information be made public. That is one of the things that this bill allows me to do as federal minister. I know this contradicts some of the outrageous claims that this amendment bill we are debating tonight weakens the act. I think it makes the act a lot more effective, and in many parts strengthens it, but before the night is out we will be inserting—all going well—a new provision that will give me a quite explicit power under section 132. That section currently creates provisions that give the minister power to seek further information for approval decision, but we are adding a new part D3, which gives the minister the power to seek further information if the relevant impacts of the action have been assessed under a law of the state or territory, and the appropriate minister of that state or territory. So, basically, it gives a quite explicit power to the Commonwealth minister to demand that information from the state. We will be making sure that all of that information is made public so it is a transparent process that the community can be involved in.
I will very quickly respond to the details of the amendment about the insertion of a water trigger and a land clearance trigger. The State of the environment report gives us some very positive news in relation to land clearance. I am sure many of us would like to see even better results but I commend the graph on page 71 to anyone who is listening and who cares about the environment. You can go to the DEH website and follow the links to the SOE. If you go to page 71 you will find that, back in the seventies, Australia was clearing up to 550,000 or 560,000 hectares, in net terms, a year—that is the difference between the amount of forests destroyed and the amount of forests replanted. By about the nineties that figure was hovering around 250,000 and possibly up to 300,000 hectares a year net loss of forest, and hovered around those figures right through to about the end of the 1990s.
The great news in this report is that—and the data has not been put in for post-2004—in 2003 we very nearly hit break-even in Australia. In fact, we are looking like planting more trees than we are chopping down, for the first time since white settlement. So that is a good achievement, and it is a cooperative achievement, I think it should be pointed out, between the activities and policies of the state governments and the federal government. It shows a very useful trend.
On my latest mathematics it looks as though the combined policies of the Natural Heritage Trust, the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality, the 2020 plantation vision and some other measures, have seen us plant, over the last 10 years, in excess of 900 million trees in Australia. We are on track to plant one billion trees, and if I can get my mathematics and calculations close enough I hope to go somewhere and plant the billionth tree, probably some time early next year.
I will be as brief as I can because there are other amendments that senators will want to talk about. This underpins the fact that the cooperation between the state and federal governments, the EPBC Act, and a range of other policy measures—including, for example, the Tasmanian private forest initiative, which I will launch in Tasmania, to purchase 45,000 hectares of forests on private land, with a large proportion of old growth—are more sensible and effective ways of protecting Australia’s forest cover, protecting our biodiversity and reversing land clearing.
Similarly, in relation to the water trigger, although we get very frustrated at the lack of progress from time to time, the government are committed to working cooperatively with the states on water policy. We have backed that up, not only with vigorous action and leadership by the Prime Minister—and more lately by the Parliamentary Secretary with special responsibility for water, Mr Turnbull—but with some $700 million just in the Murray-Darling Basin alone, through the Living Murray initiative; an extra $500,000 for works given to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission in the last budget; and the $2 billion water fund, which creates incentives for the states to put in place a range of measures.
We think that cooperative approach is the best way to go. There have of course been threats made about the Commonwealth taking over control of water, from both sides of politics I think it is fair to say. But my strong view is that a cooperative federalist approach is desirable. That is not to say that the Commonwealth would rule out seeking to go further if we were not able to make the sort of progress that the government would want. So I am not going to denigrate the proposal of a water trigger outright. I think it is the sort of thing that the Commonwealth would keep in its policy back pocket, to be quite frank. But we think that in a federation where the states have primary responsibility for water resources—quite properly, I would say—a cooperative approach is the best. But we do recognise that water does not respect state boundaries—particularly the water in the Murray-Darling system, which crosses four states and one territory—and that getting that cooperative federalist approach right is very important.
The issues at stake are huge for Australia, and the Commonwealth could never rule out using a blunter legislative and constitutional instrument some time in the future. But we have committed and re-committed to a cooperative federalist approach, working with the states. I think that, although we do not believe we have made good enough progress to date, there are already some signs that that approach can bear fruit for the environmental and ecosystem outcomes we are seeking and, also importantly, for sustainable agriculture.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,43,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-12-07,"—I have a number of points but I would also like to ask a few questions. The first point is that planting trees does not necessarily replace biodiversity. I remind the chamber of the comments from the State of the environment report where it says:
It is often the case that the replacement vegetation, whether natural regeneration or planted trees, is not like the communities that were previously cleared.
I would like to know the percentage of regrowth or trees that were planted that replaced a fully functional ecosystem and whether there is any data on how many hectares of fully functioning ecosystems were replaced.
I would also like to draw the Senate’s attention to the fact that there is a big push, as is well known in this place, to develop the north. In fact, in my own home state of Western Australia—and the development also extends into the Northern Territory—there is Ord stage 2, which will lead to the clearing of a large amount of native vegetation. And if certain senators from the government have their way, and do start the push for developing the north, there are likely to be other areas in the north. I believe very strongly that the federal government needs a strong trigger with which to assess that. I believe that is an issue of national environmental significance.
I also understand that there is a lot of ongoing clearing of native vegetation in Tasmania. I would like to ask the minister what the government is doing about addressing the continuing land clearing in Tasmania.
I also understand that for part of the national water fund the funding is not necessarily tied to outcomes. I have some concerns that there is in fact a wonderful tool there that the government has at its fingertips and that it could be using to a fuller extent. I would like to see that more closely tied to some better outcomes.
I also have a couple of questions about the Mary River dam. I think there is still some confusion in Queensland about whether the public will get to see the state government’s environmental review before it is handed over to the federal government. I understand that is because it is classed as a project of state significance. I am asking whether that will occur.
Secondly, I am pleased to see that the government and the minister will be able to ask for additional material. I am wondering whether, on the Mary River dam proposal, the government will be asking Queensland to justify the dam and whether they will be requiring the state to produce the water figures and their calculations on water prior to making any further decisions. Are they able to, and will they be doing it?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,43,1

This is an amendment to restore the five-yearly review of matters of national environmental significance to ensure that the EPBC Act evolves to consider new triggers or environmental protections. This is a principle that Robert Hill, a former environment minister, understood. He proposed that such a process of evolution be built into the environmental protection legislation of this country. He put this view with regard to additional triggers and the EPBC Act in his discussion papers where he said:
We will be evolving a situation reflecting community attitudes and what really is the best and most appropriate mix at the time.
So in fact the act provides for a five-yearly review to assess the needs of any new matters of national environmental significance and the key environmental challenges that trigger the act. The most recent review was undertaken in April 2005. I have asked the minister on a previous occasion where the published report of that review is. I have yet to get a satisfactory answer. As we can see by the amendments before the chamber, no new triggers have been added. The opposition maintains the view that, because of the failure to publish the results of the review, the minister has failed in his legislative obligations under the act. We take the view that section 28A is explicit:
Every 5 years after the commencement of this Act, the Minister must cause a report to be prepared on whether this Part—
that is, matters of national environmental significance—
should be amended ...
It goes on to say:
(4) Before the preparation of the report is completed, the Minister must cause to be published in accordance with the regulations (if any):
a draft of the report; and
an invitation to comment on the draft within the period specified by the minister.
It is our view that that has not occurred. I take the view that the minister is in breach of his own legislation. So far what we have had is that the minister is seeking to repeal this section of the legislation. It is his response to his current breach of the act. The opposition takes the view that it reflects the arrogance of the government and the incompetence of the minister and ought to be addressed by an amendment such as this. I trust that this will be supported by at least sections of this government.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,43,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-12-07,"—I make the point that we have had three potential triggers put before the Senate tonight. In fact, we have had more than that, if you add them up. Actually we have had six potential triggers put before the parliament tonight, and Labor supported one of them.
—Two—two of our own amendments.
—It must have been two out of seven, then. The government agreed with Labor on all but those two, so through our own processes we came to similar decisions. It is open to the government, or any government, to seek to put new triggers into the act. I have already said that we would not rule out looking at a water trigger at some time if a cooperative federalist approach fails to address Australia’s water needs. That would be one of the policy options that we would not rule out.
But you do not need a five-yearly review to tell you to do that. You need to have the sort of approach that the Howard government has, and that is to look at the needs, look at the effectiveness and do things like having a robust independent State of the environment report done to guide you in your policy decision making. If you make a decision that you want to put in a new trigger, then you bring the matter to the parliament without the need for yet another piece of red tape.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,43,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-12-07,"—I want to put on record that the Democrats share the Labor Party’s concern. Again, the State of the environment report noted that the EPBC Act, as it stands, has improved public accountability and access to information. I do not think that the section the bill seeks to remove—the requirement for a report every five years about possible additions to matters of national environmental significance—is a piece of red tape. I think it is a useful accountability mechanism. It might be one that the government and the minister have not chosen to follow, which I think is a bit disappointing, but that is no reason to get rid of it. For that reason, I believe it is better to retain it as the Labor amendment seeks to do.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,43,1

34G Declarations relating to nuclear actions
In moving these amendments I will explain their effect. The EPBC Act 1999 currently prevents the minister from approving certain nuclear installations—in particular, fuel fabrication plants, enrichment plants, nuclear power plants and reprocessing plants. However, other nuclear activities fall under the assessment and approval processes of the act as it currently stands. Nuclear activities, such as new uranium mines, nuclear waste dumps and transporting spent nuclear fuel, are examples of nuclear actions that come under the assessment and approval process. If the assessment finds that, for example, a nuclear waste dump will, or is likely to, have a significant impact on the environment, the act does not allow the minister to approve it.
The amendments that the government brought before the House changed that, and the amendments I am moving here tonight close the loopholes which could prevent uranium mines, nuclear waste dumps and nuclear transport facilities from being assessed if they occur in the context of bioregional plans, in the context of strategic assessments, in the context of conservation agreements, in the context of declarations made under section 33, in the context of the minister saying that it was approved by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency and in the context of a bilateral agreement, which, as it currently stands, could include a declaration that a nuclear action does not require approval under part 9 for the purposes of sections 21 or 22A.
The amendments I am moving tonight move to close those loopholes so that the minister cannot avoid assessing nuclear activities—new uranium mines, nuclear waste dumps and transporting spent fuel—under the act. The reason I am concerned that the Commonwealth may consider doing that is that we have had several pieces of legislation before the House recently making way for a huge expansion in nuclear activity.
There was the ANSTO bill before the house, which allows ANSTO to handle nuclear waste that is from overseas and not generated in Australia. There was the radioactive waste dump bill, which took away procedural fairness and judicial review from traditional owners and anybody else who might have wanted to go through a proper process of consultation and to object. Then there was the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommending Australia go straight ahead with exporting hugely increased amounts of uranium to China in spite of the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency is completely underfunded, as is the safeguards process. Then there was the report of the Prime Minister’s task force advocating a massive expansion in nuclear facilities, including nuclear power plants, but of course particularly highlighting new uranium mines and waste dumps.
Then there was the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry and Resources, which was supported by three Labor members: Mr Martin Ferguson, Mr Dick Adams, who represents Lyons in the state of Tasmania, and Mr Michael Hatton, who is the Labor Deputy Chair of that committee. They signed off on a recommendation that the Australian government minister, through the Council of Australian Governments and other means, encourage state governments to reconsider their opposition to uranium mining and to abolish legislative restrictions on uranium and thorium mining and exploration where these exist. Also, those Labor people signed off on a recommendation that the Australian government, again through the Council of Australian Governments, seek to remedy the impediments to the development of the uranium industry. They listed there that the government should specifically develop uniform and minimum effective regulation for uranium exploration and mining across all states and territories. They also disgracefully moved to ensure that processes associated with issues such as land access and native title assessments, approvals and reporting are streamlined. They have called for minimisation of duplication of regulation across levels of government, addressing of labour shortages and, finally, addressing of transportation impediments, particularly issues associated with denial of shipping services.
Everything points to a government push—with Labor support, if Mr Martin Ferguson, Mr Dick Adams and Mr Michael Hatton have anything to do with it—for expanded uranium mining, expanded nuclear facilities around the country and for minimising and getting rid of any legislative restrictions or impediments. On that basis, I think it is critical that we close the loopholes in the amendments the government has put forward. I am seeking to close those loopholes so that new uranium mines, nuclear waste dumps and nuclear transport facilities will have to be assessed under the environment protection legislation in this country.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,43,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-12-07,"—I will put it simply and shortly: there are no loopholes. All of those matters will have to be assessed. They cannot be assessed under the bioregional plans or strategic assessment provisions. The act as it stands ensures that we have very high quality assessments for all actions relating to the mining, waste and transportation of uranium.

"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-12-07,"—I appreciate the minister putting that on the record. I think that any analysis of this legislation will show that, whilst currently the minister cannot approve the fabrication plants, enrichment plants, power plants and reprocessing plants, all those other activities are required under the act. The bioregional plans make it quite clear that that is a mechanism by which the minister can make a declaration that a uranium mine is in accordance with a bioregional plan and therefore does not require approval under part 9 of the act. The same goes for strategic assessments and conservation agreements. I appreciate the minister saying in here that the legislation clearly does not contain those loopholes. On that basis, he will not have any problem supporting these amendments, which make it absolutely clear that those activities cannot be exempted by the minister by any process or declaration from being assessed under the act.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,43,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-12-07,"—I will just make a clarification. Although those matters could be dealt with under a bioregional plan, that would not alleviate the need to have those matters assessed. We could not approve the bioregional plan unless those matters were assessed.

This amendment removes all references to the regional forest agreement in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and, in effect, brings forests back into Australia’s environment as if they mattered. The forests of Australia which are being logged have been removed from national environmental legislation. It is the greatest environmental travesty by parliamentary process, by government edict, that I know of anywhere in Australia.

(4)    Schedule 1, item 189, page 51 (lines 16 to 34), TO BE OPPOSED.
I note on the last amendment that there was silence except for the opposition of the government so I am hoping that means the opposition may have supported it. I will move onto this amendment. The Greens are opposing item 189. When you go to the explanatory memorandum at page 30 clause 82 it says that this is:
... to clarify that in making a controlled action decision—
the minister is making that decision, of course—
in relation to proposed developments, such as, a factory which will use timber from as RFA region, the Minister must not consider any adverse impacts of any RFA forestry operation ...
That is, in effect, a pulp mill exemption provision. This is a specific provision in the act to exempt Gunns’s pulp mill from proper environmental assessment. It is the Howard government’s Gunns’s pulp mill absolution clause. What it means is that the minister will effectively be prevented from looking at the impact of the proposed mega pulp mill on the Tamar River that Gunns has now effectively got state government approval for, insofar as the impact that pulp mill will have on Tasmania’s native forests and forests generally, high conservation value and old-growth forests, for decades to come.
This is an extraordinary provision. It would in future extend to other forms of wood processing, including forest furnaces—and there are proposals for three of those by the Labor government in Tasmania. These will enable forests, including high conservation value forests, to be fed into furnaces to be turned into electricity and fed through Basslink to the mainland to be sold as premium power.
So what we have there is the potential for conversion of high conservation value forests into so-called green power under federal legislation. It is a total travesty of the English language as well as of environmental probity and honesty. I ask the minister: is it a fact that this amendment will protect Gunns’s pulp mill from an assessment by him of the enormous impact—any impact at all—that there will be on Tasmania’s forests over the coming decade as they are fed into that pulp mill?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,43,1

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-12-07,"—The minister has said if there are impacts on wildlife—that includes in an RFA area—he will be doing an assessment. I ask him: will he confirm that to the committee? I am good at reading headshaking—and he has been advised that, no, he will not confirm that and he has been advised that, no, he will not be doing that assessment. Because what the minister knows is that the forests of Tasmania are in regional forest agreement areas. They were signed over to destruction by the Prime Minister’s signature in November 1997. We have now got to the horrendous situation where, as Senator Milne made clear in question time today, ammonium nitrate explosives are being used—the very thing that is being banned, because of terrorism, in this country except under licence. They are being licensed under the authority of the Prime Minister effectively through the regional forest agreement to blow up the biggest trees in the Southern Hemisphere such as those in the Styx Valley and the World Heritage value Upper Florentine Valley.
Here we have a pulp mill which is going, for two decades or more, to continue to erode the national estate and potentially World Heritage value forests of north-east Tasmania. The minister has every right to be hanging his head because he knows that this amendment is to make abundantly clear that he cannot do an assessment of those forests under a regional forest agreement and, therefore, the wildlife in those forests under a regional forest agreement.
I will go to one species that he knows very well—that is, the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle. Forestry Tasmania itself, with Melbourne university, has done a study of this exact area in north-east Tasmania—the Bass component of Tasmanian forestry operations—which will be the resource for Gunns’s proposed pulp mill. Those studying it found that it has a 65 per cent chance of going to extinction. This is one of the world’s six biggest raptors or eagles. It is bigger than the mainland variety. If Gunns’s logging proceeds—and this pulp mill will make sure of it, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate—that 65 per cent chance of extinction becomes a 99 per cent chance of extinction. The wedge-tailed eagle has had it. Make no mistake about this, what we are voting on here is the destruction of species in this great nation of ours through the unnecessary logging of what is left of our native forest estate in a country which has 1½ million hectares of plantations and does not need to cut native forests to provide wood for building, paper or whatever it might be. And this government knows it.
This government, through this particular amendment, is saying: ‘We will not allow ourselves to—we want the parliament to ensure that we cannot—look at the forests in assessing that pulp mill or the forest furnaces which are coming down the line.’ The State of the environment report, which was produced by the minister yesterday, was scathing on the loss of biodiversity in this country which continues to grow—that is, on the species going to extinction in this nation when that should have been stopped long ago. And here we have a minister for the environment in a government which is deliberately legislating to destroy ancient ecosystems upon which species, from the great wedge-tail of Tasmania down to minute species within the firmament of the forest, depend—legislating to destroy their habitat, destroy their creation, destroy their existence on this planet. Can you believe it?
You, as this government, are concocting a situation where you are legislating to put blinkers on to blind yourselves to this deliberate destruction of what is left of the fastness of creatures which make this country, which are the essence of this country. You are legislating knowing that, by doing so, you are going to send them to destruction for a Gunns pulp mill. You are legislating that you cannot look at that process, knowing that we are in a period of unprecedented extinction of species due to human activity. This government is legislating to prevent interference in that extinction process which has been signed into law by the regional forest agreement by Prime Minister Howard.
Then along comes the Stern report which says, ‘Go from the environmental aspect and look at the economic aspect.’ When you do the figures, you will find that we are getting paid $10 or $15 a tonne by Gunns for what they take out of the forest; the huge amount they leave there they pay nothing for. Yet under a carbon trading system—which we are told, and we know, the world is going to have, and which even the Prime Minister assents to now—those forests would be worth two, three or four times that amount if left standing. So you would send them to destruction now when, in a decade or two, standing, they would be worth four times as much, and you would still have the biological amenity and the safety for species they provide, and all the economic activity which would come out of tourists wanting to visit what is left of real wild forests on the planet.
I went for a walk the other morning—a beautiful sunny Saturday morning—with a little tourist operator from St Helens, into the Blue Tier, into a coupe to be targeted by Gunns in the next few months. It was sensational: huge Antarctic ferns, centuries old—some nudging a millennium old. And at the end of this 20-minute walk, which would delight the heart of anybody on the planet, we came to the Big Tree. It has a cave inside it. You walk in one side, it opens out like a small ballroom and you can walk out the other side. It is 19 or 20 metres in circumference at shoulder level around the base. And do you know, fellow senators, what they are going to do with that, in the next few months—possibly before we come back here? They are going to get another mixture of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil and blow it up. And this minister is legislating so that he cannot look at that, and so that Gunns can continue to do that and then feed it into their pulp mill. I get a little of the feeling for the environment that legislators must have felt in other parliaments for wicked things that have happened to human beings in the past.
So: we have 15 minutes left in this debate before it is guillotined. I will sit down. I will let it go. This minister has sat on his hands. He is not even going to look at those forests; this government will not. This Prime Minister has knowingly wiped his hands, like Pontius Pilate, of what is about to befall, is befalling and will befall the forest heritage of this nation and the world, and all the creatures that live in it. It is appalling beyond words. And it is all so unnecessary. Yet here we have legislation to say not only that the minister should not look at it, but that he cannot. This is a straitjacket of the government’s own introduction through law. Can you believe it?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,43,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-12-07,"—I will be very brief, because I cannot allow what Senator Brown has said to stand on the record. Senator Brown knows, but he will not tell you, that the regional forest agreement that was struck between the Commonwealth and Tasmania in November 1997 followed one of the most extensive consultation processes and processes of identifying biodiversity to make sure that the forests had a balance of protection of biodiversity put in place with a long-term and secure resource security arrangement. The regional forest agreements across Australia, struck between the Commonwealth and the states of varying political persuasions, ensure that each of those forest areas achieve a comprehensive, adequate and representative cross-section of the ecosystem types within those forests. So all of that work has been done. All of those ecosystems have been protected.
It is interesting that Senator Brown would have the audacity to mislead about a document—which is available, because I released it yesterday—prepared by Professor Bob Beeton and an eminent group of scientists, ecologists and statisticians on the state of Australia’s environment. It is a phenomenal document, independently assessing just where we are. It is a five-yearly report, an audit and a checklist on where we are. And Senator Brown said it is scathing in what it says about Australia’s biodiversity loss. What does Professor Beeton’s committee say about the regional forest agreements at page 44? He says, and his committee says:
The regional forest agreements have also been important in conserving forest values.
He goes on to say:
The result of the 2005 Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement—
which builds on those RFAs—
is that more than 156 000 hectares of forest were added to formal and informal reserves and, of that, some 121 000 hectares were old growth forest.
So he hides all of those facts. He hides the fact that under this government we have protected Tasmanian forests and, as a result of the election commitments made by the Prime Minister at the last election, diligently applied, we see the Tarkine forest protected. I remember talking to the Pullinger family down there in November, just after the election. I said to the Tarkine coalition, ‘What would be a good result in terms of protecting the Tarkine?’ And they said: ‘Look, 50,000 hectares would be a reasonable outcome—a bronze medal sort of outcome. Sixty thousand hectares would be a silver medal outcome; 70,000 hectares would be a gold medal outcome.’ And we were able to achieve 72½ thousand hectares of the Tarkine being protected in perpetuity, locked away forever so that future generations of Australians and people from around the world can do as Senator Brown did last weekend and walk through those magnificent forests and enjoy those values.
So under the RFA in Tasmania the forests have that sort of protection. Where the wildlife and other nationally significant species occur, of course they will have to be assessed under the process. I think Senator Brown knowingly misleads in relation to this process. We have a strong law that ensures that these sorts of proposals are assessed, and we also have good policies in place that are protecting and preserving biodiversity in forests across Australia in a way that has never been done before.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,43,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-12-07,"—I want to seek some clarity from the minister. I heard him say earlier that the pulp mill was going to be assessed by the minister, that it was a controlled action and that the species in forests that will be fed to the pulp mill will be under assessment. But I understand, looking at the transitional provisions, that this legislation will apply retrospectively so that the pulp mill will in fact be exempted. So I would like absolute clarity on whether these retrospective provisions are going to exempt the pulp mill. Secondly, the RPDC assessment in Tasmania specifically excludes the assessment of the forests and there were complete lies told by Gunns in relation to the forests. They said initially that is was going to be plantation based but now it is to be native forest based, and they want access to native forest for 30 years for this pulp mill. Thirty years: that is a minimum of 2½ million tonnes a year for 30 years out of native forests in Tasmania.
I would like the minister to tell the House whether the transitional provisions in this legislation will be retrospectively applied to the pulp mill. Secondly, will he spell out to the House the process by which he as the federal minister is going to assess the environmental impacts of the feedstock to the pulp mill? How is he going to assess it? What is the process?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,43,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-12-07,—These provisions do not apply retrospectively. I made quite clear statements about the assessment of impacts on wildlife. It is quite clear that within RFA forests they are covered by the RFA provisions.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-12-07,"—Well, there you have it. The forests that we are talking about are all inside the RFA process, and there will be no assessment of the wildlife or the forests as far as this destructive pulp mill is concerned. The minister had his head on the desk—I do not blame him. It is an appalling process against this nation by this government. The Prime Minister drives this process. He signed the regional forest agreement. He, with the logging industry, is behind the writing of this component of the legislation.
As the minister knows, I have taken action on Wielangta in the Federal Court against the destruction of species there in south-east Tasmania. The swift parrot is one species that has just returned to the state, in much depleted numbers from its former range. And the proposal is to log the heartland of its breeding in Wielangta. The minister was talking about the forests, but we all know—schoolkids know—that when you cut these forests down he can go and celebrate planting his billionth tree, but those trees are not providing habitat. They are not old enough; they do not grow to the age. Gunns is never going to let them grow to the age; it wants to cut them down again. They need to live 100 years before their branches drop out and the swift parrots, for example, can find a nesting place. No nests, no species: that is what this process is, and no minister to assess it. This legislation makes it abundantly clear that the pulp mill is outside the reach of the minister. This is the minister’s Gunns provision. It is a most shameful piece of legislation.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2006-12-07,"—It is with great pleasure that I stand tonight to congratulate Professor Martin Silink, the newly elected President of the International Diabetes Federation. Martin Silink is a paediatrician from Westmead Hospital in Sydney and he is the first Australian ever to be elected as the president of the International Diabetes Federation. The International Diabetes Federation is the global advocate for diabetes. It is based in Brussels and consists of 191 diabetes associations from 145 countries. Just this week it held its International Diabetes Federation congress in Cape Town, South Africa.
I had the pleasure of being invited to speak at the congress. Professor Martin Silink was elected at that congress having been made president elect three years earlier at the IDF congress in Paris, where I also had the pleasure of speaking and assisting the Australian contingent—led by Diabetes Australia—and the many Australians there to support, and lobby for the election of Martin Silink as president elect.
It is a great credit to Martin Silink and I want to pass on congratulations not only to him but to his wife, Margaret, who has served and assisted Martin with great perseverance and patience over the last three years in his role as president elect. I want to pass on my best wishes and congratulations for the next three years, when there will be a lot of travel all around the world—not only to Brussels, but to the many countries around the world where diabetes is such a problem.
It was an excellent congress in Cape Town, where there were some 10,000 people present. It was a great honour and a privilege to be invited to speak at that congress, on the obesity epidemic and the role of the diabetes community in dealing with government.
I also want to acknowledge the work of Diabetes Australia for the efforts that they have undertaken to support Martin Silink, and the measures that they have taken to address the diabetes epidemic in this country. They have spearheaded the campaign to support a UN resolution on diabetes and tonight I wear my badge or logo—the blue circle—on my lapel to support the UN resolution on diabetes. Diabetes Australia has supported that campaign, together with the Australian Diabetes Society and the Australian Diabetes Educators Association. Internationally, the campaign is supported by the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the American Diabetes Association, and various other organisations, including the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which is an excellent organisation headed up by Susan Alberti in this country, and Chief Executive Officer Mike Wilson, who perform excellent roles.
I want to say that the main effect of the UN resolution would be to bring diabetes out of the shadows; unite people with diabetes, strengthen diabetes associations; raise awareness of simple, cost-effective strategies to prevent the complications of diabetes; encourage individual responsibility in health maintenance; and raise awareness at societal levels to promote healthy nutrition, increased physical activity and a healthy lifestyle. The thrust of the resolution would be to ask the United Nations and its member states to declare 14 November as a United Nations world diabetes day to recognise the seriousness of the diabetes epidemic and to encourage cost-effective strategies for the prevention of diabetes and its complications.
I seek leave to incorporate the United Nations resolution on diabetes in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—

Draft United Nations Resolution on Diabetes


Sponsoring Country: Bangladesh

Welcoming the fact that the WHO and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) have officially observed 14 November as World Diabetes Day on a global level since 1989,
Recognizing the activities of the IDF to combat diabetes and welcoming the initiative to establish a campaign to empower, energize and educate more than 200,000,000 persons with diabetes in self-management,
Recognizing the urgent need to pursue multilateral efforts to promote and improve human health, provide access to medications and education,
4,     Decides to declare the current WHO/IDF World Diabetes Day, 14 November, as a UN World Diabetes Day, to be observed beginning 2007,
Invites all Member States, relevant agencies, bodies, funds and programs of the United Nations system, and other international organizations and non-governmental organizations, to organize on that day activities designated to raise public awareness of diabetes, prevention of diabetic complications and prevention of diabetes itself,
Requests the Secretary-General to take the measures necessary, within existing resources, and in association with relevant agencies and bodies within the UN to promote the observance of World Diabetes Day,
Urges Member States to develop national policies for the prevention and control of diabetes in line with the sustainable development of their health systems in conformity with the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals,
Requests all relevant United Nations organizations to address the diabetes pandemic in line with their respective mandates, to assist wherever possible, in global efforts against the pandemic and to keep their actions under regular review to counter the negative impact of diabetes on individuals and society as a whole,
Expresses keen interest in additional discussion among relevant United Nations bodies, Member States, industry and other relevant organizations as proposed in the Millennium Development Goals to make progress, inter alia, on the question of access to treatment and care and continued research,
Encourages all Member States to work with relevant UN Organizations and civil society, in order to develop cost-effective sustainable long-term strategies for the prevention of diabetic complications and diabetes prevention, taking into account Member States’ organization and delivery of their respective health services, ethical, legal, cultural and other relevant issues and available resources.
—I would like to add that the Australian Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group is a bipartisan group in this parliament. It is a very effective group, and very recently Judy Moylan, on behalf of the group, and I met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer. We were very pleased to have confirmed to us that the Australian government would support the UN resolution on diabetes. We were very thrilled with that because we have been making representations to our government over many months—in fact, since Martin Silink first apprised us of this initiative.
It is very important, in our view, that the diabetes movement takes up the cudgels on this, leads the community and works in partnership with government at all levels and the various stakeholder groups to address the top three priorities espoused by Sir George Alberti at the International Diabetes Federation Congress in Paris in September 2003—those three priorities being prevention, prevention and prevention.
Winning the battle will require an enormous commitment because, like tobacco, saturated fats and sugar are among the modern world’s great temptations, while inertia is a simpler and far more attractive message for the brain and body than the effort of activity. However, it is a battle that we must fight so that within a few decades we will look back and be able to say that fixing the obesity epidemic, by living healthier lifestyles, was as vital as changing attitudes and behaviour towards smoking. Of course, obesity leads to a whole range of chronic conditions, not just diabetes. It leads to heart disease, cancer, respiratory problems and the like.
I would also like to acknowledge the good work at Diabetes Australia of the former president Dr Peter Little and thank him for his many years of service to that organisation, which in my view have been quite outstanding. He has been selfless in his commitment and his sacrifice to the cause.
I want to thank and acknowledge the work of Brian Conway, who is the executive director—and has been for many years. He has been handling and working for that organisation in a professional, committed and incredibly capable manner.
I want to say thank you in advance to Dr Gary Deed, based in Queensland, who is the new President of Diabetes Australia. I congratulate him on his election, very recently—just some weeks ago—and say that he has the full support of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group for his work on behalf of people with diabetes in this country.
As far as Australia is concerned, we do have a responsibility for ourselves and in particular our Indigenous communities. Quite frankly, our Indigenous communities are in peril. They have a much higher rate of diabetes than the rate for the average Australian. Professor Paul Zimmet has advised in his wisdom that these communities could actually be wiped out by this disease. This view was confirmed by other experts that I met with in Cape Town in the last few days. Frankly, I am shocked and deeply, deeply concerned for the future of our Indigenous communities if we continue along the current path.
Diabetes is now impacting directly on 230 million adults worldwide. That is an estimate. It is nearly six per cent of the world’s adult population and it is increasing at seven million per year, with 70 per cent of the burden falling on the developing countries. Diabetes alone is causing a death every 10 seconds, an amputation every 30 seconds and is the leading cause of adult onset blindness and kidney failure and is equivalent in mortality to AIDS. They are shocking statistics. In my home state of Tasmania just a year or two ago we had 69 amputations from the knee down directly as a result of diabetes. It is a scary statistic indeed.
As far as Australia is concerned, I have mentioned our Indigenous populations but we also have a concern for the Pacific Islanders, who are particularly subject to this disease. They are amongst the worst affected in the world. What are we doing about it? Professor Silink has said that diabetes is undermining the benefits of economic gain and is thwarting efforts to reach the Millennium Development Goals in developing countries. Finally, I also want to thank Professor Paul Zimmet for his efforts—(Time expired)
