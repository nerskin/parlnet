Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (15:03):  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah moving immediately—


That this House calls on the Prime Minister to explain to the Australian people why she arrogantly refuses to give them a vote on whether Australia should introduce a carbon tax, a vote that she denied them at the last election when she said ""there will be no carbon tax under a Government I lead"", and now rules out a plebiscite. If the Prime Minister thinks the Australian people want a carbon tax, why is she so scared to give the people their say?


This motion to suspend standing orders is necessary because this debate and this plebiscite cannot wait. We have a government which is now rushing to sneak through this parliament a carbon tax for which it has no mandate whatsoever. It is typical of this frightened and floundering Prime Minister that she has yet again scurried from the chamber rather than stay for this debate, listen to what people have to say and defend her position. No previous Prime Minister in this House would have run away from debate the way this Prime Minister has. She runs away from debate and now she is running away from a vote on the biggest policy change that this parliament has ever been asked to make. She is running away from a vote on the biggest decision and the biggest change that the Australian people have ever been asked to contemplate.


This cannot wait, because the first task of national leadership is to tell the truth. That is the first task of national leadership. The first task of national leadership is to tell the truth when the Australian people are listening before an election. What we had from this Prime Minister was a complete deceit before the last election. Let us not forget what she said six days before the last election. These are words that will haunt her to her political grave and these are words that will echo around this chamber again and again until this government is defeated. She said before the last election, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.'


Having failed to seek a mandate at the last election, having refused to seek a mandate at the next election, there must be a vote now. There must be a vote now so that the Australian people can have their say on this massive change. Let no-one be under any illusion about the extent of the change that the Prime Minister wants to foist upon them without a mandate. This is the biggest single policy change in our history. This is not just a tax change. This is not just a revenue measure. This is a tax that purports to change the very way we live. This is a tax that proposes to change the very way we work. Every aspect of Australians' way of life and every aspect of Australians' way of work will be affected by this tax. That is why it is absolutely imperative that standing orders be suspended so that the Prime Minister can explain. A change of this magnitude must be put to the people first. There is no recent Prime Minister who would have run away from taking this tax to the people. We used to hear from the Prime Minister about the GST. She does not refer to the GST anymore because Prime Minister Howard had the guts to take his tax change to the people at the 1998 election. Prime Minister Howard had the guts to do it and this Prime Minister should also have the guts to face the people at a vote. She should have the guts, she should have the ticker and she should have the honesty to face the people at a vote. 


Let there be no doubt in this chamber about the impact of this carbon tax should it go ahead. There will be a 25 per cent increase in the price of electricity, and that is just for starters. This suspension is urgent because this matter cannot wait. There will be a 6½c a litre increase in the price of petrol, and that is just for starters. There will be an up to five per cent increase in the price of groceries, and that is just for starters. There will be 16 major coalmines closed, and that is just for starters. Standing orders must be suspended because the fate of those mines and those workers must be debated now—their fate should be put to a vote of the Australian people. 


There will be 45,000 jobs lost in energy-intensive industries. There will be 126,000 jobs lost mainly in regional Australia. Isn't that why members opposite are so scared of this tax? Isn't that why members opposite are openly talking to journalists about whether this Prime Minister can survive? The only job that this Prime Minister is interested in, it seems, is her own job. We know her record. She sabotaged the former Prime Minister, the member for Griffith, over the emissions trading scheme. It is urgent that we suspend standing orders so that she can explain herself. She deceived the Australian people at the last election and now—and this is why standing orders should be suspended—she is trying to deny the Australian people a vote on this matter, which is absolutely vital to their future. 


It seems that this Prime Minister is now deaf to everyone. When Paul Howes, the man who more than anyone else put her into the leadership, says, 'I want a guarantee from you, Prime Minister, that not a single job will be lost,' she does not listen. When Jennie George, former President of the ACTU, says, 'I want a guarantee from you, Prime Minister, that the steel industry will be wholly exempt from a carbon tax,' she does not listen. We know that members on her own backbench, such as the member for Throsby and the member for Cunningham, are now terrified of what a carbon tax will do to jobs in their electorates. We know that the member for Capricornia is terrified about the closure of multiple coalmines in her electorate. 


Why won't the Prime Minister listen? Why won't she listen to her own backbench? Why won't she, above all else, listen to the verdict of the Australian people? The first duty of any democratic politician is to tell the truth and then to trust the people. Tell the truth and trust the people are the duties of a democratic politician and this is what this Prime Minister must do. She must tell the truth and she must trust the people. That is why standing orders should be suspended so that for once, just for once, we can hear the truth from this Prime Minister. 


By not listening to anyone anymore, who does this Prime Minister most resemble? Her predecessor. Remember her predecessor. Remember what it was like 12 months ago when we heard constant off-the-record briefings from members opposite to journalists—the Prime Minister will not listen, the Prime Minister is a dictator, the Prime Minister has abolished cabinet government, the Prime Minister has lost his way. I tell you what: this Prime Minister has lost her way. She is more lost than he was. That is why, even at this late stage, she should start listening and, most of all, she should start listening to the people. 


Things are so bad for this Prime Minister that just about every broken-down old Labor warhorse now wants to come to Canberra to rescue the situation. Even Peter Beattie wants to come to Canberra. Even Morris Iemma wants to come to Canberra. Morris Iemma would be worth while having in this parliament because he understands the Hawker Britton style; he understands government that is all spin and no substance. Why don't we have him here as a reproach to the Sussex Street death squads that have done so much damage to Labor. What we want above all else is democracy, not hypocrisy, and that is why standing orders should be suspended. That is why we need a vote.




The SPEAKER:
  Is the motion seconded?

"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Ms JULIE BISHOP
 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:13):  I second the motion. This Prime Minister should return to the House immediately to explain to the Australian people why she will deny them the right to vote on one of the most significant economic changes in Australia's history. But we also think that the Prime Minister needs to come back to the chamber to explain—and this is why I am seeking a suspension of standing orders—why the Australian people find her so untrustworthy on this issue. In fact, the Prime Minister is considered to be so untrustworthy, so disappointing, so incompetent and, dare I say it, so misleading on this issue that just before I came into question time I looked on the ABC website—they have a little survey running about the Prime Minister; this is the Australian public broadcaster— 




Mr Hockey:
  Our ABC.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  Our ABC. They have asked the Australian public to submit three words that come to mind when they want to describe this Prime Minister. Then, with the wonders of technology, they create a word cloud, and that word cloud then highlights in large capital letters the words most often used by the Australian people replying to this survey about this Prime Minister. What do you think the first word is, the largest word?



Opposition members:  Liar!




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  Liar. That is what the Australian people say—'liar'. The second word is 'incompetent'. The third is 'disappointing'.




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition should be very careful with the expressions she uses. Just because she is quoting them does not entitle her to use them.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  The Prime Minister needs to come into this chamber and explain why it is that the Australian people describe her as a disaster, as dishonest, as ineffective, as hypocritical, as weak and as hopeless. But, in amongst the words, there is 'Kevin'. Why is it that when you mention this Prime Minister's name they remember Kevin? Because this Prime Minister betrayed her leader. She betrayed her leader and then she betrayed the Australian people when she promised there would be no carbon tax under the government she led. So this Prime Minister betrayed her leader, having promised never to challenge her leader. She would sooner fly to the moon or Mars or play full forward for the Doggies than challenge, but challenge she did. In this week-long festival of Kevin's revenge, this Prime Minister is too gutless to come into the House and explain to the Australian people why she betrayed them on the issue of a carbon tax.


Last Thursday we were subjected to the spectacle of the Prime Minister dismissing out of hand the votes of the House of Representatives and the Senate. A majority of the 150 members and the 76 senators voted to condemn a motion of this government in relation to the so-called Malaysian asylum seeker solution. Yet this Prime Minister, having not learnt the lesson that she is not above the will of this parliament, arrogantly walks out of this place and refuses to explain why it is she will not let the Australian people have a say on the most significant issue facing the Australian economy.


This is not a GST, which put up the price of some goods and which has been embraced by countries around the world. No, this is a tax that no other country on earth has introduced—a comprehensive, economy wide carbon tax that no other country has. This is a tax that will send jobs offshore, send production and manufacturing offshore. This is a tax that will damage our economy because it is designed to damage our economy. It is designed to go up and up, year on year. The government knows that it will be passed on, cascading through the economy, because it is a tax on energy. It is designed to change the way we live, the way we shop, the way we work. It is designed to change our behaviour by punishing people, making people victims of this government's ideology.


The Australian people deserve a say on this. They deserve a say. We can do this without going to an election. We know the result of an election. We are not putting it to an election; we are asking the government to give the Australian population the opport­unity to have their say via a plebiscite. Let the Australian people have their say. Why is this Prime Minister so afraid? If she truly believed in a carbon tax, she would argue her case before a plebiscite. If she truly believed that this was good for the Australian people, why did she say before the last election that there would be no carbon tax? Do you know why she said that? Because she knew she would not be Prime Minister today if she told the truth about the carbon tax.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:19):  The Leader of the Opposition's followers have morphed into a group of vuvuzelas. They have been listening to him for so long that they have got it right: 'No, no, no, no.' They have got it right, because that is what those opposite are about. You had an extraordinary perform­ance today, and now half of question times have been suspended by the opposition so that they can engage in the ego trip of the Leader of the Opposition—so that he can stand up for 10 minutes and do his ranting and raving and his relentless negativity. They swap around a bit. Sometimes it is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, sometimes it is the shadow Treasurer and sometimes it is the Manager of Opposition Business. But you know one thing: it will never be the member for Wentworth, who can never even get a question in this place. If we did not suspend standing orders so often, maybe he would get a question—which is why we should not suspend standing orders.


They moved this suspension on the basis that it is urgent. I ask you to take yourself back a little bit over 24 hours ago to when you woke up on Monday morning and you read the paper. It was so urgent he was going to do it at 10 am, but of course nothing happened yesterday. No-one was here at 10 am and nothing happened throughout the day. Of course, nothing has happened today either in the House of Representatives or in the Senate. Nothing has happened except that his stunt has been rejected as a stunt. And why has it been rejected as a stunt? Because so relentless is the Leader of the Opposition's negativity that when he went on the radio yesterday to sell the idea that it is vital that we give Australians a say and he was asked a simple question—question 1: 'What if they come back and they don't agree with you? Will you change your position?'—he said no. He said 'No, no, no, no' because he cannot help himself. What a farce.


You can imagine them workshopping it yesterday morning. You can imagine them in the tactics room. There they were: 'Well, Tone, it's gone well. We got the front page of the Telegraph. They look pretty stupid. We got the front page of the Herald Sun and they look stupid, and we got the Advertiser and they look stupid.' They all ran that this was going to happen. Imagine the workshop: 'Let's workshop some questions; let's do a little Q&A. First question: will you agree to be bound by the plebiscite? Answer: no.' You are a joke. You do not deserve to be the alternative Prime Minister of this country.




The SPEAKER:
  The Leader of the House will refer his remarks through the chair.




Mr ALBANESE:
  If you cannot get through such a simple—




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, on a point of order: while we are in some respects enjoying this pantomime from the Leader of the House, he should actually direct his remarks through the chair and not individually to members.




The SPEAKER:
  Order! I have just explained to the Leader of the House that he needs to address his remarks through the chair.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I will, Mr Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition has shown in the last 48 hours, if there was any doubt, that he is unfit for high public office—it is as simple as that. He himself said:


Disrupting the House is not a sign of a disciplined opposition; disrupting the House is a sign of a desperate opposition.


He then said:


What we have seen from members opposite consistently in the course of this year but particularly over the last few weeks is consistent, deliberate, planned and premeditated conduct to disrupt this House.


Does anyone think—does any single Australian who watches question time think—that this Leader of the Opposition does not have a premeditated strategy to trash the parliamentary processes? This person is not a conservative; he is a reactionary who has no respect for parliamentary institutions and no respect for due process as it occurs in this place. What he has respect for is the front page of newspapers. We see it day after day. Last week, we saw the Leader of the Opposition out there with an apparent new victim, Geoff Didier. He forgot to disclose that Mr Didier was a former, failed Liberal Party candidate.


But it gets better. Yesterday on the front page of the Australian we saw jeweller Peter Dracakis, with his assistant, in his store at Warringah Mall, backing up in this case not his opposition to climate change but his love of Work Choices. There are two things the Leader of the Opposition is passionate about: hating climate change and loving Work Choices. Again, the fact is that when you look into it—it does not take much—you find that Mr Dracakis and his father do own the family jewellery store that was featured in the article through their family company, Polmind Pty Ltd but you also find that Mr Dracakis is the president and financial controller of the Warringah Club—the personal fund-raising group of the Leader of the Opposition. That is who is out there arguing for Work Choices.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Leader of the House is completely off the leash. While it is at times amusing to find him so desperate, he should at least attempt to address the suspension of standing orders.




The SPEAKER:
  The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Leader of the House knows he must relate his contribution to the suspension.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I would not mind some questions in this House about Work Choices. For example, we might even ask about the investigation that took place last year in relation to this particular company for failing to comply with electoral donation laws. The same group that has raised over $110,000 for the Leader of the Opposition is calling—




Mr PYNE:
  I move:


That the member be no longer heard.



A division having been called and the bells being rung— 




The SPEAKER:
  While the tellers count the division, I indicate to members that we have present in the gallery representatives of the scientists in Parliament House who are participating in the 12th annual Science meets Parliament. Members would be aware that they have come from all over Australia to share their valuable work with parliamentarians. Some of them might try to propose a hypothesis that can give me some understanding of the phenomena occurring in this chamber at the moment.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (15:41):  I thank my colleagues for their support. Thank you for being here and staying and being attentive throughout the course of my matter of public importance. A little earlier this week, the Leader of the Opposition was asked what it would mean should the Labor Party swap leaders from Julia Gillard to Kevin Rudd. He reflected that it would be like swapping from Burke to Wills, both of whom failed on their journey. As we approach the 150th anniversary of the death of both Burke and Wills, who were declared to be dead on the same day, for historical purposes, by the Victorian government 149 years ago, never let it be said that we are not the party mindful of history. We are. We are mindful of the fact that Burke and Wills failed on their journey, but indeed they were captivated by a heroic ambition, and that was to cross the continent.


Sadly, the modern-day Burke and Wills, the Prime Minister and the former Prime Minister, possess neither the ambition nor the courage to be able to deliver something so grandiose as a good government. Australians deserve a good government. They deserve a competent and consistent government. The Australian economy, which is enjoying the very best terms of trade in 150 years, deserves strong leadership. And yet over the last four years the Burke and Wills of modern-day Australian politics have completely misled the Australian people. They have on so many occasions said one thing but delivered the absolute opposite. They have made grandiose claims but have never been able to back them up with reality. 


I have compiled a list. It is just a short list, covering 100 separate issues! As I have less than 13 minutes, I will select but a few to remind my colleagues of the inconsistency of the modern-day Labor Party over the last four years. For example, we recall that in 2007 the Labor Party promised to cut the bill for consultants substantially as part of their budget savings. And yet over the following two years they spent over $1 billion on consultants. They said they would build a broadband network for $4.7 billion. They have had a $30 billion blow-out. They said they would simplify the GST paperwork for small business. The shadow minister would appreciate that. They promised BAS easy in 2007, and then they scrapped it in 2009. What about the trade training centres, my colleague the shadow minister for education? They promised 2,650 trade training centres. But they have delivered one. And how could we forget Peter Garrett, the former minister for the environment? He promised to take Japan to the International Court of Justice to stop whaling. Of course, that never eventuated either. With Fuelwatch—



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr HOCKEY:
  I am glad my colleague here is so obsessed with Fuelwatch—rather uncomfortably obsessed with Fuelwatch for a while. Fuelwatch was promised because according to former Prime Minister Rudd it would bring down petrol prices. Alas, not only did Fuelwatch fail but the petrol commissioner quit after just four months—another failure. The government then said they would take over public hospitals in mid-2009. They failed to do that. They said they would deliver 36 GP superclinics and they have only delivered 11.


They promised one regulation in, one regulation out. I understand the total number of new regulations since Labor was elected exceeds 10,000. How many have been abolished?




Mr Billson:
  A handful. There are 220 for each one.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Two hundred and twenty new regulations for every one that they have abolished. Remember they said they would establish a department of homeland security? It was never delivered. They said they would have an independent election debate commission. That was never delivered. What a grandiose claim computers in schools were. There has been a $1.2 billion blowout and they have not delivered a computer on every desk. With childcare centres the former Prime Minister promised to end the double drop-off. They promised 260 childcare centres. They delivered just 38 and then they had the Minister for Sport announce they were not going to continue with the program.


With private health insurance, the former Prime Minister gave an ironclad guarantee to the Australian people he would not touch private health insurance. Then he had a backflip and wanted to introduce a means test. Of course, speaking of means tests, the Labor Party said they would not touch the baby bonus, but of course they touched the baby bonus. They had their little socialist mitts all over the baby bonus and that was the end of it.


The minister at the table, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, knows this one because she has contributed to it: the Commonwealth public bureaucracy. The Labor Party promised they would cut the red tape and cut the bureaucrats. Since they were elected 20,000 extra public servants have been employed in Canberra.


But there is more. There is a set of steak knives coming down the path. The government said it would not touch employee share schemes and then it had an on-again, off-again attack on employee share schemes. I forgot about this next one. The government promised green incentives, including a $50 green rewards card. I completely forgot about that but so did Labor. It was never delivered. Then there was GROCERY choice. You remember old Swanee used to have a list of a basket of goods from the local Franklins that he would take out each week. He would say how hard Australians were doing it. He said, 'We're going to bring down those grocery prices because we're going to watch them.' GROCERY choice, promised in 2007, was abandoned in 2009. They promised there would be no cap on the bank deposit guarantee 12 days before they introduced one.


Then they said they would impose no new taxes. This is perhaps the most breathtaking of their broken promises. They promised no new taxes and now, after four years, Labor have introduced or increased 19 taxes. The most substantial backflips have been on the things that matter most to the Australian people, and that is where it hits their hip pocket.


The government said that they needed for moral purposes to have an emissions trading scheme. It was the greatest moral challenge of our time. Then they broke that commitment. Even worse, the leaders behind that broken commitment were the now Prime Minister and the now Deputy Prime Minister. So I can understand the grim face of the member for Griffith when he walks into this chamber each day and has to suffer the fact that it is the now Prime Minister who sits near the dispatch box, because she was the lady who advised him to dump the emissions trading scheme. It was the then Deputy Prime Minister who advised him to dump the emissions trading scheme. So he is wondering: how does that work? Not only does the policy come back, but these guys get promoted after they misled me.


This indicates that there is a continuum in relation to this mob, which is that they need to impose a tax where they see a problem. When they see the problem of alcohol consumption by young people, in comes an alcopops tax. When they see that the Australian car industry is doing it tough, they increase the tax on luxury cars. When they see that the health system is suffering because there is not enough money going into it, they try to impose additional costs on private health insurance. When the government see that the mining industry is driving business investment—it has gone from 15 per cent of every dollar invested in Australia 10 years ago to nearly 60c in every dollar now—what do the government do? They whack a tax on it. 


Of course, when it comes to carbon emissions, the government's great big solution to that is to whack another tax on it. But of all the new taxes, of all the insidious acts of this government, I truly believe that the one that most riled the Australian people was when the Prime Minister asked the Australian people to give generously for the flood victims in Queensland. After they donate money, organise community fund­raisers, have telethons—after Australians go out of their way to give whatever discretionary sums they have available to help their mates in Queensland—what does the government do? It whacks a tax on it. No wonder the Australian people are so cynical, because this means that now the Australian people do not trust their Prime Minister and their Treasurer. 


It was Kevin Rudd at a press conference on 29 February 2008 who said:


Trust is the key currency of politics …


Little did he know that he would become a devalued currency. He would become the peso of the Pacific as soon as trust became the key currency of politics. But it goes further, because in down time at night, when I am suffering a little bit of insomnia, what do I turn to? I turn to the words of the current Prime Minister. I dug out these words from the current Prime Minister on 10 May 2005:


… the Labor Party is the party of truth telling.


I believe the words still stand. Come on, Bill, rush to her defence!


The government is so inept that, when the Prime Minister took the job in the night of the long knives, with barely a year to go, she said:


I asked my colleagues to make a leadership change, a change because I believed that a good government was losing its way.


The good government that was losing its way is now a bad government that is still losing its way. The bad government that is still losing its way is having an impact on the confidence of the Australian people. The bad government which has lost its way is now causing so much concern to Australian consumers that, according to latest Westpac-Melbourne Institute Consumer Sentiment Index, confidence fell to the lowest level in two years last month. So we have unemployment falling, we have economic growth improving, we have the best terms of trade in 140 years, and everyday Australians have less confidence than they did two years ago in the wake of the financial crisis.


Do you know what, Mr Deputy Speaker? It is reflected in the fact that Australians are cocooning themselves, wrapping themselves in a security blanket, afraid of the instability coming out of Canberra. Household savings have increased to 11½ per cent of disposable income, a level not seen since the global financial crisis back in 2007-08. Australians are wrapping themselves up. Their discretionary spend is down remarkably, and why? Because of the incompetence of this government, because of the inconsistency of this government, because of the fact that this government cannot hold a policy from midnight to dawn. It cannot even hold a prime minister from midnight to dawn, let alone hold a policy from midnight to dawn. This is a government that has no trust. It does not trust itself, so how can it expect the Australian people to trust it? How can it expect the Australian people to believe what it says?

): Honourable members will direct their remarks through the chair, and that includes the Assistant Treasurer.




Mr HOCKEY:
  Here we have the man sharpening his knives. There is one person who pays a visit to Shortie's house every week, and that is the knife sharpener. He comes around for 20 bucks a knife, and he sharpens them up for old Billy, because Billy and his mate Paul Howes are just waiting for the moment. They are waiting for the moment, just as they did with Prime Minister Rudd. When he was not looking, along came the knives. So too it comes again. Once an animal has blood on his teeth, he will have the blood again. It is easy to kill twice; it is hard to kill once. But the Assistant Treasurer has done it, and the Australian people know it.



Mr Shorten interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The Assistant Treasurer will have his go shortly.



Honourable members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for North Sydney will be heard in silence.




Mr HOCKEY:
  When it comes to competence, when it comes to consistency, when it comes to truth, when it comes to honesty, when it comes to personal integrity, the Australian people have identified the Labor Party as missing all of that. They have identified that the Labor Party is without leadership. It is not consistent. It is not honest. It is not genuine.


In some parts of Australia, they refer to it as bovine defecation. In other parts of Australia they call it bullshit. It is the fact that this mob do not tell the truth, and if they do not tell the truth they cannot expect the Australian people to believe in them. If they do not trust each other, how can the Australian people trust them? If they do not have a consistent plan for the nation, how can they expect the Australian people to trust them?

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (15:56):  I entered this place being an optimist and I am always optimistic that Mr Hockey will say something of substance. I will not give up, even though we did not hear anything in the last 15 minutes to sustain my optimism. In fact, when I was looking at some of the great Joe Hockey comments in politics, I realised that he added to the list last night at the CEDA dinner. Mr Hockey was the guest star speaker at the Committee for Economic Development of Australia. In a question-and-answer session, with Mr Hockey perhaps after dinner in a moment of veritas, or truth, he was asked about his greatest regret in politics: 'Mr Hockey, what's your greatest regret in politics?' There were 200 people there to hear it, 200 witnesses. When he was pressed for an honest answer, Mr Hockey hesitated—and obviously I cannot do his avuncular, hail-fellow-well-met style—and said, 'Not pushing John Howard harder to go.' There is the Liberal Party: no consistency. They pretend to be one thing and yet they do another thing.


The people listening to parliament may or may not be aware of what the process of a matter of public importance is. It is an opportunity for the opposition to debate a matter of the day, a topic of the day. The topic which the opposition were raising and which they said they wanted to debate was consistency in financial management, so I thought I would prepare and speak to the topic, as opposed to perhaps doing the more ad hominem personal attacks beloved of some in the opposition, the low-rent behaviour which we saw yesterday from the Leader of the Opposition when we had the visiting Prime Minister of New Zealand—the first time ever that we have had the Prime Minister of New Zealand on the floor of parliament. We saw that our Prime Minister spoke appropriately. She did not try and score any points off the opposition, because sometimes in politics the moment is greater than the individuals. We had the Prime Minister of New Zealand here in part to recognise the work we have done after their terrible tragedies in Christchurch. Our Prime Minister understands, as does the government, that sometimes you have to suspend the verbal hostilities and the jousting and say, 'The whole nation is on display.' So she spoke, presented the case for Australia and recognised New Zealand's fundamental importance to Australia. But then the Leader of the Opposition came to his feet. We in the government did not think he would, but we sort of half expected that he would not fail to disappoint, and he in fact did disappoint us when he started having a crack at the government in front of the visiting Prime Minister of New Zealand.


Some people in politics say that it should always be winner take all; it does not matter what you do, whatever it takes, you just have to win the argument at all costs. But the government is not informed by that sort of low-rent politics. We think that we have to encourage Australians to not be afraid of the future—and this is one of the big things, when we look at consistency in this political debate at the moment, that the opposition are not interested in. They want to scare the Australian public. They are not interested in consistent economic debate. So I would like to present for the benefit of the House and, indeed, those who listen to parliament some propositions about what the Gillard government is actually doing in terms of consistent economic management. Let me start off with the fundamentals, the economy—a topic the opposition do not always come to in question time. What has happened since the global financial crisis is that we have seen a very big hit from 2008 on on Commonwealth revenues. In other words, the Australian economy felt the effects of the global financial crisis. Obviously from Ireland to Greece to Portugal to Europe and North America we have seen terrible effects where there has been a massive downturn in economic activity. We saw the collapse of Lehman Bros, the big bank in New York, on Wall Street. That has had repercussions throughout the Western world. Australia was not immune. Corporate profits were terribly hit in 2008 and 2009 and indeed we still feel some of the after-effects now. That is one of the challenges this government has had to contend with, the largest economic dislocation since the Great Depression.


This government stared the issues in the face. We said, 'Okay, on the best economic advice we have got we need to stimulate the economy, we have got to guarantee the security of the banks, we have got to make sure that people have some money to spend to help stimulate the retail economy, we have got to make sure people are in work.' That is why we have done the greatest expenditure on the school system, on the primary schools of Australia, that we have ever seen. Through the stimulus package combining with our education agenda, what we have seen this government do and continue to do as new facilities open up is for the first time in 40 or 50 years we are seeing resources being built in the schools of Australia which are as good as the homes that Australians live in. What an important message about the priority of education, the fundamental uplift in quality of education, sent by our Prime Minister when she was education minister to say that we know we have got to keep people in work, we know there are thousands of tradespeople all around Australia who are affected by the downturn, the global financial crisis to which I was referring. What our Prime Minister did was say, 'Enough is enough. We have to make decisions,' as did the whole of the government. We have seen now something like 9,000 projects started and many completed and many to be completed in the near future. What we have also seen is a message sent to the children of Australia from their parents, the taxpayers, and the government of Australia that we think education is important. We want children to be educated in facilities which are as good as the homes they live in, sending an important message about education.


When I talk about how we have coped with the financial crisis and the consistent economic management of the Labor government, we have to recognise what we have done to get our finances back into shape. It is a little-known story that the reduction in Commonwealth tax revenue had a massive impact. Imagine if you are a business in Australia and instead of having 100 per cent of the revenue you had for any number of years it is down to 83 per cent of the revenue but you still have to carry on 100 per cent of the functions and more. That is what we have been doing. Yet we have seen the fastest turnaround on record in terms of getting the budget heading towards being back in the black. The opposition conveniently like to state when they trail their usual rhetoric against the government that in fact the global financial crisis was just a hiccup. Let us not forget what the Leader of the Opposition said on 12 March 2009. He said, 'We are against the government's stimulus package.' Let us not forget that the opposition opposed the stimulus package consistently and now they are trying to resist us getting the budget back into the black.


It is not just getting the budget back into the black which is important. We understand that having a surplus in the budget is important to withstand future ups and downs of economic life on this globe of ours. Australia is an island geographically but we are not disconnected from what happens in the rest of the world. That is why we have been working so hard to reduce our debt. Let us put this debt debate in context. The opposition like to say, 'We are low-taxing and the government is high-taxing.' But the numbers actually contradict that myth. The opposition when they were in power had the mining boom mark 1 and an increase in financial surpluses and they just spent the money.


We have had the privilege of coming to office but at a time when revenues are down. We have had to continue the functions of government and we have had to borrow money to carry out the functions of gover­nment, and to carry out the reconstruction work after the natural disasters. It has not just been the global financial crisis; we have seen cyclones and floods, we have seen the bushfires in Western Australia. We have seen a massive set last summer of terrible climatic events. Billions of dollars of infrastructure have been wrecked and lost. So what we have to do is make hard decisions to find the money to help Queenslanders get back on their feet and other people who are flood affected get back on their feet by making sure the roads get repaired, the bridges get repaired, the railways get repaired, making sure that people have the opportunity to get back on their feet as quickly as possible.


So we have consistently managed through an extreme set of economic circumstances, and at the same time we have got the mining boom. You have got a trifecta of events. You had the global financial crisis, you had the terrible climatic events and then we have also seen the mining boom mark 2, which has been a great outcome for people working in the mining sector and the construction sector related to mining and for people providing services to mining. But the whole Australian economy is not receiving the benefits in the same way. We have certainly seen massive capital expansion in the mining sector. We are seeing good rates of pay and we are seeing that jobs in the mining sector are going very well, but at the same time our dollar has gone up—we have a very high Australian dollar. So the mining boom is having good and negative effects. The rest of the world is interested in our currency, especially as America is depressed in terms of the value of its dollar. So we have sections of the Australian economy that trade with the rest of the world—be it inbound tourism, domestic tourism, parts of retail, regional parts of Australia—who are doing it a lot harder than other parts of Australia. This government is determined that we spread the benefits of the mining boom to all. 


The opposition like to have a bet each way on this issue. On the one hand they do not like our Commonwealth mineral resource rent tax but they like it when the West Australian Premier increases tax on mining. I think this smacks of double standards. Why is it that a Liberal tax is a good tax but a Labor tax is a bad tax? I can tell you why: because there is a lack of intellectual consistency.




Mr Christensen:
  The state owns the minerals.




Mr SHORTEN:
  The member for Dawson says the state owns the minerals. Do you know who I think owns the minerals? The Australian people—West Australians, Queenslanders, Australians. I respect the fact that the member for Dawson has been elected but he is a new member in this place and what he should understand is that a lot of Australians do not actually think that these resources belong to just one company or several companies. Companies operate under a licence and, when you use finite resources, they are gone. What is left after that? I admire Australian mining companies. I have dealt with many of them. I admire multinational mining companies, maybe not as much as the member for Dawson but I accept they are very important in the Australian economy. What I also know is that when they move on they move on. I have worked as a union rep in Townsville and when the company moves on there is not a lot of love left after they have gone. We on this side know that a mining boom does not last forever. In an uneven economy we want to spread the prosperity of the mining boom. So, what are we going to do? We are going to decrease company tax for all 2½ million businesses in Australia, and not just look after the mining sector.


We want to make sure that superannuation goes up from nine to 12 per cent, because we think it is important that when people retire after working for 40 years they have enough money to retire on.



Wyatt Roy interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  I know that that is not a big issue for the member for Longman. He will have a distinguished career in life, I have no doubt. But what I do know is that if you are baby boomer, born at some time between 1945 and 1965, you may work for 30 or 40 years but chances are you will not have had the chance in many cases to save enough money to retire. Whilst we do have the safety net of the age pension, which this government has increased—



Wyatt Roy interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  I know the age pension does not worry the member for Longman, but it worries a lot of other people in his electorate.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  Order! The member for Longman is obviously not in his seat.




Mr SHORTEN:
  We want to make sure that our people have adequate retirement incomes. This is a very important issue. We want to use the mining tax to replace forgone Commonwealth revenue as we provide the opportunity for Australians to have money put aside in superannuation savings, which are taxed at a lower rate than they otherwise would be.


Let me also tell you why I think we are consistent and those opposite are not. Any member of parliament elected before 2004 gets what they call a defined benefit scheme. Very nice. I wasn't elected then, but very nice for those who have got it.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  Indeed, there would be several opposite who can sympathise with this point. But if you were elected after 2004 you get 15 per cent super, which is a very generous deal. What I do not like is that those opposite would vote for Australians at large to get only nine per cent. My view is that if it is good enough for us it is good enough for the people. If it is good enough for members of parliament, we need to lift super. All point-scoring aside, I know that there would be plenty on the opposition side who would think that there is a case there.


Let me be clear: we are consistent. We have invested in education.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  I know that when people are embarrassed they sometimes laugh to hide their embarrassment. I think we have just seen a little bit of a laboratory experiment from those opposite.


We are seeking to consistently manage this economy. Another problem that we are consistent on is that we know climate change is real. We heard the Prime Minister of New Zealand say that he thinks climate change is real. We have had all the scientists from around Australia come to visit Canberra and they think climate change is real. The problem is that those opposite are run by a gentleman, Mr Abbott, the member for Warringah, who has the intellectual curiosity of an Inquisition monk. He is not greatly interested in the science. Although, at different times the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, has said that a carbon tax is a good idea and at other times he has supported an emissions trading scheme. Certainly, when he realised that he might have a third of the caucus to back him to knock of Malcolm Turnbull, he was then prepared to go very hardline right wing—very hardline and very right wing.


Then we had the shadow Treasurer, who entertained us so jovially before. He said that what you think about climate change is a matter of conscience. I love that.



Opposition members interjecting—




The SPEAKER:
  Honourable members will not interject from outside their seat.




Mr SHORTEN:
  I appreciate the attention of the House to this matter. We are consistent, the coalition are not. We are determined to manage this economy for the long term and not the short term. We are focused on the best interests of Australians, not tomorrow's headlines in the newspapers.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (16:11):  On this matter of public importance we have just been treated to another lecture from the high moral ground by the Assistant Treasurer—as he leaves the chamber—defending the failure of this government: their failure on trust and their failure on competence. He might leave the chamber, just as he leaves every single issue of importance in his portfolio.


The Assistant Treasurer said the Australian public should not be scared about the future. The Australian public are scared about the Gillard government. They are scared about what they are doing and what they will do if they get the chance. This matter of public importance goes to the heart of the failure of this government. Australians are losing confidence because of this government. They are losing confidence because this has proved to be an incompetent government and because this government cannot be trusted. Those members opposite—the Assistant Treasurer has departed the chamber—will stand here and defend 3½ years of utter incompetence. It is incompetence on a scale we have not seen before.


Policy failure and policy debacle from this government are like matchbox cars: there are a million of them. You start at the beginning, as the shadow Treasurer did, and you move through each budget and each announce­ment. Every announcement they have made of any scale has either blown out or not been delivered. The shadow Treasurer mentioned the computers in schools—$1.2 billion, I think he said.




Mr Bradbury:
  A wonderful program.




Mr TONY SMITH:
  A wonderful program, says the parliamentary secretary. A wonderful program not delivered and with a $1 billion-plus blowout. Building the Education Revolution had a $1.7 billion blowout and waste in every corner of the country. More than $1 billion here and $1.7 billion there; waste all over the country. But these $1 billion and $2 billion figures are just rounding errors to those opposite.


The Assistant Treasurer has only been a minister for a short period of time. But let's give him one thing: he has caught on very quickly to this litany of incompetence. He gave us another speech from the high moral ground—he almost needs an oxygen tank, he is up so high. But it has not taken him long to fit in with the incompetence of this government. We did not hear one thing from the Assistant Treasurer about competent administration. We did not hear one squeak from him to acknowledge failure on behalf of this government. It is that very failure in policy delivery that is making the Australian public so nervous about this government and about economic circumstances in Australia. He was here today on this matter of public importance and he could have addressed one of the issues for which he is responsible. A week ago he woke up to a front page of the Financial Review that showed the luxury car tax is being rorted. Those behind me will remember that the luxury car tax, which has existed for some time, was massively increased by this government from 25 to 33 per cent in 2008. You would think it would be pretty obvious that when you massively increase a tax like that the incentives for would-be rorters to evade it would increase correspondingly. So what steps did the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, take to ensure enforcement was beefed up to deal with what was obviously a heightened risk with the higher tax rate that those opposite brought in? Apparently none. What follow-through was there? Apparently none.


As those behind me will readily agree, the Treasurer's ignorance and incompetence leading to another policy debacle is not really news—situation normal from the Treasurer, Mr Swan. But what about the bloke who is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the tax office, the Assistant Treasurer, who was here before during this debate and has now departed from the chamber? It is seven days since this story appeared. Seven days ago the Assistant Treasurer woke up to the front page of the Financial Review and discovered he has a rupture in the luxury car tax the size of the tear in the side of the Titanic. And what has he got to say about it? Absolutely nothing. For seven days he has said nothing. We can only assume he has done absolutely nothing. We do not know what he plans to do about it, but we can assume from the past actions of this government that his first step, in the tradition of this government, will be to do absolutely nothing. He will hope it goes away, just like the Prime Minister hoped the Building the Education Revolution debacles would go away.


The Assistant Treasurer ought to do something no other minister in the Rudd or Gillard governments have done—that is, take responsibility. He should come forward and actually own up to the mess they have created and candidly tell the Australian people how they are going to fix it. But of course whenever there is any criticism of this government those opposite just say it is a scare campaign. It is not a scare campaign; it is a truth campaign. Truth is an issue this government also has a great problem with. A guy at the local football club summed it up pretty well when he said, 'I don't know what frightens me more: when they try and implement a policy and muck it up or the anger it causes me when they break their word. I'm not sure which upsets me more.'


We have talked about the blow-outs and the incompetence. The Australian public are rightly angry about those and they know that this government cannot do better. This government cannot improve; its incomp­etence level is locked into its DNA. But this government is also fundamentally untruthful. We have seen it with the Prime Minister over and over again. Six days before the last election she said, 'There will not be a carbon tax under the government I lead', and a day before the election on the front page of the Australian was the very same commitment. That was not a commitment that came out of the blue. It was considered, it was calculated and she made that commitment knowing it not to be true. 


The Treasurer seems to slip through a lot of this, but he said exactly the same thing. On 15 August he told Meet the Press that to suggest the government was moving towards a carbon tax was an 'hysterical allegation'—and that is exactly what they are doing. We have come to expect this from the Treasurer, and the public now know that this Treasurer is both incompetent and untrustworthy. The member for Griffith knows this well. We are coming up to the first anniversary of the member for Griffith's demise as Prime Minister.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr TONY SMITH:
  'Fundamental injustice day', said a colleague behind me. It is fundamental injustice day 2, the sequel, because the member for Griffith named the introduction of the goods and services tax as 'fundamental injustice day'. Three hundred and sixty-five days ago, a couple of days before the coup, the Treasurer was supporting the Prime Minister. The press tell us that the Treasurer still, in all that time, has not had a proper conversation with the foreign minister. It is getting on to the first anniversary. And he was such a loyal Treasurer! We are told by the press gallery in all the accounts of that night that this spineless Treasurer did not even have the courage to tell the then Prime Minister he was bailing on him. The Australian public knows someone like that cannot be trusted with the economy and the decisions— (Time expired)




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  Before I call the member for Parramatta I will remind members that it is disorderly to interject from outside their seats and, under standing order 64, it is disorderly to refer to other honourable members by their names. I was reluctant to interrupt the offenders on both sides of the chamber with respect to those two matters. I now give the call to the honourable member for Parramatta.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2011-06-21,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (16:21):  Listening to the previous two opposition speakers, one would not know we were talking about a matter of public importance involving consistency and confidence. In fact, I do not think the mover of the motion mentioned either of those two words. Instead, we got a rather low-level comedy routine from a man who pretends he is capable of being the Treasurer of this country. It is not surprising, because this is not an opposition that cares about confidence; it is an opposition that takes every opportunity to run scare campaigns to damage confidence.


This motion today on rebuilding confidence in the Australian economy is hypocrisy writ large. It is yet another stunt from an opposition without a single idea, an opposition that takes every opportunity to claim that the world will end at any moment. If that were right, the world would have ended several times in the last few months alone. The opposition exaggerates; it misinforms on a daily basis. The Leader of the Opposition goes on national tours to promote fear in any way he can to anyone he can, to weaken confidence and to provoke doubt.


And then they come in here and move a motion about consistency and confidence and, true to form, do not even bother to talk about it. The truth is that they do not want confidence in the Australian economy because it does not suit their political self-interest. Fear is the method they use. They undermine confidence. That is the game they play, and they play that game with the lives and welfare of Australians.


Then there is the word 'consistency' from this opposition—a motion about consistency from an opposition with a leader who is a self-proclaimed weathervane. He gets up every morning and decides his policy position based on which way the wind is blowing—the political wind, that is. They are consistent about one thing, and that is that they oppose everything and anything every single day. No matter what it is, they oppose it. Recently we even saw, when it came to the alternative fuels bill, that they opposed their own policy. It is opposition at all costs. From the masters of the scare campaign, from the masters of confusion and doubt, suddenly we have a motion about consistency and confidence. That, quite frankly, is a joke, and it is not surprising that they did not bother to speak on it.


The opposition has one more speaker to go. Maybe you can actually do it. Maybe you can actually address the motion you have moved in this House as a matter of such importance that we are spending an hour and a half debating it. The opposition has another 10 minutes to actually speak to it. It would take a serious change in the behaviour of the opposition and the attitudes of those opposite for anyone to take this motion seriously.


I would actually like to speak to this motion, because confidence and consistency are extremely important, and the government has been delivering sound, consistent policy. It has resulted in the positive economic outcomes that the shadow Treasurer referred to in his speech—in one of his more lucid moments. We have been delivering sound policy, but there is no doubt a sense of uncertainty out there and we do need to acknowledge that. The opposition are not causing it, but they are thrashing about in every way they can to try to find a way to exploit it for their own political benefit.


Let us acknowledge some of that uncertainty and what the most likely causes are. There was a global financial crisis a few years ago. I know the opposition try to pretend it did not happen—they do that every day—but it did happen. It was not the making of the government, but we weathered the storm as a nation better than did just about any developed country in the world. There is consistent talk still about problems in Europe—again, not a problem of the government's making and not related to Australian circumstances. There is unrest in the Middle East—again, something that makes people feel uneasy. We have had earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, cyclones and fires around the world, among our neighbours and in our own backyard, which have resulted in short-term increases in prices, particularly for food. But we are already, as a nation, rebuilding after those disasters. We are already out there rebuilding the roads, the rail, the schools, the public buildings and the homes.


There is a growing need to act on climate change. A new resources boom is on its way. Economic power around the world is changing. We have a strong dollar, putting pressure on manufacturing. These are times of change and readjustment and they can cause unease among people in our communities and around the country. What you do not do in times like this is run fake scare campaigns. You do not come out every day finding a way to exploit that uncertainty for your own political gain. You do not do that, members of the opposition. It is not the right thing to do, particularly when you know in your heart of hearts how well the economy is travelling. Again, we had acknowledgement from the shadow Treasurer just 20 minutes ago about that.


We are in an excellent position as a nation to respond to the challenges that face us. We have the capacity within us as a people and we are in a very, very strong economic position. Australians can be confident about the future. We have strong jobs growth and business investment, and our public finances are the envy of the world. That shows that we are continuing to get the policy settings right. You do not get the policy settings right through times like this because you are incompetent, as the opposition would say, or because of inconsistency. In fact, it is quite the opposite. No other developed country in the world has steered its economy through the present financial times as well as this one has. That is acknowledged broadly.


Let me refer to a couple of other organisations and people around the world who confirm that. The IMF, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the global rating agencies have all backed the strength of our budget position and the strategy to return the budget to surplus. S&P said recently that Australia has exceptionally strong public sector finances, underpinned by low public debt and strong fiscal discipline. In response to the recent budget, S&P noted:


… the sound profile of Australia's public finances, which remain among the strongest of our peer group.


Moody's said that the budget demonstrates the government's determination to return to fiscal surplus and that our government debt remains among the lowest of all AAA-rated governments. So it seems that many respected agencies around the world will confirm that the Australian economy is travelling incredibly well, particularly given the extraordinary circumstances the world has faced in the last three years.


We saw the national accounts delivered on Wednesday. We saw a slight contraction in the quarter of about 1.2 per cent but one per cent growth across the year. It was encouraging to see the components of GDP, such as consumption, dwelling investment and business investment, growing in the first three months of this year. We have already seen a strong rebound in the economy in the monthly figures. Trade data shows that coal exports were up by almost 16 per cent over the past two months. Iron ore and metal shipments have gained 23 per cent. We saw a solid gain in retail sales in April, and we know from our own retail sector how important that is. In fact, it was the biggest monthly increase in 17 months. Australians can be confident about our strong fundamentals. Our economy is forecast to create around 500,000 jobs in the next couple of years, and an unprecedented pipeline of mining investment is on its way. In the last 12 months, prior to the budget, 258,000 Australians gained jobs.


We are consistent on this side of the chamber about the need to put a price on carbon. We went to the 2007 election committed to putting a price on carbon; we attempted to do that. If there is any inconsistency in this House about this it is from the opposition, who also went to the 2007 election promising to put a price on carbon, contrary to their calls now for a plebiscite to gauge public opinion. In spite of public opinion and public views at that stage, their own commitment to do it and our clear mandate to do it, they voted against it. There was no commitment then to the will of the people. There was no commitment at all when they voted against what was their policy position and something that we had a clear mandate to do.


We also went to the 2010 election with a commitment to pricing carbon. If members of the opposition who do not believe that do a little googling, in the last weeks of the campaign they will find copious newspaper articles where our commitment to price carbon in this term is made very clear. We have been consistent about that and we will deliver on that. We will deliver on pricing carbon because that is the only way to provide consistency—again, what this motion is about—and certainty to business in Australia so that they can move forward, make the investment decisions that they need to, set themselves up and begin the process of exploiting what is a worldwide move to a clean economy. That is consistency, and we could well do with the opposition finding a single position to stand on this for the good of the whole nation.


This is a motion about consistency and confidence, and I am proud to stand up here as part of a government that has delivered consistency in its policies. I am proud to stand up here as part of a government that has delivered a strong economy in what are some very difficult international conditions.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2011-06-21,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (16:31):  I commend the shadow Treasurer for proposing this matter of public importance for discussion, because there certainly is an urgent need for consistency from this government so that we can restore confidence in the economy. But, sadly, what we heard from the member for Parramatta for over half of her speech was more of the same bleating, finger-pointing, whingeing and whining about the coalition and its policies, pointing to all of the problems and all of the uncertainty that this government, after almost four years and two prime ministers, still has not addressed. That only serves to highlight the absolute deficiency there is on the treasury bench in terms of consistent, well-thought-through policies.


We had the Assistant Treasurer before that with about seven of his caucus members. Boy, Bill, you are sure going to have to do the numbers a bit better—assassination day is coming up pretty quickly! He gave us some propositions on what the government is doing about the economy. They stared at the issues, he said. Well, that was about it. Overpriced school halls, pink batts, $900 money-for-nothing cheques that went to buying plasma TVs from China—none of this saved the economy. What a joke! Neither the Assistant Treasurer nor anyone in this government had anything to do with this country's economic rebound after the GFC. It was the mining industry and the agricultural industry that saved this country from recession, not pink batts and overpriced school halls. And aren't they doing their best to kill off those industries through, firstly, the taxes that the Assistant Treasurer talked about—the carbon tax and the mining tax? The words 'spread the wealth' that he used so liberally are just socialist code for ripping out the money that is being generated in productive regions like Mackay, Townsville, Central and North Queensland and WA and funnelling it off to Sydney, Melbourne and, not to forget, to fill in the ever-growing $107-plus billion worth of government debt that the Assistant Treasurer allowed to be ramped up to $250 billion when he came into this place in the dead of night with his amendment bills to the budget.


What inconsistency we have from the government on a range of different issues. I am going to highlight two of them. We have had this absolute stuff-up of a policy on the live animal exports front. We have seen in the last month just how reckless this inconsistent government is. There was a whole lot of finger-pointing going on after the nation witnessed the barbaric cruelty to Aussie bred cattle on Four Corners. Some blamed Meat and Livestock Australia, some blamed LiveCorp and some blamed the entire industry. But the reality is that a lot of the blame lies with this Gillard Labor government for its slow reaction and indifference to the issue.


Several months after the federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Joe Ludwig, became aware of the footage of cruelty shown on Four Corners, the government finally reacted. And—would you believe it?—they got it right the first go. They did what should have been done as soon as they knew of the cruelty footage when Animals Australia made the minister aware of it. But, before Four Corners, we had the member for Page moving motions that were all but trying to shut down the live export industry. Then we had pressure from people like the member for Fremantle and the member for Wills, two people from those great cattle-grazing electorates of Fremantle and Wills, telling caucus and Minister Ludwig what was to happen—and that was that they were going to shut down the industry. So the government buckled. It was a shining case of inconsistency. The minister buckled by completely banning live cattle exports to Indonesia and, bizarrely, even to abattoirs that use the humane process of stunning. By doing so, the government have now firmly pointed the finger of blame at the entire cattle industry, because they are the only ones penalised by this decision. The government are refusing to compensate graziers, who stand to lose a multimillion dollar export market, instead saying that the MLA should pay when they were the only ones trying to improve practices in Indonesia. The MLA did not ban the live exports; the government did. They should compensate. Better still, they should show some consistency and some compassion for the farmers in North Queensland and reopen live exports to those Indonesian abattoirs whose practices are in accordance with international standards. This is people's lives we are talking about.


A lot of people in this room and around the country may have seen the email doing the rounds from Mr Scot Braithwaite. Scot is the nephew of a former member for Dawson, Ray Braithwaite. He has also been associated with the live export industry for decades, including being employed as a head stockman. I want to take a moment to quote a little bit out of Scot's email where he refers to abattoirs in Indonesia. He says:


One of these facilities is operated and owned by a large Australian pastoral house … The operation is run by a North Queensland man who, through his absolute dedication to excellence, has built a feedlot and slaughtering system that his company, the industry and himself can be very proud of. The system is closed, or the cattle are already killed through their own abattoir. They import 20,000 to 25,000 cattle a year. They have been doing this for the last five years. Why should they be shut down? For what reason could anyone justify closing this operation down, especially without even bothering to look at what goes on. 


There are many other abattoirs in Indonesia like it. Why can't trade to those abattoirs be opened? These fakers claim that they are out to protect animals, and what do they do? They vote to remove Australia from the situation, which does nothing for the cattle from other nations or from Indonesia that are going to end up at the abattoirs that are not doing the right thing. 


It has occurred to me that there is something missing from this blame game. They are quick to blame Australian farmers and the industry, but they have not said anything about the religion that actually inspires the torture of the cattle there. I find that very hypocritical. We have not heard the member for Wills, the member for Fremantle or the member for Page raise that issue. But they are very quick to sink the boot into the farmers regardless of the consequences. 


If we want to have a look further at government inconsistency that is hurting our economy, then there is no greater example than the carbon tax fiasco. The whole country is waiting for some decision and consistency on this issue. The best consistency that we could get would be for the Prime Minister to stick to her election promise: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government that I lead.' The best consistency we could get would be for the Treasurer to stick to his election statements. Firstly, on Meet the Press on 15 August 2010, he said, 'What we rejected is this hysterical allegation that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax.' And, secondly, on The7.30 Report on 12 August 2010, he was asked to rule out a carbon tax and said: 'We made our position very clear. We have ruled it out.' We could get some consistency from the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency and his department, which lists the first of six priorities in its corporate plan this year as being 'delivery of the Government's election commitments'. As I said, the election commitment of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer was that there would be no carbon tax. Perhaps they could give some consistency on this or change the corporate plan to say 'delivery of the Greens election commitments'. 


The reality is that there are a couple of ways out of this inconsistency. The government could drop the tax, but I understand and we understand that that would be a very embarrassing thing to do and it would hurt the Greens feelings. So here is another clue for you. How about having a plebiscite? How about letting the people decide? But you will not do that because you are all about hypocrisy and not about democracy.


The Queensland Resources Council has done studies that suggest that in my region there are about half a dozen mines in the Bowen Basin, serviced by Mackay, that would be under threat.  They say that worse still is the impact it would have on investment in mining and local industry. We have another view on this matter from the Minister for Resources and Energy, who said that 'no-one can rule out a mine or two closing' under the carbon tax. I wonder if he was saying, 'It is just a mine or two,' when those mines employ thousands of people whose families will suffer because this tax will rip away their jobs. The Mayor of Mackay, Mr Col Meng, described this tax as just another grab for money. He said:


I am very disappointed to say the least that we now have another tax. I'd see regional Australia as certainly going to be the people that bear the brunt of this tax … because transportation and fuel costs will go up … It's just another grab, another tax … and I can't say we are going to get value for money. 


I could point to Mick Crowe from the local mining service company, who spoke against the carbon tax. I could point to the chairman of Mackay Canegrowers, Mr Paul Schembri, who thinks that the carbon tax is going to be a 'lead weight in the saddlebags of the sugar industry'. I could point to dozens of people in industries in my electorate. I could probably sit here for another 10 minutes and tell you of some of the other companies around the nation. But I have to say that the only thing consistent about this government is their ability to stuff things up. As a result the economy suffers, the people suffer and the whole nation suffers.

Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen) (16:41):  I am very pleased to be able to speak on this matter of public importance. This MPI was proposed by the member for North Sydney, who has absolutely no clue when it comes to economics. I am pleased that today the shadow Treasurer has finally started to talk about economics, because we never hear him talk much about it. We know why. It is because numbers are not his strong point. Whether it is here, on the opposition front bench or in the party room, numbers are not his strong point. This is why he keeps on with this babble and rubbish. It proves once again that in the opposition you do not have to have a sharp mind. Just because you have a sharp tongue, it does not mean that you have a keen mind. 


Today we have the wit from the member for Dawson. I would fair dinkum have to say that the member for Dawson ought to go and have a look at what he said. I tell you what: you have come close to being the most disgraceful thing I have ever seen in parliament.



An opposition member:  Have you had a look at yourself?




Mr MITCHELL:
  Yes, I have, and I am quite proud to be up here not using xenophobic tactics or misogynistic tactics to blame everything.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The member for McEwen will not respond to interjections from across the chamber.




Mr MITCHELL:
  Certainly, Mr Deputy Speaker, I should know not to go into a battle of wits with an unarmed man. I apologise. 


Following the budget, the shadow Treasurer described the global financial crisis as nothing more than a hiccup. What an absolute insult to Australians who have lost their jobs or had their hours cut during what was known as one of the biggest economic downturns across the world. You have to ask the question: what would the member for North Sydney do? How would he have cured our economy during this so-called hiccup? Would he have instructed us to stand on our heads, hold our breath or maybe take a glass of water? In countries like Spain and Ireland unemployment is around 20 per cent due to the global financial crisis. But, according to those on the other side, that was just a hiccup. Twenty per cent of people unemployed! 


I know that the people of Australia and particularly the people of my electorate do not view the global financial crisis as a hiccup. It just illustrates the complete disregard that the Liberal Party has for the importance of job security to families across our country. We know too well that during the GFC the Liberal Party opposed stimulus funding, which helped to create and support new jobs, as well as investing in things like education. I am sure that the tuckshop raiders would be out there at the new school hall saying, 'How good is this? We are here getting our photo taken. It is something the Labor government has delivered.' Not one of you has ever got up and said, 'I tell you what, let's not put one of these in my schools.' How many times have you been out to schools and said: 'We shouldn't have this. Your kids don't deserve the best education opportunities. Your kids don't deserve 21st century facilities. We just think that what we are going through is a hiccup.' 



An opposition member:  You should be ashamed of yourself.




Mr MITCHELL:
  I am very ashamed to be up here talking about how many of the 210 schools in McEwen received brand-new buildings, brand-new classrooms, science and language learning centres! What did you get them? A flagpole—whoop-de-do. That is really going to give you the best education, sitting under a white piece of wood. We are actually out there delivering better teachers, better services and better facilities, to give every kid every opportunity. They will grow up, get an education and say, 'Gee whiz, how did we ever let those people over there into the 43rd Parliament? What were we thinking at that stage?'


Unlike the Liberal Party, we took the GFC seriously. We took action, rather than sitting there and just hoping it would go away, it would fade into the distance.




Mr Craig Thomson:
  A bit like the National Party.




Mr MITCHELL:
  A bit like the National Party—but not all the National Party. Some are very good members for their electorates.



Mr McCormack interjecting—




Mr MITCHELL:
  Of course. Mr Scott, the Deputy Speaker, is a wonderful member and I hope he is here for a long, long time to come and enjoys a good long parliamentary career.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  The member for McEwen will—




Mr MITCHELL:
  Stop crawling?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for McEwen has the call and he should use his time to address the MPI before the House.




Mr MITCHELL:
  Certainly, Mr Deputy Speaker. Those opposite are a bunch of nay-sayers and it is becoming increasingly evident that the only preselection process for a Liberal Party candidate is to say no. Then you are guaranteed preselection, because that is all you need to do. You do not need to think of a policy, you do not need to think of a plan and you do not need to have an idea. You just say no and then hit your reaction plans.


If we had listened to that lot over there during the global financial crisis, over 200,000 Australians would now be out of work. But we did not. Instead, because we have policies, because we have plans and because we have ideas, we have created 700,000 jobs right across the country. If we had listened to the nay-sayers over there when it comes to job creation, we would have a massively high unemployment rate—double digits. But we did not. Because we have plans, because we have ideas and because we have that P word that they are so afraid of—policies—we have a steady 4.9 per cent unemployment rate. It is the lowest amongst developed nations in the world. That is something we should be very proud of. This government delivered jobs, which delivers incomes to families and allows the economy to keep going. Australia was saved from the GFC.


If we had listened to you when it came to stimulus funding in schools, 210 schools in McEwen would not have received new buildings or upgrades. They would not have received one cent. But we did not listen to you. We put the plans in place which kept jobs going, kept local economies stimulated and kept people in work. Now we have principals and teachers right across the electorate of McEwen saying that this program, Building the Education Revolution, has brought forward education and their school facilities by 20 to 30 years. That was done after 11 long, dark years of neglect in education by the former Howard govern­ment.


If we listen to the nay-sayers when it comes to putting a price on carbon, our economy, as the Productivity Commission has revealed, would drastically suffer. We quite often hear those opposite saying, 'But the Prime Minister said there would be no carbon tax before the election.' They should come in with the Australian dated 20 August. There was a great article written by Paul Kelly and Dennis Shanahan titled 'Julia Gillard's carbon price promise'. I read this and I thought, 'What's going on here?' There is the Prime Minister saying before the election that she is 'prepared to legislate a carbon price in the new term'. In the new term—that is this term. She said:


I don't rule out the possibility of legislating a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, a market-based mechanism …


There you go. That is exactly what we are doing, and that was before the election. It was 20 August—before the election—in the Australian, the great newspaper that you all read and dream of. There it is in black and white. We are delivering exactly what we said before the election. But, of course, when you are sitting there saying, 'No, no, no,' you have no idea. You just cannot hear what goes on around this place.


The Liberal Party's message during the GFC was: 'If you are out of work, tough. Bad luck. You lost your job? Tough luck. You've had your hours at work cut? Tough luck. We will sit here and do nothing.' But they would have been happy, had they still been in government, to cut your working conditions, cut your wages and bring everyone down. That was the only policy they had during their last term in government. It is outrageous that those opposite did not take the struggles of working families seriously. We on this side of the House have a plan. We have a strong Treasurer with a plan to get the budget back into surplus, to create more jobs and a clean energy economy. Those opposite think that their little childlike three-word slogans will get us back into surplus.


But what is the member for North Sydney's excuse for his incompetence? Maybe it has to do with the fact that he cannot concentrate because someone used a blower vac or a lawnmower outside his window and it put him off. It left him in a space where he could not work. That is how frail and brittle he is. It shows that he is just not up to the job. But of course the member for Goldstein knows that. He is circling like a little shark. He is circling there, waiting to take the shadow Treasurer's job, and we know how confident he is. This is the man who went to the 2007 election saying, 'All these Labor Party candidates still work for the government, in breach of section 44 of the Constitution.' That lasted about 10 minutes, because once the press looked at it they found that his detailed research, his hours of energy and effort, were put into looking at websites that were out of date. He googled once and that was it. That is the extent of the ability of the financial mess that those members over there call their financial portfolio spokesman.


This motion is an absolute joke. Someone who has failed every single step of the way when it comes to doing numbers, doing the budget and doing finance policies and who has delivered absolutely nothing comes in and has a crack at our guys. Our Treasurer, as I said, has delivered a strong budget. We are delivering on all our election promises. It is all there in black and white.



Mr McCormack interjecting—




Mr MITCHELL:
  Once again, that is evidence you do not listen. I think I just went through that and I know the tuckshop raiders up the back have no idea. (Time expired)

Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (16:53):  Yesterday, I had an opportunity to make some initial remarks in this debate on the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011. I was addressing some of the very practical measures which the bill puts in place to help consumers. The bill endeavours to help people who rely so very heavily on credit cards and who shoulder the burden of personal debt. I mentioned that the measures included in the bill will help those people make much better choices about the kinds of debt arrangements that they enter into—for instance, better choices about mortgage products and credit cards.


This debate sketches out fairly neatly for the public some of the differences between our government and the opposition. I have listened fairly intently to the remarks of the opposition in this debate. They say that they will support the reforms in this bill but that they are effectively being dragged to it. I think that the Hansard of the debate from yesterday will bear that out. They say that they are reluctantly accepting of our legislation to give consumers choice. They particularly mentioned overregulation and intrusion into business. As I said at the time, they made similar noises and mutterings in debates earlier this year, in particular in debates in which they were more concerned with the interests of executives and with standing up for executives and their salaries than with standing up for shareholders and consumers. We saw that very recently in the debate on the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011, which this government pursued and has ultimately had passed in the Senate.


The opposition say that they are terribly concerned about overregulation. They have to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to support very sensible legislation which gives consumers choice. Then they say that they have faith in the market. I say: 'Hearty congratulations to all of them,' because it really is the first time in this term that they have applied that logic to any debate. Indeed, I invite them to apply their faith in markets to some other debates that are affecting our nation at the moment. The carbon price, for instance, might benefit from the application of that logic. Unfortunately, the opposition chop and change and make up the rules as they go. They are happy to talk about markets and their concerns about regulation in the context of this debate on this bill that is looking out for consumers—mums and dads and individuals such as those in my electorate. They are not terribly concerned about applying the same logic of their faith in markets when it comes to things like a carbon price. We have been consistent. We have said that we would act for consumers on banking, credit cards and home loans—all of those products on which so many Australians have come to rely for their everyday existence. I mentioned yesterday that the Reserve Bank's figure on the level of credit card debt in February of this year was a staggering $49.3 billion, of which some $36 billion at that time was accruing interest.


These are issues which touch all Australians in a significant way, and it is for this reason that the Treasurer recognised the need to act. He has taken that opportunity to act by introducing this bill. Our reforms will enable consumers to make a more informed choice about home loan products and credit cards. I spelt out yesterday some of the ways that the bill does that. I imagine that other speakers in this debate will elaborate on that. Our reforms will reduce the risk of consumers being offered credit card limits, the balance on which they are almost certain to be unable to repay in a reasonable period of time.


These are the very real and very practical differences between what we as a government are putting forward against the nothing that the opposition have in mind—because they offer nothing on these issues. They offered nothing in the budget reply. They have offered nothing in relation to the NBN. They offer nothing in relation to carbon pricing. They offered nothing on the floods in Queensland and the means to fund the recovery. They offer nothing to consumers looking for a better deal in banking.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (16:57):  I rise to speak on the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011. In doing so, I observe that there is nothing that gladdens the heart of the Rudd-Gillard government more than a piece of detailed, prescriptive, intrusive microregulation, as it seeks to get its fingers deep into the entrails of the day-to-day conduct of business. There is nothing that gladdens the heart of the Rudd-Gillard government more than a cartoonish, headline political attack on the business sector—in this case, the banking sector. There appears to be, I regret to note, nothing that gladdens the heart of the Rudd-Gillard government more than rushing out legislation in a furious burst of enthusiasm, well before the critical detail of how the arrangements will work has in fact been sorted out. Is that not all too familiar a pattern from this government? In the bill that is before the House this evening, I regret to note that we are once again seeing this pattern at play.


Let us be clear: the question is not whether some Australians are offered credit card increases which they are ill equipped to deal with—of course that happens all too often—and the question is not whether there are issues in relation to people dealing with credit who may not be well equipped to do so. The question before this House is whether this particular bill is an effective way of dealing with the problem, because this government assumes consistently that all you need is good intentions. If you genuinely think there is a problem, then bring forward any measure, any package, and that ought to be judged as a success. The real question for the House is whether, as a matter of fact, this is an effective and sensible package of measures. I regret to say that there are serious reasons to doubt that it is an effective and sensible package of measures.


I note that the genesis for this legislation was a deeply political exercise, a package of so-called reforms announced on 15 August 2010, a date you will have no hesitation in recalling, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, which fell during the middle of the last election campaign. 


Substantively, there are some six measures contained in this package, which this bill now seeks to pass into law and some, as we have been pleased to acknowledge, have some merit. Others, I regret to say, have very little merit and could fairly be described as merely being meretricious window dressing designed to pad out a press release. 


I seek to make three points in the time available to me this evening. Firstly, to too great an extent, this bill gives effect to a package of measures driven largely by politics, not by policy, and by a political desire to have a package on credit cards. Secondly, much of this bill involves detailed, onerous and poorly thought through regulation, the costs of which look very like to considerably exceed the benefits. The third point I wish to make is that the implementation of this package regrettably has been done in this government's usual shoddy, hasty and imprecise way and, indeed, much of the critical detail is still not yet available, because it is contained in regulations.


Let me turn to the first point—a package driven largely by politics, not by policy. Let me quote some of the more fragrant observations from the press release headed 'A competitive and sustainable banking system', issued by the Treasurer on 12 December 2010. According to the Treasurer this package of measures, of which the measures in this bill form part, will 'give every Australian a fairer go'—I note he seems to be troubled by self-doubt because he is not committing to a fair go, merely a fairer go. He goes on to say in another typical flourish of rhetoric that they 'won't let the big banks off the hook'. If there was ever a clear indicator of the deliberate political intent of this legislation, I think that quote gives the game away.


Again, with a little bit of self-doubt from the Treasurer, he goes on to note, 'There's no silver bullet here,' which might as well amount to an admission that quite a number of the measures in this bill are frankly more trouble than they are worth, that the costs they will introduce exceed the benefits. He nevertheless commits to 'keep working hard to give all Australians a fighting chance'. Again, I wonder how giving Australians a fighting chance measures up to the standard he set himself at the start of the press release to give every Australian a fairer go.


The thing that really stands out is a classic non-sequitur. We have come to appreciate the non-sequitur as the favourite rhetorical device of the Treasurer of Australia and there is a fine example of a non-sequitur in this press release. Immediately after the statements I have quoted, he goes on to say 'Vigorous competition is the best way to keep interest rates for borrowers lower over time and create a system that offers real choice.' I am very pleased to say that I agree with that proposition. On this side of the House, we very much agree with the proposition that vigorous competition in the banking sector, as in every sector, is very much to be encouraged.


But we do ask ourselves the question: how much credibility does this Treasurer have about calling for vigorous competition in the banking sector when, on his watch, there were not one but two very significant bank mergers waved through. St George and Westpac were allowed to merge and the Commonwealth Bank and Bank West were allowed to merge, in both cases approved by the Treasurer of Australia, the same man on whose watch this particular piece of legislation is being brought forward.


The Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Guy Debelle, noted in a speech last year that, as a result of those two mergers, the major banks' combined market share rose from 60 per cent to over 80 per cent between 2007 and 2009. The reality is that this Treasurer, this Rudd-Gillard Labor government, has presided over one of the most dramatic contractions of competition in the banking sector that we have seen for a very long time, and you do not make up for a significant attack on competition, as this government has been party to, by putting some worthy sentences in a press release. 


I would suggest to you that what this government is trying to do with this particular package, these detailed controls on credit cards, is to seek to make up for the fact that in reality competition in the banking sector is considerably weaker than it used to be. If we look at some of these measures, they include prescribing rules for approval of the use of credit cards above a credit limit, restricting credit providers from making unsolicited invitations to borrowers to increase the credit limit of their credit card and introducing a requirement for lenders to put out a key facts sheet for credit card contracts.


I want to make the point that much of this package of measures involves detailed, onerous and poorly thought through regulation, the costs of which can be expected to exceed the benefits. Take, for example, the very broad prohibition against written communications to customers regarding a credit limit increase under the proposed section 133BE. This will not only apply to express offers and invitations to use the legal language; it also has, in practical terms, the effect of capturing any communication to a customer which has the purpose of encouraging the customer to consider applying for an increase. It is very broadly drafted indeed and is likely to prevent not only communications which are objectionable but also communications which are highly desirable. A further question which is raised about the measures contained in this legislation is: why are they necessary, in light of the fact that there is already a very tight regulatory regime dealing with credit limit approvals under chapter 3 of the National Consumer Credit Protection Act?


A further question which might be asked is: isn't there a risk that, by imposing detailed restrictions on the capacity of banks to offer increased credit limits to their customers, the banks will in fact be encouraged to start by offering higher credit limits than they might otherwise have proposed? Isn't there a real possibility that this legislation will end up having the very opposite effect to the one which is proposed?


Another serious concern with this package of measures is that some of the critical detail is not obvious on the face of the legislation, because the legislation simply provides that there will be regulations made regarding these matters—for example, the key provision to be added to the National Credit Code, section 30B, which gives the minister the power to make regulations regarding interest charges.


A further question which might very reasonably be asked is: why is it the case that this legislation is rife with strict liability provisions—that is, provisions under which guilt is simply assumed and the mental state of the person charged with the offence is considered to be irrelevant? One reason why it might be rife is that such provisions appear to be rife in every piece of legislation this government brings forward, because they sit very well with this government's preference for detailed, prescriptive and intrusive legislation. But it is a very good policy question. I note that some of those provisions have been removed from the set of amendments which have been put forward by the government at the eleventh hour, but we still face a very serious and obvious question: why is it that there are simply so many measures contained in this bill which seek to impose strict liability?


The third point I wish to make is to note, with considerable regret, that the implementation of this package has been done in a shoddy, hasty and imprecise way. The exposure draft was released on 3 March, and only two working days were allowed for written submissions to be received by Treasury, even though this bill deals with extremely complex business processes involving the provision of services to millions of Australians and the practical day-to-day management consequences of this sweeping set of changes are very, very substantial.


I note further that, when the bill was first introduced, there was a set of provisions which mandated that every customer of a bank would be automatically provided with a 10 per cent buffer facility. That is to say, in practical terms, their credit limit would turn out to be 10 per cent higher than they and their bank had understood it to be. It was pointed out to the government that that was not a particularly good idea in a piece of legislation which is supposed to prevent automatic or unsolicited increase in credit card limit limits, because it has the substantive effect that you effectively give every customer a one-time 10 per cent increase in their credit limit. It is hard to think of a clearer example of the very shoddy way in which this set of rapidly rammed together measures, dreamt up for political purposes, has been put into legislation.


I note that, as a consequence of this rather obvious point being made to the government, the government has at a very late stage chosen to completely remove the provisions that were in the original bill dealing with this buffer mechanism and has introduced a whole new set of provisions in this area by means of amendment. I suppose we ought to at least acknowledge the fact that the government has conceded the self-evident logical problem in the original set of measures dealing with the so-called buffer facility.


In substance, what we have here is a piece of legislation which contains one or two sensible measures and a range of other measures which are difficult to justify, a set of measures which have been thrown together quickly to meet a political imperative to have a package on credit cards and a package on banking which could be taken to the 2010 election. We have a set of measures, which have been drafted in haste, which deal with very complex business processes affecting millions of people—very expensive to organise and administer—and yet these have been put to the banking industry with quite inadequate time for consultation. We subsequently find ourselves considering a piece of legislation which contains some significant drafting errors, some significant problems of logic and, in some cases, the original premise of which has been almost completely changed by late-in-the-day amendments. The key principle is this: a government needs more than good intentions; it needs detailed, well-worked-through policy.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (17:13):  The Australian dream of owning your own home is usually only possible through a home loan, yet taking out a home loan can be the biggest financial commitment that most Australians make. Credit cards promise that bit of help to manage the family budget. Whether it is helping to get access to cash in an emergency or helping to pay for those little extras like a holiday, accessing quick and easy credit is an attractive option for most. But, in the excitement of thinking about a first home or a new home, or the possibilities of what can be bought with a credit card or an extended credit limit, the obligations that banks and other credit providers place on consumers can be forgotten.


When you are thinking about moving into your first house, the last thing you want to do is read through the fine print in a dense home loan contract. When you are planning your overseas holiday, you do not read the clause about the additional charges associated with a cash advance. The changes proposed in this amendment are part of a broad suite of reforms that seek to increase fairness for consumers seeking credit, help to better educate consumers about what it is they are signing up for and create a set of uniform laws across Australia. 


It can be extremely difficult to work in an area where every day you see people suffering from extreme financial hardship. I would like to use this opportunity to commend the consumer rights advocates in my electorate for their hard work. Some of the groups doing marvellous work include Moneycare, provided through the Salvation Army, Street Law, the ACT Welfare Rights Centre and Care Inc., which includes the financial counselling service and the Consumer Law Centre for the ACT.


My friend Liz Dawson has shown me around Moneycare at their Dickson offices and I have seen how hard they work to provide assistance to people in the community who are under pressure from their debts. Moneycare reminded me that many people suffering from financial difficulty as a result of credit card and home loan stress often end up with depression or anxiety as a result.


Care Inc. is the main consumer law advocacy body in the Australian Capital Territory and also provides advice and assistance to consumers. They wrote a submission on the financial services and credit reform green paper that preceded the range of legislative reforms. They rightly point out that, even though low-income earners carry less debt than high-income earners, the potential for that debt to have a negative impact on their lives, families and general wellbeing was far greater. Here in the ACT we boast some of the highest living standards in the country. But even in a relatively well-off electorate like Fraser there is still disadvantage, and we need to remember that, even though those generalisations about Fraser might be true for many, they are certainly not true for all.


Care Inc. told me that a local elderly woman on a pension was given a mortgage for the exclusive use of her son to purchase a business. The son was unable to repay the mortgage and the elderly pensioner was at risk of losing her home because of the loan, which she clearly could not service and from which she received absolutely no benefit. Care Inc. also told me that they had a client who was a homeless man living off a credit card. The man was unemployed and had a range of financial and other legal difficulties, yet he was still given a credit card.


In addition to low-income earners suffering from mortgage and credit card stress, financial counsellors agree that in the last five years there has been a significant increase in the number of middle-income earners suffering mortgage stress. One way that we can help people, regardless of their level of income, to avoid financial stress due to debt is to assist them to understand what it is that they are signing up for. The Gillard government have introduced a range of measures through the National Financial Literacy Strategy—measures that Tony Abbott included in his 'hit list' to pay for the flood reconstruction. The government are doing this in recognition of the fact that this is an important way of helping Australians to understand and pay their debts.


Requiring banks to provide their information in a simpler and more concise format is one part of how the government are helping consumers. We need to remember that the most vulnerable members of our community are the ones least able to access legal advice to assist them to understand their rights and obligations. The most significant changes—the changes that will provide genuine assistance to vulnerable consumers—are requirements to provide consumers with information that is easy to understand.


The key facts sheets to accompany a home loan will enable consumers to better compare home loans and better compare the loans offered by the big banks with loans offered by credit unions and other smaller providers. Potential credit card borrowers will also be provided with a key facts sheet showing interest rates on purchases, cash advances and promotional offers. These facts sheets will help those who do not have the ability to wade through pages and pages of complex legal and technical terms to understand what they are signing up to.


In the House Economics Committee's inquiry into this bill—ably chaired by the member for Dobell—we heard a range of witnesses support this measure. In fact, research by University of Queensland law lecturer Paul O'Shea, referred to in the explanatory memorandum, has taken an innovative approach to assess the impact of simplified disclosure statements. He has shown that, when a sample of respondents were presented with current disclosure statements, only 37 per cent correctly answered a question about the maximum interest rate. With a redesigned disclosure statement, 80 per cent answered the question correctly. On a question about the time to pay off the credit, only 13 per cent gave the right answer when presented with the current disclosure statement, as compared with 100 per cent when given a redesigned disclosure statement. The research provides empirical support for what many of us would have intuitively thought—better disclosure improves customer knowledge.


It is important for us to encourage banks and other lenders to produce their material in a format that is comprehensive yet easy to understand. This is just as important a part of developing financial literacy as teaching consumers how to read complex credit contracts. We are going to ensure that loans are easy to compare by ensuring that all financial providers—banks, credit unions and building societies—have to put their key facts sheets in the same format. That will mean that consumers can compare like with like.


Care Inc., the local service I mentioned earlier, rightly points out that financial service providers can afford lawyers to draft their standard term contracts, whereas the most vulnerable in our society do not have the capacity to obtain legal advice on their rights and obligations prior to entering into credit contracts. Care Inc. also notes that in their experience their clients do not read the contracts in full and several do not even keep a copy of their contract to refer to if required to challenge any of its terms.


The changes to ban unsolicited offers to borrowers to increase their credit limit are also important to help consumers understand their financial obligations. Credit limit increases are targeted to consumers with outstanding credit card balances who are struggling to maintain their repayments. They target people with an immediate need for credit, and agreeing to the offer is often made very easy. The decision to increase credit is not done in a competitive market with an ability to compare interest rates and card features to take the most financially appropriate option. The people targeted by such offers are often not in a financial position to benefit from a competitive market.


Letters offering increases are presented as marketing or promotional material rather than as an application for additional credit. This is misleading. Many consumers assume that the financial institution has done an assessment of their capacity to repay before sending out the offer and they have an unrealistic expectation of their own capacity to repay. The bank nominates the amount of increase and it does not necessarily reflect the financial capacity of the consumer. This is almost a predatory practice that preys on the most vulnerable members of our community. This bill will stop lenders from placing consumers in further financial hardship. I used to think that it was critical to educate people to understand complex financial documents. I thought we should be encouraging citizens to see the importance of carefully reading each and every document, regardless of how dense and confused these might be. But now I take a different approach. My philosophy now is that, rather than forcing consumers to do the hard work, we should be looking at reducing complexity. Why do we need to have confusing documents rather than easy-to-read tables? Sure, there is still a need to understand contractual terms, but a one-page document will enable consumers to understand the most important points, and they will know where to look if they need more advice, detail or information.


There are so many interesting things to do and to read in life: brilliant literature, trashy fiction as a guilty pleasure, movies to watch, sports to participate in and families to spend time with. Why should people be forced to spend their valuable leisure time wading through complex documents? I would rather we encouraged people to read for pleasure, rather than spending excessive time on financial contracts. Put another way: we should look at financial literacy as an obligation for lenders as well as for consumers. Through this bill and previous changes to the National Consumer Credit Protection Act, Labor has demonstrated a commitment to eradicating predatory lending practices and promoting better information for consumers. As the Treasurer said in his second reading speech, this bill 'is part of our commitment to always stand on the side of consumers'. I commend the bill to the House.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (17:23):  With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I would like to recognise in the gallery today a delegation from the Catholic Church. I would like to recognise, in particular, Bishop Peter Connors, who looks after the pastoral care in my electorate of Wannon and does so very well. I would also like to recognise some other friends, particularly of the Tehan and O'Brien families, who have known my family for many years; on your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I welcome them to the gallery this evening.


I rise to speak on the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011. There are five points I would like to make on this bill. One is that the coalition will not be opposing it. Amendments have been made; many which are embarrassing for the government have had to be made at the 11th hour and highlight the deficiencies, sadly, in their approach to decision making.


In many ways, this bill was heading down the path of many others that have come into this chamber in that the unintended consequences had not been thought through. Industry and institutions warned on a number of occasions throughout the legislative process that some of the elements contained in this legislation would have unintended consequences—a fact that the government has chosen at the last minute to recognise but still has not recognised in a comprehensive way. The coalition believes that the government's approach of imposing additional regulation and interfering in the commercial decisions of banks is not the preferred approach to addressing market deficiencies. What we are calling for, and I will take this opportunity to call for now, is a full root-and-branch review of Australia's financial system. This was set out in the coalition's nine-point banking plan, put forward by the shadow Treasurer over eight months ago and which, in many ways, has led to the bill before us today.


I would like to go into some detail about the coalition's nine-point plan because it has set the platform for the bill before us today. In many ways the Treasurer has been dragged, kicking and screaming, to present this legislation as a result of what the coalition put forward. When we hear that the coalition is not setting a positive agenda, I think this issue makes nonsense of that claim. In many ways our nine-point banking plan has led us to see these reforms being introduced today, some of which have merit and some of which do not.


In our nine-point plan, we set out that we wanted the ACCC to have the power to investigate anticompetitive price signalling. We were prepared to, and did, put forward a private member's bill on that. We encouraged APRA to investigate whether the major banks are taking on unnecessary risks in the name of trying to maximise short-term returns that conflict with the preferences of those who backstop the system—namely, the taxpayers. We wanted to mandate the RBA to publish regular, rather than irregular, reporting on bank net interest margins, on returns on equity and on profitability so that we can all determine whether the major banks are extracting monopolistic profits. We wanted to investigate whether we could allow Australia Post to make its 3,800 branches available as distribution channels for small lenders. We wanted to ask the Treasury and the RBA to investigate ways to further improve the liquidity of the residential and commercial mortgage backed securities markets, which are an alternative source of funding for small lenders, including consideration of the coalition's proposal to extend the government's credit rating to AAA rated commercial paper in those markets to improve liquidity to further help the small end of town.


We wanted to explore further simplification of the Financial Services Reform Act to make getting out and doing business easier and simpler, so rather than introducing more red tape, as this bill does in parts, the idea was to reduce it. We wanted to direct APRA to explore whether the risk weightings on business loans secured by residential properties are punitive. The idea would be to ensure that small businesses received sufficient financial benefit from pledging their family homes to secure their borrowings. We wanted to resolve the debate about whether the banks should be able to issue covered bonds, in the same way that other jurisdictions allow their banks to issue them, which would provide a more affordable line of credit. Most importantly, we wanted to have a full review of the financial system.


It is now 13 years since the last major review of banking. The Wallis review brought forward substantial reforms in the banking sector. It is high time that we had another review into the banking sector because reform is necessary, but it needs to be done in a way that we think through sensibly how the banking system needs further reform driven through it and what the policy approach should be, and it needs to be done in a way that makes sure we take into consideration the unintended consequences. As I said, the coalition put forward its nine-point plan. We could talk, as I have highlighted here, about the various merits of points one to eight and whether some were necessary and some were not. But I think the last point, the one about a root-and-branch review of our banking regulations, should be supported by everyone in this House. Two months after the coalition put forward its plan, we had the Treasurer dragged, kicking and screaming, to announce his own policy approach in this area. That is what led to this bill before us. 


There are a couple of specific items in this bill we need to discuss. The first is the banning of exit fees on new floating rate mortgages. The coalition has said that the government has not thought through this part of the bill. We are not arguing that there is not an issue with exit fees. What we are saying is that there should be a choice. This is particularly important for small lenders—and we get a lot of these out in regional and rural areas. The only way they can protect themselves from the major banks is to have exit fees; otherwise, the major banks, if they are being successful, have the opportunity to move in and offer better rates for a short period of time and take borrowers from these smaller lenders.


So what we are arguing about here is choice, and choice for smaller lenders in particular—the type of lenders who are found in my electorate of Wannon and out in regional and rural Australia. These smaller lenders are trying to compete with the major banks. Sometimes, in order for them to be able to offer lower interest rates, they need to be able to put exit fees on. It gives them the protection they need as smaller lenders. So that is what we are arguing here; we are arguing about choice, about allowing smaller lenders to remain competitive in the market, about enabling them to compete with the major banks. One of the things that they need to be able to do, in some instances, in order to provide that competition is to put exit fees on. We are not saying that there is not an issue with exit fees; we are saying that, in some instances, smaller lenders in particular should be given the choice of using them. That is the point we are making on this issue.


The second point I raise today is about the introduction of fact sheets. The requirement for these fact sheets will now come into effect two years after problems with competition in the banking sector were first raised. Once again we are seeing the government come up with a solution two years after the problem was first identified. And now they are having to backtrack and put an amendment into this bill at the last minute to give the banking sector and other financial institutions enough time to introduce these fact sheets. The fact sheets are designed to provide simple information to borrowers so that they know exactly what they are getting themselves involved in. These fact sheets could be important in making sure that borrowers have a simple way to choose between lenders. But you also have to take into consideration that, in introducing a bill like this, you are putting requirements on our financial institutions. Those financial institutions have to be given sufficient time to enable them to produce these fact sheets in a timely manner and in a manner which will not lead to them being rushed and will not lead to the fact sheets failing to do the job they are intended to do.


Sadly, the government has had to move back the date on which the requirement for these fact sheets will come into effect. It will now be 1 January 2012. One has to ask why it has taken so long for the government to get these bills before us and why it has taken it so long to undertake the necessary discussions with the financial institutions to get agreement on what these facts sheets should look like and what should be in them. One also has to ask why the fact sheet requirements are to be introduced by regulation rather than in the legislation. Once again we are seeing the government bring forward a bill where most of the detail—it is especially so in this case—is in the regulations and not where it should be. It should be in the bill proper so that we get a chance to fully examine it and, if necessary, pass amendments to make sure that there are no unintended consequences. 


When the government came into office, it committed itself to taking a regulation out for every regulation introduced. One of the things that disappoints me, in standing in the House today and delivering this speech, is that we are not seeing regulation being removed as regulation is being put in. From what I can gather, the Gillard government is now operating under a system whereby there are 220 pieces of regulation brought into the House for every one being taken out. I know that some Rudd policies have been dumped—some of the policies he implemented have not worked and we have had to move away from them. But that commitment, made before Prime Minister Rudd was elected in 2011—that might be a Freudian slip there; I mean 2007—that for every piece of regulation that came into this House one would be removed, was very noble in its cause and is one which the coalition has supported. It is one which we would have liked to have seen the government support in the introduction of this bill. This bill is regulatory and we need to keep in mind that the more we regulate, the more business costs we put on all our financial institutions. And any costs we impose on our financial institutions, they have to get back from somewhere. Ultimately, that usually comes from the borrower and can mean increased interest rates.


I will make one final point on this bill, and that goes to the Treasurer. The Treasurer has said that this legislation will not be a silver bullet; but, at the same time, when he introduced these reforms, he said that they would drive interest rates lower. We only have to go to the front page of the Australian on the day that these reforms were introduced to see that they were aimed at driving interest rates lower. It will be very interesting to see, now that the legislation has come into the House, whether in fact that is what they will do. Sadly, given the government's wasteful spending, we are hearing from the financial market that interest rates are likely to rise rather than decrease in the next six months. But let us hope that the Treasurer will work wonders and this bill will do what he is on the record as saying it will do—and that is drive interest rates lower. We on this side of the House will be holding him to that commitment, especially over the next six months. Cost-of-living pressures are going up and the last thing that Australian communities need and the people in the community of Wannon need at this stage is further interest rate rises, especially when they are the direct result of the wasteful spending that this government has engaged in and the fact that the government has not been able to show budgetary discipline and bring the budget back into surplus sooner than forecast for 2012-13.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (17:38):  Never has there been so much negative carping in the process of saying yes. The National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011 is good legislation. This legislation is definitely in the interests of the working people that I represent in the electorate of Throsby, and I would like to take a few moments to explain why. I will start by going to the evidence that was presented to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics—a committee which I sit on. This evidence, given by Ms Karen Cox, the coordinator of the Consumer Credit Legal Centre, outlines why some of the measures in this bill are necessary. 


In evidence before the committee, Ms Cox said:


… there is no doubt that credit cards are an enormous cause of pressure on families, and we have seen countless examples over the years of people on very low incomes who have accepted a series of credit limit increases.


She went on to explain that there was indeed a problem, particularly with people on modest incomes who have had considerable credit card debts, and that it was those debts that were leading to financial stress.


This evidence certainly aligns with some of the stories that I have heard in my electorate—even as late as last weekend, when I had the great pleasure of visiting the offices of the St Vincent de Paul Society in Oak Flats in my electorate. I spoke there with one of the managers, Ms Linda O'Rourke. In the process of speaking to her about the $500,000-plus that the Commonwealth government has provided to St Vincent de Paul in Oak Flats to assist with emergency services grants, we had a discussion about the importance of financial literacy. Ms O'Rourke impressed upon me that there was indeed a great need for improved financial literacy amongst the working people in our electorate, particularly those who from time to time have to avail themselves of the services of St Vincent de Paul because they have maxed out their credit cards, they have found themselves in financial stress and they need assistance to pay the bills or to put some food on the table. 


This legislation is good legislation. It is good legislation for everyone who has ever walked out to their letterbox and found it chocker-block full of direct marketing mail from a credit card company, offering them an increase in their credit limit. It is good news for consumers, owners of credit cards, who on a week-to-week or monthly basis put additional money on their credit card thinking that in doing so they were going to reduce their interest payments, only to find that the money had not been allocated to the highest interest bearing portion of their loan and that they had been whacked with an interest payment much higher than they had expected. It is good news for the consumers out there who are concerned that they can get all the marketing information that they could ever imagine from banks and financial institutions but not the sort of concrete information which enables them to get a real handle on the cost of the loan and how it compares with that from another institution. So it is good legislation, and it should enjoy the support of all members in this place. 


Let us go to a few of the features which address the problems that I have outlined. The first is the home loan key facts sheet. The bill will introduce a requirement for lenders to give borrowers a simple one-page key facts sheet—revolutionary stuff, Mr Deputy Speaker. You have to wonder why this is not happening right now, but it is not. There is a one-page key facts sheet for home loans and for credit cards to enable people to assess the full cost of the loan, to compare it in standard form to those of other financial institutions and to shop around and get a better deal. The aim of this measure is to ensure that, when a potential home borrower is applying for a mortgage, it is easier for them to compare what each lender is offering them. It is very difficult to see why any fair-minded person would oppose such a measure. Indeed, as I have said, it is nothing more than militant good sense. We also believe that the transparency and the uniformity provided in these key facts sheets are going to encourage greater competition between financial institutions because the consumers will be able to compare like with like. 


The second component that I would like to talk about in relation to this legislation goes to credit card repayments. This bill delivers on the Gillard government's election commitment to crack down on unfair treatment of Australians with credit cards and to help them get a better deal in the banking system. The bill will give credit card holders more control over the amount that they borrow and will also ensure that they are not charged excessive fees. It will do this by regulating the circumstances in which borrowers can go over their credit limits and abolishing fees when they do so unless the consumer has consented to opt in to a system which extends their credit in this circumstance.


This bill will also mean that credit card providers will be required to allocate repayments—and this is critical—to the higher interest bearing debts first so that families will not need to pay more interest than they otherwise should. Currently consumers do not have any control at all over how their repayments are allocated, meaning that lenders will often use repayments to pay off the part of a loan that is only incurring low or indeed no interest at all. So it is good legislation and it enjoys the support of the House.


This bill will ban unsolicited credit limit extension invitations that encourage borrowers to increase their credit limit. These unsolicited offers of additional credit can result in consumers ending up with high credit limits and often high levels of debt. We know that interest charges on credit cards are quite high. They are good money spinners. I do not take anything away from the financial institutions that offer these products. They are a critical service in our economy. But we believe that where credit is offered it should offered responsibly. That should include the offering of additional credit or the raising of credit extensions.


Another measure in this bill will require application forms for credit cards to include a key facts sheet that clearly provides information about the credit card, including the interest rate on purchases, cash advances, the annual fee and any other relevant fee or charge. Again, this measure is quite simply about increasing transparency and empowering consumers. So it is difficult to see how many of those on the opposite side of the chamber could find a reason to criticise this particular initiative. You have got to wonder why this is not already happening as a matter of good commercial practice.


Let's talk about overlimit fees. It is not hard to exceed your credit limit, and indeed this can often happen inadvertently. In most cases, credit card providers allow accounts to go over the credit limit and then apply a fee for exceeding this limit. The measures in this bill will limit the amount by which the credit limit can be exceeded to 10 per cent above the credit limit at the discretion of the lender. The fee for exceeding the credit limit will be abolished. To ensure that there are no unintended consequences from this measure, consumers can decide to opt out of this default buffer if it helps them to manage their finances better, or they can ask for a larger buffer if that is best for their individual circumstances.


These measures go some way to put in place some sensible regulation on consumer credit in this country. In closing I make the observation that, unlike many of the financial systems around the world, our banks and our financial institutions are incredibly well managed and incredibly well regulated. It is the fact that successive governments in this country have put in place sensible regulation of our financial institutions that has ensured that, unlike in many other countries in our region and around the globe, we did not see the failure of our financial institutions as the world went through the global financial crisis. That does not mean that we should rest on our laurels or that we should not be continuing to review and improve the operation of our banking and financial institutions. The measures in this legislation are a modest addition to that ongoing review and improvement. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Smyth, Laura, MP",ALP,2011-06-21,"



Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (16:53):  Yesterday, I had an opportunity to make some initial remarks in this debate on the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011. I was addressing some of the very practical measures which the bill puts in place to help consumers. The bill endeavours to help people who rely so very heavily on credit cards and who shoulder the burden of personal debt. I mentioned that the measures included in the bill will help those people make much better choices about the kinds of debt arrangements that they enter into—for instance, better choices about mortgage products and credit cards.


This debate sketches out fairly neatly for the public some of the differences between our government and the opposition. I have listened fairly intently to the remarks of the opposition in this debate. They say that they will support the reforms in this bill but that they are effectively being dragged to it. I think that the Hansard of the debate from yesterday will bear that out. They say that they are reluctantly accepting of our legislation to give consumers choice. They particularly mentioned overregulation and intrusion into business. As I said at the time, they made similar noises and mutterings in debates earlier this year, in particular in debates in which they were more concerned with the interests of executives and with standing up for executives and their salaries than with standing up for shareholders and consumers. We saw that very recently in the debate on the Corporations Amendment (Improving Accountability on Director and Executive Remuneration) Bill 2011, which this government pursued and has ultimately had passed in the Senate.


The opposition say that they are terribly concerned about overregulation. They have to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to support very sensible legislation which gives consumers choice. Then they say that they have faith in the market. I say: 'Hearty congratulations to all of them,' because it really is the first time in this term that they have applied that logic to any debate. Indeed, I invite them to apply their faith in markets to some other debates that are affecting our nation at the moment. The carbon price, for instance, might benefit from the application of that logic. Unfortunately, the opposition chop and change and make up the rules as they go. They are happy to talk about markets and their concerns about regulation in the context of this debate on this bill that is looking out for consumers—mums and dads and individuals such as those in my electorate. They are not terribly concerned about applying the same logic of their faith in markets when it comes to things like a carbon price. We have been consistent. We have said that we would act for consumers on banking, credit cards and home loans—all of those products on which so many Australians have come to rely for their everyday existence. I mentioned yesterday that the Reserve Bank's figure on the level of credit card debt in February of this year was a staggering $49.3 billion, of which some $36 billion at that time was accruing interest.


These are issues which touch all Australians in a significant way, and it is for this reason that the Treasurer recognised the need to act. He has taken that opportunity to act by introducing this bill. Our reforms will enable consumers to make a more informed choice about home loan products and credit cards. I spelt out yesterday some of the ways that the bill does that. I imagine that other speakers in this debate will elaborate on that. Our reforms will reduce the risk of consumers being offered credit card limits, the balance on which they are almost certain to be unable to repay in a reasonable period of time.


These are the very real and very practical differences between what we as a government are putting forward against the nothing that the opposition have in mind—because they offer nothing on these issues. They offered nothing in the budget reply. They have offered nothing in relation to the NBN. They offer nothing in relation to carbon pricing. They offered nothing on the floods in Queensland and the means to fund the recovery. They offer nothing to consumers looking for a better deal in banking.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (16:57):  I rise to speak on the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011. In doing so, I observe that there is nothing that gladdens the heart of the Rudd-Gillard government more than a piece of detailed, prescriptive, intrusive microregulation, as it seeks to get its fingers deep into the entrails of the day-to-day conduct of business. There is nothing that gladdens the heart of the Rudd-Gillard government more than a cartoonish, headline political attack on the business sector—in this case, the banking sector. There appears to be, I regret to note, nothing that gladdens the heart of the Rudd-Gillard government more than rushing out legislation in a furious burst of enthusiasm, well before the critical detail of how the arrangements will work has in fact been sorted out. Is that not all too familiar a pattern from this government? In the bill that is before the House this evening, I regret to note that we are once again seeing this pattern at play.


Let us be clear: the question is not whether some Australians are offered credit card increases which they are ill equipped to deal with—of course that happens all too often—and the question is not whether there are issues in relation to people dealing with credit who may not be well equipped to do so. The question before this House is whether this particular bill is an effective way of dealing with the problem, because this government assumes consistently that all you need is good intentions. If you genuinely think there is a problem, then bring forward any measure, any package, and that ought to be judged as a success. The real question for the House is whether, as a matter of fact, this is an effective and sensible package of measures. I regret to say that there are serious reasons to doubt that it is an effective and sensible package of measures.


I note that the genesis for this legislation was a deeply political exercise, a package of so-called reforms announced on 15 August 2010, a date you will have no hesitation in recalling, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, which fell during the middle of the last election campaign. 


Substantively, there are some six measures contained in this package, which this bill now seeks to pass into law and some, as we have been pleased to acknowledge, have some merit. Others, I regret to say, have very little merit and could fairly be described as merely being meretricious window dressing designed to pad out a press release. 


I seek to make three points in the time available to me this evening. Firstly, to too great an extent, this bill gives effect to a package of measures driven largely by politics, not by policy, and by a political desire to have a package on credit cards. Secondly, much of this bill involves detailed, onerous and poorly thought through regulation, the costs of which look very like to considerably exceed the benefits. The third point I wish to make is that the implementation of this package regrettably has been done in this government's usual shoddy, hasty and imprecise way and, indeed, much of the critical detail is still not yet available, because it is contained in regulations.


Let me turn to the first point—a package driven largely by politics, not by policy. Let me quote some of the more fragrant observations from the press release headed 'A competitive and sustainable banking system', issued by the Treasurer on 12 December 2010. According to the Treasurer this package of measures, of which the measures in this bill form part, will 'give every Australian a fairer go'—I note he seems to be troubled by self-doubt because he is not committing to a fair go, merely a fairer go. He goes on to say in another typical flourish of rhetoric that they 'won't let the big banks off the hook'. If there was ever a clear indicator of the deliberate political intent of this legislation, I think that quote gives the game away.


Again, with a little bit of self-doubt from the Treasurer, he goes on to note, 'There's no silver bullet here,' which might as well amount to an admission that quite a number of the measures in this bill are frankly more trouble than they are worth, that the costs they will introduce exceed the benefits. He nevertheless commits to 'keep working hard to give all Australians a fighting chance'. Again, I wonder how giving Australians a fighting chance measures up to the standard he set himself at the start of the press release to give every Australian a fairer go.


The thing that really stands out is a classic non-sequitur. We have come to appreciate the non-sequitur as the favourite rhetorical device of the Treasurer of Australia and there is a fine example of a non-sequitur in this press release. Immediately after the statements I have quoted, he goes on to say 'Vigorous competition is the best way to keep interest rates for borrowers lower over time and create a system that offers real choice.' I am very pleased to say that I agree with that proposition. On this side of the House, we very much agree with the proposition that vigorous competition in the banking sector, as in every sector, is very much to be encouraged.


But we do ask ourselves the question: how much credibility does this Treasurer have about calling for vigorous competition in the banking sector when, on his watch, there were not one but two very significant bank mergers waved through. St George and Westpac were allowed to merge and the Commonwealth Bank and Bank West were allowed to merge, in both cases approved by the Treasurer of Australia, the same man on whose watch this particular piece of legislation is being brought forward.


The Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Guy Debelle, noted in a speech last year that, as a result of those two mergers, the major banks' combined market share rose from 60 per cent to over 80 per cent between 2007 and 2009. The reality is that this Treasurer, this Rudd-Gillard Labor government, has presided over one of the most dramatic contractions of competition in the banking sector that we have seen for a very long time, and you do not make up for a significant attack on competition, as this government has been party to, by putting some worthy sentences in a press release. 


I would suggest to you that what this government is trying to do with this particular package, these detailed controls on credit cards, is to seek to make up for the fact that in reality competition in the banking sector is considerably weaker than it used to be. If we look at some of these measures, they include prescribing rules for approval of the use of credit cards above a credit limit, restricting credit providers from making unsolicited invitations to borrowers to increase the credit limit of their credit card and introducing a requirement for lenders to put out a key facts sheet for credit card contracts.


I want to make the point that much of this package of measures involves detailed, onerous and poorly thought through regulation, the costs of which can be expected to exceed the benefits. Take, for example, the very broad prohibition against written communications to customers regarding a credit limit increase under the proposed section 133BE. This will not only apply to express offers and invitations to use the legal language; it also has, in practical terms, the effect of capturing any communication to a customer which has the purpose of encouraging the customer to consider applying for an increase. It is very broadly drafted indeed and is likely to prevent not only communications which are objectionable but also communications which are highly desirable. A further question which is raised about the measures contained in this legislation is: why are they necessary, in light of the fact that there is already a very tight regulatory regime dealing with credit limit approvals under chapter 3 of the National Consumer Credit Protection Act?


A further question which might be asked is: isn't there a risk that, by imposing detailed restrictions on the capacity of banks to offer increased credit limits to their customers, the banks will in fact be encouraged to start by offering higher credit limits than they might otherwise have proposed? Isn't there a real possibility that this legislation will end up having the very opposite effect to the one which is proposed?


Another serious concern with this package of measures is that some of the critical detail is not obvious on the face of the legislation, because the legislation simply provides that there will be regulations made regarding these matters—for example, the key provision to be added to the National Credit Code, section 30B, which gives the minister the power to make regulations regarding interest charges.


A further question which might very reasonably be asked is: why is it the case that this legislation is rife with strict liability provisions—that is, provisions under which guilt is simply assumed and the mental state of the person charged with the offence is considered to be irrelevant? One reason why it might be rife is that such provisions appear to be rife in every piece of legislation this government brings forward, because they sit very well with this government's preference for detailed, prescriptive and intrusive legislation. But it is a very good policy question. I note that some of those provisions have been removed from the set of amendments which have been put forward by the government at the eleventh hour, but we still face a very serious and obvious question: why is it that there are simply so many measures contained in this bill which seek to impose strict liability?


The third point I wish to make is to note, with considerable regret, that the implementation of this package has been done in a shoddy, hasty and imprecise way. The exposure draft was released on 3 March, and only two working days were allowed for written submissions to be received by Treasury, even though this bill deals with extremely complex business processes involving the provision of services to millions of Australians and the practical day-to-day management consequences of this sweeping set of changes are very, very substantial.


I note further that, when the bill was first introduced, there was a set of provisions which mandated that every customer of a bank would be automatically provided with a 10 per cent buffer facility. That is to say, in practical terms, their credit limit would turn out to be 10 per cent higher than they and their bank had understood it to be. It was pointed out to the government that that was not a particularly good idea in a piece of legislation which is supposed to prevent automatic or unsolicited increase in credit card limit limits, because it has the substantive effect that you effectively give every customer a one-time 10 per cent increase in their credit limit. It is hard to think of a clearer example of the very shoddy way in which this set of rapidly rammed together measures, dreamt up for political purposes, has been put into legislation.


I note that, as a consequence of this rather obvious point being made to the government, the government has at a very late stage chosen to completely remove the provisions that were in the original bill dealing with this buffer mechanism and has introduced a whole new set of provisions in this area by means of amendment. I suppose we ought to at least acknowledge the fact that the government has conceded the self-evident logical problem in the original set of measures dealing with the so-called buffer facility.


In substance, what we have here is a piece of legislation which contains one or two sensible measures and a range of other measures which are difficult to justify, a set of measures which have been thrown together quickly to meet a political imperative to have a package on credit cards and a package on banking which could be taken to the 2010 election. We have a set of measures, which have been drafted in haste, which deal with very complex business processes affecting millions of people—very expensive to organise and administer—and yet these have been put to the banking industry with quite inadequate time for consultation. We subsequently find ourselves considering a piece of legislation which contains some significant drafting errors, some significant problems of logic and, in some cases, the original premise of which has been almost completely changed by late-in-the-day amendments. The key principle is this: a government needs more than good intentions; it needs detailed, well-worked-through policy.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2011-06-21,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (17:13):  The Australian dream of owning your own home is usually only possible through a home loan, yet taking out a home loan can be the biggest financial commitment that most Australians make. Credit cards promise that bit of help to manage the family budget. Whether it is helping to get access to cash in an emergency or helping to pay for those little extras like a holiday, accessing quick and easy credit is an attractive option for most. But, in the excitement of thinking about a first home or a new home, or the possibilities of what can be bought with a credit card or an extended credit limit, the obligations that banks and other credit providers place on consumers can be forgotten.


When you are thinking about moving into your first house, the last thing you want to do is read through the fine print in a dense home loan contract. When you are planning your overseas holiday, you do not read the clause about the additional charges associated with a cash advance. The changes proposed in this amendment are part of a broad suite of reforms that seek to increase fairness for consumers seeking credit, help to better educate consumers about what it is they are signing up for and create a set of uniform laws across Australia. 


It can be extremely difficult to work in an area where every day you see people suffering from extreme financial hardship. I would like to use this opportunity to commend the consumer rights advocates in my electorate for their hard work. Some of the groups doing marvellous work include Moneycare, provided through the Salvation Army, Street Law, the ACT Welfare Rights Centre and Care Inc., which includes the financial counselling service and the Consumer Law Centre for the ACT.


My friend Liz Dawson has shown me around Moneycare at their Dickson offices and I have seen how hard they work to provide assistance to people in the community who are under pressure from their debts. Moneycare reminded me that many people suffering from financial difficulty as a result of credit card and home loan stress often end up with depression or anxiety as a result.


Care Inc. is the main consumer law advocacy body in the Australian Capital Territory and also provides advice and assistance to consumers. They wrote a submission on the financial services and credit reform green paper that preceded the range of legislative reforms. They rightly point out that, even though low-income earners carry less debt than high-income earners, the potential for that debt to have a negative impact on their lives, families and general wellbeing was far greater. Here in the ACT we boast some of the highest living standards in the country. But even in a relatively well-off electorate like Fraser there is still disadvantage, and we need to remember that, even though those generalisations about Fraser might be true for many, they are certainly not true for all.


Care Inc. told me that a local elderly woman on a pension was given a mortgage for the exclusive use of her son to purchase a business. The son was unable to repay the mortgage and the elderly pensioner was at risk of losing her home because of the loan, which she clearly could not service and from which she received absolutely no benefit. Care Inc. also told me that they had a client who was a homeless man living off a credit card. The man was unemployed and had a range of financial and other legal difficulties, yet he was still given a credit card.


In addition to low-income earners suffering from mortgage and credit card stress, financial counsellors agree that in the last five years there has been a significant increase in the number of middle-income earners suffering mortgage stress. One way that we can help people, regardless of their level of income, to avoid financial stress due to debt is to assist them to understand what it is that they are signing up for. The Gillard government have introduced a range of measures through the National Financial Literacy Strategy—measures that Tony Abbott included in his 'hit list' to pay for the flood reconstruction. The government are doing this in recognition of the fact that this is an important way of helping Australians to understand and pay their debts.


Requiring banks to provide their information in a simpler and more concise format is one part of how the government are helping consumers. We need to remember that the most vulnerable members of our community are the ones least able to access legal advice to assist them to understand their rights and obligations. The most significant changes—the changes that will provide genuine assistance to vulnerable consumers—are requirements to provide consumers with information that is easy to understand.


The key facts sheets to accompany a home loan will enable consumers to better compare home loans and better compare the loans offered by the big banks with loans offered by credit unions and other smaller providers. Potential credit card borrowers will also be provided with a key facts sheet showing interest rates on purchases, cash advances and promotional offers. These facts sheets will help those who do not have the ability to wade through pages and pages of complex legal and technical terms to understand what they are signing up to.


In the House Economics Committee's inquiry into this bill—ably chaired by the member for Dobell—we heard a range of witnesses support this measure. In fact, research by University of Queensland law lecturer Paul O'Shea, referred to in the explanatory memorandum, has taken an innovative approach to assess the impact of simplified disclosure statements. He has shown that, when a sample of respondents were presented with current disclosure statements, only 37 per cent correctly answered a question about the maximum interest rate. With a redesigned disclosure statement, 80 per cent answered the question correctly. On a question about the time to pay off the credit, only 13 per cent gave the right answer when presented with the current disclosure statement, as compared with 100 per cent when given a redesigned disclosure statement. The research provides empirical support for what many of us would have intuitively thought—better disclosure improves customer knowledge.


It is important for us to encourage banks and other lenders to produce their material in a format that is comprehensive yet easy to understand. This is just as important a part of developing financial literacy as teaching consumers how to read complex credit contracts. We are going to ensure that loans are easy to compare by ensuring that all financial providers—banks, credit unions and building societies—have to put their key facts sheets in the same format. That will mean that consumers can compare like with like.


Care Inc., the local service I mentioned earlier, rightly points out that financial service providers can afford lawyers to draft their standard term contracts, whereas the most vulnerable in our society do not have the capacity to obtain legal advice on their rights and obligations prior to entering into credit contracts. Care Inc. also notes that in their experience their clients do not read the contracts in full and several do not even keep a copy of their contract to refer to if required to challenge any of its terms.


The changes to ban unsolicited offers to borrowers to increase their credit limit are also important to help consumers understand their financial obligations. Credit limit increases are targeted to consumers with outstanding credit card balances who are struggling to maintain their repayments. They target people with an immediate need for credit, and agreeing to the offer is often made very easy. The decision to increase credit is not done in a competitive market with an ability to compare interest rates and card features to take the most financially appropriate option. The people targeted by such offers are often not in a financial position to benefit from a competitive market.


Letters offering increases are presented as marketing or promotional material rather than as an application for additional credit. This is misleading. Many consumers assume that the financial institution has done an assessment of their capacity to repay before sending out the offer and they have an unrealistic expectation of their own capacity to repay. The bank nominates the amount of increase and it does not necessarily reflect the financial capacity of the consumer. This is almost a predatory practice that preys on the most vulnerable members of our community. This bill will stop lenders from placing consumers in further financial hardship. I used to think that it was critical to educate people to understand complex financial documents. I thought we should be encouraging citizens to see the importance of carefully reading each and every document, regardless of how dense and confused these might be. But now I take a different approach. My philosophy now is that, rather than forcing consumers to do the hard work, we should be looking at reducing complexity. Why do we need to have confusing documents rather than easy-to-read tables? Sure, there is still a need to understand contractual terms, but a one-page document will enable consumers to understand the most important points, and they will know where to look if they need more advice, detail or information.


There are so many interesting things to do and to read in life: brilliant literature, trashy fiction as a guilty pleasure, movies to watch, sports to participate in and families to spend time with. Why should people be forced to spend their valuable leisure time wading through complex documents? I would rather we encouraged people to read for pleasure, rather than spending excessive time on financial contracts. Put another way: we should look at financial literacy as an obligation for lenders as well as for consumers. Through this bill and previous changes to the National Consumer Credit Protection Act, Labor has demonstrated a commitment to eradicating predatory lending practices and promoting better information for consumers. As the Treasurer said in his second reading speech, this bill 'is part of our commitment to always stand on the side of consumers'. I commend the bill to the House.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (17:23):  With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I would like to recognise in the gallery today a delegation from the Catholic Church. I would like to recognise, in particular, Bishop Peter Connors, who looks after the pastoral care in my electorate of Wannon and does so very well. I would also like to recognise some other friends, particularly of the Tehan and O'Brien families, who have known my family for many years; on your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I welcome them to the gallery this evening.


I rise to speak on the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011. There are five points I would like to make on this bill. One is that the coalition will not be opposing it. Amendments have been made; many which are embarrassing for the government have had to be made at the 11th hour and highlight the deficiencies, sadly, in their approach to decision making.


In many ways, this bill was heading down the path of many others that have come into this chamber in that the unintended consequences had not been thought through. Industry and institutions warned on a number of occasions throughout the legislative process that some of the elements contained in this legislation would have unintended consequences—a fact that the government has chosen at the last minute to recognise but still has not recognised in a comprehensive way. The coalition believes that the government's approach of imposing additional regulation and interfering in the commercial decisions of banks is not the preferred approach to addressing market deficiencies. What we are calling for, and I will take this opportunity to call for now, is a full root-and-branch review of Australia's financial system. This was set out in the coalition's nine-point banking plan, put forward by the shadow Treasurer over eight months ago and which, in many ways, has led to the bill before us today.


I would like to go into some detail about the coalition's nine-point plan because it has set the platform for the bill before us today. In many ways the Treasurer has been dragged, kicking and screaming, to present this legislation as a result of what the coalition put forward. When we hear that the coalition is not setting a positive agenda, I think this issue makes nonsense of that claim. In many ways our nine-point banking plan has led us to see these reforms being introduced today, some of which have merit and some of which do not.


In our nine-point plan, we set out that we wanted the ACCC to have the power to investigate anticompetitive price signalling. We were prepared to, and did, put forward a private member's bill on that. We encouraged APRA to investigate whether the major banks are taking on unnecessary risks in the name of trying to maximise short-term returns that conflict with the preferences of those who backstop the system—namely, the taxpayers. We wanted to mandate the RBA to publish regular, rather than irregular, reporting on bank net interest margins, on returns on equity and on profitability so that we can all determine whether the major banks are extracting monopolistic profits. We wanted to investigate whether we could allow Australia Post to make its 3,800 branches available as distribution channels for small lenders. We wanted to ask the Treasury and the RBA to investigate ways to further improve the liquidity of the residential and commercial mortgage backed securities markets, which are an alternative source of funding for small lenders, including consideration of the coalition's proposal to extend the government's credit rating to AAA rated commercial paper in those markets to improve liquidity to further help the small end of town.


We wanted to explore further simplification of the Financial Services Reform Act to make getting out and doing business easier and simpler, so rather than introducing more red tape, as this bill does in parts, the idea was to reduce it. We wanted to direct APRA to explore whether the risk weightings on business loans secured by residential properties are punitive. The idea would be to ensure that small businesses received sufficient financial benefit from pledging their family homes to secure their borrowings. We wanted to resolve the debate about whether the banks should be able to issue covered bonds, in the same way that other jurisdictions allow their banks to issue them, which would provide a more affordable line of credit. Most importantly, we wanted to have a full review of the financial system.


It is now 13 years since the last major review of banking. The Wallis review brought forward substantial reforms in the banking sector. It is high time that we had another review into the banking sector because reform is necessary, but it needs to be done in a way that we think through sensibly how the banking system needs further reform driven through it and what the policy approach should be, and it needs to be done in a way that makes sure we take into consideration the unintended consequences. As I said, the coalition put forward its nine-point plan. We could talk, as I have highlighted here, about the various merits of points one to eight and whether some were necessary and some were not. But I think the last point, the one about a root-and-branch review of our banking regulations, should be supported by everyone in this House. Two months after the coalition put forward its plan, we had the Treasurer dragged, kicking and screaming, to announce his own policy approach in this area. That is what led to this bill before us. 


There are a couple of specific items in this bill we need to discuss. The first is the banning of exit fees on new floating rate mortgages. The coalition has said that the government has not thought through this part of the bill. We are not arguing that there is not an issue with exit fees. What we are saying is that there should be a choice. This is particularly important for small lenders—and we get a lot of these out in regional and rural areas. The only way they can protect themselves from the major banks is to have exit fees; otherwise, the major banks, if they are being successful, have the opportunity to move in and offer better rates for a short period of time and take borrowers from these smaller lenders.


So what we are arguing about here is choice, and choice for smaller lenders in particular—the type of lenders who are found in my electorate of Wannon and out in regional and rural Australia. These smaller lenders are trying to compete with the major banks. Sometimes, in order for them to be able to offer lower interest rates, they need to be able to put exit fees on. It gives them the protection they need as smaller lenders. So that is what we are arguing here; we are arguing about choice, about allowing smaller lenders to remain competitive in the market, about enabling them to compete with the major banks. One of the things that they need to be able to do, in some instances, in order to provide that competition is to put exit fees on. We are not saying that there is not an issue with exit fees; we are saying that, in some instances, smaller lenders in particular should be given the choice of using them. That is the point we are making on this issue.


The second point I raise today is about the introduction of fact sheets. The requirement for these fact sheets will now come into effect two years after problems with competition in the banking sector were first raised. Once again we are seeing the government come up with a solution two years after the problem was first identified. And now they are having to backtrack and put an amendment into this bill at the last minute to give the banking sector and other financial institutions enough time to introduce these fact sheets. The fact sheets are designed to provide simple information to borrowers so that they know exactly what they are getting themselves involved in. These fact sheets could be important in making sure that borrowers have a simple way to choose between lenders. But you also have to take into consideration that, in introducing a bill like this, you are putting requirements on our financial institutions. Those financial institutions have to be given sufficient time to enable them to produce these fact sheets in a timely manner and in a manner which will not lead to them being rushed and will not lead to the fact sheets failing to do the job they are intended to do.


Sadly, the government has had to move back the date on which the requirement for these fact sheets will come into effect. It will now be 1 January 2012. One has to ask why it has taken so long for the government to get these bills before us and why it has taken it so long to undertake the necessary discussions with the financial institutions to get agreement on what these facts sheets should look like and what should be in them. One also has to ask why the fact sheet requirements are to be introduced by regulation rather than in the legislation. Once again we are seeing the government bring forward a bill where most of the detail—it is especially so in this case—is in the regulations and not where it should be. It should be in the bill proper so that we get a chance to fully examine it and, if necessary, pass amendments to make sure that there are no unintended consequences. 


When the government came into office, it committed itself to taking a regulation out for every regulation introduced. One of the things that disappoints me, in standing in the House today and delivering this speech, is that we are not seeing regulation being removed as regulation is being put in. From what I can gather, the Gillard government is now operating under a system whereby there are 220 pieces of regulation brought into the House for every one being taken out. I know that some Rudd policies have been dumped—some of the policies he implemented have not worked and we have had to move away from them. But that commitment, made before Prime Minister Rudd was elected in 2011—that might be a Freudian slip there; I mean 2007—that for every piece of regulation that came into this House one would be removed, was very noble in its cause and is one which the coalition has supported. It is one which we would have liked to have seen the government support in the introduction of this bill. This bill is regulatory and we need to keep in mind that the more we regulate, the more business costs we put on all our financial institutions. And any costs we impose on our financial institutions, they have to get back from somewhere. Ultimately, that usually comes from the borrower and can mean increased interest rates.


I will make one final point on this bill, and that goes to the Treasurer. The Treasurer has said that this legislation will not be a silver bullet; but, at the same time, when he introduced these reforms, he said that they would drive interest rates lower. We only have to go to the front page of the Australian on the day that these reforms were introduced to see that they were aimed at driving interest rates lower. It will be very interesting to see, now that the legislation has come into the House, whether in fact that is what they will do. Sadly, given the government's wasteful spending, we are hearing from the financial market that interest rates are likely to rise rather than decrease in the next six months. But let us hope that the Treasurer will work wonders and this bill will do what he is on the record as saying it will do—and that is drive interest rates lower. We on this side of the House will be holding him to that commitment, especially over the next six months. Cost-of-living pressures are going up and the last thing that Australian communities need and the people in the community of Wannon need at this stage is further interest rate rises, especially when they are the direct result of the wasteful spending that this government has engaged in and the fact that the government has not been able to show budgetary discipline and bring the budget back into surplus sooner than forecast for 2012-13.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2011-06-21,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (17:38):  Never has there been so much negative carping in the process of saying yes. The National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011 is good legislation. This legislation is definitely in the interests of the working people that I represent in the electorate of Throsby, and I would like to take a few moments to explain why. I will start by going to the evidence that was presented to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics—a committee which I sit on. This evidence, given by Ms Karen Cox, the coordinator of the Consumer Credit Legal Centre, outlines why some of the measures in this bill are necessary. 


In evidence before the committee, Ms Cox said:


… there is no doubt that credit cards are an enormous cause of pressure on families, and we have seen countless examples over the years of people on very low incomes who have accepted a series of credit limit increases.


She went on to explain that there was indeed a problem, particularly with people on modest incomes who have had considerable credit card debts, and that it was those debts that were leading to financial stress.


This evidence certainly aligns with some of the stories that I have heard in my electorate—even as late as last weekend, when I had the great pleasure of visiting the offices of the St Vincent de Paul Society in Oak Flats in my electorate. I spoke there with one of the managers, Ms Linda O'Rourke. In the process of speaking to her about the $500,000-plus that the Commonwealth government has provided to St Vincent de Paul in Oak Flats to assist with emergency services grants, we had a discussion about the importance of financial literacy. Ms O'Rourke impressed upon me that there was indeed a great need for improved financial literacy amongst the working people in our electorate, particularly those who from time to time have to avail themselves of the services of St Vincent de Paul because they have maxed out their credit cards, they have found themselves in financial stress and they need assistance to pay the bills or to put some food on the table. 


This legislation is good legislation. It is good legislation for everyone who has ever walked out to their letterbox and found it chocker-block full of direct marketing mail from a credit card company, offering them an increase in their credit limit. It is good news for consumers, owners of credit cards, who on a week-to-week or monthly basis put additional money on their credit card thinking that in doing so they were going to reduce their interest payments, only to find that the money had not been allocated to the highest interest bearing portion of their loan and that they had been whacked with an interest payment much higher than they had expected. It is good news for the consumers out there who are concerned that they can get all the marketing information that they could ever imagine from banks and financial institutions but not the sort of concrete information which enables them to get a real handle on the cost of the loan and how it compares with that from another institution. So it is good legislation, and it should enjoy the support of all members in this place. 


Let us go to a few of the features which address the problems that I have outlined. The first is the home loan key facts sheet. The bill will introduce a requirement for lenders to give borrowers a simple one-page key facts sheet—revolutionary stuff, Mr Deputy Speaker. You have to wonder why this is not happening right now, but it is not. There is a one-page key facts sheet for home loans and for credit cards to enable people to assess the full cost of the loan, to compare it in standard form to those of other financial institutions and to shop around and get a better deal. The aim of this measure is to ensure that, when a potential home borrower is applying for a mortgage, it is easier for them to compare what each lender is offering them. It is very difficult to see why any fair-minded person would oppose such a measure. Indeed, as I have said, it is nothing more than militant good sense. We also believe that the transparency and the uniformity provided in these key facts sheets are going to encourage greater competition between financial institutions because the consumers will be able to compare like with like. 


The second component that I would like to talk about in relation to this legislation goes to credit card repayments. This bill delivers on the Gillard government's election commitment to crack down on unfair treatment of Australians with credit cards and to help them get a better deal in the banking system. The bill will give credit card holders more control over the amount that they borrow and will also ensure that they are not charged excessive fees. It will do this by regulating the circumstances in which borrowers can go over their credit limits and abolishing fees when they do so unless the consumer has consented to opt in to a system which extends their credit in this circumstance.


This bill will also mean that credit card providers will be required to allocate repayments—and this is critical—to the higher interest bearing debts first so that families will not need to pay more interest than they otherwise should. Currently consumers do not have any control at all over how their repayments are allocated, meaning that lenders will often use repayments to pay off the part of a loan that is only incurring low or indeed no interest at all. So it is good legislation and it enjoys the support of the House.


This bill will ban unsolicited credit limit extension invitations that encourage borrowers to increase their credit limit. These unsolicited offers of additional credit can result in consumers ending up with high credit limits and often high levels of debt. We know that interest charges on credit cards are quite high. They are good money spinners. I do not take anything away from the financial institutions that offer these products. They are a critical service in our economy. But we believe that where credit is offered it should offered responsibly. That should include the offering of additional credit or the raising of credit extensions.


Another measure in this bill will require application forms for credit cards to include a key facts sheet that clearly provides information about the credit card, including the interest rate on purchases, cash advances, the annual fee and any other relevant fee or charge. Again, this measure is quite simply about increasing transparency and empowering consumers. So it is difficult to see how many of those on the opposite side of the chamber could find a reason to criticise this particular initiative. You have got to wonder why this is not already happening as a matter of good commercial practice.


Let's talk about overlimit fees. It is not hard to exceed your credit limit, and indeed this can often happen inadvertently. In most cases, credit card providers allow accounts to go over the credit limit and then apply a fee for exceeding this limit. The measures in this bill will limit the amount by which the credit limit can be exceeded to 10 per cent above the credit limit at the discretion of the lender. The fee for exceeding the credit limit will be abolished. To ensure that there are no unintended consequences from this measure, consumers can decide to opt out of this default buffer if it helps them to manage their finances better, or they can ask for a larger buffer if that is best for their individual circumstances.


These measures go some way to put in place some sensible regulation on consumer credit in this country. In closing I make the observation that, unlike many of the financial systems around the world, our banks and our financial institutions are incredibly well managed and incredibly well regulated. It is the fact that successive governments in this country have put in place sensible regulation of our financial institutions that has ensured that, unlike in many other countries in our region and around the globe, we did not see the failure of our financial institutions as the world went through the global financial crisis. That does not mean that we should rest on our laurels or that we should not be continuing to review and improve the operation of our banking and financial institutions. The measures in this legislation are a modest addition to that ongoing review and improvement. I commend the legislation to the House.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (17:49):  Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask leave of the House to make a ministerial statement relating to Australia's offshore oil and gas resources sector security inquiry.


Leave granted.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I thank the opposition. I wish to take this opportunity to update the House on the progress of the inquiry, which the government announced early this year, into the security of our nation's offshore oil and gas facilities being conducted by the Inspector of Transport Security, Mick Palmer AO APM. Mr Palmer has recently reported to me that his inquiry is progressing well and that he is receiving outstanding cooperation and support from the oil and gas industry. Mr Palmer formally launched the inquiry with a briefing to the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA) board in Perth on 10 April 2011 during their national conference.


The inquiry, which is the first-ever comprehensive review of our nation's offshore oil and gas facilities security, is in response to the growing threats from international terrorism and piracy. It is important to note that, while at this time there is no known specific threat against any of our facilities, in light of the current global security environment it is crucial that we remain vigilant and take all reasonable steps to ensure our security preparedness and arrangements are equal to any emerging threats. An act of terrorism against any offshore facility in or near Australian waters would be not only extremely damaging to our natural environment but also very costly to our economy. This growing sector already employs more than 10,000 Australians and generates over $22 billion in annual export earnings.


Australia's reserves of oil and gas are concentrated offshore in the north-west of Australia, Bass Strait and the Timor Sea. The development of these oil and gas resources has raised Australia's international profile in global oil and gas production, but such a profile may also attract undesirable attention in highlighting Australia as a potential target for terrorism or other criminal acts including piracy. Add to this the fact that current exploration and production activities in Australia are moving towards deeper and more distant waters, in increasingly remote offshore locations, and the critical importance of continuous vigilance in regard to the issue of security becomes obvious.


Consequently, the Inspector of Transport Security is assessing the quality and effectiveness of current security arrangements in regard to the offshore oil and gas resources sector together with the response capabilities of resource operators and government to any security incident or attack on offshore oil and gas exploration and production infrastructure. Specifically, the inquiry is looking at:


Government and industry relationships, communication and coordination;


The nature and extent of current security control and oversight arrangements;


The development and implementation of security programs;


Possible sea and landslide security gaps and areas for improvement;


The economic and environmental cost of a violent takeover of any offshore oil or gas infrastructure;


Coastal and high seas shipping routes used in the transport of oil and gas products;


The supply and support of offshore platforms and facilities used to deliver building components for offshore oil and gas fields.


Due to the wide-ranging nature of the inquiry, I wrote to all of the relevant federal, state and territory ministers together with peak oil and gas bodies, ship owners, port operators and operators of offshore facilities.


This support has been forthcoming and as a consequence, the inquiry is being conducted in consultation and close cooperation with a range of federal and state/territory agencies including particularly the National Security Advisor, and with the active support of the federal Attorney-General, the Minister for Resources and Energy and the Minister for Defence.


Additionally, letters of support have already been received from the Northern Territory Minister for Transport, together with positive industry responses from APPEA and a wide range of industry corporations including ExxonMobil, Woodside, Apache Energy, BP Developments Australia, Shell, Beach Petroleum, Chevron Australia, Inpex, ENI, BHP Petroleum and PTTEP.


APPEA is also providing physical support to the inquiry in the form of two liaison officers to work closely with the inquiry and to facilitate policy and security level meetings and site inspections both within Australia and overseas.


The operational phase of the inquiry commenced with site visitations in the Bass Strait, and further domestic discussions and site visitations are planned for the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Timor-Leste during the June-August period.


International policy meetings in the United States have commenced with the support and cooperation of the US Government Accountability Office, the United States Coast Guard, and the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, with the Inspector of Transport Security leading an inquiry team to the United States last month.


Mr Palmer is due to provide me with an interim report in late 2011 but I anticipate, due to the nature and width of the inquiry and the logistical difficulties associated with aspects of many of the site visitations, that the inquiry will not be completed until the latter part of 2012.


I recommend the inquiry to the House and put on the record the appreciation of the government for the unqualified cooperation and support being provided to the Inspector of Transport Security by the states and territories and the oil and gas industry.


I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Wide Bay to speak for six minutes.


Leave granted.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Truss (Leader of The Nationals) speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding six minutes.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2011-06-21,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (17:56):  I welcome the minister's report on the security inquiry into Australia's offshore oil and gas resource sector and the progress of the work of Mr Mick Palmer on this issue. Protecting Australia's $24 billion a year oil and gas industry is vital for Australia's future energy security. As the minister notes, the industry employs some 10,000 Australians across the country. Offshore oil and gas production provides a major input into our economy and its infrastructure is of critical national importance. 


There are around 170 oil and gas production platforms in operation around the Australian coast, from the Timor Sea, to the North-West Shelf, to Bass Strait. As we all know, some of those oil and gas platforms are actually a long way from our coastline. Australia's gas production for domestic and export markets continues to increase every year; however, petroleum liquids production is still falling. In 2000-01 Australia produced 272.4 million barrels of petroleum liquids. By 2009-10 this had fallen to 186.9 million barrels.


There is further scope for exploration and appraisal drilling to address the growing demand for petroleum liquids, although significant prospective areas offshore are out of limits because they are in national parks, in particular around the Great Barrier Reef, and so we will never know whether or not there are winnable resources in such areas. While Australia accounts for approximately 0.6 per cent of the world oil supply and 1.5 per cent of the worldwide demand, our oil and natural gas accounts for nearly 56 per cent of primary energy consumed in Australia.


With the rise in international piracy and the threat of terrorism, it is certainly timely to revisit the security requirements in place to protect our offshore oil and gas assets. Last year, pirates were involved in an unsuccessful attempt to attack and take over an oil rig off the coast of Nigeria, with a firefight erupting between the Nigerian navy and the pirates. As the minister notes, there is no suggestion of a particular threat against any oil and gas platform in Australia but vigilance is certainly necessary.


It is clear that a potential security threat would be extremely damaging to our national economy and affect our energy security if it were in fact to succeed. I note that the inquiry by the Inspector of Transport Security, Mick Palmer, will examine a number of important matters and report on potential improvements to our offshore oil and gas security regime. When the minister announced the inquiry on 1 February 2010, a draft report was due to be provided in late 2011. But I understand that is now to be an interim report, with the final report due out in the second half of 2012, which is quite a long time away. While it is important to get all of this right, as it deals with national security, it should be noted that it does look somewhat like another one in the long list of delayed reports by the Labor government.


There are also some policy conflicts here. While the inquiry is welcome, this report comes while the parliament is still considering the current budget, which slashes $21 million for aircraft surveillance of our coastal waters, which will result in 950 fewer hours of aerial surveillance each year. That does seem to me to be a bit inconsistent because, if we are seriously interested in security and assessing what happens in these particular production areas, the surveillance aircraft may well provide the first alert. There is also a wind back in other areas of border protection by this government. Almost every budget has cut the resources available for airport security and for customs and quarantine.


The coalition will always support sensible moves to enhance our maritime security regime. The coalition has a history of proposing and supporting sensible measures to enhance our maritime security regime and in this case the security of our offshore oil and gas assets. For example, in 2005 the coalition amended the Maritime Transport Security Act 2003 to require operators to write and follow security plans, including security risk assessments, and develop preventative strategies to manage risk. The coalition in government had a strong record of securing Australia's borders and strengthening security requirements across the maritime industry, including our offshore oil and gas assets.


The industry is of vital significance to Australia's economy. In addition to being a major employer, it is an important part also of our energy security. We must do what we can as a nation to keep these valuable resources, and the infrastructure that services them, safe and particularly protect them from any risk of terrorism, pirating or other dangerous activities. So I commend Mr Palmer. I note with satisfaction the cooperation that the industry are giving to this inquiry, because they also recognise how important it is to keep their valuable assets safe.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (18:04):  I am pleased to rise on the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011, not because I am fervently in support of the bill but more broadly because I believe in policy measures that in broad terms are supportive of improving consumer protection and enhancing consumer transparency. When it comes to the single biggest credit items that affect most consumers and most people in the community, home loans and credit cards are among them. That said, the government's bill that is currently before the House is not a bill that the coalition will be opposing, although it is also not a bill that we are completely supportive of.


The reality is that, in typical Labor fashion, the bill that is before the House wades its ugly way into the marketplace and sets about ensuring that there are a whole raft of new legislative protections, as they are labelled, to try to policy-manage and effectively legislate their way to a better market outcome. The question is: could this have been achieved through other methods? We had raised a number of concerns when the first iteration of this bill was put before the Australian public. We raised concerns about the approach that Labor was adopting. At the time the government said that our concerns could not be incorporated into the legislation because they would have undermined and eroded the value of the legislation as the Labor Party saw it.


What we have seen though, following an inquiry into this particular bill by House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, a committee of which I have the great fortune of being deputy chair, is that a number of the recommendations the committee has put forward and a significant amount of the evidence that came forward from witnesses before the committee have now been incorporated at the eleventh hour into the bill before the chamber this evening. So it has come to pass that a large number of the reforms which were sought by the coalition and which were ruled out by the Labor Party have now been incorporated into the legislation which we are currently debating. That said, though, in broad terms—let me stress that it is in broad terms—I am supportive of measures that are contained within the bill to do a number of key things. The first is the requirement for lenders to provide key facts sheets for standard home loans as well as for credit cards. These are important measures which enhance consumer protection insofar as they provide what is effectively a ready reckoner. The reality is that consumers receive great wads of information. My constituents on the Gold Coast in my seat of Moncrieff and all of us in this chamber know that when you have interactions with banks, when you have dealings with financial houses, you receive wads and wads of paper: statements of advice, policy disclosure statements and all those types of items. To be able to distil it down to its most basic elements, which is effectively what the key facts sheet does, is a welcome addition to the arsenal that consumers have when it comes to determining which is the best home loan or credit card, what the pitfalls are and what the various charges associated with that credit card or home loan are. In that respect I welcome it.


There are of course some other reforms that have been made with respect to prescribing rules for approval of the use of credit cards above their credit limit, specifying an allocation hierarchy for payments made under credit card contracts and restricting credit providers from making unsolicited invitations to borrowers to increase the credit limit of their credit card—as well as introducing a requirement for lenders to provide a key facts sheet for credit cards, as I said. A number of these subelements of the legislation are important because they have a material impact on the functioning of credit providers. In particular, one is straightforward and is supported by this side—that is, the specification of an allocation hierarchy for payments made under credit card contracts. It is certainly worthwhile that there be an allocation hierarchy such that repayments made on credit cards go to paying down the debt that attracts the highest interest rate. That is a smart step. It is a step that we are supportive of. It is a step that is proconsumer and therefore of benefit.


But also contained within this legislation are issues of concern. One of them, which has now been amended at the eleventh hour, was about rules surrounding the use of credit cards above their credit limit. I am Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Economics. We heard evidence from a number of witnesses that highlighted their concern about what the impact of Labor's legislation would have meant. In the first instance—this was an obvious concern and one that I raised with witnesses as well—was the issue about whether, as a consequence of Labor's legislation, we would see a situation where credit providers provided a higher than usual credit limit to a customer, expecting that subsequently they would be unable to raise the credit limit unless they had jumped over all the hurdles that this legislation effectively put before them. The clear and unequivocal answer from witnesses was: yes, the consequence that was most likely as a result of this legislation would have been a higher initial credit limit. So one could rightly wonder why the Labor Party was undertaking this.


Certainly, as with many things Labor attempts to do, it is driven by a sense of purity, I guess, in some respects about the outcome that is being sought. The reality is, though, that the application is often worse than the affliction which Labor is attempting to address in the first instance. That was the case with the original iteration of this legislation. Now that has been amended so that consumers can give their consent to there being, for example, additional fees and charges associated with going over their credit limit as well as with respect to the way a credit limit is assigned in the first place. In that sense, I am pleased that the Labor Party has seen the common sense that was put forward by the coalition and incorporated those changes into the legislation.


A second aspect of this that causes me some concern is with respect to so-called unsolicited invitations. As a matter of principle, I do not really understand why we feel it necessary for there to be legislation with respect to unsolicited invitations. The reality is that anyone who watches some television, listens to some radio or reads some newspapers sees advertising for all manner of products and services. It is part of daily life. When you drive in your car, you see billboards. When you turn on the television, you see advertisements. We are not compelled to race out and purchase all those items as a consequence of seeing advertising. Indeed, for the manufacturers and service providers that are advertising in a market economy, I think it is part of their routine business. In fact, I think most people have become desensitised to a large extent to advertising. Yet for some reason the Labor Party takes the view in this legislation that we are able to withstand advertising in all manner of other things but not when it comes to credit card limits. When it comes to credit card limits, apparently we are all suckers and immediately sign up to increasing our credit limit on our credit card.


Given that there are criminal sanctions under the legislation, at least in its first iteration, which apply as a result of an unsolicited invitation to increase your credit limit, you have to start scratch your head about whether or not this is a little heavy-handed. My personal view is that it is heavy-handed. My personal view is that it is crazy to be saying to financial lenders, 'Don't you dare provide an unsolicited credit offer, because if you do that then you're in breach of the legislation, and if it is a personal employee they're in breach of the legislation and potentially subject to criminal sanctions.' It is madness. Why is it that consumers apparently have the ability to discern what they should consume when it comes to other products and services but they cannot do it with respect to credit cards? I think it is one bridge too far. I think it is unnecessary. In that sense, I certainly have some concerns. It also lacks common sense.


Again, a key part of the testimony from witnesses before the committee when we undertook the inquiry related to whether or not it was commercially sound for a financial lender to lend a consumer more money than that consumer was able to pay back. Of course the answer is no. That is not a sustainable business model. The reason most borrowers are not in a situation to repay their debts is typically because of a life-changing event like the loss of employment. That typically is the reason why people get themselves in hot water, and it is often unforeseen. Given that that is the key driver of many of the defaults, especially of credit card borrowers, you have to question why this subelement of this legislation is necessary. Given that it is commercially unsound to do it, and therefore you would assume that there is not a demand in the marketplace for it, why would it happen?


That is not to say that there are not some fly-by-night operators, and there has been some evidence that there has been at a very minor level. So again the question is: why regulate an entire industry when you are attempting to address a very small percentage of those that are effectively, for lack of a better term, breaking the rules and operating in an unsustainable way? That notwithstanding, I guess it does provide the opportunity for the Labor Party to beat their chests and claim they are all about the consumer and all about empowering people. But what consumers need to know is that they end up paying for all this red tape, they end up paying for all these protections, they end up paying in some way, shape or form for all of the compliance that is associated with all of these additional regulations. It is consistent with the big government approach of the Labor Party.


However, I outline, as I said, that there are a number of aspects that I am broadly supportive of, especially with respect to the key fact sheets and particularly with relation to the allocation hierarchy for payments. In that sense, whilst I certainly do not commend the bill, as a member of the opposition I am also not totally opposed to it.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2011-06-21,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (18:15):  I rise to speak in support of the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011 and note the support, broadly speaking, of the member for Moncrieff. I commend him on his contribution. I am sure that when the Turnbull tide returns he will be promoted to the front bench.




Mr Bowen:
  Shadow Treasurer.




Mr PERRETT:
  Yes, shadow Treasurer perhaps. This bill delivers on our election commitment to get a better deal for consumers with credit cards. Any Labor member or anyone representing any seat knows that this is a huge issue. Whilst it is very easy for the member for Moncrieff to talk about pure markets and ability to say no to advertisements, the reality is that with credit it is a slightly different market. It is a bit like the carbon price: there are some times when the market does achieve the best things and occasionally we need to have the hand of government in there. 


I note that in April this year there were 14.8 million credit cards in circulation in Australia, with a total credit limit of almost $135 billion. In April the credit card debt of Australians was $49.3 billion and Australians made many millions of purchases on their credit cards. I would like to go on the record and note that less than half of those purchases in April were from my wife!




Mr Bowen:
  Is she listening?




Mr PERRETT:
  I am hoping not. And in April we had the Easter holidays, so there was at least one day when most of the shops were closed down. But still there were all those purchases. That credit card debt in April was $49.3 billion and if you go back to December you have that Christmas spike when it was up to $158.9 billion. So obviously credit cards are an important part of their daily lives for many people.


The legislation before the House is not about bashing the banks but is about ensuring that we have a regulatory framework in place to protect consumers from excessive fees. It also gives them greater control over how much they borrow. Rather than just let the market rip, it is important to have controls and some checks and balances. This is in response to growing community concerns about some bank behaviours and this bill therefore amends the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. Firstly, the bill changes the way banks apply credit limits. Currently banks allow credit accounts to exceed credit limits and then charge an over-limit free. These fees alone cost consumers $225 million a year. With about 22 million Australians, that is about $10 each just in the over-limit fees. This bill limits the amount credit accounts can go over to 10 per cent above the credit limit and abolishes the fee when they do. Consumers can also opt out of this buffer if that is best for them or they can negotiate a larger buffer, which would be subject to a fee. This measure strikes the right balance. It prevents banks from slugging consumers with excessive over-limit fees and empowers consumers to choose whether they can go over their limit. As I said, at the moment there is about $10 in fees for every man, woman and child in Australia. Hopefully not everyone in Australia has a credit card, but still it is a significant amount. This bill also requires credit card lenders to allocate repayments to a consumer's higher interest bearing debts first. As we know, that stops the compounding effect to a slight extent. It overturns the practice of lenders allocating repayments first to debts with the lowest rate. It is expected that this could save consumers around $360 a year, depending on their spending habits. 


This bill also includes measures to help protect consumers from excessive debt. It does so by banning unsolicited credit limit extension offers being sent to credit card holders. I did a bit of a survey today, knowing that I was going to deliver this speech, to find someone that had not been given a credit card offer. Irrespective of your income, how many people have been made these offers? This is just my little snap survey, admittedly—I did not wander into the Liberal Party room today and talk to them—but the norm seemed to be that people's credit limit was doubled as a matter of course. They were able to immediately double what they were able to rack up. Now lenders will not be able to send offers to extend credit limits unless consumers have already agreed to receive these offers. To placate the concerns of the member for Moncrieff, you will still be able to tick the box and be sent offers if you are comfortable with that.


We all know it is quite enticing the way these offers are sent out. In Catcher in the Rye Holden Caulfield talked about the fact that everyone wants to be in a club and the more exclusive the club the better people feel about themselves—so the bronze club, the silver club, the gold club, the platinum club—and sometimes it is a case of offering to change you from a gold to a platinum, yet it does not really change anything except the colour of the card, but people mistakenly feel they are in a more exclusive club. I am not sure what sorts of colours and metals they progress on to, but everyone likes an exclusive club and the people who offer credit cards understand that. It is a bit like Calvin in Calvin and Hobbes offering to build a cubbyhouse only for boys. This will provide some protection for consumers, who can easily end up with a credit limit they cannot afford. We all know that if someone receives a credit card offer at the same time as losing their job or their circumstances change they may make a short-term decision that will get them out of trouble for a few payments but obviously, in the long term, at the higher interest rates that are attached to the credit cards, the debt chases hardship and ends up compounding the problems.


This bill also introduces a new requirement for lenders to include on credit card application forms a facts sheet with a clear summary of key account features. This is a long overdue measure that will give consumers important information including the annual fee; the interest rates on purchases, cash advances and promotional offers; and other relevant fees. We have all been sent the product disclosure statements, but if we did a survey I wonder how many people, including lawyers, would have actually read all of the product disclosure statements they receive in the mail. It would be a very small percentage I would suggest. It should be incumbent upon banks to ensure that their customers are fully informed about this kind of information so they can make an informed choice when selecting a credit product. The clear summaries are a great feature. This information should not be buried in complex terms and conditions booklets but should be made obvious to consumers as part of the application process. In the past I have gone through the PDS and crossed out the odd paragraph every now and then and returned it. I have done it a couple of times and never actually received any comment back from the people. So, maybe consumers are not reading it and the people who send out the information are also not reading it. The key facts sheet mandated by this bill will ensure more appropriate disclosure to consumers. (Quorum formed)


I promise I will not say nice things about the member for Moncrieff again, if that was the reason for the quorum call!


The bill requires lenders to provide a key facts sheet to set out the costs of home loans to allow consumers to more easily compare home loan products.


It is no surprise the banking sector is not overwhelmingly behind this bill. The Australian Bankers Association have come out swinging, but I do not think we need worry too much about our banks or lose too much sleep over them. The 'big four' have reported first-half-yearly profits—so, just six months—of $11.9 billion, which is about $540.91 for every Australian. The Commonwealth Bank posted $3.3 billion profit to December 2010, NAB earned $2.67 billion, Westpac a cool $3.16 billion and ANZ's six-month profit was up a massive 38 percent to $2.66 billion. No-one is suggesting the banks should not be profitable, and I think most of us would agree that the strength of the Australian banking sector played a part in shielding Australia from the full impact of the global financial crisis. When we saw banks around the world tumbling, we saw that our 'big four' were consistently in the top 15 banks in the world. I commend the opposition for their contribution to making sure that we have had a strong banking sector. It is something that there has been bipartisan support for. As well, there were government measures during the GFC, such as the bank deposit guarantee.


Banks answer to their shareholders and most are no doubt very happy with the half-yearly profit reports. But the banks also have a social licence to provide financial credit and enable measured economic growth and fiscal stability throughout Australia. The Gillard Labor government believes that with this social licence comes an obligation on the part of the banks to protect consumers and not lure them into unaffordable and unreasonable credit deals. We should acknowledge that banks such as NAB are actually leading the way when it comes to some of these reforms, and I do commend the banks that have taken these initiatives. They have already scrapped some over-limit fees and now allocate repayments to the highest interest debts first. These are terrific initiatives for consumers and also prove that the sky will not fall in for Australian lenders when these reforms come into force. I commend the bill to the House.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (18:29):  By introducing these changes to the National Consumer Credit Protection Act, these amendments form part of a knee-jerk change put forward by this government. Given this Labor government's track record of unsuccessful and bungled delivery of change in Australia, I am understandably apprehensive about the possible outcomes.


The banking sector is one of the most important industries in Australia. Given the world that we live in today, it is of the utmost importance that the services provided by banks deliver the best possible outcomes for consumers. Increased competition within this sector will help to improve these outcomes and deliver better services for all Australians.


However, we must be wary of knee-jerk reactions to perceived problems. Australia's banking sector fared better through the global financial crisis than that of any other OECD country. Whilst we saw massive runs on Northern Rock in the United Kingdom and Bear Stearns in the US, the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, the bailout of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, and the US federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Australian sector, whilst taking a hit, did not teeter on the precipice of destruction like others did around the world.


That was due, in a large part, to our superior regulation system. Of course, the responsible economic management of the Howard-Costello government provided an unparalleled cushion for the Australian economy. However, the system of regulation present in Australia, with both ASIC for financial services and APRA for the banking sector, helped keep us out of the storm.


The dovetailing of these two regulating bodies was real reform of the banking sector in Australia. It was considered and responsible. Whilst the banking sector is in need of review, given the massive changes the world has undergone, we must ensure that any such reform is not knee-jerk and reactionary and that we study and understand the unintended consequences of any such reform.


Measures that this government is proposing, with the stated purpose of consumer protection, could in fact have the exact opposite effect. Banning exit fees, for example, could very well have a detrimental effect on smaller lenders, severely decreasing competition. Such a decrease would further centralise big lenders' purchasing power, leaving the consumer worse off.


The banning of exit fees is a classic example of this government's policy of reaction and it is important to briefly discuss this today as an example of why we must ensure that the current amendments do not follow in the same vein. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, small lenders' market share of mortgages has already fallen, from above 13 per cent in the period pre the global financial crisis 2007, to just 1.2 per cent in February this year. The ability to recuperate the costs of establishing a mortgage through an exit fee penalty is extremely important to a small lender, who has less of an ability to absorb this outlay than the big lenders.


Whilst at face value the banning of exit fees may seem like a popular measure, it is also regarded as a major threat to competition within the sector. Even the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry into banking competition echoed these concerns and recommended that the government re-evaluate the outright ban, which is currently planned to come into effect on 1 July this year. The proposal is a perfect example of how a rash and rushed decision can in fact have unintended consequences and exacerbate a situation rather than fix it. The proposal is a perfect example. 


The amendments put forward today have the usual, distinctive ad hoc Labor feel to them. Australia's strong banking sector should not be put to the test unnecessarily through poorly thought out policy. This is why the coalition has been engaged in the issue of banking reform for a long time. We take competition in the banking sector seriously and support sensible measures to improve the industry.


Some elements of the bill have merit, such as the changes to the hierarchy of payments under credit card contracts, which would facilitate consumers to pay off the transactions with the highest interest rate first. However, it seems that many of the considerations in relation to credit cards are poorly drafted and the concerns of the industry have not been fully addressed.


I am therefore concerned about the lack of clarity within these government proposals. It is particularly apparent with retrospectivity in relation to existing credit contracts. Currently, the bill proposes that the changes being made to credit card regulation apply only to new contracts. That means that current credit card holders would not benefit from the reform. This raises concerns and the government has provided no discussion as to why existing contracts should not be subject to the changes proposed in this bill. If there is a clear reason, be it legal or constitutional, as to why existing contracts should not be included, I call upon the government to make these reasons known.


Additionally, it seems to me that poor drafting now appears to, in effect, allow every new credit card customer to be provided with an automatic 10 per cent limit increase. This clause essentially aims to protect consumers by disallowing lenders to charge high fees for drawing over their limit. However, it is implemented in a confusing way that does not provide simplicity or clarity for the consumer. Also, this 10 per cent default buffer applies to all contracts, unless the customer has chosen to opt out. This, effectively, results in a credit provider having no option but to provide this buffer, whereas it is currently at the lender's discretion to allow or disallow an overdrawn transaction. It essentially locks lenders in to providing 10 per cent more credit, reducing flexibility and potentially having many negative unintended consequences.


This gets to the core of my concern about these amendments. They take away flexibility and assume that, for credit cards, one size can fit all. That is simply not true. By locking lenders in to prescriptive regulation, this bill could unintentionally result in credit providers being forced into acting in a way that does not best suit their customer and these regulations would affect every provider. The customer would no longer have the choice of leaving their current lender in search of a better deal. Given this, I ask the government to truly look at the unintended consequences of this bill. Considering the number of amendments to legislation that have been put before the House this year alone that deal with little more than retrospective clean-ups, it would be much more sensible and efficient for the government to simply get the drafting right in the first place by properly considering these factors.


As well as the abovementioned issues with the provisions in relation to credit cards, I have concerns about the changes to home loan regulation, particularly the time frame the government has set down for these quite time-consuming changes to be made. This will in turn affect the rollout of the key facts sheet, which, under this bill, all mortgage providers must present and provide about their home loans. The proposed key facts sheet is a one-page sheet that provides a summary of a mortgage provider's home loan that can easily be used to compare different institutions' offerings. These key facts sheets are meant to be provided by September this year; however, it is now June, and the government is yet to inform stakeholders as to what is required for these sheets—how they must look, what they must contain and how they will cover fixed-rate loans or lines of credit. This will give providers just two months to create, test and implement the new system and train staff around the country to be competent with this new measure. The credit provider alone is responsible for these key facts sheets. They cannot be managed by a mortgage broker or manager.


The Treasurer has taken almost 12 months to get to this stage of the legislation, which is still riddled with poor drafting and unintended consequences. Yet he is now trying to give the industry just two months to comply, assuming that the legislation receives royal assent this month. Given the harsh penalties that will be enforced if these key facts sheets do not meet the regulatory requirements, a two-month time frame is unrealistic and arrogant and is evidence that the government does not particularly care how its legislation actually affects people. It has regard for superficial  appearances only.


Furthermore, the introduction of a key facts sheet once again assumes that a one-size-fits-all approach will work. It will not. The introduction of such a scheme places an obligation on a whole sector of people, including mortgage brokers and mortgage managers, and imposes very high penalties for a product that is already widely available. A key facts sheet, in reality, is simply an outline of what is potentially available. It is not a finalised assessment based on an individual's situation and cannot be substituted for one. A mortgage is a huge commitment for most people. To believe that reform can come from what is essentially a simple summary sheet is irresponsible, unrealistic and, to be honest, quite a frightening simplification by the Treasurer of a very complex issue.


Whilst the coalition will not oppose this bill, the bill raises real questions as to the government's ad hoc approach to policy. For four years now this government has been short on reform and has broken promise after promise. This is, quite rightly, turning the electorate against them. With these amendments we see a scrambling, haphazard response to an extremely complex issue. This bill highlights the common sense of the coalition's call for a full root-and-branch review of Australia's financial system. I implore the government to take the same approach.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2011-06-21,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Government Whip) (18:41):  I rise to speak in favour of the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011. As an amendment to the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009, which includes the National Credit Code, the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011 gives effect to the government's election commitment in relation to fairer and simpler banking policy. This amendment delivers on the government's election commitment to reduce the information asymmetry—the very one-sided information flow from lenders to consumers—that we have in the industry at the moment.


Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Adams, I know you are well aware of my electorate. As such, you are aware of the issue of housing stress that is currently of significant proportions there. It is not only housing stress that is of concern to people in my electorate. There is also the burden of genuine financial stress. People get in over their heads. Some will take the view that everyone is entitled to make their own decisions, and hopefully they make the best decisions. With this piece of legislation we are trying to ensure that people are provided with the information they need to make decisions—cutting through all the hype, the glamour and the glossy brochures that encourage them to borrow more—that are in their own interest and that of their families and that give them a debt they are able to manage.


It is a simple fact that currently in Australia there are approximately 15 million credit card account holders. Therefore we must strive to have the most efficient, streamlined credit card system to ensure that consumers are not left behind and left vulnerable. We must also aim to improve the consumer relationship, particularly with the banking system, through the elimination of excessive fees. This amendment introduces the requirement that lenders give borrowers a one-page key facts sheet for home loans. The aim of this facts sheet is to ensure that the borrower will have the best possible information when making that home loan decision. Australian families should be able to easily compare the deals offered by the big banks with those of their local credit unions and building societies. This is about transparency.


I must say, it was a vastly different situation when I went to get my first home loan. I recall going to one of the big banks, only to be knocked back. That is how I and my wife, Bernadette, ended up at the building society. Things have not changed that much. Therefore, we are trying to reduce the market capture of the big banks, allowing competition in the system and allowing people to know and understand the true position being offered by the respective financial institutions as well as the consequences and effects of that. As I said, this amendment is about transparency. It is about ensuring that there is clear and concise information available to the consumer. It is our objective to ensure that the consumers are not paying more interest than they should be.


It goes without saying that a home mortgage is one of the biggest financial commitments that most Australians will enter into in their adult lives. It is our responsibility to ensure that they are given the fairest possible deal or arrangement in coming to that decision. We understand that banks must make a profit and must remain profitable. That certainly underpins our economic system. But, at the same time, it is our responsibility to protect everyday families. They are not approaching this as bank executives. They are not sitting as equals at a negotiating table. They are, to some extent, taking what is on offer. We are just going to try to ensure through this piece of legislation that what they are shown as being on offer is written in common-sense language that is understandable such that a family can make a decision as to what is good for them.


The bill provides a balance between making banks and other financial institutions competitive and helping borrowers make the best decisions for themselves and their families. There is no doubt that consumers have a responsibility to be prudent. This does not absolve them of that. But, in short, we are trying through this legislation to give them more access to understandable information to help prudent decision making. We must ensure that they are informed not only about all the opportunities available through the various financial institutions but also, more importantly, about the financial consequences and obligations of entering into various contracts or mortgages.


In recent years the government has successfully streamlined and updated consumer credit laws. Australians now have uniform credit laws applying throughout all states and territories. That provides protection for consumers against unfair treatment. Now it is time to address the national credit laws. Under the proposed changes outlined by the amendment, lenders will be prohibited from sending invitations to borrowers offering increased credit limits. I have received those on many occasions. Anyone who on any occasion has taken out an interest-free loan or something like that knows that if you are disciplined and make the repayments there is no downside. However, if you are slightly less than disciplined—and by 'slightly' I mean missing one repayment or not paying on the exact day—you then incur a significant penalty at a higher interest rate.


One of the things that I have always found so terribly loathsome is the amount of material that you are targeted with by the lending institution in question by simply signing up for one commercial transaction. This seeks to discourage that practice but also to discourage Australian credit card holders from accepting such offers that encourage frivolous spending and mounting up a debt that unfortunately becomes unmanageable. I have been through that with my own kids. I am sure, with the number of credit cards out there—and I have already indicated the number of them—that many members in this place have experienced that too. At one stage one of my children decided to make purchases, and it was fine until they had to be paid back on a given day. I guess it does then fall to mums and dads to come in and help. Maybe this goes to helping mums and dads out a little bit in that process too. My child took this loan out. At the time she approached it from being a knowledgeable university graduate. But when you take these things out, unless there is self-discipline, it is very easy to be caught up in a situation where managing that debt eventually becomes more and more difficult.


As I said, this is trying to give consumers the information they need when they are making those decisions and also drawing their attention to how to make suitable judgment calls about the debt that they are going to have to try to manage. I spoke about being bombarded with the amount of literature you get on these matters. It is bad when you are being bombarded with what is effectively a sales pitch to take on more debt. They gloss it up and make it look more attractive but, at the end of the day, we need people to make decisions as to the management of their debt.


Under the terms of this legislation, lenders will not able to charge fees to customers who go over their credit limit. That is something that used to apply. You would get that in the mail and most people would just pay it. You might complain but mostly you would just pay it. This will now prohibit that from occurring. However, it can be reversed upon the express request of the credit card holder. This is actually transferring a bit of that power. It is putting the consumer in a position to say, 'I want to go above that credit limit,' as opposed to simply going above it and being caught after the event.


With this in mind, lenders will still be able to practise discretion when approving some payments above the credit limit, but this discretion will only be able to be exercised up to a buffer limit of 10 per cent of the consumer's credit card limit. This change to the system signifies an end to most credit limit overdraw fees. That will be a significant change for a lot of people. I understand that nationally it will mean a saving of $225 million annually. That is $225 million that will stay in the pockets of hardworking Australians. In addition to these changes, the government is moving to increase the regulation of lenders in relation to the warning to consumers about making only minimum repayments on their credit card accounts. Consumers need to be kept well informed about the consequences of making only minimum repayments and must be encouraged to make additional monthly contributions. More importantly, lenders will be forced to allocate the additional payments that are being made, in the first instance, to the credit card holder's highest interest debt.


For far too long the banks have had the upper hand. There has been a clear lack of transparency in the information flow between banking institutions and consumers, which has seen too many Australian families get trapped in bad loans and lumped with excessive credit card fees. This initiative gives some power back to individuals, helping them to make the best decisions with their hard-earned money.


I represent an electorate which is very much governed by the number of families who live there. A mortgage is, without doubt, the biggest financial arrangement that people in my electorate enter into. This bill will go a long way towards helping hardworking families make prudent decisions about their finances and helping them take all steps possible to ensure that they do not enter into a bad financial arrangement. I commend this bill to the House.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (18:54):  I rise to speak on the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011, and particularly mention that the coalition might also be introducing amendments. This amendment bill is a significant action by the government to address the complex regulations relative to the areas of consumer credit, including payday lending, credit cards, store credit, investment and small business lending, and personal loans.


The coalition holds a very strong view that our objective and commitment is to ensure constitutional soundness, particularly that implementation arrangements are in place for the referral of consumer credit powers to the Commonwealth by the states. We must all be assured that the national regulation of consumer credit by the Commonwealth provides a thorough and consistent administration that extinguishes the gaps and conflicts that may have existed under the current regime and that it addresses the shortcomings of the current system in protecting all Australians, especially the most vulnerable in our society. 


Protecting consumer rights and meeting the needs of all Australians are essential in building a very strong social fabric. The coalition supports fair, open and competitive markets to provide the very best means of having an open, dynamic, prosperous and equitable society. Government needs to ensure that markets are fair, open and always competitive. We also support a more comprehensive regulatory regime. We support reducing the financial risk and disadvantage to Australian consumers entering into contractual arrangements for credit.


Potentially, the scope and influence of these new laws will affect the majority of this country's adult population. It is currently estimated that in Australia there are over 14 million credit-active individuals. Even people who have utilities—including electricity and gas accounts or mobile phones in their name—are active users of credit. For many people the use of credit is a stark reality in order to survive. They lead a hand-to-mouth existence, with very little margin for error in managing their financial resources. These people are well aware that they are constantly on the brink of, or a pay cheque away from, disaster. 


In today's society it is becoming increasingly difficult to conduct day-to-day transactions without the use of a credit card. In the area of credit cards alone, Australians have a collective debt of a staggering $50 billion. More than two-thirds of this debt is accruing interest every day at an average annual rate of interest of 19.7 per cent—a near 20-year high according to the Reserve Bank. That translates to $7 billion a year paid in interest alone on credit cards. 


There is very wide competition in the financial industry, with more than 174 banks, building societies and credit unions offering some form of high-street financial product. They are all vying for that very important consumer business. This legislation will no doubt result in significant changes in the way that credit providers and credit assistance providers conduct their business. It will also result in changes to the commercial practices of businesses involved in offering, managing and recovering loans and consumer credit contracts. However, there are some very serious concerns about the length of time that the government has provided industry with to comply with the new laws. They have provided very minimal time for industry to provide feedback and to comply with the new laws, particularly in light of the fact that a great deal of the detail in this bill has been deferred to regulation, which has yet to be released by the government. 


This is all the more reason for the government to ensure that this legislation fully and adequately serves the purpose for which it was intended. It is anticipated, and it is absolutely essential, that the introduction of licensing, conduct, advice and disclosure requirements meets the needs of both consumers and businesses alike. This legislation must ensure that consumers are fully protected in their dealings with credit products, and credit providers must ensure that the legislation is clearly communicated and articulated to their customers. We also have an opportunity to liberate the market and encourage more stringent rules on access to credit, but also to cap the rates of interest that can be charged. The coalition holds the view that consumers' interests could be best met by measures which encourage competition within the banking sector, as opposed to the prescriptive regulatory approach for ad hoc issues.


The coalition stands by its call for a full root and branch review into Australia's financial system as part of the nine-point banking plan announced in October last year. There has not been a major review of banking since the Wallis review reported some 13 years ago. This side of the House supports the upgrading of ASIC's enforcement powers to eradicate unscrupulous and misleading practices. Responsible financial industry participants will undoubtedly regard this as an overdue and positive advancement in this area. This will be a challenging and complex undertaking as it covers all major financial institutions and major credit providers, including the banks, the building societies, the credit unions, the finance companies, the retailers and other businesses that offer credit arrangements, as well as the payday lenders.


With many Australians experiencing difficulties in meeting their financial obligations, we must ensure that public education and guidance is available to assist consumers in choosing a course of action when they are having difficulties with payments, which can result in a long-term effect. A consumer's credit history is a foundation of lender decisions and can make the difference between getting a good loan with excellent interest rates and getting a bad loan, declined applications or highly inflated interest rates.


The issue of access to credit for low-income earners is also of great importance. These people continue to require access to available credit and we must ensure that this legislation does not disadvantage this very important sector of the credit market. Often it is the financially disadvantaged in our communities who most need to access short-term financial credit opportunities or products. Within my own electorate of Brisbane, this is also the case for people involved in temporary situations such as those who are recovering from the recent Queensland floods and natural disasters. Some are still waiting for insurance payouts or grants from the government and really need to access these credit facilities desperately.


Whilst we recognise the need to regulate the credit industry to protect consumers from unscrupulous financial credit providers, the coalition is determined to ensure that the providers of the credit are not inhibited by bureaucratic and demonstratively overburdening legislation that denies credit to the people who need it the most. The coalition applauds the advancement of consumer credit reforms in line with the adoption of a national regulatory approach to important social and economic issues. However, we share certain concerns, particularly about ensuring not only that this legislation fully and adequately protects consumers but also that it is not to the detriment of credit service providers.


ASIC must provide the mechanisms for easy access to services such as dispute resolution, where consumers will have access to these services with location, procedural simplicity and affordable costs being absolute priorities. This legislation will have a major impact on any organisation or individual involved in providing, assisting with or enforcing consumer credit, including in areas such as consumer leases and credit for residential property for investment purposes.


Interest rates under the Gillard government have increased seven times since September 2009, increasing repayments on the average mortgage by $477 per month in a little under two years. The truth is the Gillard government has been forced into taking action on financial credit providers and is playing catch-up politics. The best thing that the government could do to provide immediate relief for homeowners and small business is to pursue responsible economic management and wind back its heavy debt fuelled spending to ease the upward pressure on interest rates.


It is our understanding that to implement this COAG decision over $70 million has been allocated over a four-year period and that this funding will be primarily for the establishment of the national licensing regime for providers of credit and credit facilities. ASIC will be the sole national regulator. What has not been identified in the proposed new national regime, however, is the cost associated to providers in procuring these new licences. Perhaps the Treasurer will answer a question at a future time relating to the envisaged costs to credit providers and whether there is a plan to recoup those operating costs over the years ahead with licensing fees. That really needs to be answered.


It would seem logical that whatever increased costs are placed on the financial or credit industry will be passed on to the consumer. We need to ensure that the new legislation does not provide an opportunity for financial businesses to use the legislation as a trigger or a reason to increase lending or credit fees. Australian banks have in the past few years increased the margins that they earn on credit cards, despite following the RBA's lead in other areas of financing. In the world of credit cards, most rate cuts by the central bank were ignored, with additional rate rises instead. Australians are acutely aware of the role of the banks in the escalating cost of credit facilities. Recent media articles and consumer surveys indicate that many Australians are becoming reluctant to increase their credit card debts.


This legislation also encompasses regulation of alternative credit facilities such as payday loans, which are becoming a popular alternative, offering small amounts of credit to those who would normally be ineligible for a credit card. A positive and encouraging trend is emerging with the increased use of debit cards, which are becoming far more popular. In fact, debit card usage has skyrocketed, with most consumers preferring to use their own funds to avoid building up any further debt. This growth in the preference for debit cards is due to the fact that, while they are restricting their credit card potential debt, Australians still owe a fair amount on their credit cards. Credit cards that attract interest rates of around 20 per cent are suggested as being of principle importance to those trying to repay in full, according to financial industry experts, while those on around nine per cent give consumers more room to move.


At a time when this country's tourism industry is working hard to encourage and stimulate our domestic tourism business, some credit card charges, such as those for airfares and taxi trips, incur usage fees by merchants of up to 10 per cent. These charges are further damaging Australia's reputation as an affordable tourism choice both domestically and internationally.


My home state of Queensland was the first state to implement a uniform consumer credit code, which was adopted by other states and territories. It is heartening to witness the coming together of different state and territory legislation and the transfer of financial services into a single, standard national consumer credit law for the benefit of all Australians.


The coalition calls on the government to refer this bill to the House Standing Committee on Economics, because the bill is an unsatisfactory response to perceived issues within the banking industry. We acknowledge that some elements within the bill are worthy of consideration, such as the changes to the hierarchy of payments under credit card contracts. The other sections relating to credit card reform seem to be poorly drafted, and there are industry concerns that have not been addressed. In addition, there are concerns over retrospectivity in relation to the bill applying to existing credit contracts. With further amendments and with properly managed implementation, this legislation has immense potential to have a beneficial effect on the credit and financial industries while ensuring the protection of Australia's consumers.

Mr CRAIG THOMSON
 (Dobell) (19:09):  The opposition are really on their game today in calling for the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011 to be sent to the House Standing Committee on Economics. It actually has been considered by the economics committee. If the member for Brisbane would like to read a copy of the committee's report on the bill, I would be very happy to send her one. It was in fact tabled here last Wednesday. So that was a great contribution by the member for Brisbane and showed her to be really up to speed on the stage the legislation is at. Well done!


This is good legislation because it protects the consumer. The National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011 makes a number of reforms to lenders' practices in relation to home loans and credit cards. For example, it requires lenders to publish key facts sheets for both these types of product, which will make it easier for consumers to compare products. Additional reforms for credit cards prevent lenders sending unsolicited limit increase offers to individuals, unless they elect to receive them; prevent lenders charging fees when a consumer goes over their credit limit, unless the consumer elects to be able to go over their credit limit; and require lenders to pay off consumer debt with the highest interest first, unless the consumer elects otherwise.


The most important reform concerns unsolicited credit card limit increase offers to individuals. During the committee's hearing into the bill there was consistent evidence that aggressive marketing of limit increases by banks was a key reason why some consumers had credit problems. Credit cards have a number of unique features, two of which are high interest rates and the requirement that consumers pay only a small amount each month. Aggressive marketing by banks appears designed to put consumers at the limits of their credit capacity, whereupon the unique features of credit cards mean that individuals are paying interest with little capacity to reduce the principal. While the debt treadmill may be good for bank profits, it has significant social costs. That is why the committee unan­imously supports this bill. Can I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that is a rare occurrence. The committee also supports the bill because it will increase competition in the market and make consumers better off. Therefore, while there will probably be some transition costs for lenders, the increased competition will mean that the extra compliance should have no impact on prices for consumers. Costs for lenders should be further reduced, because many have already voluntarily adopted some of these reforms.


The committee made only two recommendations. One recommendation was that the House pass the bill. The contrib­utions of not just the member for Brisbane but most of those opposite show clearly that they have not read the report, because the other recommendation was that the deadline for financial organisations to have their key facts sheets ready should be moved back from 1 September 2011 to 1 January 2012. The evidence was that, given passage of this legislation, there were some timing issues in relation to that. I understand that the Assistant Treasurer will introduce some amendments in relation to that recom­mendation. The committee, in considering these issues, saw that this is a good bill and that it should be supported, with the one additional recommendation in relation to the facts sheet time line.


As I said, this was a unanimous report, which is rare for the economics committee in this parliament. The House economics committee has followed the pattern we have seen in this parliament, which is that generally all we get from the opposition is 'no'. Even with this legislation we were not quite sure, right up to the death, where the opposition would go on it, but two minutes before the report was tabled we heard that they would support the bill. It shows that even the opposition understood that, if they opposed this bill, they would be condemned out there in consumer land. Unfortunately, the opposition seem to have a different view of consumer rights when it comes to exit fees from banks, which they want to see reintroduced and which we are trying to make sure are not. It is a continuing battle. The primary reason these reforms were needed was in relation particularly to unsolicited credit card limit increase offers. The bulk of the evidence from consumer groups concerned the prevalence of the unsolicited credit card increase offers and their potential to lead customers into the debt trap. Reforms contained in this bill would make it more difficult for customers to take on credit card debt that they are not able to repay. Ms Karen Cox, the coordinator of the Consumer Credit Legal Centre, gave evidence that credit cards have been the most common reason for people seeking assistance for the full 10 years she has been there. She said:


There is no doubt that credit cards are an enormous cause of pressure on families. We have seen countless examples over the years of people on very low incomes who have accepted a series of credit limit increases.


Importantly, the Finance Sector Union of Australia also confirmed that over the past several years their members working in financial institutions have been asked to be part of what they describe as an increase in the number of unsolicited marketing and other letters from financial providers suggesting people should increase their credit limit. 


While the majority of customers pay off their credit card balance monthly, the most profitable customers from the lenders' perspective are those who cannot afford to pay back the full balance every month. Treasury, in their evidence, said that one of the issues with credit cards is that you only have to make minimum repayments, and increases in the credit limit can place you in a position where you are carrying long-term credit card debts without ever necessarily being able to significantly reduce those debts. 


Research by consumer groups shows that banks have aggressively marketed credit cards. Mr Mark Degotardi from Abacus gave evidence that that is what they had seen and noticed. There was a study done in 2009 which showed that 84 per cent of Victorian credit card holders had received an unsolicited credit card limit increase offer. We are seeing almost everyone in Victoria in this particular study being offered an increase.


The study also broke it down into different groups and showed virtually the same rate of credit card limit increase being offered to people who are unemployed—84 per cent of unemployed people in Victoria had been offered an increase; 83 per cent of those studying had been offered an increase; and, 82 per cent of people with a healthcare card had been offered an increase. Banks certainly were not looking at people's capacity to pay; they were looking at ways of maximising profits and using the unique nature of credit cards, which is the high interest rate and the low minimum payment where you pay only part of the interest back and never get to the principal, as being one of the key issues. That is why this government has gone about making sure that we address these issues. We are addressing consumer concerns in a wide range of financial issues including exit fees, which the opposition continue to oppose, but we are doing it particularly in relation to credit cards because of the problems consumer groups continually told us about—the heartbreak of families who have used credit cards to pay bills to get by each month and who, in doing so, get themselves into a worse situation. Almost universally they were getting unsolicited offers to increase their credit limit.


This is an important bill which makes sure consumers are protected. It is part of a range of bills which this government has been introducing to make sure consumers are looked after.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (19:20):  I rise to speak on theNational Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011. In his second reading speech on 24 March this year, the Treasurer said:


I announce new reforms to promote a competitive and sustainable banking system to give every Australian a fair go. 


What the Treasurer failed to mention in his second reading speech was that one of the reasons we need reform to promote a competitive and sustainable banking system is as a result of the Treasurer's monumental blunder in approving the Westpac takeover of St George Bank in 2008. The Treasurer has no excuse. He was aided and abetted by the flawed and misguided advice from the ACCC, an organisation dangerously ignorant of the risks to our nation's long-term economic prosperity, by allowing markets to degenerate into the state of hyper- concentration. For while the test applied by the ACCC to approve a merger is under section 50 of the Trade Practices Act, it is no more than crystal ball gazing to guess if the merger will result in a substantial lessening of competition. The test that the Treasurer applies to such proposed banking mergers arises under section 63 of the Banking Act 1959, which provides that the Treasurer must take the national interest into account when considering such a merger. Simply, the St George-Westpac merger—the removal of St George Bank as an active and aggressive competitor in the market—was not in the national interest and the Treasurer abrogated his responsibility by allowing this merger. It is worth noting that even former Prime Minister Keating has made it clear that he would have never agreed to this merger, due its detrimental effects on competition. But this misguided decision from the Treasurer should not have come as any surprise, for we have seen time and time again that this government possesses the reverse Midas touch—from Ruddbank to GROCERYchoice, to winding back border protection, to the ceiling insulation scandal, the green loans affair and live cattle exports, everything this government touches turns to mush.


The long-term success of our economy and our future economic prosperity rely on increasing our nation's productivity. As history has taught us time and time again, it is small business that drives innovation and productivity improvements, not the big end of town.    As a former vice-chairman of the General Electric Company once noted:


Not a single distinctively new electric home appliance has ever been created by one of the giant concerns—not the first washing machine, electric range, dryer … razor, lawn mower, freezer, air conditioner, vacuum cleaner, dishwasher, or grill. 


These were all created by small and medium sized firms. The success of small business depends upon the ability of small businesses to obtain finance and start-up capital. But when you reduce the number of banks in the market, as the Treasurer did by allowing the St George-Westpac merger, you reduce the number of options for small business to obtain finance and, in doing so, you undermine the long-term economic prosperity of our nation.


The history of business is littered with stories of businesses' successes after being rejected by bank after bank and finally finding a bank that would provide start-up capital and give them a go. I will give just one example. Almost every child in the world has heard of and loves Disneyland. Today, as well as Disneyland in California, there is Disneyworld in Florida and there are Disneylands in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Paris. Over one billion people around the world have visited a Disneyland. Disneyland is one of the great business success stories in history. Yet, when Walt Disney went to the banks to try to get funding for his very first Disneyland, he was rejected by more than 100 banks before finally being accepted. The top executives of the major banks turned Disney down because they thought no-one would come. Just imagine if, at the time, some misguided fool had swallowed, hook, line and sinker, the merger buzzwords of 'synergies', 'greater economies of scale' and 'improved efficiency' and allowed a series of mergers whereby Walt Disney only had four major banks to turn to—the current situation in Australia. The Disneyland that is known and loved throughout the world would never have come into existence.


We will never know what new products, new inventions and new jobs will fail to come into existence, killed before they were born because of the deluded theory which underpinned the Treasurer's allowing the St George-Westpac merger, thereby reducing the number of banks in the market which small business can seek to obtain finance from. We will never be able to compute the price that all of us will pay and how our standard of living will be lower than it would otherwise have been because of the Treasurer mistakenly allowing our banking sector to become more concentrated.


As the Treasurer scratches his head, befuddled as to why productivity in the nation has stagnated under his watch, he need look no further than the damage being done to our small business sector by our overly concentrated banking sector. History has shown time and time again that small business plays the leading role in the experimentation and innovation that lead to technological change and drive productivity growth. If you attack small business, as this Labor government has done time after time, if you make it more difficult for them to obtain finance, as this government has done, you will retard productivity growth.


Over the past few years, we have witnessed an unprecedented increase in concentration in our banking sector. The problem is not only the reduction in the options of small business to obtain finance; it is also the increasing interest rate margins that small businesses pay and the fees and charges that they are being slugged with. Figures from the RBA confirm that the big banks have now become parasitic on the small business sector. The banks are simply gouging small business on interest rate margins. 


It is not only interest rate margins that small business are being gouged on. Late last week, we had the RBA release further data exposing how the banks are ripping off business, as these figures showed that the banks had massively increased fees and charges to businesses—by 14 per cent, to hit a record $6.87 billion—and this increase came despite business borrowing actually falling. So the banks are actually loaning less but they are taking more. This is the classic test of an uncompetitive market.


If the Treasurer wants to give every Australian a fairer go in regard to banking, he should be tackling the huge problem in our banking industry, and that is the penalty fees and charges imposed by the big banks. Although there has been a slight recent decline in bank fees charged to consumers, which the banks have made up for by slugging businesses, according to a 2009 report by Fujitsu Consulting, Australian bank customers pay the Western world's highest bank fees. The report's author states: 


A lack of competition in Australia meant local banks were collecting $5 billion in fees from consumers, making them the most expensive in the western world.


The report's author goes on:


The average household is, in our view, paying up to $200 more each year than they should thanks to the wide range of fees and charges levied in Australia, and to the lower levels of competition in the market.


The real concern that this government should be tackling is that many of these fees and charges imposed by the banks are possibly unenforceable. It is a well-established legal principle that a contractual term—




Mr Craig Thomson:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We have been going nine minutes on this contribution. The member has not addressed one issue in relation to this bill. He has not been on the topic at all. He has had a complete spray. It is time he was brought back to what the bill is actually about.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. DGH Adams
):  The honourable member for Hughes will address the bill.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  I am talking about bank fees. The real concern is that many of the measures this bill proposes to regulate the fees and charges imposed by the banks are possibly unenforceable, for it is a well-established legal principle that a contractual term which requires one party to the contract to pay the other 'innocent' party a sum of money upon default or breach of that contract is only enforceable if it provides that the sum is a genuine pre-estimate of the loss or damage suffered by the innocent party. If the fee is inflated to a level where it does not represent a genuine pre-estimate of loss or damage suffered, it is a penalty and is unenforceable at common law.


In our democracy only the government can issue penalties, not the big four banks. The possible illegality of many forms of bank fees that this bill attempts to regulate is something that a well-resourced ACCC should have been looking at.




Mr Craig Thomson:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I have the same point of order. You have been very generous to the member. Far be it from me to defend the banks, but we have had a 10-minute spray against the banks. Not one part of this contribution has gone to what a very important piece of consumer protection legislation this is. It is time the member be brought back to what this bill is about.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. DGH Adams
):  The bill is the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011. I ask the honourable member for Hughes to address the bill before the chamber.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. This bill addresses the issue of bank fees and charges to consumers and that is the issue that I am addressing. The question is the possible illegality of many forms of these bank fees, and that is something that a well-resourced ACCC should have been looking at, especially remembering that Australian consumers pay the highest bank fees in the Western world. But, as usual, the ACCC were asleep at the wheel on this issue—and no wonder, because the ACCC have been more interested in spruiking government policy.


As if to highlight the inaction of the ACCC on bank fees and charges, the UK Office of Fair Trading, the UK's equivalent of our ACCC, have been taking an active and vocal role in standing up for consumers by dragging the banks through the courts to challenge the legality of many of their fees. While the ACCC have closed their eyes, one might ask: where is the government's minister on competition? It would help if this government even had a competition minister. Following the disastrous stints of the members for McMahon and Rankin as failed competition ministers, this government no longer even has a competition minister. So, despite all the problems we have with competition in Australia, with the grocery duopoly punishing consumers—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! I ask the honourable member to come back to the bill. The bill deals with credit card protection and matters dealing with information for consumers. It does not go to a lot of the points that the honourable member is dealing with. This is not an appropriation bill, on which a wide-ranging debate is allowed; it is a bill dealing with a narrower matter. I ask the honourable member to come back to the bill.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. This bill addresses the issue of fees and charges, how they should be regulated, how they should be listed and what information consumers could have about them, and they are the issues that I am addressing.


Since the ACCC and the government have dropped the ball on looking at and regulating these fees and charges, it has been left to a private law firm to run a class action test case seeking to prove that many of the banks' fees and charges that this bill seeks to regulate are in fact unlawful penalties that may have to be refunded. This case is already proceeding before the courts and involves over 27,000 individuals and businesses, holding 40,000 personal and business accounts, acting against the ANZ, attempting to recoup over $50 million worth of unenforceable penalties that the bank has gouged from consumers.


This bill simply misses the mark. It fails to address the problems in our overly concentrated Australian banking sector, a sector which has now become so highly concentrated and so big that the big four banks are all too big to fail, whereby they require special regulation to protect them from the forces of competition. This bill does little to improve a competitive and sustainable banking system and it fails in its aim to give every Australian 'a fair go'. It fails to address the gouging of small business and consumers by the banks. That is why it is correct that the bill was sent off to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics and that is why the government should support the coalition's call for a root-and-branch review of Australia's financial system.

"Symon, Mike, MP",ALP,2011-06-21,"



Mr SYMON
 (Deakin) (19:35):  Unlike the member for Hughes, who has just spent 15 minutes talking about anything but what is in the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011, I speak in support of the bill. It is part of the Labor government's commitment to reforming the Australian banking sector. This bill will amend the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 to improve competition and provide better support for Australian consumers. This bill will affect credit card and home loan providers, ensuring they provide better information to consumers, and the provisions detailed in this bill will limit some of the worse practices of the banking sector in these areas.


The RBA credit and charge statistics table Cl reports that in April 2011 there were 14,853,000 credit card accounts in Australia. In that month alone there were 2,108,000 cash advances, to a total of $811 million, and there were 126,383,000 purchases, with a total value of over $17 billion. Repayments for the month were $19.25 billion and balances of $36.39 billion were accruing interest—a huge amount when you think about it. The total credit limit in April 2011 for both drawn and undrawn credit cards was $134.9 billion. Families and individuals Australia wide rely on their credit cards to smooth out unforeseen costs and provide an important safety net. Credit cards for many people are a necessary part of their household budget and can be of great benefit. Some people do use credit cards wisely and are able to pay them off in time, and they see the benefit because they do not pay the fees, they do not pay the interest, but not everyone has that advantage. There is a danger that the consumer's level of credit card debt can exceed their capacity to manage it.


As a member of this House I—and, I am sure, many other members as well—quite often deal with people who are in these situations and I have to refer them to local services because of the dire straits they are in. In many cases it comes back to credit cards. In many cases the journey from sustainable to unsustainable credit card debt is being helped by the practices of Australia's banks. Consumers usually take on a credit card with a limit that they can cope with, a credit limit that enables them to deal with unforeseen costs and yet is manageable so that any debts accumulated can be cleared up in a reasonable time. At a later date, the consumer may receive a letter in the mail from the bank offering them a preapproved increase in their limit, and I am sure most of us have seen that many times. I have certainly received many such letters over the years. With a form such as that, all it needs is a signature. It can be faxed or mailed off and—bingo!—the credit limit has been increased, sometimes by many thousands of dollars and sometimes by even more.


For a family under pressure, if the bills are mounting and their credit card is getting close to its current limit, you pretty much know what is going to happen next. That form gets signed. It gets sent off. The new limit is in place and it is then used. Of course, the customer, the borrower, who has gone up to the max on the old credit card limit and has not been able to pay it off has even less chance of paying off a card with a higher limit.


Banks have been widely condemned for the practice of sending unsolicited invitations to increase credit card limits, and I think it is right that this bill addresses that. There are certainly some people in situations that can cope with increased credit card limits, but I think banks should also carry some responsibility when those are being offered.


A typical credit card interest cost is often more than 20 per cent per annum. For some cards it is less; they have different conditions. But there are certainly a lot of cards that have that rate or more. It only takes an outstanding balance of $10,000 on a credit card to see $2,000 a year go up in interest and not one cent applied to the amount that has been loaned via the credit card. Many people unfortunately fall into that trap and spend a large amount of their income paying off interest for purchases that in many cases they have already used or consumed. As we often hear, having large debts can have a devastating effect on families. Credit card debt can make people feel stressed, frustrated and overwhelmed and even leads to health problems. A lot of mental stress can come about from that type of situation with a tight budget.


Data from the Reserve Bank showed that total credit card debt in Australia was $48.6 billion in November 2010. At that time, there was a total credit limit of $133 billion. As I mentioned before, it has gone up slightly since then. Of that $48.6 billion in November 2010, 77 per cent was rolled over from month to month, as most people had not paid off their credit cards in full. When you think about that, that is 77 per cent of those cards having interest paid on them—lots of interest. Of course, it is the banks' right to charge interest; it is their product. But it is also a question of how people have got this credit available to them, and this bill addresses some of those issues. The growth in credit card debt over the past decade has been nothing short of spectacular. Just as an example, from January 2000 until July 2010 the total amount of credit card debt outstanding in Australia rose by 320 per cent. The continual rise in the level of credit card debt is a concern, and this legislation is aimed at helping consumers reduce their levels of debt.


For some local examples, I turn to a service I know rather well in my electorate of Deakin, because my electorate, just like every other electorate, is affected by people who get into financial trouble. Eastern Access Community Health, who have a social and community service based in and around Ringwood, in my electorate, also have a financial service there. They are very good at dealing with locals with financial crises and are able to put them on the right track. That service is funded with federal government support, which is a good thing. That started as part of the global financial crisis, back in 2009. The Labor government at the time provided $80.4 million of additional money for emergency relief and financial counselling which ran from 1 March 2009 until 30 June this year. In the electorate of Deakin this funding supported an additional two financial counsellors who were employed at EACH. As I said, they provide support for members of the community who may be experiencing financial difficulty.


The good news is that in the recent budget it was announced that the 77 full-time financial-counselling positions established during the global financial crisis will continue to be funded, with an extra $28 million over the next four years. That is a great thing for not only my electorate of Deakin but, as I said, everyone else's electorates, where these problems have arisen.


In particular I would like to mention Deborah Graham. She is one of the financial counsellors at EACH, and she advises that, in every case that she has dealt with of severe financial hardship, extensive credit card debt has been the problem. She advises me that, in all of her current cases, her clients started with much lower credit limits and that they increased their limits after they accepted unsolicited bank offers. One of the examples she provided involved an individual on a Centrelink income who has cards from three different banks with credit limits of $4,000, $2,000 and $4,000 respectively. In each case the bank offered to increase the limits of their cards from an earlier lower limit. Over a period of time the debts got higher until they got to the point where help had to be sought. It was unsustainable. The credit card debt spiralled out of control, past any ability of that client to pay it back on the income they were receiving. Deborah is now working with that client to help manage those debts, but it is not a situation that should become a matter of course. It should be the exception, and it should not be made easy to get into that situation. The message Deborah gave to me is that this legislation will make a real difference in helping to keep people out of financial distress. Banning the practice of unsolicited offers of extra credit limits will help people operate within their limits. 


As well as banning the practice of unsolicited pre-approved credit limit increases, this bill will stop banks providing debt above the agreed credit limit and then charging penalties for this so-called service. As part of this reform the government recognises that lenders may need some discretion to approve certain payments which go over the credit limit, and I think that is valid if it is for an essential service. It is valid in the interest of a borrower to see that their gas or their power does not get cut off simply because it has been paid off with a credit card maybe at the wrong time of the billing cycle. Although the credit level will be able to exceed the total limit, this legislation will ban the current practice of charging a penalty plus interest for exceeding that limit. The interest will still be there, as I said before. That is money borrowed. The penalty for the bank is just cream on top. These types of penalties can be very frustrating for customers who accidentally exceed their limit. Many times there seems to be no correlation at all between the penalty charged and the so-called inconvenience to the bank. The two scales are way different. 


For those who are in severe financial hardship, the removal of these penalty fees can help them gain control of their own debt and ensure the amounts they are paying are not spiralling out of control even further. Currently many banks will charge consumers anywhere between $20 and I am told up to $95 each month while the debt sits above the credit limit. These penalties make it even harder for people to dig themselves out of debt. The customer is often paying 20 per cent interest or more on the outstanding amount and on top of this they are incurring regular fees and penalties for exceeding their limit. The Reserve Bank of Australia, in its June quarter 2011 Bulletin, advised that fees on exceeding credit card limits, including late payments, totalled $301 million for the year to 30 June 2010. It is estimated that Australians could save around $225 million annually from the banning of fees and penalty rates for exceeding credit limits. Banning these fees will empower consumers to deal with their debt levels and not face additional costs at the time they can least afford it. 


Another aspect of the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment Bill 2011 is that it will require lenders to allocate repayments to higher interest debts first, so families do not pay more interest than they should. Currently, bank customers do not have any control at all over how their repayments on credit cards are allocated. Some credit providers allocate repayments under their credit card contracts in a way that can maximise the amount and time required for the customer to repay the debt on their credit card. The customer's money is often used to pay off parts of the loan which are actually only incurring low or sometimes even no interest. Each bank and each financial institution that issues cards has different conditions and quite often they have different conditions for different types of cards issued by the same institution. Many people simply do not understand what they are paying or the how or the why or the when as to which part of their debt is getting paid. Other countries have been able to bring in legislation to ensure that the highest interest rate debt is paid first. I think this is a great step forward that we are now proposing to do this in Australia. 


Very importantly, on top of that, this bill will also make it mandatory for credit card statements to advise customers not to pay just the minimum amount, which is very easily done. The statement comes out and it has a figure on there. If you pay that you do not hear any more from the bank until the next month and you get another statement. But if you are paying the minimum amount your chances of paying off your loan from the bank are virtually nil. You will probably never get there in a working lifetime. The minimum amounts are very low. 


Also contained in this bill is a provision that will make it mandatory for credit providers to provide a key facts sheet to consumers before entering a credit card contract. This change will allow customers to compare different credit card products more easily and have a better understanding of how to use their credit cards more efficiently. I would hope that minimises the amount they have to pay in both fees and interest. 


In addition to introducing the key facts statement, this bill also runs in parallel with the reforms that are part of the federal government's commitment to reform the banking system and to promote competitive and sustainable practices. These reforms include the federal government's ban on mortgage exit fees which the Liberal and National parties are trying to torpedo this very day in the Senate, I understand. Banning exit fees on mortgages will help boost competition in the home loan market over time by giving consumers the ability to swap banks without facing the financial burden of exit fees. If the Liberals have their way, it will be families who get it in the neck, not the big end of town. I commend this bill to the House.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (19:50):  I sit on the Standing Committee on Economics and this bill seeks to introduce major changes to the relationship between credit providers and consumers in respect of credit cards and home loans. It forms part of the banking reforms announced by the government designed to empower consumers, to support smaller lenders and to secure the flow of credit to our economy. In principle we do support this bill. However, there are some points raised during taking evidence and listening to witnesses that it is prudent for me tonight to pass on so that we have an entirety. This bill is going to need constant massaging and constant monitoring as its implementation has an impact on the market. 


The bill has a provision to introduce a requirement for lenders to produce a key facts sheet for standard home loans. We do not have a problem with that. The more information we can give a consumer to make a value decision the better. The downside to the fact sheets is that there will be an extra cost, an extra imposition on the banks, and undoubtedly the banks will pass that on. I do not see the banks shifting to an environment where their fine print will become less. It will be just another layer of administration. Notwithstanding that, I think there is substantial benefit in people being made aware of their financial responsibilities. The facts sheet would set out in a standardised format pricing and other information about their products, allowing consumers to readily compare different home loans. The banks will be encouraged to actually personalise the data for the client so that they will be able to shop apples against apples.


Also, the bill tends to regulate the circumstances in which borrowers can exceed their credit limit on their credit card and prohibits fees being charged by the credit provider when they do so, except when the consumer has adopted to have a higher buffer on which they can be charged fees. I do not get this, because the body of this bill speaks to protecting consumers with credit card debt from unsolicited invitations, but this part of the bill, with reference to a buffer, is something that I struggle with. If we are trying to restrict unsolicited limits to credit card holders, providing a buffer for the consumer is exactly the juxtaposed position of what the body of this bill speaks to. So whilst it is in there I will speak to it, but I definitely have concerns, unless I have misinterpreted it.


The bill also speaks to specifying a hierarchy of payments made under credit card contracts, requiring credit providers to allocate repayments by the borrower to that part of the balance of the credit card on which they have charged the highest interest rate, unless they have elected to make different payment arrangements. With most of the standard credit cards there are default or higher components of your credit card expenditure that are exposed to greater interest payments. For example, if you get a cash advance on your credit card you may be paying an extra two or three per cent or a fee to get that cash advance. So, when you go to make your minimum monthly payment the bill intends that the payment will be calculated to offset higher amount of outstanding funding. This part of the bill does make sense. Hopefully, it will reduce some of the burdens for consumers.


This bill speaks to restricting credit providers from making unsolicited invitations encouraging borrowers to increase their limits and credit cards, except when consumers have consented to receiving such offers. We have all seen the volume of such mail that comes through our letterboxes. If you have, or have had, a credit card the banks have taken a position of going out and soliciting increases in limits. My concern was—and I will give my defence of the banks later on in my speech—that the banks make these unsolicited offers, such as increasing a person's limit from $500 to $5,000, without being diligent enough about the capacity requirement or in their evaluation. Enormous cost-of-living pressures are being borne by society as a result of the fiscal management of this country at the moment. There are people in my electorate who are on their knees. Credit card payments and expenditure are the ways in which they are keeping their heads above water. They are paying their energy bills, kids school fees and buying fuel for their car on their credit card. Some of them are actually buying their weekly groceries on credit cards. When you have cost-of-living pressures mounting up to the back teeth and you have an offer from the bank to increase your credit limit from $500 to $5,000, it's Christmas! You are not a logical rational thinking person when it comes to taking up that option. As a result we have this pain in the marketplace.


We heard this from Consumer Action Law Centre and the Consumer Credit Legal Centre, who gave evidence. Some of the stats they referred to were that out of all the people they were dealing with who had credit card default problems 60 per cent had one credit card and 40 per cent had multiple cards. I thought that was an interesting statistic to share with you. We would probably not have to be dealing with this legislation as aggressively as we are if we had stronger fiscal responsibility and the cost-of-living pressures in society were not as intrusive as they are at the moment.


The last point the bill speaks to is an introduction of a requirement for lenders to provide a key facts sheet for credit card contracts. The bill makes it mandatory for credit card providers to include in credit application forms key information about annual percentage rates and other terms that would apply to a contract. This part of the bill just speaks to a mandatory note on your credit card bill alluding to the fact that if you continue to make the minimum monthly payment on your credit card your term for the outstanding balance should be shown. So, on a standard $5,000 credit card, if you make a minimum account balance payment you could be entering into a term of up to 15 to 20 years to pay back that debt. Passing that information to the consumer will hopefully motivate people to reduce their debts quicker.


One of the issues raised by the parties in relation to the consultation process was the short time frame permitted for submissions to be made. I have some dates here. The exposure draft was released by Treasury on 4 March. Given the importance of this bill and the number of people it affects, it was a little unfair that the closing date for submissions was—wait for it—8 March. Treasury put it out on Friday the 4th; then there was the weekend and Monday. This had to be submitted by Tuesday, 8 March—way too short a time for consideration and for the market and stakeholders to respond. The Australian Bankers Association articulated a concern that the banking industry has not been able to fully assess the potential impact or the likelihood—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Order! It being 8 pm I have to interrupt the member for Wright. He will understand. Earlier today the honourable member for Fadden drew the attention of the Speaker to the state of the House. In accordance with standing order 55(c) I will count the House if the member so desires. I invite the member for Fadden to indicate whether he requires a count of the House to be taken.




Mr Robert:
  My desire has eluded me, Madam Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Surprise, surprise! I thank the member for Fadden. The member for Wright has the call.




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I was just alluding to the fact that the Australian Bankers Association articulated a concern that the banking industry had not been able to fully assess the potential impact or the likelihood of unintended consequences of the new rules. Predominantly, that was as a result of the time frame that they had to work with. Groups also broadly shared the concern that, as many of the substantive provisions would be included in this regulations, comprehensive comments on the policy detail were not possible at this stage of the legislation. Predominantly that speaks to the lack of substantial regulation included in this bill. 


Often you will hear us, as the opposition, oppose. We oppose policy that is put up for a very good reason: often it is pretty ordinary policy. But on this particular occasion I am more than happy not to oppose it but to support it. I can see the intent. (Quorum called)While we have the members of the government in the House, this is the first time that we have actually supported a bill and you called a quorum. I was actually speaking for your motion. That is how disconnected you guys are from reality. It was bad policy, but I could see that you were having a go. I could see your intent. 



Government members interjecting—




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  You guys have just absolutely lost it. For the first time you can no longer say no, no, no, no. You guys have just screwed this one. You have taken it the wrong—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Wright is trying my patience. He will refer to the bill.




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  I am sorry, Madam Deputy Speaker. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The members will leave the chamber.




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  With 29 seconds to go I have shown my intent to support the legislation. However, sometimes the standard practice of this House is quite confusing to a new member.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (18:04):  I am pleased to rise on the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011, not because I am fervently in support of the bill but more broadly because I believe in policy measures that in broad terms are supportive of improving consumer protection and enhancing consumer transparency. When it comes to the single biggest credit items that affect most consumers and most people in the community, home loans and credit cards are among them. That said, the government's bill that is currently before the House is not a bill that the coalition will be opposing, although it is also not a bill that we are completely supportive of.


The reality is that, in typical Labor fashion, the bill that is before the House wades its ugly way into the marketplace and sets about ensuring that there are a whole raft of new legislative protections, as they are labelled, to try to policy-manage and effectively legislate their way to a better market outcome. The question is: could this have been achieved through other methods? We had raised a number of concerns when the first iteration of this bill was put before the Australian public. We raised concerns about the approach that Labor was adopting. At the time the government said that our concerns could not be incorporated into the legislation because they would have undermined and eroded the value of the legislation as the Labor Party saw it.


What we have seen though, following an inquiry into this particular bill by House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, a committee of which I have the great fortune of being deputy chair, is that a number of the recommendations the committee has put forward and a significant amount of the evidence that came forward from witnesses before the committee have now been incorporated at the eleventh hour into the bill before the chamber this evening. So it has come to pass that a large number of the reforms which were sought by the coalition and which were ruled out by the Labor Party have now been incorporated into the legislation which we are currently debating. That said, though, in broad terms—let me stress that it is in broad terms—I am supportive of measures that are contained within the bill to do a number of key things. The first is the requirement for lenders to provide key facts sheets for standard home loans as well as for credit cards. These are important measures which enhance consumer protection insofar as they provide what is effectively a ready reckoner. The reality is that consumers receive great wads of information. My constituents on the Gold Coast in my seat of Moncrieff and all of us in this chamber know that when you have interactions with banks, when you have dealings with financial houses, you receive wads and wads of paper: statements of advice, policy disclosure statements and all those types of items. To be able to distil it down to its most basic elements, which is effectively what the key facts sheet does, is a welcome addition to the arsenal that consumers have when it comes to determining which is the best home loan or credit card, what the pitfalls are and what the various charges associated with that credit card or home loan are. In that respect I welcome it.


There are of course some other reforms that have been made with respect to prescribing rules for approval of the use of credit cards above their credit limit, specifying an allocation hierarchy for payments made under credit card contracts and restricting credit providers from making unsolicited invitations to borrowers to increase the credit limit of their credit card—as well as introducing a requirement for lenders to provide a key facts sheet for credit cards, as I said. A number of these subelements of the legislation are important because they have a material impact on the functioning of credit providers. In particular, one is straightforward and is supported by this side—that is, the specification of an allocation hierarchy for payments made under credit card contracts. It is certainly worthwhile that there be an allocation hierarchy such that repayments made on credit cards go to paying down the debt that attracts the highest interest rate. That is a smart step. It is a step that we are supportive of. It is a step that is proconsumer and therefore of benefit.


But also contained within this legislation are issues of concern. One of them, which has now been amended at the eleventh hour, was about rules surrounding the use of credit cards above their credit limit. I am Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Economics. We heard evidence from a number of witnesses that highlighted their concern about what the impact of Labor's legislation would have meant. In the first instance—this was an obvious concern and one that I raised with witnesses as well—was the issue about whether, as a consequence of Labor's legislation, we would see a situation where credit providers provided a higher than usual credit limit to a customer, expecting that subsequently they would be unable to raise the credit limit unless they had jumped over all the hurdles that this legislation effectively put before them. The clear and unequivocal answer from witnesses was: yes, the consequence that was most likely as a result of this legislation would have been a higher initial credit limit. So one could rightly wonder why the Labor Party was undertaking this.


Certainly, as with many things Labor attempts to do, it is driven by a sense of purity, I guess, in some respects about the outcome that is being sought. The reality is, though, that the application is often worse than the affliction which Labor is attempting to address in the first instance. That was the case with the original iteration of this legislation. Now that has been amended so that consumers can give their consent to there being, for example, additional fees and charges associated with going over their credit limit as well as with respect to the way a credit limit is assigned in the first place. In that sense, I am pleased that the Labor Party has seen the common sense that was put forward by the coalition and incorporated those changes into the legislation.


A second aspect of this that causes me some concern is with respect to so-called unsolicited invitations. As a matter of principle, I do not really understand why we feel it necessary for there to be legislation with respect to unsolicited invitations. The reality is that anyone who watches some television, listens to some radio or reads some newspapers sees advertising for all manner of products and services. It is part of daily life. When you drive in your car, you see billboards. When you turn on the television, you see advertisements. We are not compelled to race out and purchase all those items as a consequence of seeing advertising. Indeed, for the manufacturers and service providers that are advertising in a market economy, I think it is part of their routine business. In fact, I think most people have become desensitised to a large extent to advertising. Yet for some reason the Labor Party takes the view in this legislation that we are able to withstand advertising in all manner of other things but not when it comes to credit card limits. When it comes to credit card limits, apparently we are all suckers and immediately sign up to increasing our credit limit on our credit card.


Given that there are criminal sanctions under the legislation, at least in its first iteration, which apply as a result of an unsolicited invitation to increase your credit limit, you have to start scratch your head about whether or not this is a little heavy-handed. My personal view is that it is heavy-handed. My personal view is that it is crazy to be saying to financial lenders, 'Don't you dare provide an unsolicited credit offer, because if you do that then you're in breach of the legislation, and if it is a personal employee they're in breach of the legislation and potentially subject to criminal sanctions.' It is madness. Why is it that consumers apparently have the ability to discern what they should consume when it comes to other products and services but they cannot do it with respect to credit cards? I think it is one bridge too far. I think it is unnecessary. In that sense, I certainly have some concerns. It also lacks common sense.


Again, a key part of the testimony from witnesses before the committee when we undertook the inquiry related to whether or not it was commercially sound for a financial lender to lend a consumer more money than that consumer was able to pay back. Of course the answer is no. That is not a sustainable business model. The reason most borrowers are not in a situation to repay their debts is typically because of a life-changing event like the loss of employment. That typically is the reason why people get themselves in hot water, and it is often unforeseen. Given that that is the key driver of many of the defaults, especially of credit card borrowers, you have to question why this subelement of this legislation is necessary. Given that it is commercially unsound to do it, and therefore you would assume that there is not a demand in the marketplace for it, why would it happen?


That is not to say that there are not some fly-by-night operators, and there has been some evidence that there has been at a very minor level. So again the question is: why regulate an entire industry when you are attempting to address a very small percentage of those that are effectively, for lack of a better term, breaking the rules and operating in an unsustainable way? That notwithstanding, I guess it does provide the opportunity for the Labor Party to beat their chests and claim they are all about the consumer and all about empowering people. But what consumers need to know is that they end up paying for all this red tape, they end up paying for all these protections, they end up paying in some way, shape or form for all of the compliance that is associated with all of these additional regulations. It is consistent with the big government approach of the Labor Party.


However, I outline, as I said, that there are a number of aspects that I am broadly supportive of, especially with respect to the key fact sheets and particularly with relation to the allocation hierarchy for payments. In that sense, whilst I certainly do not commend the bill, as a member of the opposition I am also not totally opposed to it.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2011-06-21,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (18:15):  I rise to speak in support of the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011 and note the support, broadly speaking, of the member for Moncrieff. I commend him on his contribution. I am sure that when the Turnbull tide returns he will be promoted to the front bench.




Mr Bowen:
  Shadow Treasurer.




Mr PERRETT:
  Yes, shadow Treasurer perhaps. This bill delivers on our election commitment to get a better deal for consumers with credit cards. Any Labor member or anyone representing any seat knows that this is a huge issue. Whilst it is very easy for the member for Moncrieff to talk about pure markets and ability to say no to advertisements, the reality is that with credit it is a slightly different market. It is a bit like the carbon price: there are some times when the market does achieve the best things and occasionally we need to have the hand of government in there. 


I note that in April this year there were 14.8 million credit cards in circulation in Australia, with a total credit limit of almost $135 billion. In April the credit card debt of Australians was $49.3 billion and Australians made many millions of purchases on their credit cards. I would like to go on the record and note that less than half of those purchases in April were from my wife!




Mr Bowen:
  Is she listening?




Mr PERRETT:
  I am hoping not. And in April we had the Easter holidays, so there was at least one day when most of the shops were closed down. But still there were all those purchases. That credit card debt in April was $49.3 billion and if you go back to December you have that Christmas spike when it was up to $158.9 billion. So obviously credit cards are an important part of their daily lives for many people.


The legislation before the House is not about bashing the banks but is about ensuring that we have a regulatory framework in place to protect consumers from excessive fees. It also gives them greater control over how much they borrow. Rather than just let the market rip, it is important to have controls and some checks and balances. This is in response to growing community concerns about some bank behaviours and this bill therefore amends the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009. Firstly, the bill changes the way banks apply credit limits. Currently banks allow credit accounts to exceed credit limits and then charge an over-limit free. These fees alone cost consumers $225 million a year. With about 22 million Australians, that is about $10 each just in the over-limit fees. This bill limits the amount credit accounts can go over to 10 per cent above the credit limit and abolishes the fee when they do. Consumers can also opt out of this buffer if that is best for them or they can negotiate a larger buffer, which would be subject to a fee. This measure strikes the right balance. It prevents banks from slugging consumers with excessive over-limit fees and empowers consumers to choose whether they can go over their limit. As I said, at the moment there is about $10 in fees for every man, woman and child in Australia. Hopefully not everyone in Australia has a credit card, but still it is a significant amount. This bill also requires credit card lenders to allocate repayments to a consumer's higher interest bearing debts first. As we know, that stops the compounding effect to a slight extent. It overturns the practice of lenders allocating repayments first to debts with the lowest rate. It is expected that this could save consumers around $360 a year, depending on their spending habits. 


This bill also includes measures to help protect consumers from excessive debt. It does so by banning unsolicited credit limit extension offers being sent to credit card holders. I did a bit of a survey today, knowing that I was going to deliver this speech, to find someone that had not been given a credit card offer. Irrespective of your income, how many people have been made these offers? This is just my little snap survey, admittedly—I did not wander into the Liberal Party room today and talk to them—but the norm seemed to be that people's credit limit was doubled as a matter of course. They were able to immediately double what they were able to rack up. Now lenders will not be able to send offers to extend credit limits unless consumers have already agreed to receive these offers. To placate the concerns of the member for Moncrieff, you will still be able to tick the box and be sent offers if you are comfortable with that.


We all know it is quite enticing the way these offers are sent out. In Catcher in the Rye Holden Caulfield talked about the fact that everyone wants to be in a club and the more exclusive the club the better people feel about themselves—so the bronze club, the silver club, the gold club, the platinum club—and sometimes it is a case of offering to change you from a gold to a platinum, yet it does not really change anything except the colour of the card, but people mistakenly feel they are in a more exclusive club. I am not sure what sorts of colours and metals they progress on to, but everyone likes an exclusive club and the people who offer credit cards understand that. It is a bit like Calvin in Calvin and Hobbes offering to build a cubbyhouse only for boys. This will provide some protection for consumers, who can easily end up with a credit limit they cannot afford. We all know that if someone receives a credit card offer at the same time as losing their job or their circumstances change they may make a short-term decision that will get them out of trouble for a few payments but obviously, in the long term, at the higher interest rates that are attached to the credit cards, the debt chases hardship and ends up compounding the problems.


This bill also introduces a new requirement for lenders to include on credit card application forms a facts sheet with a clear summary of key account features. This is a long overdue measure that will give consumers important information including the annual fee; the interest rates on purchases, cash advances and promotional offers; and other relevant fees. We have all been sent the product disclosure statements, but if we did a survey I wonder how many people, including lawyers, would have actually read all of the product disclosure statements they receive in the mail. It would be a very small percentage I would suggest. It should be incumbent upon banks to ensure that their customers are fully informed about this kind of information so they can make an informed choice when selecting a credit product. The clear summaries are a great feature. This information should not be buried in complex terms and conditions booklets but should be made obvious to consumers as part of the application process. In the past I have gone through the PDS and crossed out the odd paragraph every now and then and returned it. I have done it a couple of times and never actually received any comment back from the people. So, maybe consumers are not reading it and the people who send out the information are also not reading it. The key facts sheet mandated by this bill will ensure more appropriate disclosure to consumers. (Quorum formed)


I promise I will not say nice things about the member for Moncrieff again, if that was the reason for the quorum call!


The bill requires lenders to provide a key facts sheet to set out the costs of home loans to allow consumers to more easily compare home loan products.


It is no surprise the banking sector is not overwhelmingly behind this bill. The Australian Bankers Association have come out swinging, but I do not think we need worry too much about our banks or lose too much sleep over them. The 'big four' have reported first-half-yearly profits—so, just six months—of $11.9 billion, which is about $540.91 for every Australian. The Commonwealth Bank posted $3.3 billion profit to December 2010, NAB earned $2.67 billion, Westpac a cool $3.16 billion and ANZ's six-month profit was up a massive 38 percent to $2.66 billion. No-one is suggesting the banks should not be profitable, and I think most of us would agree that the strength of the Australian banking sector played a part in shielding Australia from the full impact of the global financial crisis. When we saw banks around the world tumbling, we saw that our 'big four' were consistently in the top 15 banks in the world. I commend the opposition for their contribution to making sure that we have had a strong banking sector. It is something that there has been bipartisan support for. As well, there were government measures during the GFC, such as the bank deposit guarantee.


Banks answer to their shareholders and most are no doubt very happy with the half-yearly profit reports. But the banks also have a social licence to provide financial credit and enable measured economic growth and fiscal stability throughout Australia. The Gillard Labor government believes that with this social licence comes an obligation on the part of the banks to protect consumers and not lure them into unaffordable and unreasonable credit deals. We should acknowledge that banks such as NAB are actually leading the way when it comes to some of these reforms, and I do commend the banks that have taken these initiatives. They have already scrapped some over-limit fees and now allocate repayments to the highest interest debts first. These are terrific initiatives for consumers and also prove that the sky will not fall in for Australian lenders when these reforms come into force. I commend the bill to the House.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (18:29):  By introducing these changes to the National Consumer Credit Protection Act, these amendments form part of a knee-jerk change put forward by this government. Given this Labor government's track record of unsuccessful and bungled delivery of change in Australia, I am understandably apprehensive about the possible outcomes.


The banking sector is one of the most important industries in Australia. Given the world that we live in today, it is of the utmost importance that the services provided by banks deliver the best possible outcomes for consumers. Increased competition within this sector will help to improve these outcomes and deliver better services for all Australians.


However, we must be wary of knee-jerk reactions to perceived problems. Australia's banking sector fared better through the global financial crisis than that of any other OECD country. Whilst we saw massive runs on Northern Rock in the United Kingdom and Bear Stearns in the US, the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, the bailout of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, and the US federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Australian sector, whilst taking a hit, did not teeter on the precipice of destruction like others did around the world.


That was due, in a large part, to our superior regulation system. Of course, the responsible economic management of the Howard-Costello government provided an unparalleled cushion for the Australian economy. However, the system of regulation present in Australia, with both ASIC for financial services and APRA for the banking sector, helped keep us out of the storm.


The dovetailing of these two regulating bodies was real reform of the banking sector in Australia. It was considered and responsible. Whilst the banking sector is in need of review, given the massive changes the world has undergone, we must ensure that any such reform is not knee-jerk and reactionary and that we study and understand the unintended consequences of any such reform.


Measures that this government is proposing, with the stated purpose of consumer protection, could in fact have the exact opposite effect. Banning exit fees, for example, could very well have a detrimental effect on smaller lenders, severely decreasing competition. Such a decrease would further centralise big lenders' purchasing power, leaving the consumer worse off.


The banning of exit fees is a classic example of this government's policy of reaction and it is important to briefly discuss this today as an example of why we must ensure that the current amendments do not follow in the same vein. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, small lenders' market share of mortgages has already fallen, from above 13 per cent in the period pre the global financial crisis 2007, to just 1.2 per cent in February this year. The ability to recuperate the costs of establishing a mortgage through an exit fee penalty is extremely important to a small lender, who has less of an ability to absorb this outlay than the big lenders.


Whilst at face value the banning of exit fees may seem like a popular measure, it is also regarded as a major threat to competition within the sector. Even the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry into banking competition echoed these concerns and recommended that the government re-evaluate the outright ban, which is currently planned to come into effect on 1 July this year. The proposal is a perfect example of how a rash and rushed decision can in fact have unintended consequences and exacerbate a situation rather than fix it. The proposal is a perfect example. 


The amendments put forward today have the usual, distinctive ad hoc Labor feel to them. Australia's strong banking sector should not be put to the test unnecessarily through poorly thought out policy. This is why the coalition has been engaged in the issue of banking reform for a long time. We take competition in the banking sector seriously and support sensible measures to improve the industry.


Some elements of the bill have merit, such as the changes to the hierarchy of payments under credit card contracts, which would facilitate consumers to pay off the transactions with the highest interest rate first. However, it seems that many of the considerations in relation to credit cards are poorly drafted and the concerns of the industry have not been fully addressed.


I am therefore concerned about the lack of clarity within these government proposals. It is particularly apparent with retrospectivity in relation to existing credit contracts. Currently, the bill proposes that the changes being made to credit card regulation apply only to new contracts. That means that current credit card holders would not benefit from the reform. This raises concerns and the government has provided no discussion as to why existing contracts should not be subject to the changes proposed in this bill. If there is a clear reason, be it legal or constitutional, as to why existing contracts should not be included, I call upon the government to make these reasons known.


Additionally, it seems to me that poor drafting now appears to, in effect, allow every new credit card customer to be provided with an automatic 10 per cent limit increase. This clause essentially aims to protect consumers by disallowing lenders to charge high fees for drawing over their limit. However, it is implemented in a confusing way that does not provide simplicity or clarity for the consumer. Also, this 10 per cent default buffer applies to all contracts, unless the customer has chosen to opt out. This, effectively, results in a credit provider having no option but to provide this buffer, whereas it is currently at the lender's discretion to allow or disallow an overdrawn transaction. It essentially locks lenders in to providing 10 per cent more credit, reducing flexibility and potentially having many negative unintended consequences.


This gets to the core of my concern about these amendments. They take away flexibility and assume that, for credit cards, one size can fit all. That is simply not true. By locking lenders in to prescriptive regulation, this bill could unintentionally result in credit providers being forced into acting in a way that does not best suit their customer and these regulations would affect every provider. The customer would no longer have the choice of leaving their current lender in search of a better deal. Given this, I ask the government to truly look at the unintended consequences of this bill. Considering the number of amendments to legislation that have been put before the House this year alone that deal with little more than retrospective clean-ups, it would be much more sensible and efficient for the government to simply get the drafting right in the first place by properly considering these factors.


As well as the abovementioned issues with the provisions in relation to credit cards, I have concerns about the changes to home loan regulation, particularly the time frame the government has set down for these quite time-consuming changes to be made. This will in turn affect the rollout of the key facts sheet, which, under this bill, all mortgage providers must present and provide about their home loans. The proposed key facts sheet is a one-page sheet that provides a summary of a mortgage provider's home loan that can easily be used to compare different institutions' offerings. These key facts sheets are meant to be provided by September this year; however, it is now June, and the government is yet to inform stakeholders as to what is required for these sheets—how they must look, what they must contain and how they will cover fixed-rate loans or lines of credit. This will give providers just two months to create, test and implement the new system and train staff around the country to be competent with this new measure. The credit provider alone is responsible for these key facts sheets. They cannot be managed by a mortgage broker or manager.


The Treasurer has taken almost 12 months to get to this stage of the legislation, which is still riddled with poor drafting and unintended consequences. Yet he is now trying to give the industry just two months to comply, assuming that the legislation receives royal assent this month. Given the harsh penalties that will be enforced if these key facts sheets do not meet the regulatory requirements, a two-month time frame is unrealistic and arrogant and is evidence that the government does not particularly care how its legislation actually affects people. It has regard for superficial  appearances only.


Furthermore, the introduction of a key facts sheet once again assumes that a one-size-fits-all approach will work. It will not. The introduction of such a scheme places an obligation on a whole sector of people, including mortgage brokers and mortgage managers, and imposes very high penalties for a product that is already widely available. A key facts sheet, in reality, is simply an outline of what is potentially available. It is not a finalised assessment based on an individual's situation and cannot be substituted for one. A mortgage is a huge commitment for most people. To believe that reform can come from what is essentially a simple summary sheet is irresponsible, unrealistic and, to be honest, quite a frightening simplification by the Treasurer of a very complex issue.


Whilst the coalition will not oppose this bill, the bill raises real questions as to the government's ad hoc approach to policy. For four years now this government has been short on reform and has broken promise after promise. This is, quite rightly, turning the electorate against them. With these amendments we see a scrambling, haphazard response to an extremely complex issue. This bill highlights the common sense of the coalition's call for a full root-and-branch review of Australia's financial system. I implore the government to take the same approach.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2011-06-21,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Government Whip) (18:41):  I rise to speak in favour of the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011. As an amendment to the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009, which includes the National Credit Code, the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011 gives effect to the government's election commitment in relation to fairer and simpler banking policy. This amendment delivers on the government's election commitment to reduce the information asymmetry—the very one-sided information flow from lenders to consumers—that we have in the industry at the moment.


Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Adams, I know you are well aware of my electorate. As such, you are aware of the issue of housing stress that is currently of significant proportions there. It is not only housing stress that is of concern to people in my electorate. There is also the burden of genuine financial stress. People get in over their heads. Some will take the view that everyone is entitled to make their own decisions, and hopefully they make the best decisions. With this piece of legislation we are trying to ensure that people are provided with the information they need to make decisions—cutting through all the hype, the glamour and the glossy brochures that encourage them to borrow more—that are in their own interest and that of their families and that give them a debt they are able to manage.


It is a simple fact that currently in Australia there are approximately 15 million credit card account holders. Therefore we must strive to have the most efficient, streamlined credit card system to ensure that consumers are not left behind and left vulnerable. We must also aim to improve the consumer relationship, particularly with the banking system, through the elimination of excessive fees. This amendment introduces the requirement that lenders give borrowers a one-page key facts sheet for home loans. The aim of this facts sheet is to ensure that the borrower will have the best possible information when making that home loan decision. Australian families should be able to easily compare the deals offered by the big banks with those of their local credit unions and building societies. This is about transparency.


I must say, it was a vastly different situation when I went to get my first home loan. I recall going to one of the big banks, only to be knocked back. That is how I and my wife, Bernadette, ended up at the building society. Things have not changed that much. Therefore, we are trying to reduce the market capture of the big banks, allowing competition in the system and allowing people to know and understand the true position being offered by the respective financial institutions as well as the consequences and effects of that. As I said, this amendment is about transparency. It is about ensuring that there is clear and concise information available to the consumer. It is our objective to ensure that the consumers are not paying more interest than they should be.


It goes without saying that a home mortgage is one of the biggest financial commitments that most Australians will enter into in their adult lives. It is our responsibility to ensure that they are given the fairest possible deal or arrangement in coming to that decision. We understand that banks must make a profit and must remain profitable. That certainly underpins our economic system. But, at the same time, it is our responsibility to protect everyday families. They are not approaching this as bank executives. They are not sitting as equals at a negotiating table. They are, to some extent, taking what is on offer. We are just going to try to ensure through this piece of legislation that what they are shown as being on offer is written in common-sense language that is understandable such that a family can make a decision as to what is good for them.


The bill provides a balance between making banks and other financial institutions competitive and helping borrowers make the best decisions for themselves and their families. There is no doubt that consumers have a responsibility to be prudent. This does not absolve them of that. But, in short, we are trying through this legislation to give them more access to understandable information to help prudent decision making. We must ensure that they are informed not only about all the opportunities available through the various financial institutions but also, more importantly, about the financial consequences and obligations of entering into various contracts or mortgages.


In recent years the government has successfully streamlined and updated consumer credit laws. Australians now have uniform credit laws applying throughout all states and territories. That provides protection for consumers against unfair treatment. Now it is time to address the national credit laws. Under the proposed changes outlined by the amendment, lenders will be prohibited from sending invitations to borrowers offering increased credit limits. I have received those on many occasions. Anyone who on any occasion has taken out an interest-free loan or something like that knows that if you are disciplined and make the repayments there is no downside. However, if you are slightly less than disciplined—and by 'slightly' I mean missing one repayment or not paying on the exact day—you then incur a significant penalty at a higher interest rate.


One of the things that I have always found so terribly loathsome is the amount of material that you are targeted with by the lending institution in question by simply signing up for one commercial transaction. This seeks to discourage that practice but also to discourage Australian credit card holders from accepting such offers that encourage frivolous spending and mounting up a debt that unfortunately becomes unmanageable. I have been through that with my own kids. I am sure, with the number of credit cards out there—and I have already indicated the number of them—that many members in this place have experienced that too. At one stage one of my children decided to make purchases, and it was fine until they had to be paid back on a given day. I guess it does then fall to mums and dads to come in and help. Maybe this goes to helping mums and dads out a little bit in that process too. My child took this loan out. At the time she approached it from being a knowledgeable university graduate. But when you take these things out, unless there is self-discipline, it is very easy to be caught up in a situation where managing that debt eventually becomes more and more difficult.


As I said, this is trying to give consumers the information they need when they are making those decisions and also drawing their attention to how to make suitable judgment calls about the debt that they are going to have to try to manage. I spoke about being bombarded with the amount of literature you get on these matters. It is bad when you are being bombarded with what is effectively a sales pitch to take on more debt. They gloss it up and make it look more attractive but, at the end of the day, we need people to make decisions as to the management of their debt.


Under the terms of this legislation, lenders will not able to charge fees to customers who go over their credit limit. That is something that used to apply. You would get that in the mail and most people would just pay it. You might complain but mostly you would just pay it. This will now prohibit that from occurring. However, it can be reversed upon the express request of the credit card holder. This is actually transferring a bit of that power. It is putting the consumer in a position to say, 'I want to go above that credit limit,' as opposed to simply going above it and being caught after the event.


With this in mind, lenders will still be able to practise discretion when approving some payments above the credit limit, but this discretion will only be able to be exercised up to a buffer limit of 10 per cent of the consumer's credit card limit. This change to the system signifies an end to most credit limit overdraw fees. That will be a significant change for a lot of people. I understand that nationally it will mean a saving of $225 million annually. That is $225 million that will stay in the pockets of hardworking Australians. In addition to these changes, the government is moving to increase the regulation of lenders in relation to the warning to consumers about making only minimum repayments on their credit card accounts. Consumers need to be kept well informed about the consequences of making only minimum repayments and must be encouraged to make additional monthly contributions. More importantly, lenders will be forced to allocate the additional payments that are being made, in the first instance, to the credit card holder's highest interest debt.


For far too long the banks have had the upper hand. There has been a clear lack of transparency in the information flow between banking institutions and consumers, which has seen too many Australian families get trapped in bad loans and lumped with excessive credit card fees. This initiative gives some power back to individuals, helping them to make the best decisions with their hard-earned money.


I represent an electorate which is very much governed by the number of families who live there. A mortgage is, without doubt, the biggest financial arrangement that people in my electorate enter into. This bill will go a long way towards helping hardworking families make prudent decisions about their finances and helping them take all steps possible to ensure that they do not enter into a bad financial arrangement. I commend this bill to the House.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (18:54):  I rise to speak on the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011, and particularly mention that the coalition might also be introducing amendments. This amendment bill is a significant action by the government to address the complex regulations relative to the areas of consumer credit, including payday lending, credit cards, store credit, investment and small business lending, and personal loans.


The coalition holds a very strong view that our objective and commitment is to ensure constitutional soundness, particularly that implementation arrangements are in place for the referral of consumer credit powers to the Commonwealth by the states. We must all be assured that the national regulation of consumer credit by the Commonwealth provides a thorough and consistent administration that extinguishes the gaps and conflicts that may have existed under the current regime and that it addresses the shortcomings of the current system in protecting all Australians, especially the most vulnerable in our society. 


Protecting consumer rights and meeting the needs of all Australians are essential in building a very strong social fabric. The coalition supports fair, open and competitive markets to provide the very best means of having an open, dynamic, prosperous and equitable society. Government needs to ensure that markets are fair, open and always competitive. We also support a more comprehensive regulatory regime. We support reducing the financial risk and disadvantage to Australian consumers entering into contractual arrangements for credit.


Potentially, the scope and influence of these new laws will affect the majority of this country's adult population. It is currently estimated that in Australia there are over 14 million credit-active individuals. Even people who have utilities—including electricity and gas accounts or mobile phones in their name—are active users of credit. For many people the use of credit is a stark reality in order to survive. They lead a hand-to-mouth existence, with very little margin for error in managing their financial resources. These people are well aware that they are constantly on the brink of, or a pay cheque away from, disaster. 


In today's society it is becoming increasingly difficult to conduct day-to-day transactions without the use of a credit card. In the area of credit cards alone, Australians have a collective debt of a staggering $50 billion. More than two-thirds of this debt is accruing interest every day at an average annual rate of interest of 19.7 per cent—a near 20-year high according to the Reserve Bank. That translates to $7 billion a year paid in interest alone on credit cards. 


There is very wide competition in the financial industry, with more than 174 banks, building societies and credit unions offering some form of high-street financial product. They are all vying for that very important consumer business. This legislation will no doubt result in significant changes in the way that credit providers and credit assistance providers conduct their business. It will also result in changes to the commercial practices of businesses involved in offering, managing and recovering loans and consumer credit contracts. However, there are some very serious concerns about the length of time that the government has provided industry with to comply with the new laws. They have provided very minimal time for industry to provide feedback and to comply with the new laws, particularly in light of the fact that a great deal of the detail in this bill has been deferred to regulation, which has yet to be released by the government. 


This is all the more reason for the government to ensure that this legislation fully and adequately serves the purpose for which it was intended. It is anticipated, and it is absolutely essential, that the introduction of licensing, conduct, advice and disclosure requirements meets the needs of both consumers and businesses alike. This legislation must ensure that consumers are fully protected in their dealings with credit products, and credit providers must ensure that the legislation is clearly communicated and articulated to their customers. We also have an opportunity to liberate the market and encourage more stringent rules on access to credit, but also to cap the rates of interest that can be charged. The coalition holds the view that consumers' interests could be best met by measures which encourage competition within the banking sector, as opposed to the prescriptive regulatory approach for ad hoc issues.


The coalition stands by its call for a full root and branch review into Australia's financial system as part of the nine-point banking plan announced in October last year. There has not been a major review of banking since the Wallis review reported some 13 years ago. This side of the House supports the upgrading of ASIC's enforcement powers to eradicate unscrupulous and misleading practices. Responsible financial industry participants will undoubtedly regard this as an overdue and positive advancement in this area. This will be a challenging and complex undertaking as it covers all major financial institutions and major credit providers, including the banks, the building societies, the credit unions, the finance companies, the retailers and other businesses that offer credit arrangements, as well as the payday lenders.


With many Australians experiencing difficulties in meeting their financial obligations, we must ensure that public education and guidance is available to assist consumers in choosing a course of action when they are having difficulties with payments, which can result in a long-term effect. A consumer's credit history is a foundation of lender decisions and can make the difference between getting a good loan with excellent interest rates and getting a bad loan, declined applications or highly inflated interest rates.


The issue of access to credit for low-income earners is also of great importance. These people continue to require access to available credit and we must ensure that this legislation does not disadvantage this very important sector of the credit market. Often it is the financially disadvantaged in our communities who most need to access short-term financial credit opportunities or products. Within my own electorate of Brisbane, this is also the case for people involved in temporary situations such as those who are recovering from the recent Queensland floods and natural disasters. Some are still waiting for insurance payouts or grants from the government and really need to access these credit facilities desperately.


Whilst we recognise the need to regulate the credit industry to protect consumers from unscrupulous financial credit providers, the coalition is determined to ensure that the providers of the credit are not inhibited by bureaucratic and demonstratively overburdening legislation that denies credit to the people who need it the most. The coalition applauds the advancement of consumer credit reforms in line with the adoption of a national regulatory approach to important social and economic issues. However, we share certain concerns, particularly about ensuring not only that this legislation fully and adequately protects consumers but also that it is not to the detriment of credit service providers.


ASIC must provide the mechanisms for easy access to services such as dispute resolution, where consumers will have access to these services with location, procedural simplicity and affordable costs being absolute priorities. This legislation will have a major impact on any organisation or individual involved in providing, assisting with or enforcing consumer credit, including in areas such as consumer leases and credit for residential property for investment purposes.


Interest rates under the Gillard government have increased seven times since September 2009, increasing repayments on the average mortgage by $477 per month in a little under two years. The truth is the Gillard government has been forced into taking action on financial credit providers and is playing catch-up politics. The best thing that the government could do to provide immediate relief for homeowners and small business is to pursue responsible economic management and wind back its heavy debt fuelled spending to ease the upward pressure on interest rates.


It is our understanding that to implement this COAG decision over $70 million has been allocated over a four-year period and that this funding will be primarily for the establishment of the national licensing regime for providers of credit and credit facilities. ASIC will be the sole national regulator. What has not been identified in the proposed new national regime, however, is the cost associated to providers in procuring these new licences. Perhaps the Treasurer will answer a question at a future time relating to the envisaged costs to credit providers and whether there is a plan to recoup those operating costs over the years ahead with licensing fees. That really needs to be answered.


It would seem logical that whatever increased costs are placed on the financial or credit industry will be passed on to the consumer. We need to ensure that the new legislation does not provide an opportunity for financial businesses to use the legislation as a trigger or a reason to increase lending or credit fees. Australian banks have in the past few years increased the margins that they earn on credit cards, despite following the RBA's lead in other areas of financing. In the world of credit cards, most rate cuts by the central bank were ignored, with additional rate rises instead. Australians are acutely aware of the role of the banks in the escalating cost of credit facilities. Recent media articles and consumer surveys indicate that many Australians are becoming reluctant to increase their credit card debts.


This legislation also encompasses regulation of alternative credit facilities such as payday loans, which are becoming a popular alternative, offering small amounts of credit to those who would normally be ineligible for a credit card. A positive and encouraging trend is emerging with the increased use of debit cards, which are becoming far more popular. In fact, debit card usage has skyrocketed, with most consumers preferring to use their own funds to avoid building up any further debt. This growth in the preference for debit cards is due to the fact that, while they are restricting their credit card potential debt, Australians still owe a fair amount on their credit cards. Credit cards that attract interest rates of around 20 per cent are suggested as being of principle importance to those trying to repay in full, according to financial industry experts, while those on around nine per cent give consumers more room to move.


At a time when this country's tourism industry is working hard to encourage and stimulate our domestic tourism business, some credit card charges, such as those for airfares and taxi trips, incur usage fees by merchants of up to 10 per cent. These charges are further damaging Australia's reputation as an affordable tourism choice both domestically and internationally.


My home state of Queensland was the first state to implement a uniform consumer credit code, which was adopted by other states and territories. It is heartening to witness the coming together of different state and territory legislation and the transfer of financial services into a single, standard national consumer credit law for the benefit of all Australians.


The coalition calls on the government to refer this bill to the House Standing Committee on Economics, because the bill is an unsatisfactory response to perceived issues within the banking industry. We acknowledge that some elements within the bill are worthy of consideration, such as the changes to the hierarchy of payments under credit card contracts. The other sections relating to credit card reform seem to be poorly drafted, and there are industry concerns that have not been addressed. In addition, there are concerns over retrospectivity in relation to the bill applying to existing credit contracts. With further amendments and with properly managed implementation, this legislation has immense potential to have a beneficial effect on the credit and financial industries while ensuring the protection of Australia's consumers.

Mr CRAIG THOMSON
 (Dobell) (19:09):  The opposition are really on their game today in calling for the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011 to be sent to the House Standing Committee on Economics. It actually has been considered by the economics committee. If the member for Brisbane would like to read a copy of the committee's report on the bill, I would be very happy to send her one. It was in fact tabled here last Wednesday. So that was a great contribution by the member for Brisbane and showed her to be really up to speed on the stage the legislation is at. Well done!


This is good legislation because it protects the consumer. The National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011 makes a number of reforms to lenders' practices in relation to home loans and credit cards. For example, it requires lenders to publish key facts sheets for both these types of product, which will make it easier for consumers to compare products. Additional reforms for credit cards prevent lenders sending unsolicited limit increase offers to individuals, unless they elect to receive them; prevent lenders charging fees when a consumer goes over their credit limit, unless the consumer elects to be able to go over their credit limit; and require lenders to pay off consumer debt with the highest interest first, unless the consumer elects otherwise.


The most important reform concerns unsolicited credit card limit increase offers to individuals. During the committee's hearing into the bill there was consistent evidence that aggressive marketing of limit increases by banks was a key reason why some consumers had credit problems. Credit cards have a number of unique features, two of which are high interest rates and the requirement that consumers pay only a small amount each month. Aggressive marketing by banks appears designed to put consumers at the limits of their credit capacity, whereupon the unique features of credit cards mean that individuals are paying interest with little capacity to reduce the principal. While the debt treadmill may be good for bank profits, it has significant social costs. That is why the committee unan­imously supports this bill. Can I say, Mr Deputy Speaker, that is a rare occurrence. The committee also supports the bill because it will increase competition in the market and make consumers better off. Therefore, while there will probably be some transition costs for lenders, the increased competition will mean that the extra compliance should have no impact on prices for consumers. Costs for lenders should be further reduced, because many have already voluntarily adopted some of these reforms.


The committee made only two recommendations. One recommendation was that the House pass the bill. The contrib­utions of not just the member for Brisbane but most of those opposite show clearly that they have not read the report, because the other recommendation was that the deadline for financial organisations to have their key facts sheets ready should be moved back from 1 September 2011 to 1 January 2012. The evidence was that, given passage of this legislation, there were some timing issues in relation to that. I understand that the Assistant Treasurer will introduce some amendments in relation to that recom­mendation. The committee, in considering these issues, saw that this is a good bill and that it should be supported, with the one additional recommendation in relation to the facts sheet time line.


As I said, this was a unanimous report, which is rare for the economics committee in this parliament. The House economics committee has followed the pattern we have seen in this parliament, which is that generally all we get from the opposition is 'no'. Even with this legislation we were not quite sure, right up to the death, where the opposition would go on it, but two minutes before the report was tabled we heard that they would support the bill. It shows that even the opposition understood that, if they opposed this bill, they would be condemned out there in consumer land. Unfortunately, the opposition seem to have a different view of consumer rights when it comes to exit fees from banks, which they want to see reintroduced and which we are trying to make sure are not. It is a continuing battle. The primary reason these reforms were needed was in relation particularly to unsolicited credit card limit increase offers. The bulk of the evidence from consumer groups concerned the prevalence of the unsolicited credit card increase offers and their potential to lead customers into the debt trap. Reforms contained in this bill would make it more difficult for customers to take on credit card debt that they are not able to repay. Ms Karen Cox, the coordinator of the Consumer Credit Legal Centre, gave evidence that credit cards have been the most common reason for people seeking assistance for the full 10 years she has been there. She said:


There is no doubt that credit cards are an enormous cause of pressure on families. We have seen countless examples over the years of people on very low incomes who have accepted a series of credit limit increases.


Importantly, the Finance Sector Union of Australia also confirmed that over the past several years their members working in financial institutions have been asked to be part of what they describe as an increase in the number of unsolicited marketing and other letters from financial providers suggesting people should increase their credit limit. 


While the majority of customers pay off their credit card balance monthly, the most profitable customers from the lenders' perspective are those who cannot afford to pay back the full balance every month. Treasury, in their evidence, said that one of the issues with credit cards is that you only have to make minimum repayments, and increases in the credit limit can place you in a position where you are carrying long-term credit card debts without ever necessarily being able to significantly reduce those debts. 


Research by consumer groups shows that banks have aggressively marketed credit cards. Mr Mark Degotardi from Abacus gave evidence that that is what they had seen and noticed. There was a study done in 2009 which showed that 84 per cent of Victorian credit card holders had received an unsolicited credit card limit increase offer. We are seeing almost everyone in Victoria in this particular study being offered an increase.


The study also broke it down into different groups and showed virtually the same rate of credit card limit increase being offered to people who are unemployed—84 per cent of unemployed people in Victoria had been offered an increase; 83 per cent of those studying had been offered an increase; and, 82 per cent of people with a healthcare card had been offered an increase. Banks certainly were not looking at people's capacity to pay; they were looking at ways of maximising profits and using the unique nature of credit cards, which is the high interest rate and the low minimum payment where you pay only part of the interest back and never get to the principal, as being one of the key issues. That is why this government has gone about making sure that we address these issues. We are addressing consumer concerns in a wide range of financial issues including exit fees, which the opposition continue to oppose, but we are doing it particularly in relation to credit cards because of the problems consumer groups continually told us about—the heartbreak of families who have used credit cards to pay bills to get by each month and who, in doing so, get themselves into a worse situation. Almost universally they were getting unsolicited offers to increase their credit limit.


This is an important bill which makes sure consumers are protected. It is part of a range of bills which this government has been introducing to make sure consumers are looked after.




Mr Robert:

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (19:20):  I rise to speak on theNational Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011. In his second reading speech on 24 March this year, the Treasurer said:


I announce new reforms to promote a competitive and sustainable banking system to give every Australian a fair go. 


What the Treasurer failed to mention in his second reading speech was that one of the reasons we need reform to promote a competitive and sustainable banking system is as a result of the Treasurer's monumental blunder in approving the Westpac takeover of St George Bank in 2008. The Treasurer has no excuse. He was aided and abetted by the flawed and misguided advice from the ACCC, an organisation dangerously ignorant of the risks to our nation's long-term economic prosperity, by allowing markets to degenerate into the state of hyper- concentration. For while the test applied by the ACCC to approve a merger is under section 50 of the Trade Practices Act, it is no more than crystal ball gazing to guess if the merger will result in a substantial lessening of competition. The test that the Treasurer applies to such proposed banking mergers arises under section 63 of the Banking Act 1959, which provides that the Treasurer must take the national interest into account when considering such a merger. Simply, the St George-Westpac merger—the removal of St George Bank as an active and aggressive competitor in the market—was not in the national interest and the Treasurer abrogated his responsibility by allowing this merger. It is worth noting that even former Prime Minister Keating has made it clear that he would have never agreed to this merger, due its detrimental effects on competition. But this misguided decision from the Treasurer should not have come as any surprise, for we have seen time and time again that this government possesses the reverse Midas touch—from Ruddbank to GROCERYchoice, to winding back border protection, to the ceiling insulation scandal, the green loans affair and live cattle exports, everything this government touches turns to mush.


The long-term success of our economy and our future economic prosperity rely on increasing our nation's productivity. As history has taught us time and time again, it is small business that drives innovation and productivity improvements, not the big end of town.    As a former vice-chairman of the General Electric Company once noted:


Not a single distinctively new electric home appliance has ever been created by one of the giant concerns—not the first washing machine, electric range, dryer … razor, lawn mower, freezer, air conditioner, vacuum cleaner, dishwasher, or grill. 


These were all created by small and medium sized firms. The success of small business depends upon the ability of small businesses to obtain finance and start-up capital. But when you reduce the number of banks in the market, as the Treasurer did by allowing the St George-Westpac merger, you reduce the number of options for small business to obtain finance and, in doing so, you undermine the long-term economic prosperity of our nation.


The history of business is littered with stories of businesses' successes after being rejected by bank after bank and finally finding a bank that would provide start-up capital and give them a go. I will give just one example. Almost every child in the world has heard of and loves Disneyland. Today, as well as Disneyland in California, there is Disneyworld in Florida and there are Disneylands in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Paris. Over one billion people around the world have visited a Disneyland. Disneyland is one of the great business success stories in history. Yet, when Walt Disney went to the banks to try to get funding for his very first Disneyland, he was rejected by more than 100 banks before finally being accepted. The top executives of the major banks turned Disney down because they thought no-one would come. Just imagine if, at the time, some misguided fool had swallowed, hook, line and sinker, the merger buzzwords of 'synergies', 'greater economies of scale' and 'improved efficiency' and allowed a series of mergers whereby Walt Disney only had four major banks to turn to—the current situation in Australia. The Disneyland that is known and loved throughout the world would never have come into existence.


We will never know what new products, new inventions and new jobs will fail to come into existence, killed before they were born because of the deluded theory which underpinned the Treasurer's allowing the St George-Westpac merger, thereby reducing the number of banks in the market which small business can seek to obtain finance from. We will never be able to compute the price that all of us will pay and how our standard of living will be lower than it would otherwise have been because of the Treasurer mistakenly allowing our banking sector to become more concentrated.


As the Treasurer scratches his head, befuddled as to why productivity in the nation has stagnated under his watch, he need look no further than the damage being done to our small business sector by our overly concentrated banking sector. History has shown time and time again that small business plays the leading role in the experimentation and innovation that lead to technological change and drive productivity growth. If you attack small business, as this Labor government has done time after time, if you make it more difficult for them to obtain finance, as this government has done, you will retard productivity growth.


Over the past few years, we have witnessed an unprecedented increase in concentration in our banking sector. The problem is not only the reduction in the options of small business to obtain finance; it is also the increasing interest rate margins that small businesses pay and the fees and charges that they are being slugged with. Figures from the RBA confirm that the big banks have now become parasitic on the small business sector. The banks are simply gouging small business on interest rate margins. 


It is not only interest rate margins that small business are being gouged on. Late last week, we had the RBA release further data exposing how the banks are ripping off business, as these figures showed that the banks had massively increased fees and charges to businesses—by 14 per cent, to hit a record $6.87 billion—and this increase came despite business borrowing actually falling. So the banks are actually loaning less but they are taking more. This is the classic test of an uncompetitive market.


If the Treasurer wants to give every Australian a fairer go in regard to banking, he should be tackling the huge problem in our banking industry, and that is the penalty fees and charges imposed by the big banks. Although there has been a slight recent decline in bank fees charged to consumers, which the banks have made up for by slugging businesses, according to a 2009 report by Fujitsu Consulting, Australian bank customers pay the Western world's highest bank fees. The report's author states: 


A lack of competition in Australia meant local banks were collecting $5 billion in fees from consumers, making them the most expensive in the western world.


The report's author goes on:


The average household is, in our view, paying up to $200 more each year than they should thanks to the wide range of fees and charges levied in Australia, and to the lower levels of competition in the market.


The real concern that this government should be tackling is that many of these fees and charges imposed by the banks are possibly unenforceable. It is a well-established legal principle that a contractual term—




Mr Craig Thomson:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We have been going nine minutes on this contribution. The member has not addressed one issue in relation to this bill. He has not been on the topic at all. He has had a complete spray. It is time he was brought back to what the bill is actually about.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. DGH Adams
):  The honourable member for Hughes will address the bill.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  I am talking about bank fees. The real concern is that many of the measures this bill proposes to regulate the fees and charges imposed by the banks are possibly unenforceable, for it is a well-established legal principle that a contractual term which requires one party to the contract to pay the other 'innocent' party a sum of money upon default or breach of that contract is only enforceable if it provides that the sum is a genuine pre-estimate of the loss or damage suffered by the innocent party. If the fee is inflated to a level where it does not represent a genuine pre-estimate of loss or damage suffered, it is a penalty and is unenforceable at common law.


In our democracy only the government can issue penalties, not the big four banks. The possible illegality of many forms of bank fees that this bill attempts to regulate is something that a well-resourced ACCC should have been looking at.




Mr Craig Thomson:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I have the same point of order. You have been very generous to the member. Far be it from me to defend the banks, but we have had a 10-minute spray against the banks. Not one part of this contribution has gone to what a very important piece of consumer protection legislation this is. It is time the member be brought back to what this bill is about.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. DGH Adams
):  The bill is the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011. I ask the honourable member for Hughes to address the bill before the chamber.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. This bill addresses the issue of bank fees and charges to consumers and that is the issue that I am addressing. The question is the possible illegality of many forms of these bank fees, and that is something that a well-resourced ACCC should have been looking at, especially remembering that Australian consumers pay the highest bank fees in the Western world. But, as usual, the ACCC were asleep at the wheel on this issue—and no wonder, because the ACCC have been more interested in spruiking government policy.


As if to highlight the inaction of the ACCC on bank fees and charges, the UK Office of Fair Trading, the UK's equivalent of our ACCC, have been taking an active and vocal role in standing up for consumers by dragging the banks through the courts to challenge the legality of many of their fees. While the ACCC have closed their eyes, one might ask: where is the government's minister on competition? It would help if this government even had a competition minister. Following the disastrous stints of the members for McMahon and Rankin as failed competition ministers, this government no longer even has a competition minister. So, despite all the problems we have with competition in Australia, with the grocery duopoly punishing consumers—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! I ask the honourable member to come back to the bill. The bill deals with credit card protection and matters dealing with information for consumers. It does not go to a lot of the points that the honourable member is dealing with. This is not an appropriation bill, on which a wide-ranging debate is allowed; it is a bill dealing with a narrower matter. I ask the honourable member to come back to the bill.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. This bill addresses the issue of fees and charges, how they should be regulated, how they should be listed and what information consumers could have about them, and they are the issues that I am addressing.


Since the ACCC and the government have dropped the ball on looking at and regulating these fees and charges, it has been left to a private law firm to run a class action test case seeking to prove that many of the banks' fees and charges that this bill seeks to regulate are in fact unlawful penalties that may have to be refunded. This case is already proceeding before the courts and involves over 27,000 individuals and businesses, holding 40,000 personal and business accounts, acting against the ANZ, attempting to recoup over $50 million worth of unenforceable penalties that the bank has gouged from consumers.


This bill simply misses the mark. It fails to address the problems in our overly concentrated Australian banking sector, a sector which has now become so highly concentrated and so big that the big four banks are all too big to fail, whereby they require special regulation to protect them from the forces of competition. This bill does little to improve a competitive and sustainable banking system and it fails in its aim to give every Australian 'a fair go'. It fails to address the gouging of small business and consumers by the banks. That is why it is correct that the bill was sent off to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics and that is why the government should support the coalition's call for a root-and-branch review of Australia's financial system.

"Symon, Mike, MP",ALP,2011-06-21,"



Mr SYMON
 (Deakin) (19:35):  Unlike the member for Hughes, who has just spent 15 minutes talking about anything but what is in the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011, I speak in support of the bill. It is part of the Labor government's commitment to reforming the Australian banking sector. This bill will amend the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 to improve competition and provide better support for Australian consumers. This bill will affect credit card and home loan providers, ensuring they provide better information to consumers, and the provisions detailed in this bill will limit some of the worse practices of the banking sector in these areas.


The RBA credit and charge statistics table Cl reports that in April 2011 there were 14,853,000 credit card accounts in Australia. In that month alone there were 2,108,000 cash advances, to a total of $811 million, and there were 126,383,000 purchases, with a total value of over $17 billion. Repayments for the month were $19.25 billion and balances of $36.39 billion were accruing interest—a huge amount when you think about it. The total credit limit in April 2011 for both drawn and undrawn credit cards was $134.9 billion. Families and individuals Australia wide rely on their credit cards to smooth out unforeseen costs and provide an important safety net. Credit cards for many people are a necessary part of their household budget and can be of great benefit. Some people do use credit cards wisely and are able to pay them off in time, and they see the benefit because they do not pay the fees, they do not pay the interest, but not everyone has that advantage. There is a danger that the consumer's level of credit card debt can exceed their capacity to manage it.


As a member of this House I—and, I am sure, many other members as well—quite often deal with people who are in these situations and I have to refer them to local services because of the dire straits they are in. In many cases it comes back to credit cards. In many cases the journey from sustainable to unsustainable credit card debt is being helped by the practices of Australia's banks. Consumers usually take on a credit card with a limit that they can cope with, a credit limit that enables them to deal with unforeseen costs and yet is manageable so that any debts accumulated can be cleared up in a reasonable time. At a later date, the consumer may receive a letter in the mail from the bank offering them a preapproved increase in their limit, and I am sure most of us have seen that many times. I have certainly received many such letters over the years. With a form such as that, all it needs is a signature. It can be faxed or mailed off and—bingo!—the credit limit has been increased, sometimes by many thousands of dollars and sometimes by even more.


For a family under pressure, if the bills are mounting and their credit card is getting close to its current limit, you pretty much know what is going to happen next. That form gets signed. It gets sent off. The new limit is in place and it is then used. Of course, the customer, the borrower, who has gone up to the max on the old credit card limit and has not been able to pay it off has even less chance of paying off a card with a higher limit.


Banks have been widely condemned for the practice of sending unsolicited invitations to increase credit card limits, and I think it is right that this bill addresses that. There are certainly some people in situations that can cope with increased credit card limits, but I think banks should also carry some responsibility when those are being offered.


A typical credit card interest cost is often more than 20 per cent per annum. For some cards it is less; they have different conditions. But there are certainly a lot of cards that have that rate or more. It only takes an outstanding balance of $10,000 on a credit card to see $2,000 a year go up in interest and not one cent applied to the amount that has been loaned via the credit card. Many people unfortunately fall into that trap and spend a large amount of their income paying off interest for purchases that in many cases they have already used or consumed. As we often hear, having large debts can have a devastating effect on families. Credit card debt can make people feel stressed, frustrated and overwhelmed and even leads to health problems. A lot of mental stress can come about from that type of situation with a tight budget.


Data from the Reserve Bank showed that total credit card debt in Australia was $48.6 billion in November 2010. At that time, there was a total credit limit of $133 billion. As I mentioned before, it has gone up slightly since then. Of that $48.6 billion in November 2010, 77 per cent was rolled over from month to month, as most people had not paid off their credit cards in full. When you think about that, that is 77 per cent of those cards having interest paid on them—lots of interest. Of course, it is the banks' right to charge interest; it is their product. But it is also a question of how people have got this credit available to them, and this bill addresses some of those issues. The growth in credit card debt over the past decade has been nothing short of spectacular. Just as an example, from January 2000 until July 2010 the total amount of credit card debt outstanding in Australia rose by 320 per cent. The continual rise in the level of credit card debt is a concern, and this legislation is aimed at helping consumers reduce their levels of debt.


For some local examples, I turn to a service I know rather well in my electorate of Deakin, because my electorate, just like every other electorate, is affected by people who get into financial trouble. Eastern Access Community Health, who have a social and community service based in and around Ringwood, in my electorate, also have a financial service there. They are very good at dealing with locals with financial crises and are able to put them on the right track. That service is funded with federal government support, which is a good thing. That started as part of the global financial crisis, back in 2009. The Labor government at the time provided $80.4 million of additional money for emergency relief and financial counselling which ran from 1 March 2009 until 30 June this year. In the electorate of Deakin this funding supported an additional two financial counsellors who were employed at EACH. As I said, they provide support for members of the community who may be experiencing financial difficulty.


The good news is that in the recent budget it was announced that the 77 full-time financial-counselling positions established during the global financial crisis will continue to be funded, with an extra $28 million over the next four years. That is a great thing for not only my electorate of Deakin but, as I said, everyone else's electorates, where these problems have arisen.


In particular I would like to mention Deborah Graham. She is one of the financial counsellors at EACH, and she advises that, in every case that she has dealt with of severe financial hardship, extensive credit card debt has been the problem. She advises me that, in all of her current cases, her clients started with much lower credit limits and that they increased their limits after they accepted unsolicited bank offers. One of the examples she provided involved an individual on a Centrelink income who has cards from three different banks with credit limits of $4,000, $2,000 and $4,000 respectively. In each case the bank offered to increase the limits of their cards from an earlier lower limit. Over a period of time the debts got higher until they got to the point where help had to be sought. It was unsustainable. The credit card debt spiralled out of control, past any ability of that client to pay it back on the income they were receiving. Deborah is now working with that client to help manage those debts, but it is not a situation that should become a matter of course. It should be the exception, and it should not be made easy to get into that situation. The message Deborah gave to me is that this legislation will make a real difference in helping to keep people out of financial distress. Banning the practice of unsolicited offers of extra credit limits will help people operate within their limits. 


As well as banning the practice of unsolicited pre-approved credit limit increases, this bill will stop banks providing debt above the agreed credit limit and then charging penalties for this so-called service. As part of this reform the government recognises that lenders may need some discretion to approve certain payments which go over the credit limit, and I think that is valid if it is for an essential service. It is valid in the interest of a borrower to see that their gas or their power does not get cut off simply because it has been paid off with a credit card maybe at the wrong time of the billing cycle. Although the credit level will be able to exceed the total limit, this legislation will ban the current practice of charging a penalty plus interest for exceeding that limit. The interest will still be there, as I said before. That is money borrowed. The penalty for the bank is just cream on top. These types of penalties can be very frustrating for customers who accidentally exceed their limit. Many times there seems to be no correlation at all between the penalty charged and the so-called inconvenience to the bank. The two scales are way different. 


For those who are in severe financial hardship, the removal of these penalty fees can help them gain control of their own debt and ensure the amounts they are paying are not spiralling out of control even further. Currently many banks will charge consumers anywhere between $20 and I am told up to $95 each month while the debt sits above the credit limit. These penalties make it even harder for people to dig themselves out of debt. The customer is often paying 20 per cent interest or more on the outstanding amount and on top of this they are incurring regular fees and penalties for exceeding their limit. The Reserve Bank of Australia, in its June quarter 2011 Bulletin, advised that fees on exceeding credit card limits, including late payments, totalled $301 million for the year to 30 June 2010. It is estimated that Australians could save around $225 million annually from the banning of fees and penalty rates for exceeding credit limits. Banning these fees will empower consumers to deal with their debt levels and not face additional costs at the time they can least afford it. 


Another aspect of the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment Bill 2011 is that it will require lenders to allocate repayments to higher interest debts first, so families do not pay more interest than they should. Currently, bank customers do not have any control at all over how their repayments on credit cards are allocated. Some credit providers allocate repayments under their credit card contracts in a way that can maximise the amount and time required for the customer to repay the debt on their credit card. The customer's money is often used to pay off parts of the loan which are actually only incurring low or sometimes even no interest. Each bank and each financial institution that issues cards has different conditions and quite often they have different conditions for different types of cards issued by the same institution. Many people simply do not understand what they are paying or the how or the why or the when as to which part of their debt is getting paid. Other countries have been able to bring in legislation to ensure that the highest interest rate debt is paid first. I think this is a great step forward that we are now proposing to do this in Australia. 


Very importantly, on top of that, this bill will also make it mandatory for credit card statements to advise customers not to pay just the minimum amount, which is very easily done. The statement comes out and it has a figure on there. If you pay that you do not hear any more from the bank until the next month and you get another statement. But if you are paying the minimum amount your chances of paying off your loan from the bank are virtually nil. You will probably never get there in a working lifetime. The minimum amounts are very low. 


Also contained in this bill is a provision that will make it mandatory for credit providers to provide a key facts sheet to consumers before entering a credit card contract. This change will allow customers to compare different credit card products more easily and have a better understanding of how to use their credit cards more efficiently. I would hope that minimises the amount they have to pay in both fees and interest. 


In addition to introducing the key facts statement, this bill also runs in parallel with the reforms that are part of the federal government's commitment to reform the banking system and to promote competitive and sustainable practices. These reforms include the federal government's ban on mortgage exit fees which the Liberal and National parties are trying to torpedo this very day in the Senate, I understand. Banning exit fees on mortgages will help boost competition in the home loan market over time by giving consumers the ability to swap banks without facing the financial burden of exit fees. If the Liberals have their way, it will be families who get it in the neck, not the big end of town. I commend this bill to the House.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (19:50):  I sit on the Standing Committee on Economics and this bill seeks to introduce major changes to the relationship between credit providers and consumers in respect of credit cards and home loans. It forms part of the banking reforms announced by the government designed to empower consumers, to support smaller lenders and to secure the flow of credit to our economy. In principle we do support this bill. However, there are some points raised during taking evidence and listening to witnesses that it is prudent for me tonight to pass on so that we have an entirety. This bill is going to need constant massaging and constant monitoring as its implementation has an impact on the market. 


The bill has a provision to introduce a requirement for lenders to produce a key facts sheet for standard home loans. We do not have a problem with that. The more information we can give a consumer to make a value decision the better. The downside to the fact sheets is that there will be an extra cost, an extra imposition on the banks, and undoubtedly the banks will pass that on. I do not see the banks shifting to an environment where their fine print will become less. It will be just another layer of administration. Notwithstanding that, I think there is substantial benefit in people being made aware of their financial responsibilities. The facts sheet would set out in a standardised format pricing and other information about their products, allowing consumers to readily compare different home loans. The banks will be encouraged to actually personalise the data for the client so that they will be able to shop apples against apples.


Also, the bill tends to regulate the circumstances in which borrowers can exceed their credit limit on their credit card and prohibits fees being charged by the credit provider when they do so, except when the consumer has adopted to have a higher buffer on which they can be charged fees. I do not get this, because the body of this bill speaks to protecting consumers with credit card debt from unsolicited invitations, but this part of the bill, with reference to a buffer, is something that I struggle with. If we are trying to restrict unsolicited limits to credit card holders, providing a buffer for the consumer is exactly the juxtaposed position of what the body of this bill speaks to. So whilst it is in there I will speak to it, but I definitely have concerns, unless I have misinterpreted it.


The bill also speaks to specifying a hierarchy of payments made under credit card contracts, requiring credit providers to allocate repayments by the borrower to that part of the balance of the credit card on which they have charged the highest interest rate, unless they have elected to make different payment arrangements. With most of the standard credit cards there are default or higher components of your credit card expenditure that are exposed to greater interest payments. For example, if you get a cash advance on your credit card you may be paying an extra two or three per cent or a fee to get that cash advance. So, when you go to make your minimum monthly payment the bill intends that the payment will be calculated to offset higher amount of outstanding funding. This part of the bill does make sense. Hopefully, it will reduce some of the burdens for consumers.


This bill speaks to restricting credit providers from making unsolicited invitations encouraging borrowers to increase their limits and credit cards, except when consumers have consented to receiving such offers. We have all seen the volume of such mail that comes through our letterboxes. If you have, or have had, a credit card the banks have taken a position of going out and soliciting increases in limits. My concern was—and I will give my defence of the banks later on in my speech—that the banks make these unsolicited offers, such as increasing a person's limit from $500 to $5,000, without being diligent enough about the capacity requirement or in their evaluation. Enormous cost-of-living pressures are being borne by society as a result of the fiscal management of this country at the moment. There are people in my electorate who are on their knees. Credit card payments and expenditure are the ways in which they are keeping their heads above water. They are paying their energy bills, kids school fees and buying fuel for their car on their credit card. Some of them are actually buying their weekly groceries on credit cards. When you have cost-of-living pressures mounting up to the back teeth and you have an offer from the bank to increase your credit limit from $500 to $5,000, it's Christmas! You are not a logical rational thinking person when it comes to taking up that option. As a result we have this pain in the marketplace.


We heard this from Consumer Action Law Centre and the Consumer Credit Legal Centre, who gave evidence. Some of the stats they referred to were that out of all the people they were dealing with who had credit card default problems 60 per cent had one credit card and 40 per cent had multiple cards. I thought that was an interesting statistic to share with you. We would probably not have to be dealing with this legislation as aggressively as we are if we had stronger fiscal responsibility and the cost-of-living pressures in society were not as intrusive as they are at the moment.


The last point the bill speaks to is an introduction of a requirement for lenders to provide a key facts sheet for credit card contracts. The bill makes it mandatory for credit card providers to include in credit application forms key information about annual percentage rates and other terms that would apply to a contract. This part of the bill just speaks to a mandatory note on your credit card bill alluding to the fact that if you continue to make the minimum monthly payment on your credit card your term for the outstanding balance should be shown. So, on a standard $5,000 credit card, if you make a minimum account balance payment you could be entering into a term of up to 15 to 20 years to pay back that debt. Passing that information to the consumer will hopefully motivate people to reduce their debts quicker.


One of the issues raised by the parties in relation to the consultation process was the short time frame permitted for submissions to be made. I have some dates here. The exposure draft was released by Treasury on 4 March. Given the importance of this bill and the number of people it affects, it was a little unfair that the closing date for submissions was—wait for it—8 March. Treasury put it out on Friday the 4th; then there was the weekend and Monday. This had to be submitted by Tuesday, 8 March—way too short a time for consideration and for the market and stakeholders to respond. The Australian Bankers Association articulated a concern that the banking industry has not been able to fully assess the potential impact or the likelihood—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(

In accordance with standing order 55(c) I will count the House if the member so desires. I invite the member for Fadden to indicate whether he requires a count of the House to be taken.




Mr Robert:
  My desire has eluded me, Madam Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Surprise, surprise! I thank the member for Fadden. The member for Wright has the call.




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I was just alluding to the fact that the Australian Bankers Association articulated a concern that the banking industry had not been able to fully assess the potential impact or the likelihood of unintended consequences of the new rules. Predominantly, that was as a result of the time frame that they had to work with. Groups also broadly shared the concern that, as many of the substantive provisions would be included in this regulations, comprehensive comments on the policy detail were not possible at this stage of the legislation. Predominantly that speaks to the lack of substantial regulation included in this bill. 


Often you will hear us, as the opposition, oppose. We oppose policy that is put up for a very good reason: often it is pretty ordinary policy. But on this particular occasion I am more than happy not to oppose it but to support it. I can see the intent. (Quorum called)While we have the members of the government in the House, this is the first time that we have actually supported a bill and you called a quorum. I was actually speaking for your motion. That is how disconnected you guys are from reality. It was bad policy, but I could see that you were having a go. I could see your intent.

  You guys have just absolutely lost it. For the first time you can no longer say no, no, no, no. You guys have just screwed this one. You have taken it the wrong—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Wright is trying my patience. He will refer to the bill.




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  I am sorry, Madam Deputy Speaker.

  With 29 seconds to go I have shown my intent to support the legislation. However, sometimes the standard practice of this House is quite confusing to a new member.

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (21:30):  I am delighted to rise in the adjournment debate tonight to extend an invitation to Senator Alfredo Mantica, the Italian government's Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs, who is currently visiting Australia, to come and visit my electorate of Sturt and listen to the concerns of my constituents over the proposed closure of the Italian consulate in South Australia. The senator probably finds himself stranded in Melbourne this evening and tomorrow due to the cancellation of flights, so he may have some time to reflect on my invitation. (Quorum formed)I appreciate the opportunity to continue my speech. I had a feeling the government would buckle. 


Two years ago the suggestion that Italian consulates in Adelaide and Brisbane were to be closed brought about a strong reaction from the Italian community, local government and state and federal members of parliament. The issue of maintaining consular services in Adelaide and Brisbane has received overwhelming support, with the Italian government being criticised for not understanding the complexity of the community, the distance between cities in Australia and the vital work performed by the Italian consular network in Australia. The local campaign that forced Silvio Berlusconi's government, the PDL, to backflip on this issue achieved the following key results. Over 15,000 people signed a petition calling on the Italian government to keep the consulates open. The petition was tabled in the Italian parliament by the honourable Marco Fedi in 2009.

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (16:00):  As a member of parliament you sometimes have stories told to you by constituents which are utterly heartbreaking and literally have you in tears in your office. This was certainly the case when Mr Praveen Ranjancame to see me with his brother last Friday. He informed me that in mid-May he found his son dead in his bedroom. His son had committed suicide. His son apparently gave no indication to his parents that he was upset, sad or in any way depressed. From all accounts, he was a successful, bright and popular young 16-year-old boy. He was captain of the hockey team. He was one of the brightest in his school and potentially was going to be the school captain in the following year.


Mr Ranjan and his family are naturally devastated. They are dealing with something now that no parent should ever have to deal with. They have given me permission to raise their tragic story in the parliament in order to raise awareness about youth mental illness and its impacts. They are particularly keen to raise awareness amongst parents of youth with depression and the possible signs and how to interact and engage better with their children, particularly teenage ones. They also want to raise awareness amongst young people about the implications of their actions if they do take their own life, of the devastation of parents and loved ones left behind. Given his devastation and his wife's devastation, I think they are being incredibly courageous in raising these issues publicly and I admire them greatly for it.


As you would be aware, youth depression and youth suicide are too common in our community. About one in three young people is estimated to suffer a mental illness at some stage before early adulthood. As a community we must do more to address youth mental illness. We need to raise awareness of its prevalence in our community and be more open in talking about it. In doing so, we must reduce the stigma associated with it so that all young people feel comfortable in talking about it and all older people can also feel comfortable in talking about it and not attach a stigma to it. We need to invest more in support services for our young people. I am particularly impressed by the headspace foundation and, as you might be aware, I am seeking a headspace centre in my electorate. Locally, I am also working with some of the other community leaders to promote the issue of youth mental health.


My heart goes out to Mr Ranjan and his family. As a parent, I can only imagine what they are going through. But hopefully through their loss they will make a difference to the lives of others. (Time expired)

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (16:30):  I had the misfortune of being here at about the same time last week. I had the responsibility of exploring with the Assistant Treasurer the various matters to do with the appropriation bills. Unfortunately, last week it was a total waste of time—an absolute and categorical waste of time. I just wanted to put it on the record because I am still very cross about what happened. The Assistant Treasurer turned up with half a dozen goons, most of whom did not speak except to intervene and interject in an attempt to disrupt proceedings for the whole hour with inane and mainly quite offensive comments. They were not even comical. Every attempt was made to not cover the substance of any of the questions. The questions were asked in good faith. As always, there is politics on either side of this chamber. Points are made, and I am not oblivious to that. I am pleased to see the Special Minister of State because we have had some healthy debates. We will make our political points. If he does not know the answer, because the Minister for Finance and Deregulation is in another chamber, it would be appreciated if we get the answer in due course. I just felt that last week's session was the worst experience I have had. The previous Minister for Finance and Deregulation made a serious attempt to canvass answers in this chamber, to make political points where appropriate and not waste the time of everyone involved.


Firstly, I would like to explore some of the issues to do with the government's proposal to increase the debt ceiling from $200 billion to $250 billion, which was included in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2011-2012. This is a cognate budget debate and this session is our only opportunity to explore any of these issues. While this is incorporated, we do feel that this is an opportunity to get some understanding of a very important matter which has never been put in an appropriation bill in the past. It has always been properly debated separately, but it was snuck into this bill with no explanation on the evening of the budget. The opposition are very interested to know which minister made the decision to incorporate the debt raising proposal in the second appropriation bill. Firstly, is the minister aware that this is without precedent, and could he explain why the government has gone down this path and not put the proposal in a stand-alone piece of legislation?


Secondly, I would be grateful to know why the government is so averse to having this item debated in detail before the House? We sought to move an amendment to allow us to debate this in detail. I wrote separately to the Leader of the House and asked, again, if he would give consideration to this being debated in some detail and separated out from the other appropriation bills, and I got back what was a fairly nondescript response. Basically, it was trying to take the mickey out of me at every opportunity on this issue, but there were no substantive reasons at all as to why it could not be done. Certainly, it was a very perfunctory 'no' to the question of whether it could be considered in some detail.


Thirdly, is the minister aware of the stark contrast in how the debt issue is being handled compared to the United States, where there is a very public and robust debate in Congress with the Congress being given the opportunity to vote on the fund-raising proposal? (Time expired)

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (16:36):  The member for Goldstein says that being here last week with the Assistant Treasurer was the worst experience he has had, but I think that you and I have both shared much worse experiences than that in our lives. He asks three questions, most of which do not fall into my direct portfolio responsibility—but, yes, I will get back to him with an answer to those questions in the way in which he has put them. I cannot promise that the answers I give will be more than the broad outline of why the government is doing what it is doing and how the parliamentary arrangements came about, but I will do that.


In 2011-2012 the Finance and Deregulation portfolio will be appropriated $601.1 million from Appropriation Bill (No. 1) for the ordinary annual services of the government. This will include departmental capital budget funding of $23.8 million, about $400,000 million in departmental supplementation, and administered capital funding of $3.3 million. The Finance and Deregulation portfolio will also be appropriated $210.2 million from Appropriation Bill (No. 2) for non-operating purposes.


A number of new measures were announced in the 2011-12 budget for the Finance portfolio. I will enumerate some of those. The government will provide $7.2 million over five years to increase the number of parliamentarians' personal employees by a total of 10 positions. The additional staff will allow members and senators to better manage their workload and provide them with greater capacity for consultation, understanding and decision making. The unique circumstances of the 43rd parliament have required this, both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. Members who hold critical positions have required additional resourcing and additional support, and as part of the normal process of ensuring that members of parliament can function properly we have provided additional staff in order to allow just for that. Other measures include appropriations of $2.3 million in 2011-12 to investigate and test ways to improve individuals' ease and use of access to Australian government services. This funding will be used for a scoping study, a technical pilot and business case, improvements to be explored including allowing individuals to communicate updated details to multiple agencies simultaneously, and improve filling in forms using information previously submitted to a government agency. There will also be the ability for individuals to view all of the government communications in one place.


I will say more about the idea of what the government wants later in this session, but the initiative is designed to create both a better digital environment for our citizens and better information management for government, and it is consistent with a drive over time from governments of Australia to ensure that the benefits of the digital revolution are felt by our citizens and can also be used to the advantage of government, reducing both the cost of service delivery from government and increasing the efficiency. The capacity to do this is important to our citizens and I will speak about it in detail as we progress through the session.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (16:41):  I refer the minister's reference to the $7.2 million over five years to increase the number of government and non-government personnel employees to a total of 10. Would the minister, firstly, tell me what the meaning of 'non-government' is—whom does it include—and what is the breakup of those 10 positions? In addressing those answers, could he tell me whether or not those positions were designed or went—even if they were not designed to—to Independents? I am particularly interested in the question of the national broadband network committee established to which Mr Oakeshott was appointed chairman. Presumably, he got more staff. Does that come in that entitlement or does that come in the entitlement of more money being given to the parliament? In looking at that instance, I note that that was created on 3 April by resolution of the Senate, which of course was after the New South Wales election when Mr Besseling, who was the Independent member for Port Macquarie, was voted out dramatically, that being a seat within Mr Oakeshott's own seat and the one he used to hold in the state parliament. Could you tell me whether or not part of that extra funding for additional employees was given to Mr Oakeshott so that he could employ Mr Besseling when he lost his seat of Port Macquarie?


And while I have still got three minutes to go, I will then move on to questions about the appointment of Mr Ken Henry to a position which is described as being 'supported' by the Prime Minister and Cabinet's Office, but would be financed, I guess, out of the Finance budget, because he said he is neither a consultant nor an employee but he is appointed under section 67 of the Constitution. So I would ask the minister if you could tell me: who prepared the brief for the Governor-General to make that appointment? What was the nature of the appointment? When will the appointment be gazetted? Did Mr Henry actually retire from the Public Service prior to his being appointed to this nebulous position? Was he a member of the Public Service Superannuation Fund that required him to retire at the age of no greater than 54 and 11 months to maximise his superannuation payout? Was he in fact in receipt of any superannuation payout? What is the basis upon which he is being paid his old salary of $535,000 a year, which is pro-rated according to the number of days he does, the details of which we do not need? When will the appointment be gazetted?

 (Brand—Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (16:44):  I thank the shadow minister for the questions. I will get back to you on those as is appropriate. Ken Henry is a distinguished Australian public servant. He is a public servant who has served the interests of our country well under all governments in the course of the last 20 years. He is a public servant whose high regard is such that the accolades that he has received have been extended by all sides of politics. I think all of us took great pride in the work that Ken has done throughout his years as a senior public servant. It is pleasing to see that he will continue to serve the interests of our nation in providing advice to the Prime Minister, and it is extremely important in the context of ensuring that our public servants are able to carry out their work both at the time and into the future rather than, as many do, see their knowledge and their considerable skill in serving both sides of parliament lost to this place, to the Public Service and to public administration. If we are to be successful at building a Public Service and a public administration environment—



Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The minister will take his seat. The member for Mackellar on a point of order—and she had better have a good reason, because this is a pretty free-flowing debate in the Main Committee.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: we do have a new paradigm even in the Main Committee. We are still governed by the standing orders, and the standing orders do require direct answers. That applies—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No, the standing orders do not. The member for Mackellar can resume her seat. This is not question time.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  I am sorry; the standing orders apply to more than just question time.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The standing order you are referring to refers to question time.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  I did not make clear which one, did I?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister has the call and will be heard.




Mr GRAY:
  I then move to the questions that were asked about staffing resources for Independent members of parliament. It is the case that members of parliament whose status in the parliament is as Independents have been provided with additional resources from the government. That has certainly been the case in my own state for the member for O'Connor, who found himself in a position where he sought to independently represent the people of that electorate in this place but also found himself in the position of needing support to understand the complex issues of public policy and also, being a new member of parliament, of servicing a massive constituency and dealing with the complex issues. Yes, we did think it was important to provide additional support for people in that environment. We have also provided additional staff support for other Independent members of parliament. We do this in order to create the best possible environment for such members to properly, conscientiously and purposefully serve the interests of the 43rd Parliament.


We have been explicit and transparent as a government both in making those appointments and in reporting publicly that we have done that. We think it is proper, we think it is appropriate and we think it is in the interests of the best parliamentary practice, of good governance and of good government. We do not resile from that. At the same time, when such decisions are made it is critically important to ensure that they are reported publicly and transparently and can be questioned.


I return to the point of Dr Henry, the former Secretary of the Department of the Treasury, with a couple of concluding comments. A lifetime of dedication to good public policy and good public administration should be celebrated in this country and should be applauded, especially in the context of a willingness to continue to serve the nation and to serve the good governance of the country. Dr Henry's willingness to do that has again been completely transparently and publicly reported, acknowledged and understood, so there is no great matter of discovery in the questions that refer to Dr Henry. There is, however, the important principle that I think we all would live with in this place, and that is the principle that our Public Service is a great institution that serves our country well. The people who are at the head of our Public Service are people whose years of service have built an experience base that can continue to serve us well, and we wish as a government to ensure that that can take place in whatever form and whatever way is optimal both for former public servants and for the government of the day. In summary, the questions that I have been asked go to matters that have been transparent and publicly reported by the government, behind which we see underpinned a pattern of behaviour, the hallmark of which is transparency and clarity.

 (Mackellar) (16:50):  From the minister's answer I take it that, when you referred to Mr Henry as being a public servant, you are stating that he has, in fact, not resigned from the Public Service but remains a public servant and has been reappointed. He has been on some sort of 'swinger' list. Would that be correct?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  If the member wishes the minister to answer she needs to resume her seat, I will give him the call and she will not get the time. This is not question time. It is consideration in detail. The member for Mackellar has the call.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  Thank you very much. That is question No. 1. Question No. 2 is: was Mr Oakeshott given an extra staff position after 24 March, which was the date of the state election? Let's take it from the end of that month. Was Mr Oakeshott given an extra position after the state election in New South Wales?


I also note that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is going to increase by another 200 people. Is Ms Lampe, who was the previous chief of staff to the Prime Minister and who was farewelled with great parties in February of this year, yet allegedly remained on the payroll until 3 June this year, counted as one of those 200 people? Indeed, why was she kept on? The reason given was that the Prime Minister's new chief of staff, who had worked for her when she was deputy leader, needed a four-month handover period. Was it, in fact, because she was supposed to end up with the national secretary's job—your old job, I think—but was vetoed and therefore without an income and the poor old taxpayer had to pick up the leeway? Perhaps we could understand whether she is one of those desperately needed 200 people, particularly when I notice that the Department of Human Services is going to lose 1,200 people while we will have 1,100 people on the Prime Minister's staff. It does not seem to be helping her out much, but it is a valiant effort, I suppose.


In that 200 people that she has now got on her staff, could you tell me whether or not the executive service appointment of Mr Henry has any precedent and whether precedent was relied upon? Perhaps in your answer this time you might be able to tell me who prepared the brief for the Governor-General and when we might expect it to be gazetted.

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (16:53):  There are a couple of points there. The first is whether Mr Henry on a 'swinger' list—I do not know. You would need to ask other people if he is on such a list. I doubt it. The Oakeshott staffing matter I have addressed. As for DPMC and Amanda Lampe, we made clear that Ms Lampe's continued presence on the staffing arrangements of the government was because it was part of her handover in that critical role as chief of staff for the Prime Minister.


I mentioned in my earlier comments the importance of the work which the government is doing on service delivery reforms, particularly those aimed at improving the delivery of Australian government services. The government's preliminary work on possible service delivery reforms is aimed at providing more personalised, convenient and quicker services to people. Advances in IT mean that we are able to provide innovative ways to improve service delivery to citizens and better meet the public's expectations of personalised services that are convenient and quick. It is the case that today our citizens are used to rapid services delivered from banking systems, airline booking systems and they expect the same sort of speed and quality of service from government departments. Worldwide, governments are looking at ways of delivering services that better meet the needs of individuals and that make it easier for individuals to interact with government. Today, Australians expect government services to be as intuitively easy to use, to understand and to access as they can be.


As a government we are constantly looking to see what we can do better and how we can effectively harness technological advances to improve what we are doing. Important reforms currently underway include the merging of Medicare, Centrelink and the Department of Human Services to provide a more connected and seamless service to people in the community. We are at the first step of a process of investigating the capacity for people to provide their personal information such as name and contact details, but potentially more complex information such as income and employment, to one government agency and to consent to it being used by other nominated agencies—a kind of 'tell us once' capability.


The early work is focused on testing concepts and scoping the environment for possible options. We have asked the Department of Finance and Deregulation to explore options that would allow people to communicate updated details to multiple agencies simultaneously, to prefill in forms using information previously submitted to other government agencies and to view all government communications in one place. The aim is to do away with some cumbersome processes such as those which require individuals to resubmit the same details multiple times to gain access to services. This could provide great benefits, for example, for people in crisis and emergency situations such as those affected by the recent floods and cyclones and for all Australians who may need to change their address details when moving house.


In exploring these capabilities, individual privacy is at the forefront of our minds. This exploratory work will focus on only frameworks that operate on the basis of individual consent so that any flow of the information will be controlled by the individual and not by the agencies involved. Individuals will be able to opt in and out of the facility at any time. People could choose not to opt in and could be selective about how much they make use of such a facility.


There will be no central database of people's personal information. Agencies would not be able to swap or match client information; rather, such an account would enable people to share their own information with each individual agency, should they choose to do so. We will not be merging agency databases. We are not looking to create a centralised national identity database and there is no hidden agenda.


We are exploring frameworks that will put greater control in the hands of individuals. The reason for this is to create greater efficiency and intuition in government information management systems to make more efficient for our citizens the information distribution that they provide, to create a more current and up-to-date information set about key metrics available for good public policy making and to ensure that our citizens obtain those benefits and rights that they are due to receive under our various rules for such entitlements. It is also the case that we will be doing this over time and in a way that is as effective as possible. (Time expired)

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (16:58):  As I understand it, we are now in the consideration in detail stage and we are supposed to be talking about the appropriations. The minister's speech was very nicely read, but I hardly think it was relevant to anything we have been addressing. The minister said at the beginning that he had answered my questions about Mr Oakeshott's personal staffing arrangements, and I disagree. We do not know whether or not Mr Oakeshott was given extra staff as a result of these budget allocations, which enabled him to put on extra staff after the last election in New South Wales. I specifically request an answer to that and, if he does not have it—or if any of those people sitting at the back cannot give it to him—then I would like to place that question formally on notice. I think we deserve an answer to that. With regard to the question about Ms Lampe, clearly the answer must be that the poor old Prime Minister is so incompetent that she needs two chiefs of staff, whereas when poor old Mr Rudd was bundled out the door, his chief of staff was sacked that same night. Maybe Mr Rudd was more competent than Ms Gillard and you knew it right from the beginning.




Mr Robb:
  No handover.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  No handover at all for him. Four months to handover to a bloke who had worked for her before—that is extraordinarily incompetent. 


I want to ask a question about solar panels and this building. I note that $187,870 is to be paid to Silex Solar Pty Ltd for solar panels for a rooftop trial for work between April and June. Solar panels will be installed on the roof of the Senate wing and the gardeners' compound. Was a thorough cost-benefit analysis done on the project to install these solar panels? On average, how much electricity will they generate? Will the electricity generated be fed back into the grid or will it be solely used for Parliament House? Will an outrageous payment be made for it if it is fed into the grid? If this trial proves unviable and there are negligible savings or no savings in electricity costs, will there be a further installation of solar panels at Parliament House—in other words, will the plan be abandoned? In the meantime, I note that the electricity costs for this building have gone up from $290,000 a month in September last year to $320,000 a month. Have any low-carbon solutions been put in place in the interim that may have caused this increase or is there some other reason?

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (17:01):  I thank the shadow minister for her questions. I will get back to her on the staffing arrangements for Mr Oakeshott. She asked questions about solar panels. I will have to get back to her on the details of the solar panel questions because it is important and do accept the good intentions behind the questioning. She has asked about a range of detailed matters around the operation of such panels and whether there are interconnections with the ACT grid and whether there is reselling into that grid. I am not able to provide answers to those questions at the moment but, yes, Shadow Minister, and I will come back to you as soon as I possibly can with the detail of answers to that.


I would like to continue the discussion around the new policy measures in place from the Department of Finance and Deregulation to do with information technology and embracing the new digital environment. In that context, it is important to understand the importance of cybersecurity and the investments which the government is making in cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is one of Australia's national security priorities and our approach to this issue is clearly outlined in the government's Cyber security strategy. The same principles, key actions and measures will apply in our work on service delivery reform and underpin our evaluations of options in this area.


It is extremely important to ensure that those who do not have a computer will not be disadvantaged in this new digital age. Such a capability would not exclude people who do not have access to a computer. People who choose not to opt into the system which I have described would access services as they do currently—that is, by approaching the relevant agency and providing sufficient information to establish eligibility. Members will be aware that in the context of the need to provide the Australian government with that information, there may well be people who are not digitally enabled or not able to get access to a computer in order to take advantage of such a streamlined and capable system. We still need to ensure that such people do not have the disadvantage of needing to inform the government several times before that information is held in a common way by the government. We will be taking steps to ensure that those who are not digitally enabled are able to take advantage of the technology changes. The reforms in this area are likely to be very complex and they will evolve over time. They will need to be considered as long-term projects, subject to the government deciding to invest in competing frameworks. We will work closely consult widely with all relevant stakeholders, users of Australian Government services, privacy interest groups, Australian Government departments et cetera in developing the future reform options in this area. However, at this stage what is happening is that the government is trying to scope the nature of a possible framework that it might want to go into. The government is not, at this point, considering whether to introduce the new service delivery arrangements. What the government is doing is considering the possibility of the service of informing the government once of a range of personal details that our citizens hold and that they may require to provide to multiple government agencies.


These reforms are an extremely important part of what we call, in general, the digital democracy and enabling our community to better contact, access and obtain information from governments. As the NBN rollout across the nation continues, the capacity to do this becomes more and more important. The current budget includes funding for the Department of Finance and Deregulation to assist in the oversight of a new entity to ensure—




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, consideration in detail is designed for information to be sought by members who wish to have more information about the appropriations bills dealing with particular areas. The way in which this is occurring right now does seem to be contrary to the intent and to the way in which the standing orders are framed, in that questions have been asked, the minister is unable to answer the questions and then he merely reads out material about issues that have not been dealt with at all in the questions.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  I am listening to the minister and I feel that he is within the parameters of the portfolio. I did not hear the question that was framed earlier because I was not here, so I am not going to make a ruling on this particular issue, but he is within his portfolio area, from what I understand. There is no point of order.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  The point of order is this: this is a part under the standing orders designed for members to ask questions about the appropriations. There were no questions asked relating to the material that the minister is merely reading out and taking up time with, thereby denying people their proper function.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister will continue.




Mr GRAY:
  The ability through this session to provide detail of the government's initiatives in the budget is extremely important and, Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for allowing me to conclude some areas of discussion around the initiatives in the digital economy.

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (17:08):  As my colleague the member for Mackellar has raised it would be beneficial, Mr Deputy Speaker, if we were to receive some detailed responses. We have lots of issues that we would like to go through. Whilst the minister has been giving us lots of wonderful detail about the budget papers, most of it I have read already. Perhaps we can take some of that material as read.


Much was made ahead of the budget—especially by the minister the minister is representing, by the Treasurer and by the Prime Minister—about the toughness of this budget. In that regard I would like to refer the minister to the table on page 10-6 of Budget Paper No. 1. I would be grateful if the minister could explain why government spending, as a percentage of GDP, has been higher in every year of office of this government. The forward estimates in the budget papers show spending in the last year of the Howard government at 22.9 per cent of GDP and since that time, and all the way through to 2014-15, the best that happens is 23.5 per cent. There is a consistent pattern of a government that is claiming to bring down an extraordinarily tough budget, that is going to take pressure off small and medium business who are seeking finance, continuing to borrow $135 million every day and putting enormous pressure on others looking for finance. They are adding to interest rates, which is adding to exchange rate pressures and adding to the cost of taking out mortgages and getting finance.


On all fronts the spending of this government is critical to economic outcomes and the cost of living pressures faced by households and the pressures faced by businesses, and yet the government, whilst talking about a tough budget, has laid out a four-year program which is still a country mile from spending levels, as a percentage of GDP, under the previous government. I would like to know why there has not been any effort to keep spending as a percentage of GDP below 2007-08 levels, as is the case with taxation receipts. The government has made a particular point about not going higher with taxation receipts than the previous government but, when it comes to spending, it sees no reason to make the same provision. This seems to be a significant inconsistency and I would appreciate an explanation for that.


From the point of view of a tough budget and the difficulty being faced by many in the economy and the uncertainty that currently exists, the reason for that uncertainty is that people have gone from minus one per cent savings to 11½ per cent, so something close to $70 billion has not been spent this year that would have been spent in a typical year. It is no wonder the retail sector is on its knees. That is a function of uncertainty. People are anxious about what might lie ahead. Do we have some sort of satisfactory protection or resilience against future economic shocks? The structural deficit within the budget is a critical factor. Why has the government not featured the structural deficit estimates over future years? If any of the assumptions for receipts or expenditure are out, the structural deficit could cause enormous problems and increase anxiety in the community. Why, as distinct from 2009-10 when they were featured strongly, has the government not this year featured the structural deficit figures? (Time expired)

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (17:13):  I thank the shadow minister for his question but it is almost as though he missed the fact that there was a global financial crisis. It is almost as though, in his commentary, he ignores the reality of government measures to support employment across the economy. Employment was under threat in every single sector, from retailing through to construction, through to the agricultural sector and in vehicle building—in every way our economy was threatened and so the government put in place measures in the third quarter of 2008 and throughout 2009. All were opposed by those opposite, and opposed for reasons entirely of basic politics. That means that the successful defence of jobs and the support of economic activity is due entirely to the quick action of the Australian government. It has been action roundly applauded both internationally and, most importantly, in local communities where jobs have been preserved, businesses have been kept intact and families have not been ripped apart by the devastating impact of high unemployment. I think it is also important that the shadow minister concedes that the current federal government has a lower, smaller taxation footprint than did its predecessor. Indeed, it is a proud tradition of the Australian Labor Party that we are not a high-taxing government, in comparison to the government that we replaced in 2007. The taxation of our community of course is the removal of funds from our community for use by government, and it is important that that footprint be proportionate and appropriate. It is revealed in the budget figures, as I am sure the shadow minister has fully understood and his reflections here demonstrate, that the low-taxing Australian government is able to do that because of both the efficiency of the way in which the Australian government spends money and the effectiveness of the way in which the Australian government raises its revenue. It is inevitably the case that because of that the massive measures that had to be undertaken to protect employment, to ensure that industries and commerce continued to operate throughout the tough and dark years and the very tough and dark weeks and months of the global financial crisis, could be supported by the rapid action of the Australian government.


We also made clear that, as a consequence of the measures that we undertook, the government does see the budget moving into surplus. The government does see the importance of those measures. And the government, through its fiscal discipline, is moving to ensure that the budget returns to surplus as quickly as it possibly can. Why do we do that? We spend money when we have to and we do not spend money when we do not have to. We spend money in order to protect employment and to protect our community. As the honourable member well knows, we spent large amounts of that money building enduring community infrastructure: enduring infrastructure that will be used to educate future generations of Australians; enduring infrastructure that will provide hospitals and roads; enduring infrastructure—ports, rail infrastructure—to support economic activity. It was about providing infrastructure that will survive generations, but a decision which was taken in order to support employment, to support our economy and to support our community.


You asked the question, quite reasonably: how is the government able to maintain its extremely low taxation footprint? The answer to that, very clearly, is through tough fiscal discipline, through insight and thoughtfulness in the way in which the government structures its own spending programs and through ensuring that our taxation footprint remains smaller, that the tax paid by our community remains proportionately less, than it did in any year under the Howard government. It is an astonishing performance, a remarkable performance, but one that we will continue. (Time expired)

Ms RISHWORTH:
  It is pretty exciting.




Mr GRAY:
  And I have to say that, I think like all of us present, especially when contemplating McLaren Vale shiraz, we would all prefer not to be doing it in a cyber way; we would prefer to be doing it in a real and genuine way. It is an important question to go to current initiatives in the budget that deal with the National Broadband Network. In particular there is funding provided for in the current budget through the Department of Finance and Deregulation to assist in the oversight of the new entity to manage the universal service obligation that comes with the National Broadband Network. On 20 June 2010 NBN Co. Ltd and Telstra announced an agreement and the rollout of the National Broadband Network. In support of that agreement the government announced policy reforms to support the transition to the National Broadband Network environment including the implementation of an institutional regulatory and funding regime for the delivery of the universal service obligation and other public interest services and that is what we dealt with in this budget.


Earlier, on 10 February 2011, the government announced that it had reached an in-principle agreement with Telstra for the package of measures announced by the government in June 2010 to facilitate the transition to the National Broadband Network. These reforms included establishing the new entity which will function from July 2012 and to provide funding that will ensure that all Australians have reasonable access to a standard telephone service—the universal service obligation for voice telephony services—and ensure that pay phones are reasonably accessible to all Australians—the universal service obligation for pay phones. It will also include emergency call handling, the triple 0 and 112 numbers, and the national relay service. There will be migration of voice only customers to a fibre based service as Telstra's copper exchanges are decommissioned and the development of technological solutions for continuity of public interest services such as public alarm systems and traffic lights. There will be $1.2 million over five years provided to the Department of Finance and Deregulation to assist in managing the government oversight of the new entity that will be established to manage this universal service obligation.


Given the government's significant financial investment in maintaining the continuity of voice services to Australians, appropriate oversight of this entity is required. Currently, no resources are provided for that function. The Department of Finance and Deregulation will provide advice to government on the governance structure of the new entity and monitoring of the ongoing strategy and performance of the entity including in relation to complex financial matters including the government's financial investment, the USO regulatory environment and related legislation, appointments and performance, stakeholder management between NBN Co. Ltd during the rollout of the National Broadband Network and with the broader telecommunications industry and other related matters.


Those initiatives are part of the all-of-government response that embraces both the reality and the possibilities that are presented by NBN. We know the language and we are commonly understanding the language of government 2.0—it has been around for five or six years—and it denotes a kind of government that has as its hallmark the ability to reach out, the ability to listen to, the ability to insightfully interpret the communities that engage with it and importantly the ability to provide information to our citizens in a timely and efficient manner. That was never more poignantly demonstrated than during the emergencies that our country faced in January and February of this year. The developments in government 2.0 and in cloud computing simply allow the government to be more embracing of the communities that we represent and allow us to deliver in an effective and efficient way. With the development of the capacity represented by the NBN Co. and the requirement to attend to the universal service obligation facilities that we are commonly understanding are part of large and complex utilities then we can see that the all-of-government approach to supporting the activities of NBN Co. is underpinned by the work that is done in the department of the digital economy and also in the department of finance.

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (17:24):  The last opportunity I had I asked about the government's spending performance. The minister spent most of his time debating previous budgets. I would be very happy to do that but the session is designed to debate, discuss and seek detail about the current budget. The current budget is struck in a climate where the terms of trade are at 140-year highs—not a bad climate in which to manage an economy. The current budget is struck at a time when we have a labour shortage with the changing demographics in the economy and the skills required for the mining sector, and an unemployment level just under five per cent. The point was made by the minister that they have had a very rigorous fiscal program, notwithstanding the global financial crisis. Given the fact that we are seeing terms of trade at 140-year highs and that those levels are expected to continue during the course of the next four years, how is it that the government appear incapable at the end of that four years to be within a bull's roar of the level of expenditure as a proportion of GDP that was brought down by the last government? That is question No. 1.


Secondly, the minister said that the government is able to maintain its low-taxation footprint because of the extraordinary capabilities of the Treasurer and his colleagues. The fact is that the reason the government has been able to maintain taxation levels lower than the previous government is that it did not include major items in its budget. For instance, it did not include the carbon tax. Minister, why did the government not include the carbon tax as it did two years ago in its expenditure items? If it had done that, it would have grossly exceeded the taxation formula and percentage of GDP of the last government. 


The other point I would like to make is that the minister made absolutely no reference to the $107 billion debt. The fact of the matter is if you borrow like a wounded bull, you do not have to tax as much. Notwithstanding that, this government have brought in a carbon tax, a mining tax, a flood tax, a luxury car tax, a cigarette tax—taxes ad nauseam. They are a high-taxing government, but they have deferred taxation. When there is $107 billion debt that is deferred taxation—it will have to be paid off by taxation in the future. They are shifting the burden onto us, so that whenever we get the opportunity and privilege of government we will have to clean-up the mess they leave. Minister, why is this government not exercising the sort of restraint that would be considered in the middle of a 140-year high in terms of trade and in the middle of a world which is potentially likely to move into a double-dip recession? Why is the government not trying to protect and restore the resilience that this government inherited in terms of the economic conditions?

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (17:28):  Today, Australia enjoys a taxation arrangement whereby the proportion of taxation paid by Australians is less than it was in the last year of the Howard government. It is a simple undeniable fact. It is something that the current government takes great pride in and something that the Australian community takes great relief from. All I hear from members opposite is the preference to tax and to spend, which is something that Australians have never supported. Australians support governments that are capable of keeping their house in financial order and we have said and stated clearly that the budget will be in surplus in the time frame that we have described. We have stated clearly that our taxation footprint is smaller than at any year under the previous government and continues to be the case. Furthermore, we are able to do that because of the extraordinary measures which the government have been prepared to take to better frame our budget and our spending priorities.



Mr Robb interjecting—




Mr GRAY:
  The shadow minister interjects, making reference to a carbon tax that is not yet in place. I hear the member opposite lamenting that the tighter fiscal discipline executed by the current government ensured a capacity for our nation to better weather the global financial crisis, to be better positioned and better prepared for the recovery in Australia and to be better prepared and better able to deal with the terms of trade that we currently see. I thank the members for their questions and I take on notice those questions which I have indicated I will. I will come back to them in a timely fashion with answers to those matters.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:30):  As members are aware, this year's budget was framed at a defining moment for our economy against a backdrop of natural disasters at home and overseas, softer economic conditions in the near term and a return to boom conditions that will stretch our economy's capacity over the coming years. In this context, the government's focus with this budget has been clear: to bring the budget back to surplus, to invest in skills and training and to get more Australians into work. 


This budget responds to Australia's workforce needs through better and more targeted skills and training and new measures to boost participation. The budget expands our healthcare system, invests in infrastructure, makes regional Australia a better place to live and continues to assist families. In line with these strategies, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has 11 new measures in this budget, including the impact of the temporary increase in the efficiency dividend.


Furthering our commitment to mental health, the government will provide $24.4 million over four years to establish Australia's first National Mental Health Commission. This is part of very large new funding for mental health services. The Gillard government is strongly committed to planning more effectively for the future mental health needs of our country, creating greater accountability and transparency in the mental health system and giving mental health prominence at a national level. The National Mental Health Commission will be established within the Prime Minister's portfolio and, through the Prime Minister, will report back to parliament, bringing a truly whole-of-government focus to the task of mental health reform.


In addition to this significant new investment in mental health, this budget provides $6.5 million over four years to maintain support for the delivery of the Council of Australian Government's reform agenda—an important agenda which is aimed at improving the wellbeing of Australians now and into the future. This budget provides for a $5 million donation in 2010-11 to the New Zealand Red Cross earthquake appeal to help with the earthquake recovery effort. These funds are helping in the immediate recovery and in getting Christchurch back on its feet after one of New Zealand's darkest days. Indeed, we have had the opportunity this week, with the visit of New Zealand Prime Minister John Key and his address to a joint sitting of both houses, to convey our direct sympathies to the people of New Zealand for the events of this year, which regrettably are continuing.


This budget provides $2 million over three years to the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney to further inform policy discussions on Australia's alliance with the United States. The budget also provides for a departmental contribution of $168,000 over two years to fund the Commonwealth's involvement in the commission of inquiry into the Queensland floods.


In the arts, this budget provides $1.6 million across the forward estimates for the Contemporary Music Touring Program to provide grants for professional artists to perform original contemporary Australian music in regional and remote Australia where this otherwise would be commercially unviable. In order to support this new investment, this budget will deliver savings of $1.6 million over four years from the GetReading! program by promoting books and reading in a more cost-effective way, including utilising digital technology and e-publishing. This budget delivers on our election commitment to provide $10 million over five years in additional support for Australian artwork. In a significant contribution to Australian sport the government will provide up to $38 million to the organisation and staging of the 2015 Asian Football Confederation Asian Cup and to ensure the sustainability of football in the lead-up to the event. In addition, this budget provides some $4.6 million over five years to establish a task force to coordinate the Commonwealth's role in supporting the cup.


The government will achieve further savings of $5.6 million over four years from 2010-11 from the testing and research components of the Illicit Drugs in Sport Program and the research component of the Sport Anti-Doping Program. These savings will be redirected to support other government priorities such as the extension to the Active After-school Communities program. I commend the appropriation to the House.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (17:35):  Before I ask specific questions, I would like to have some indication as to whether the parliamentary secretary is going to adopt the practice of the minister previously, which is: if he cannot give an answer to a question he continues to read out blurb from the budget papers, which in no way responds to the question asked and just takes up five minutes of time, or whether we can go to the practice that used to pertain in this consideration in detail—which, if you like, is more of an estimates hearing for the lower house—whereby we can ask a question, have it responded to and have a to-and-fro of information without someone from the government getting up and speaking for five minutes and then the minister taking another five minutes and wasting the entire period.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  Order! The member for Mackellar will resume her seat. I ask the member for Mackellar whether her question is to the chair or whether it is part of her five-minute consideration in detail to the parliamentary secretary? I think you are asking the question of me. Is that correct?




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  No. It is a question to the parliamentary secretary. I do not think you would know what is in the mind of the parliamentary secretary. I am making the point that this whole process has really become something of a farce, which it never used to be before. It used to be used to elicit useful information and specific answers to questions. I might be kind to the parliamentary secretary and say that this was the practice that existed before he came to this place. It is a new and novel development that we are seeing here. With that prefix to my questions I will be interested to hear his response.


The questions that I specifically would like answers to relate to the funding of a review of illegal boat arrivals and the Ombudsman. I notice in budget paper No. 2 in the Prime Minister and Cabinet section that $900,000 has been earmarked over two years to continue the Ombudsman's scrutiny of processing refugee claims for irregular maritime arrivals by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. The budget paper claims that the funding will be used out of the Ombudsman's current resources. My first question that I would like a response to is: what duties will that mean that the Ombudsman cannot do that he would otherwise would have done with those resources, because $900,000 of his money has been earmarked for this specific purpose? My second question is: in 2007-08 there were 25 unauthorised arrivals. That was the result of our effective Pacific Solution policy, which of course was ended by the government in 2008 and the boat arrivals started to arrive. In 2009-10 there were 5,614 arrivals. If we start to see an increase, or the increase as we have seen continues, will the Ombudsman need more than $900,000 to fund these claims, and if he does will he be able to get that from an advance from the minister for finance or some other mechanism?


My third question is: by giving this responsibility, to the Ombudsman, does this effectively amount to a vote of no confidence in the department of immigration which I note has had its numbers increased to carry out its tasks? My fourth question is: does the scrutiny process entail reviewing every single refugee application, or doing a random sample of applications? Is there an anticipated individual assessment cost for each inquiry it makes? A further question is, has the scrutiny which the Ombudsman has already carried out revealed an increased number of refugee claims from irregular maritime arrivals in the past three years, and can we have precise details of that?

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:40):  If I could first start with the procedural inquiry that was raised by the member for Mackellar. It was apparently some kind of expression of concern about the way in which the government here in the consideration in detail of appropriations is answering the questions. I listened intently to the previous consideration in detail over the hour that the Special Minister of State was answering questions posed by members of the opposition.



Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting—




Mr DREYFUS:
  What I heard very directly was the Special Minister of State indicating very clearly to opposition members in response to their questions that he would take on notice a range of the questions in respect of which—



Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting—




Mr DREYFUS:
  I listened in silence to the member for Mackellar and I think she should do me the same favour. I listened to the Special Minister of State taking on notice in saying he would get back honourable members in a timely fashion. That is how he ended his session here in consideration in detail. So I can assure the member for Mackellar that certainly we will be answering questions, and indeed if the member for Mackellar had looked at Hansard, because she was not here yesterday, she would have seen that I was here in the consideration in detail of the appropriations for the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency attending with the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Both of us answered questions and I think that were she to consult Hansard she would see that I indeed answered the opposition's questions from yesterday. Going to the question about the Ombudsman's $900,000 indicated for scrutiny of processing refugee claims, and the indication that he is—




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  No, asylum seeker claims.




Mr DREYFUS:
  Sorry, I am sure that you had said refugee claims, but we will take it as asylum seeker claims, which he is going to fund from current resources. With respect to the other questions that were directed to apparently additional unauthorised arrivals. Can I say that it is an excellent measure that the Ombudsman is now undertaking additional scrutiny for processing asylum seeker claims. Implied in the member for Mackellar's question is the suggestion that perhaps this scrutiny is not warranted. I can assure the House that this scrutiny is absolutely warranted, and it is reflective of much greater care in the way in which these asylum seeker claims are being handled, and indeed much greater care in the way in which the entire system is being run.


I need only refer in that regard to the appalling compensation bill that the Commonwealth is still facing, arising from people, some of them Australian citizens, detained in the immigration detention system by the Howard government before August 2007. There is a budget item that relates to the compensation bill. It is now over $16 million and these cases, and the compensation provision that is having to be made, almost all relate to the 247 cases that were referred by the department to the Ombudsman following the Palmer inquiry and the Comrie report with such notorious cases as the case of Vivian Solon, falsely deported from Australia by the former government, or Cornelia Rau, improperly and illegally detained over an extended period by the former government as a result of the appalling mismanagement of the immigration detention system by the former government and the lack of scrutiny, scrutiny which is now to be provided by the Ombudsman as indicated in the budget papers. The member for Mackellar was referring to the claim that in 2007 there were some 25 unauthorised arrivals, which of course is held out by the opposition as some claim to the success of their policies. It was no such thing. As I have just indicated, arising from the mismanagement of the immigration detention system, under the Howard government there were much larger numbers of people in immigration detention, an indication why we need to have scrutiny. We need the Ombudsman looking at these things. (Time expired)

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (17:46):  Thank you for those non-answers, Parliamentary Secretary Dreyfus. I see that we are going to continue in this vein. I would ask you then the specific questions that I asked to be taken on notice and that you let me have them as soon as possible. I will try one more specific question. Considering the deal that your government is proposing with Malaysia, with the disgraceful trade in human flesh, whereby Australia sends one person to Malaysia to be either tagged or subject to Malaysian law and birchings, and we in return will receive five refugees who have been approved by the Malaysian government, does the $900 cover the costs of the Ombudsman scrutinising each one of those exchanges, those vile exchanges? If so, when will he be reporting upon them? Is that part of the government's overall plan? That is question No.1.


Question No. 2 for this section. I want to now turn to the Australian National Audit Office where there is outlined an expenditure of nearly $2 million to be spent on conducting a financial statement audit of the National Broadband Network and the NBN Tasmania between 1 April 2011 and 30 October 2013. I note that there is no confidentiality clause in the contract despite the government repeatedly making the excuse that much of the NBN's activities are commercial-in-confidence and that any scrutiny of this $50 billion project is impossible. In light of those things, is the audit which is to be conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers a comprehensive audit and will its cover all income and expenditure aspects of the NBN and NBN Tasmania? That is question 2(a).


Question 2(b) is: will the audited financial statement be published? 2(c), if so, how often will the audited financial statements be published and, if they are not to be published, why not? 2(d), how regularly will financial statements be audited and how often will the government receive audited financial statements from the auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers? Are you aware of any other companies who have been asked to conduct an audit of the NBN? And what audits of financial statements of the NBN had been conducted to date? At what cost would these audits have been done? Will the cost of the audit be included in the overall cost of the NBN, which, the best we can guess is likely to be $50 billion? They are very specific questions and if the parliamentary secretary is unable to answer those specific questions, I would simply ask him to take them on notice and reply in that way or, if he has specific information, I would very pleased to receive it.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2011-06-21,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:49):  They are very specific questions that have just been asked by the member for Mackellar. Before going to them, I had not quite completed my answer in relation to the Ombudsman, in respect of whom I need to point out that he is a statutory office holder. I certainly will take the more detailed questions that the member for Mackellar asked about the Ombudsman on notice and will endeavour to get a response to the member for Mackellar in a timely fashion.


At the moment the portfolio budget statement indicates, as the member for Mackellar said—and I have checked this—that there is a $900,000 measure to be funded from internal sources, so I will take those on notice. In respect of the detailed questions about the Australian National Audit Office, the Auditor-General is also a statutory office holder. Insofar as those questions relate to that statutory office holder, I will take them on notice as well. But the detailed questions that were asked about the NBN are misdirected and really need to be directed to the communications portfolio. I am sure that the member for Mackellar has means available in which she can so direct.


The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet does provide the Prime Minister with policy advice on matters that relate to the National Broadband Network, but the implementation of the National Broadband Network is the responsibility of NBN Co., its shareholder ministers and their respective departments, which are Senator Conroy and his Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, and Senator Wong and her Department of Finance and Deregulation. It is the case that senior officials from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet attend the National Broadband Network implementation steering committee, which covers a range of departments. But the kind of detailed financial questions relating to the NBN really should be directed to the department of communications.


To conclude—insofar as there is some information being sought in relation to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet appropriation—the government, through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, engaged the investment bank Greenhill Caliburn in November 2010 to review the NBN Co. corporate plan. The cost of that engagement was $1.1 million including GST, plus about $8,000 in expenses.


The other question the member for Mackellar asked, as best as I understood it, was about the current status of the negotiations with Malaysia—with some quite pejorative and needlessly, but typically, inflammatory statements made about this area of policy which I do not accept for a moment. I need to make it clear that, in answering this question, I reject entirely the way in which it was framed and put and the language used by the member for Mackellar, including her use of the word 'disgraceful'. The only thing which is disgraceful about the discussion of the negotiations with Malaysia is the way in which the opposition is approaching this question. There are advanced negotiations with Malaysia and with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Those discussions are progressing well. The talks are being conducted in a spirit of great goodwill. It is a very detailed arrangement. It is very important that we get it right. As the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has said, further details will be announced in the coming weeks. Our government is committed to breaking the people smugglers business model and to deterring people from making dangerous sea journeys so that we will not have a repetition of the tragic event that occurred on Christmas Island late last year.



While we are talking about 'disgraceful', what is actually disgraceful is that the member for Cook is now saying that he is going to visit Malaysia. It is apparent that the Leader of the Opposition is so worried that the arrangement with Malaysia is going to work and work well that he is sending the member for Cook for another stunt—another dumb stunt, I might say—to Kuala Lumpur in a deliberate attempt to wreck the current negotiations, and, indeed, while they are about it, to wreck our relations with Malaysia. It is a disgraceful act. It is an incredibly destructive stunt by the opposition and it amazes me that anyone who is contending for national leadership in this country, as is the Leader of the Opposition, would authorise one of his spokespeople to go to one of our regional neighbours for this purpose.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (17:54):  The minister failed to answer my specific question relating to the disgraceful and despicable deal that his government is doing with Malaysia to trade in human flesh. I find the so-called solution absolutely reprehensible. I am astounded the parliamentary secretary can stand there and attempt to defend it. The very specific question I asked him was: can you tell me whether the Ombudsman, out of his $900,000, will be reviewing each of those transfers should the deal be completed so that we will know whether people have been tagged like cattle to be immune from birching or whether they will be subject to Malaysian law and subject to the birching that is part of that law? That was my specific question, and I note he failed to answer it.


I now want to go to appointments to the Prime Minister's staff. I did ask some of these questions of the Special Minister of State, but he was unable to provide any information. We might get some from you. First of all, Amanda Lampe, who was the chief of staff to the Prime Minister, was farewelled with great parties in February but remained on the public payroll until, I understand, 3 June. Could the parliamentary secretary tell me, the rest of the parliament and the public generally why it was deemed necessary for there to be a four-month handover from Ms Lampe to Mr Hubbard, who had previously worked for the Prime Minister. Was it due to the incompetence of the Prime Minister that she needed two private secretaries? Was it the fact that Ms Lampe needed an income because she did not get the national secretary's job? You might then be able to confirm for me that she left the Public Service on 3 June and confirm for me that she has not been offered another position.


My second set of questions relates to Mr Ken Henry. I did ask the minister whether Mr Henry had left the Public Service. I ask that as a very specific question. If he has left the Public Service, is there any policy in place that says someone who has left the Public Service may not be re-engaged on what used to be referred to as a Friday-to-Monday appointment, which was used by people who were under the old Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme? To maximise their return they must leave no later than being 54 years and 11 months of age. I notice that Mr Henry is about to turn 54. 


If Mr Henry is still a public servant, what is the nature of the leave that has been referred to in the newspaper? Is it leave without pay? Is he still being paid at the rate of $535,000 a year? If not, could you give me the details? What is the specific nature of the appointment by the Governor-General under section 67 of the Constitution that requires this appointment to be made in this way? If you examine precedent, the sorts of people who are appointed by the Governor-General usually have not included former heads of departments onto the staff of the Prime Minister. 


I note in the press that it has been said that he is neither a consultant nor an employee—it is a mystical appointment—but he will be supported by Prime Minister and Cabinet. I would be grateful for details of what that support entails and precisely what the nature of his duties will be. I also asked the minister when the appointment will be gazetted and why it has not already been gazetted.


Perhaps I could have some specific answers to those questions. If I cannot have specific answers today, would the parliamentary secretary please take those questions on notice and give me specific answers as soon as possible.

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2011-06-21,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:59):  I will start with Dr Ken Henry's appointment. The questions that I have just been asked seem to have been drawn from various instances of misreporting in the media. It has been made very clear that Dr Ken Henry AC has been appointed by the Governor-General as a special adviser and his senior appointment was announced on 1 June 2011. The result of this appointment is that Dr Henry's extensive knowledge and experience are going to continue to be a valuable resource, and I am pleased that those skills are going to continue to be available to the Australian government.


Dr Henry has had a very distinguished Public Service career which spanned more than 25 years, 10 of which were spent as the secretary to the Treasury. In that time Dr Henry has made major contributions to the wellbeing of Australians and to the prosperity of the nation, not least of which was the extraordinary, timely and invaluable advice he provided to the government with the onset of the global financial crisis. His appointment does not require a gazettal—there seems to be a misapprehension on the part of the member for Mackellar in that part of her question. He is appointed by the Governor-General. He is presently being remunerated at secretary level, but he is expected to work part time and will be paid on a pro rata basis.


I can point out that the most recent appointment under section 67 was that of Mr Fergus Ryan as strategic investment coordinator, and this expired in 2002. Other examples include Dr Paul Twomey as chief executive officer of the National Office for the Information Economy, Ms Gwenyth Andrews as chief executive of the Australian Greenhouse Office and Mr Michael Hutchinson as chief executive of the Office of Asset Sales and Information Technology, all in 1998—these appointments were made by the Howard government. It is a process recognised under the Constitution and it should be a surprise to anyone here that the opposition were expressing concern about it. We have a distinguished Australian who has provided distinguished service to the nation. It is an excellent thing that Dr Henry is going to continue to be able to provide service to the people of Australia.


Another question asked by the member for Mackellar related to the Prime Minister's former chief of staff Amanda Lampe. Again, as I indicated to the member for Mackellar in relation to some of her earlier questions, that question needs to be addressed to the finance portfolio, since prime ministerial staff are not paid out of the appropriation under consideration here for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It is the responsibility of the department of finance to operate the MOPS ministerial and parliamentary staff system.


The other matter is one that the member for Mackellar pursued, using inappropriate language and the word 'disgraceful' in relation to present negotiations with Malaysia, and asserting that I had not answered her earlier question about whether the Ombudsman would be reviewing each possible transfer under the yet-to-be-concluded arrangements with Malaysia. The question that she actually asked when she first stood up to ask about the Malaysia arrangement was in relation to whether or not the government would be making public details of the arrangement, not the question that the member for Mackellar now asserts that I have not answered. Again, it is a question that is better directed to— (Time expired)

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (18:04):  We can check Hansard to see the context of my question. My intent was clear to me; I am sorry it was not clear to you. But thank you for those answers. I will go again to the question of Dr Henry. You did not tell me whether or not he has left the Public Service or, if he has left, when he left. You said that he has been appointed as a special adviser, without saying to whom he is special adviser. You have said that he has been appointed to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and that is useful, but I would like to know the terms and conditions of his appointment. 


The parliamentary secretary has been at great pains to say that Dr Henry was a great public servant. In the eyes of many that may well have been true during much of his career, but at the end he certainly became very partisan. I am not at all surprised that he has been given this rather political appointment to take up advising the Prime Minister—




Mr Dreyfus:
  He was appointed by the Howard government.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  Yes; that was a mistake, I think. I am not surprised at this appointment, particularly since you have a Treasurer who is seen by the electorate as ineffectual and not across his portfolio at all. I can understand why you would want someone with more expertise around to give better advice. Nonetheless, I would like to know the terms and conditions of the appointment and why it was done under section 67 of the Constitution. There is no adequate reason. You made some comparisons and I can find you many other appointments made under section 67 of the Constitution, but I find it very difficult to find any precedent where a political appointment has been made, to assist the Prime Minister via the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, under section 67. All the other appointments are ones where there is a provision in legislation that the appointment be made under section 67.


I saw an official shake his head, but if he can find an example and convey it to the parliamentary secretary of anyone who has been appointed under that section by the Governor-General, as a political appointee, to assist the Prime Minister and advise the Prime Minister via the department, I would be very pleased to hear about it. Perhaps, when he is advising the parliamentary secretary on that issue, he could help him give the answer to what the terms and conditions are and what the job specification is for the position to which Mr Henry has been appointed. But I would particularly like to know whether he left the Public Service and is coming back as a contractor.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (18:08):  Dr Henry ended his appointment as Secretary to the Treasury on 26 April 2011 and he commenced in his new role as special adviser upon being appointed by the Governor-General. His duties are to be determined in discussions with the Prime Minister. I need to make it as clear as I possibly can to the member for Mackellar that this is not a political appointment, that the government does not accept her characterisation of the appointment of Dr Henry under section 67 as a political appointment and, further, that the comments that the member for Mackellar has just made to this House—that Dr Henry, when he ended his distinguished career or apparently at some unspecified point towards the end of his distinguished career, became partisan—are a disgrace. That is a disgraceful comment to make. We have here, in Dr Henry, someone who has served our nation for 25 years, 10 of them spent as Secretary to the Treasury. He was of course appointed as Secretary to the Treasury by the Howard government. After taking a well-earned period of leave, he will return to part-time government service, the terms of which will be determined in consultation with the Prime Minister later in the year. I want to take further issue with the whole way in which the member for Mackellar has sought to characterise this appointment. A legion of appointments have been made by successive Australian governments, not only under section 67 but in a range of other ways, sometimes not even under statutory authority or specifically under a particular provision of the Constitution but under the executive power of the Commonwealth. It is open to a Commonwealth government to appoint anyone in any capacity to serve the government, and it would be a sorry day if it were otherwise.


The government is entitled to engage the services of anyone to serve this nation if it is for the better government of the Commonwealth. It is not necessary to point to precedent. It is not necessary to point to anything other than the constitutional authority conferred on the government. Nor do we need to look for particular statutory authority because there is a whole range of conventions and institutions that serve the Commonwealth that nobody queries, other than those opposite, who wish to query governmental arrangements that they themselves have used on numerous occasions in government. They wish to challenge them because they are now in opposition and they wish to simply nit-pick or raise problems where none exist.


It is entirely appropriate that Dr Ken Henry, a distinguished Australian appointed to his former post by the former government and having served Australia well over many years, should continue to provide service to the people of Australia. Insofar as there is anything left of the question by the member for Mackellar I will take it on notice and provide anything more that might be needed to answer her questions in a timely fashion.


I would take issue also with her proposition that the examples that I gave of other appointments during the term of the former government, being Mr Fergus Ryan, Dr Paul Twomey, Ms Gwenyth Andrews, Mr Michael Hutchison, were not legislatively required to be made under section 67 of the Constitution. It is a facility put there when the Constitution was drafted in order to make it very clear that the Commonwealth will have at its disposal appropriate services of people with expertise, who could be employed in the manner envisaged by section 67 of the Constitution, as appointments of the Governor-General.


I reject on behalf of the government in the strongest possible terms the connotations which the member for Mackellar has sought to put on the engagement of Dr Henry or indeed the characterisation of his appointment by the member for Mackellar as a partisan or political appointment, which it is certainly not.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (18:12):  Thank you for the rhetoric. I stand by the comments I made earlier and I would simply ask you again: is Mr Henry still a member of the public service? If not, when did he retire, what is his position and what are the terms and conditions of his appointment? How is it possible that the government can legitimately ask the Governor-General to appoint Mr Henry at a salary of $535,000 a year without knowing what the job is?


He is no longer a person employed as the head of a department where the salary of $535,000 is established by the Remuneration Tribunal. He is now someone who is merely being appointed to assist the Prime Minister with advice of a political nature and he is being paid at the same level as the head of Treasury. I think the Australian people are entitled to know why the appointment is being made with no terms and conditions, no understanding of what the contract is or what his responsibilities are. And how you can possibly justify him being paid at the rate of the head of Treasury? I think it is an absolute disgrace but typical of the attitude of this government that thinks it can do anything in a panic to try and get some advice, which it thinks might help it out of a hole. If Mr Henry is still a member of the Public Service then I would like to know why he was not appointed in the ordinary way as a member of the executive service. Why was the decision taken to use section 67? Was it because this was the only way in which he could be paid this extraordinary amount of money, and otherwise he would be captured by a determination of the tribunal?


The parliamentary secretary can sit there and smirk all he likes. The bottom line is that this is taxpayers' money. We heard from the shadow minister for finance today that we are in debt wholly and solely due to the incompetence of this government—and, I might add, under the watch of the same Mr Henry as the head of Treasury, who backed up the extraordinary expenditure. We have only to look at your track record. We have only to look at pink batts, the waste of money in the BER or the $900 that went out to dead people or to people who lived overseas, only for us to be told, 'Oh, this is all perfectly ordinary.'


I asked you to give me one—just one—example of where anybody else had appointed a political appointee—that is, someone who was not part of a determination and was not someone like the sorts of people that you identified as being appointed quite properly under section 67. I asked you to give me one name of somebody who was appointed to a golden job with no job specification at $535,000 a year while still on leave, and you do not expect me to be outraged by that. Of course I am outraged by it. So I ask you again: is he still a member of the Public Service? If not, when did he leave? What are the terms and conditions? When will we know the terms and conditions of this supposed job? How can you possibly justify that salary when there is no job for him to go to? And what are the terms and conditions of his leave?


I simply sum up by saying that this epitomises the attitude that this government has to the people of Australia: you are totally unaccountable and totally without consideration of the way things should be done properly, whether it is sending people in a trade of human flesh to Malaysia to be subject to birching or to have a label attached to them like an animal, or the incompetence in putting any program in place. This appointment epitomises all the things that are wrong with this government and why, on the question of the carbon tax, we need to have that plebiscite to let the Australian people speak.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (18:17):  It should come as no surprise that the member for Mackellar has ended with the reference to the dumb stunt that the Leader of the Opposition staged yesterday, referring in the news media to a plebiscite proposal that he was supposedly going to put to the parliament at 10 am yesterday, knowing that the parliament was not even sitting at 10 am—indeed, knowing what a piece of wrecking it was likely to be, but presumably guessing that it might just attract some news coverage. But it did not, of course, contribute in the slightest way to the government of this country. It did not contribute in the slightest way to the development of the carbon price that we need and that this government is working on.


To go back to the questions about Dr Henry—and I am glad the member for Mackellar is not actually leaving; it looked like she was for a moment there—




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  I'm getting a glass of water to put out the fire.




Mr DREYFUS:
  Yes, she has got very excited in asking those questions before. I would invite the member for Mackellar to examine the history of section 67, what was said about it in the convention debates and why it appears in the Constitution. Section 67 has traditionally been used because there is no coverage in existing legislation for the manner of appointment of a whole range of people who provide service to the Commonwealth.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Just give me one political example.




Mr DREYFUS:
  I reject, as I did before, the characterisation of Dr Henry's appointment under section 67 of the constitution as in any way political. He is a distinguished Australian with immense expertise in Treasury matters, in fiscal matters and in economic matters who I am very pleased is going to continue to provide his services to our country. The member for Mackellar said that the Australian people are entitled to know. I think that the Australian people are entitled to know why it is that members of the opposition are in any way challenging the appointment of Dr Henry to the service of the Commonwealth, because the appointment of Dr Henry to the continuing service of the Commonwealth ensures that his abilities and his vast experience, recognised by the former government, are going to continue to be of service to our people. Section 67 is being used for Dr Henry because of the whole-of-government nature of the policy advice that he is going to be able to give the Commonwealth. It goes well beyond anything that a conventional appointment under the Australian Public Service Act might encompass. Dr Henry will be advising the government on issues that are of a whole-of-government nature, and details of that, as I have indicated in my previous answer to the member for Mackellar, will be determined with the Prime Minister. It is bizarre that the member for Mackellar should suggest that there has been even the slightest lack of accountability in relation to the appointment of Dr Henry. If it was so unaccountable, why was it that there was an announcement of Dr Henry's appointment, along with a number of senior appointments that the Prime Minister announced on 1 June 2011? It is hardly an act of unaccountability to make an announcement of the appointment of someone under section 67 of the Constitution. I would ask again, and I think the Australian people are entitled to know, why it is that the opposition are so set on criticising absolutely every feature of the administration of the Commonwealth in talking down this country and the government that they cannot conceive that someone with as distinguished a career as Dr Henry could and indeed will provide continuing service to our country.


Finally we had a reference from the member for Mackellar, who just cannot seem to leave it alone, to the negotiations that are ongoing with our neighbour Malaysia. For weeks now we have seen an attempt to destroy our relations with Malaysia and our government's work with our regional neighbours, something which the former government never did, in order to reach appropriate arrangements in relation to asylum seekers. Coming up now—and no doubt we will hear more about it—we have further destruction being planned by the member for Cook, who has been sent by the Leader of the Opposition to Kuala Lumpur.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (18:22):  The reason I raised the question of Malaysia was to specifically ask you whether or not the Ombudsman would be using part of his $900,000 earmarked money—which is not extra money but money taken away from other duties he might be doing—to make reports on each and every one of the disgraceful trades in human flesh of one asylum seeker going from Australia and our receiving five here in Australia. I ask whether the ones being sent to Malaysia are to be tagged like animals or subject to the birch. If you find that acceptable behaviour then that is a big difference between you and me, because I sure do not.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms S Bird
):  I would just remind the member for Mackellar that she is not directing those questions to me as the chair. If you could direct them through the chair, that would be good.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  The parliamentary secretary, of course, has failed to answer that question. The second question he has failed to answer—and I have asked it, I think, three times now—is whether Mr Henry is still a member of the Public Service. I would like an answer to that question. If he is not, when did he leave the Public Service, and is his re-engagement as a contractor, even though the appointment is via section 67? I ask the parliamentary secretary to give me one name—just one—of any other political appointment or any appointment of a person to assist the Prime Minister out of a hole, which is exactly what this is. I can understand why the Prime Minister thinks she needs some additional advice, because she certainly cannot rely on the person who parades around as the Treasurer. She needs something to dig her out of the hole, so I can understand why they might seize on Mr Henry as being the answer. He served the government very well in the latter stages of his appointment, particularly when it came to assessing the budget savings that were put forward by the opposition prior to the last election.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  We have lost a quorum in this chamber, so we will suspend until a quorum is returned to the chamber.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms S Bird
):  The chamber will resume. We have gone over time, but I am going to allow the member for Mackellar to finish her question and then the parliamentary secretary can either respond or take it on notice. 




Mr Ripoll:
  Deputy Speaker, a point of clarification: I understand that at 6.30 it changes and the time allocated has actually expired. I would like clarification just so we stick to the rules. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  To clarify: 5.30 to 6.30 is a guide time and there is not another time frame that will come into play on that. In the interests of progressing the debate I am going to allow the member for Mackellar to finish and then the parliamentary secretary can handle it as he sees fit. The member for Mackellar.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. When the parliamentary secretary scrabbled off for the quorum and took the only remaining government member with him, of course this place had to close down because we no longer had a quorum.




Mr Dreyfus:
  It was called by the opposition in the chamber.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  Of course.




Mr Dreyfus:
  Shutting down debate in both places. 




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  Not at all. It is because of your behaviour previously. The long and the short of it is you might remember next time that, if you do not want to close down this place, you must leave one government member behind.


To go back to my question and to reiterate, it concerned Mr Ken Henry. I still do not have an answer and I specifically ask for one. Is he a member of the Public Service? If not, when did he leave the Public Service and what is the nature of his contract with the government via section 67? Who wrote the brief for the Governor-General? Who put together the information for her to make that appointment? I think that is a very important point to have on the public record. I repeat: how is it possible that you can ask the Governor-General to appoint someone to a position of $535,000 a year with no job specification, no description of the duties they will have to carry out and no notification to the general public as to why it was necessary to have this very special method of appointment? I make the point that it is special. I asked you for one name of anybody who had been appointed to a political position like this and you cannot supply me with one. All the other people that you have given me the names of are perfectly ordinary appointments under section 67 and I am perfectly familiar with the operation of that. This is an exceptional appointment. You, Parliamentary Secretary, have admitted here today that there are no terms and conditions that have been established. It is all going to be a nice chat when he comes back from leave and we do not even know the date on which he is to return. Would you also supply me with the date on which he will return?

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (18:36):  We have gone over time, but I will respond as quickly as I can. I would say to the member for Mackellar that I will take on notice her questions, although I do feel I have answered quite a number of them now more than once. I will take on notice those of her questions that have not yet been answered and respond in a timely fashion.


I just want to make a point about the Ombudsman because, while attending the quorum call in the chamber, I have had occasion to reflect on the Ombudsman's position. It is a very curious thing that the member for Mackellar should be addressing questions to me about an independent statutory office holder. I know that those opposite do not have the same proper view of the independence of statutory office holders. It appears that the member for Mackellar has not read the Ombudsman's legislation, does not understand that the way in which the Ombudsman functions is to act on complaints and further that, insofar as there is any other jurisdiction available to him, it is a jurisdiction that he determines solely in his own absolute discretion as to how that discretion is to be exercised. The suggestion that I, appearing here in consideration in detail of the appropriations for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, should be able to say or indeed that it would even be proper for me to say how the Ombudsman is going to carry out his statutory functions is frankly ridiculous.


As to the continued appalling calling into question the excellent appointment of Dr Ken Henry, it is a sorry day that the opposition is seeking to deny to the Australian people the services of someone of the immense eminence and expertise of Dr Ken Henry, who I have no doubt could be commanding remuneration many times that which he is being provided from the public purse if he were to go into the private sector. We are all very well aware of the immense salaries that are being paid in the finance sector in Australia at the moment and indeed overseas, and the Australian people are being well served by obtaining the services of Dr Henry.


Lastly—and I say again, I will take on notice the questions that have been addressed to me, insofar as they are proper questions, by the member for Mackellar. Some of them were not—I need to put this on the record: I reject absolutely any statements of fact that were made here by the member for Mackellar and I completely reject the suggestion that I have admitted anything, which is the way in which she sought to characterise something that I said on the last question here. Proposed expenditure agreed to.

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (16:30):  I had the misfortune of being here at about the same time last week. I had the responsibility of exploring with the Assistant Treasurer the various matters to do with the appropriation bills. Unfortunately, last week it was a total waste of time—an absolute and categorical waste of time. I just wanted to put it on the record because I am still very cross about what happened. The Assistant Treasurer turned up with half a dozen goons, most of whom did not speak except to intervene and interject in an attempt to disrupt proceedings for the whole hour with inane and mainly quite offensive comments. They were not even comical. Every attempt was made to not cover the substance of any of the questions. The questions were asked in good faith. As always, there is politics on either side of this chamber. Points are made, and I am not oblivious to that. I am pleased to see the Special Minister of State because we have had some healthy debates. We will make our political points. If he does not know the answer, because the Minister for Finance and Deregulation is in another chamber, it would be appreciated if we get the answer in due course. I just felt that last week's session was the worst experience I have had. The previous Minister for Finance and Deregulation made a serious attempt to canvass answers in this chamber, to make political points where appropriate and not waste the time of everyone involved.


Firstly, I would like to explore some of the issues to do with the government's proposal to increase the debt ceiling from $200 billion to $250 billion, which was included in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2011-2012. This is a cognate budget debate and this session is our only opportunity to explore any of these issues. While this is incorporated, we do feel that this is an opportunity to get some understanding of a very important matter which has never been put in an appropriation bill in the past. It has always been properly debated separately, but it was snuck into this bill with no explanation on the evening of the budget. The opposition are very interested to know which minister made the decision to incorporate the debt raising proposal in the second appropriation bill. Firstly, is the minister aware that this is without precedent, and could he explain why the government has gone down this path and not put the proposal in a stand-alone piece of legislation?


Secondly, I would be grateful to know why the government is so averse to having this item debated in detail before the House? We sought to move an amendment to allow us to debate this in detail. I wrote separately to the Leader of the House and asked, again, if he would give consideration to this being debated in some detail and separated out from the other appropriation bills, and I got back what was a fairly nondescript response. Basically, it was trying to take the mickey out of me at every opportunity on this issue, but there were no substantive reasons at all as to why it could not be done. Certainly, it was a very perfunctory 'no' to the question of whether it could be considered in some detail.


Thirdly, is the minister aware of the stark contrast in how the debt issue is being handled compared to the United States, where there is a very public and robust debate in Congress with the Congress being given the opportunity to vote on the fund-raising proposal? (Time expired)

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (16:36):  The member for Goldstein says that being here last week with the Assistant Treasurer was the worst experience he has had, but I think that you and I have both shared much worse experiences than that in our lives. He asks three questions, most of which do not fall into my direct portfolio responsibility—but, yes, I will get back to him with an answer to those questions in the way in which he has put them. I cannot promise that the answers I give will be more than the broad outline of why the government is doing what it is doing and how the parliamentary arrangements came about, but I will do that.


In 2011-2012 the Finance and Deregulation portfolio will be appropriated $601.1 million from Appropriation Bill (No. 1) for the ordinary annual services of the government. This will include departmental capital budget funding of $23.8 million, about $400,000 million in departmental supplementation, and administered capital funding of $3.3 million. The Finance and Deregulation portfolio will also be appropriated $210.2 million from Appropriation Bill (No. 2) for non-operating purposes.


A number of new measures were announced in the 2011-12 budget for the Finance portfolio. I will enumerate some of those. The government will provide $7.2 million over five years to increase the number of parliamentarians' personal employees by a total of 10 positions. The additional staff will allow members and senators to better manage their workload and provide them with greater capacity for consultation, understanding and decision making. The unique circumstances of the 43rd parliament have required this, both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. Members who hold critical positions have required additional resourcing and additional support, and as part of the normal process of ensuring that members of parliament can function properly we have provided additional staff in order to allow just for that. Other measures include appropriations of $2.3 million in 2011-12 to investigate and test ways to improve individuals' ease and use of access to Australian government services. This funding will be used for a scoping study, a technical pilot and business case, improvements to be explored including allowing individuals to communicate updated details to multiple agencies simultaneously, and improve filling in forms using information previously submitted to a government agency. There will also be the ability for individuals to view all of the government communications in one place.


I will say more about the idea of what the government wants later in this session, but the initiative is designed to create both a better digital environment for our citizens and better information management for government, and it is consistent with a drive over time from governments of Australia to ensure that the benefits of the digital revolution are felt by our citizens and can also be used to the advantage of government, reducing both the cost of service delivery from government and increasing the efficiency. The capacity to do this is important to our citizens and I will speak about it in detail as we progress through the session.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (16:41):  I refer the minister's reference to the $7.2 million over five years to increase the number of government and non-government personnel employees to a total of 10. Would the minister, firstly, tell me what the meaning of 'non-government' is—whom does it include—and what is the breakup of those 10 positions? In addressing those answers, could he tell me whether or not those positions were designed or went—even if they were not designed to—to Independents? I am particularly interested in the question of the national broadband network committee established to which Mr Oakeshott was appointed chairman. Presumably, he got more staff. Does that come in that entitlement or does that come in the entitlement of more money being given to the parliament? In looking at that instance, I note that that was created on 3 April by resolution of the Senate, which of course was after the New South Wales election when Mr Besseling, who was the Independent member for Port Macquarie, was voted out dramatically, that being a seat within Mr Oakeshott's own seat and the one he used to hold in the state parliament. Could you tell me whether or not part of that extra funding for additional employees was given to Mr Oakeshott so that he could employ Mr Besseling when he lost his seat of Port Macquarie?


And while I have still got three minutes to go, I will then move on to questions about the appointment of Mr Ken Henry to a position which is described as being 'supported' by the Prime Minister and Cabinet's Office, but would be financed, I guess, out of the Finance budget, because he said he is neither a consultant nor an employee but he is appointed under section 67 of the Constitution. So I would ask the minister if you could tell me: who prepared the brief for the Governor-General to make that appointment? What was the nature of the appointment? When will the appointment be gazetted? Did Mr Henry actually retire from the Public Service prior to his being appointed to this nebulous position? Was he a member of the Public Service Superannuation Fund that required him to retire at the age of no greater than 54 and 11 months to maximise his superannuation payout? Was he in fact in receipt of any superannuation payout? What is the basis upon which he is being paid his old salary of $535,000 a year, which is pro-rated according to the number of days he does, the details of which we do not need? When will the appointment be gazetted?

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (16:44):  I thank the shadow minister for the questions. I will get back to you on those as is appropriate. Ken Henry is a distinguished Australian public servant. He is a public servant who has served the interests of our country well under all governments in the course of the last 20 years. He is a public servant whose high regard is such that the accolades that he has received have been extended by all sides of politics. I think all of us took great pride in the work that Ken has done throughout his years as a senior public servant. It is pleasing to see that he will continue to serve the interests of our nation in providing advice to the Prime Minister, and it is extremely important in the context of ensuring that our public servants are able to carry out their work both at the time and into the future rather than, as many do, see their knowledge and their considerable skill in serving both sides of parliament lost to this place, to the Public Service and to public administration. If we are to be successful at building a Public Service and a public administration environment—



Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The minister will take his seat. The member for Mackellar on a point of order—and she had better have a good reason, because this is a pretty free-flowing debate in the Main Committee.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: we do have a new paradigm even in the Main Committee. We are still governed by the standing orders, and the standing orders do require direct answers. That applies—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No, the standing orders do not. The member for Mackellar can resume her seat. This is not question time.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  I am sorry; the standing orders apply to more than just question time.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The standing order you are referring to refers to question time.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  I did not make clear which one, did I?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister has the call and will be heard.




Mr GRAY:
  I then move to the questions that were asked about staffing resources for Independent members of parliament. It is the case that members of parliament whose status in the parliament is as Independents have been provided with additional resources from the government. That has certainly been the case in my own state for the member for O'Connor, who found himself in a position where he sought to independently represent the people of that electorate in this place but also found himself in the position of needing support to understand the complex issues of public policy and also, being a new member of parliament, of servicing a massive constituency and dealing with the complex issues. Yes, we did think it was important to provide additional support for people in that environment. We have also provided additional staff support for other Independent members of parliament. We do this in order to create the best possible environment for such members to properly, conscientiously and purposefully serve the interests of the 43rd Parliament.


We have been explicit and transparent as a government both in making those appointments and in reporting publicly that we have done that. We think it is proper, we think it is appropriate and we think it is in the interests of the best parliamentary practice, of good governance and of good government. We do not resile from that. At the same time, when such decisions are made it is critically important to ensure that they are reported publicly and transparently and can be questioned.


I return to the point of Dr Henry, the former Secretary of the Department of the Treasury, with a couple of concluding comments. A lifetime of dedication to good public policy and good public administration should be celebrated in this country and should be applauded, especially in the context of a willingness to continue to serve the nation and to serve the good governance of the country. Dr Henry's willingness to do that has again been completely transparently and publicly reported, acknowledged and understood, so there is no great matter of discovery in the questions that refer to Dr Henry. There is, however, the important principle that I think we all would live with in this place, and that is the principle that our Public Service is a great institution that serves our country well. The people who are at the head of our Public Service are people whose years of service have built an experience base that can continue to serve us well, and we wish as a government to ensure that that can take place in whatever form and whatever way is optimal both for former public servants and for the government of the day. In summary, the questions that I have been asked go to matters that have been transparent and publicly reported by the government, behind which we see underpinned a pattern of behaviour, the hallmark of which is transparency and clarity.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (16:50):  From the minister's answer I take it that, when you referred to Mr Henry as being a public servant, you are stating that he has, in fact, not resigned from the Public Service but remains a public servant and has been reappointed. He has been on some sort of 'swinger' list. Would that be correct?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  If the member wishes the minister to answer she needs to resume her seat, I will give him the call and she will not get the time. This is not question time. It is consideration in detail. The member for Mackellar has the call.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  Thank you very much. That is question No. 1. Question No. 2 is: was Mr Oakeshott given an extra staff position after 24 March, which was the date of the state election? Let's take it from the end of that month. Was Mr Oakeshott given an extra position after the state election in New South Wales?


I also note that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is going to increase by another 200 people. Is Ms Lampe, who was the previous chief of staff to the Prime Minister and who was farewelled with great parties in February of this year, yet allegedly remained on the payroll until 3 June this year, counted as one of those 200 people? Indeed, why was she kept on? The reason given was that the Prime Minister's new chief of staff, who had worked for her when she was deputy leader, needed a four-month handover period. Was it, in fact, because she was supposed to end up with the national secretary's job—your old job, I think—but was vetoed and therefore without an income and the poor old taxpayer had to pick up the leeway? Perhaps we could understand whether she is one of those desperately needed 200 people, particularly when I notice that the Department of Human Services is going to lose 1,200 people while we will have 1,100 people on the Prime Minister's staff. It does not seem to be helping her out much, but it is a valiant effort, I suppose.


In that 200 people that she has now got on her staff, could you tell me whether or not the executive service appointment of Mr Henry has any precedent and whether precedent was relied upon? Perhaps in your answer this time you might be able to tell me who prepared the brief for the Governor-General and when we might expect it to be gazetted.

"Gray, Gary, MP",ALP,2011-06-21,"



Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (16:53):  There are a couple of points there. The first is whether Mr Henry on a 'swinger' list—I do not know. You would need to ask other people if he is on such a list. I doubt it. The Oakeshott staffing matter I have addressed. As for DPMC and Amanda Lampe, we made clear that Ms Lampe's continued presence on the staffing arrangements of the government was because it was part of her handover in that critical role as chief of staff for the Prime Minister.


I mentioned in my earlier comments the importance of the work which the government is doing on service delivery reforms, particularly those aimed at improving the delivery of Australian government services. The government's preliminary work on possible service delivery reforms is aimed at providing more personalised, convenient and quicker services to people. Advances in IT mean that we are able to provide innovative ways to improve service delivery to citizens and better meet the public's expectations of personalised services that are convenient and quick. It is the case that today our citizens are used to rapid services delivered from banking systems, airline booking systems and they expect the same sort of speed and quality of service from government departments. Worldwide, governments are looking at ways of delivering services that better meet the needs of individuals and that make it easier for individuals to interact with government. Today, Australians expect government services to be as intuitively easy to use, to understand and to access as they can be.


As a government we are constantly looking to see what we can do better and how we can effectively harness technological advances to improve what we are doing. Important reforms currently underway include the merging of Medicare, Centrelink and the Department of Human Services to provide a more connected and seamless service to people in the community. We are at the first step of a process of investigating the capacity for people to provide their personal information such as name and contact details, but potentially more complex information such as income and employment, to one government agency and to consent to it being used by other nominated agencies—a kind of 'tell us once' capability.


The early work is focused on testing concepts and scoping the environment for possible options. We have asked the Department of Finance and Deregulation to explore options that would allow people to communicate updated details to multiple agencies simultaneously, to prefill in forms using information previously submitted to other government agencies and to view all government communications in one place. The aim is to do away with some cumbersome processes such as those which require individuals to resubmit the same details multiple times to gain access to services. This could provide great benefits, for example, for people in crisis and emergency situations such as those affected by the recent floods and cyclones and for all Australians who may need to change their address details when moving house.


In exploring these capabilities, individual privacy is at the forefront of our minds. This exploratory work will focus on only frameworks that operate on the basis of individual consent so that any flow of the information will be controlled by the individual and not by the agencies involved. Individuals will be able to opt in and out of the facility at any time. People could choose not to opt in and could be selective about how much they make use of such a facility.


There will be no central database of people's personal information. Agencies would not be able to swap or match client information; rather, such an account would enable people to share their own information with each individual agency, should they choose to do so. We will not be merging agency databases. We are not looking to create a centralised national identity database and there is no hidden agenda.


We are exploring frameworks that will put greater control in the hands of individuals. The reason for this is to create greater efficiency and intuition in government information management systems to make more efficient for our citizens the information distribution that they provide, to create a more current and up-to-date information set about key metrics available for good public policy making and to ensure that our citizens obtain those benefits and rights that they are due to receive under our various rules for such entitlements. It is also the case that we will be doing this over time and in a way that is as effective as possible. (Time expired)

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (16:58):  As I understand it, we are now in the consideration in detail stage and we are supposed to be talking about the appropriations. The minister's speech was very nicely read, but I hardly think it was relevant to anything we have been addressing. The minister said at the beginning that he had answered my questions about Mr Oakeshott's personal staffing arrangements, and I disagree. We do not know whether or not Mr Oakeshott was given extra staff as a result of these budget allocations, which enabled him to put on extra staff after the last election in New South Wales. I specifically request an answer to that and, if he does not have it—or if any of those people sitting at the back cannot give it to him—then I would like to place that question formally on notice. I think we deserve an answer to that. With regard to the question about Ms Lampe, clearly the answer must be that the poor old Prime Minister is so incompetent that she needs two chiefs of staff, whereas when poor old Mr Rudd was bundled out the door, his chief of staff was sacked that same night. Maybe Mr Rudd was more competent than Ms Gillard and you knew it right from the beginning.




Mr Robb:
  No handover.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  No handover at all for him. Four months to handover to a bloke who had worked for her before—that is extraordinarily incompetent. 


I want to ask a question about solar panels and this building. I note that $187,870 is to be paid to Silex Solar Pty Ltd for solar panels for a rooftop trial for work between April and June. Solar panels will be installed on the roof of the Senate wing and the gardeners' compound. Was a thorough cost-benefit analysis done on the project to install these solar panels? On average, how much electricity will they generate? Will the electricity generated be fed back into the grid or will it be solely used for Parliament House? Will an outrageous payment be made for it if it is fed into the grid? If this trial proves unviable and there are negligible savings or no savings in electricity costs, will there be a further installation of solar panels at Parliament House—in other words, will the plan be abandoned? In the meantime, I note that the electricity costs for this building have gone up from $290,000 a month in September last year to $320,000 a month. Have any low-carbon solutions been put in place in the interim that may have caused this increase or is there some other reason?

I will have to get back to her on the details of the solar panel questions because it is important and do accept the good intentions behind the questioning. She has asked about a range of detailed matters around the operation of such panels and whether there are interconnections with the ACT grid and whether there is reselling into that grid. I am not able to provide answers to those questions at the moment but, yes, Shadow Minister, and I will come back to you as soon as I possibly can with the detail of answers to that.


I would like to continue the discussion around the new policy measures in place from the Department of Finance and Deregulation to do with information technology and embracing the new digital environment. In that context, it is important to understand the importance of cybersecurity and the investments which the government is making in cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is one of Australia's national security priorities and our approach to this issue is clearly outlined in the government's Cyber security strategy. The same principles, key actions and measures will apply in our work on service delivery reform and underpin our evaluations of options in this area.


It is extremely important to ensure that those who do not have a computer will not be disadvantaged in this new digital age. Such a capability would not exclude people who do not have access to a computer. People who choose not to opt into the system which I have described would access services as they do currently—that is, by approaching the relevant agency and providing sufficient information to establish eligibility. Members will be aware that in the context of the need to provide the Australian government with that information, there may well be people who are not digitally enabled or not able to get access to a computer in order to take advantage of such a streamlined and capable system. We still need to ensure that such people do not have the disadvantage of needing to inform the government several times before that information is held in a common way by the government. We will be taking steps to ensure that those who are not digitally enabled are able to take advantage of the technology changes. The reforms in this area are likely to be very complex and they will evolve over time. They will need to be considered as long-term projects, subject to the government deciding to invest in competing frameworks. We will work closely consult widely with all relevant stakeholders, users of Australian Government services, privacy interest groups, Australian Government departments et cetera in developing the future reform options in this area. However, at this stage what is happening is that the government is trying to scope the nature of a possible framework that it might want to go into. The government is not, at this point, considering whether to introduce the new service delivery arrangements. What the government is doing is considering the possibility of the service of informing the government once of a range of personal details that our citizens hold and that they may require to provide to multiple government agencies.


These reforms are an extremely important part of what we call, in general, the digital democracy and enabling our community to better contact, access and obtain information from governments. As the NBN rollout across the nation continues, the capacity to do this becomes more and more important. The current budget includes funding for the Department of Finance and Deregulation to assist in the oversight of a new entity to ensure—




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, consideration in detail is designed for information to be sought by members who wish to have more information about the appropriations bills dealing with particular areas. The way in which this is occurring right now does seem to be contrary to the intent and to the way in which the standing orders are framed, in that questions have been asked, the minister is unable to answer the questions and then he merely reads out material about issues that have not been dealt with at all in the questions.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  I am listening to the minister and I feel that he is within the parameters of the portfolio. I did not hear the question that was framed earlier because I was not here, so I am not going to make a ruling on this particular issue, but he is within his portfolio area, from what I understand. There is no point of order.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  The point of order is this: this is a part under the standing orders designed for members to ask questions about the appropriations. There were no questions asked relating to the material that the minister is merely reading out and taking up time with, thereby denying people their proper function.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister will continue.




Mr GRAY:
  The ability through this session to provide detail of the government's initiatives in the budget is extremely important and, Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for allowing me to conclude some areas of discussion around the initiatives in the digital economy. When I speak next I will come back to broader issues in the budget to do with the NBN. (Time expired)

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (17:08):  As my colleague the member for Mackellar has raised it would be beneficial, Mr Deputy Speaker, if we were to receive some detailed responses. We have lots of issues that we would like to go through. Whilst the minister has been giving us lots of wonderful detail about the budget papers, most of it I have read already. Perhaps we can take some of that material as read.


Much was made ahead of the budget—especially by the minister the minister is representing, by the Treasurer and by the Prime Minister—about the toughness of this budget. In that regard I would like to refer the minister to the table on page 10-6 of Budget Paper No. 1. I would be grateful if the minister could explain why government spending, as a percentage of GDP, has been higher in every year of office of this government. The forward estimates in the budget papers show spending in the last year of the Howard government at 22.9 per cent of GDP and since that time, and all the way through to 2014-15, the best that happens is 23.5 per cent. There is a consistent pattern of a government that is claiming to bring down an extraordinarily tough budget, that is going to take pressure off small and medium business who are seeking finance, continuing to borrow $135 million every day and putting enormous pressure on others looking for finance. They are adding to interest rates, which is adding to exchange rate pressures and adding to the cost of taking out mortgages and getting finance.


On all fronts the spending of this government is critical to economic outcomes and the cost of living pressures faced by households and the pressures faced by businesses, and yet the government, whilst talking about a tough budget, has laid out a four-year program which is still a country mile from spending levels, as a percentage of GDP, under the previous government. I would like to know why there has not been any effort to keep spending as a percentage of GDP below 2007-08 levels, as is the case with taxation receipts. The government has made a particular point about not going higher with taxation receipts than the previous government but, when it comes to spending, it sees no reason to make the same provision. This seems to be a significant inconsistency and I would appreciate an explanation for that.


From the point of view of a tough budget and the difficulty being faced by many in the economy and the uncertainty that currently exists, the reason for that uncertainty is that people have gone from minus one per cent savings to 11½ per cent, so something close to $70 billion has not been spent this year that would have been spent in a typical year. It is no wonder the retail sector is on its knees. That is a function of uncertainty. People are anxious about what might lie ahead. Do we have some sort of satisfactory protection or resilience against future economic shocks? The structural deficit within the budget is a critical factor. Why has the government not featured the structural deficit estimates over future years? If any of the assumptions for receipts or expenditure are out, the structural deficit could cause enormous problems and increase anxiety in the community. Why, as distinct from 2009-10 when they were featured strongly, has the government not this year featured the structural deficit figures? (Time expired)

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (17:13):  I thank the shadow minister for his question but it is almost as though he missed the fact that there was a global financial crisis. It is almost as though, in his commentary, he ignores the reality of government measures to support employment across the economy. Employment was under threat in every single sector, from retailing through to construction, through to the agricultural sector and in vehicle building—in every way our economy was threatened and so the government put in place measures in the third quarter of 2008 and throughout 2009. All were opposed by those opposite, and opposed for reasons entirely of basic politics. That means that the successful defence of jobs and the support of economic activity is due entirely to the quick action of the Australian government. It has been action roundly applauded both internationally and, most importantly, in local communities where jobs have been preserved, businesses have been kept intact and families have not been ripped apart by the devastating impact of high unemployment. I think it is also important that the shadow minister concedes that the current federal government has a lower, smaller taxation footprint than did its predecessor. Indeed, it is a proud tradition of the Australian Labor Party that we are not a high-taxing government, in comparison to the government that we replaced in 2007. The taxation of our community of course is the removal of funds from our community for use by government, and it is important that that footprint be proportionate and appropriate. It is revealed in the budget figures, as I am sure the shadow minister has fully understood and his reflections here demonstrate, that the low-taxing Australian government is able to do that because of both the efficiency of the way in which the Australian government spends money and the effectiveness of the way in which the Australian government raises its revenue. It is inevitably the case that because of that the massive measures that had to be undertaken to protect employment, to ensure that industries and commerce continued to operate throughout the tough and dark years and the very tough and dark weeks and months of the global financial crisis, could be supported by the rapid action of the Australian government.


We also made clear that, as a consequence of the measures that we undertook, the government does see the budget moving into surplus. The government does see the importance of those measures. And the government, through its fiscal discipline, is moving to ensure that the budget returns to surplus as quickly as it possibly can. Why do we do that? We spend money when we have to and we do not spend money when we do not have to. We spend money in order to protect employment and to protect our community. As the honourable member well knows, we spent large amounts of that money building enduring community infrastructure: enduring infrastructure that will be used to educate future generations of Australians; enduring infrastructure that will provide hospitals and roads; enduring infrastructure—ports, rail infrastructure—to support economic activity. It was about providing infrastructure that will survive generations, but a decision which was taken in order to support employment, to support our economy and to support our community.


You asked the question, quite reasonably: how is the government able to maintain its extremely low taxation footprint? The answer to that, very clearly, is through tough fiscal discipline, through insight and thoughtfulness in the way in which the government structures its own spending programs and through ensuring that our taxation footprint remains smaller, that the tax paid by our community remains proportionately less, than it did in any year under the Howard government. It is an astonishing performance, a remarkable performance, but one that we will continue. (Time expired)

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (17:19):  I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I am not really sure how you do cyber wine-tasting.




Ms RISHWORTH:
  It is pretty exciting.




Mr GRAY:
  And I have to say that, I think like all of us present, especially when contemplating McLaren Vale shiraz, we would all prefer not to be doing it in a cyber way; we would prefer to be doing it in a real and genuine way. It is an important question to go to current initiatives in the budget that deal with the National Broadband Network. In particular there is funding provided for in the current budget through the Department of Finance and Deregulation to assist in the oversight of the new entity to manage the universal service obligation that comes with the National Broadband Network. On 20 June 2010 NBN Co. Ltd and Telstra announced an agreement and the rollout of the National Broadband Network. In support of that agreement the government announced policy reforms to support the transition to the National Broadband Network environment including the implementation of an institutional regulatory and funding regime for the delivery of the universal service obligation and other public interest services and that is what we dealt with in this budget.


Earlier, on 10 February 2011, the government announced that it had reached an in-principle agreement with Telstra for the package of measures announced by the government in June 2010 to facilitate the transition to the National Broadband Network. These reforms included establishing the new entity which will function from July 2012 and to provide funding that will ensure that all Australians have reasonable access to a standard telephone service—the universal service obligation for voice telephony services—and ensure that pay phones are reasonably accessible to all Australians—the universal service obligation for pay phones. It will also include emergency call handling, the triple 0 and 112 numbers, and the national relay service. There will be migration of voice only customers to a fibre based service as Telstra's copper exchanges are decommissioned and the development of technological solutions for continuity of public interest services such as public alarm systems and traffic lights. There will be $1.2 million over five years provided to the Department of Finance and Deregulation to assist in managing the government oversight of the new entity that will be established to manage this universal service obligation.


Given the government's significant financial investment in maintaining the continuity of voice services to Australians, appropriate oversight of this entity is required. Currently, no resources are provided for that function. The Department of Finance and Deregulation will provide advice to government on the governance structure of the new entity and monitoring of the ongoing strategy and performance of the entity including in relation to complex financial matters including the government's financial investment, the USO regulatory environment and related legislation, appointments and performance, stakeholder management between NBN Co. Ltd during the rollout of the National Broadband Network and with the broader telecommunications industry and other related matters.


Those initiatives are part of the all-of-government response that embraces both the reality and the possibilities that are presented by NBN. We know the language and we are commonly understanding the language of government 2.0—it has been around for five or six years—and it denotes a kind of government that has as its hallmark the ability to reach out, the ability to listen to, the ability to insightfully interpret the communities that engage with it and importantly the ability to provide information to our citizens in a timely and efficient manner. That was never more poignantly demonstrated than during the emergencies that our country faced in January and February of this year. The developments in government 2.0 and in cloud computing simply allow the government to be more embracing of the communities that we represent and allow us to deliver in an effective and efficient way. With the development of the capacity represented by the NBN Co. and the requirement to attend to the universal service obligation facilities that we are commonly understanding are part of large and complex utilities then we can see that the all-of-government approach to supporting the activities of NBN Co. is underpinned by the work that is done in the department of the digital economy and also in the department of finance.

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (17:24):  The last opportunity I had I asked about the government's spending performance. The minister spent most of his time debating previous budgets. I would be very happy to do that but the session is designed to debate, discuss and seek detail about the current budget. The current budget is struck in a climate where the terms of trade are at 140-year highs—not a bad climate in which to manage an economy. The current budget is struck at a time when we have a labour shortage with the changing demographics in the economy and the skills required for the mining sector, and an unemployment level just under five per cent. The point was made by the minister that they have had a very rigorous fiscal program, notwithstanding the global financial crisis. Given the fact that we are seeing terms of trade at 140-year highs and that those levels are expected to continue during the course of the next four years, how is it that the government appear incapable at the end of that four years to be within a bull's roar of the level of expenditure as a proportion of GDP that was brought down by the last government? That is question No. 1.


Secondly, the minister said that the government is able to maintain its low-taxation footprint because of the extraordinary capabilities of the Treasurer and his colleagues. The fact is that the reason the government has been able to maintain taxation levels lower than the previous government is that it did not include major items in its budget. For instance, it did not include the carbon tax. Minister, why did the government not include the carbon tax as it did two years ago in its expenditure items? If it had done that, it would have grossly exceeded the taxation formula and percentage of GDP of the last government. 


The other point I would like to make is that the minister made absolutely no reference to the $107 billion debt. The fact of the matter is if you borrow like a wounded bull, you do not have to tax as much. Notwithstanding that, this government have brought in a carbon tax, a mining tax, a flood tax, a luxury car tax, a cigarette tax—taxes ad nauseam. They are a high-taxing government, but they have deferred taxation. When there is $107 billion debt that is deferred taxation—it will have to be paid off by taxation in the future. They are shifting the burden onto us, so that whenever we get the opportunity and privilege of government we will have to clean-up the mess they leave. Minister, why is this government not exercising the sort of restraint that would be considered in the middle of a 140-year high in terms of trade and in the middle of a world which is potentially likely to move into a double-dip recession? Why is the government not trying to protect and restore the resilience that this government inherited in terms of the economic conditions?

Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (17:28):  Today, Australia enjoys a taxation arrangement whereby the proportion of taxation paid by Australians is less than it was in the last year of the Howard government. It is a simple undeniable fact. It is something that the current government takes great pride in and something that the Australian community takes great relief from. All I hear from members opposite is the preference to tax and to spend, which is something that Australians have never supported. Australians support governments that are capable of keeping their house in financial order and we have said and stated clearly that the budget will be in surplus in the time frame that we have described. We have stated clearly that our taxation footprint is smaller than at any year under the previous government and continues to be the case. Furthermore, we are able to do that because of the extraordinary measures which the government have been prepared to take to better frame our budget and our spending priorities.



Mr Robb interjecting—




Mr GRAY:
  The shadow minister interjects, making reference to a carbon tax that is not yet in place. I hear the member opposite lamenting that the tighter fiscal discipline executed by the current government ensured a capacity for our nation to better weather the global financial crisis, to be better positioned and better prepared for the recovery in Australia and to be better prepared and better able to deal with the terms of trade that we currently see. I thank the members for their questions and I take on notice those questions which I have indicated I will. I will come back to them in a timely fashion with answers to those matters.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:30):  As members are aware, this year's budget was framed at a defining moment for our economy against a backdrop of natural disasters at home and overseas, softer economic conditions in the near term and a return to boom conditions that will stretch our economy's capacity over the coming years. In this context, the government's focus with this budget has been clear: to bring the budget back to surplus, to invest in skills and training and to get more Australians into work. 


This budget responds to Australia's workforce needs through better and more targeted skills and training and new measures to boost participation. The budget expands our healthcare system, invests in infrastructure, makes regional Australia a better place to live and continues to assist families. In line with these strategies, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has 11 new measures in this budget, including the impact of the temporary increase in the efficiency dividend.


Furthering our commitment to mental health, the government will provide $24.4 million over four years to establish Australia's first National Mental Health Commission. This is part of very large new funding for mental health services. The Gillard government is strongly committed to planning more effectively for the future mental health needs of our country, creating greater accountability and transparency in the mental health system and giving mental health prominence at a national level. The National Mental Health Commission will be established within the Prime Minister's portfolio and, through the Prime Minister, will report back to parliament, bringing a truly whole-of-government focus to the task of mental health reform.


In addition to this significant new investment in mental health, this budget provides $6.5 million over four years to maintain support for the delivery of the Council of Australian Government's reform agenda—an important agenda which is aimed at improving the wellbeing of Australians now and into the future. This budget provides for a $5 million donation in 2010-11 to the New Zealand Red Cross earthquake appeal to help with the earthquake recovery effort. These funds are helping in the immediate recovery and in getting Christchurch back on its feet after one of New Zealand's darkest days. Indeed, we have had the opportunity this week, with the visit of New Zealand Prime Minister John Key and his address to a joint sitting of both houses, to convey our direct sympathies to the people of New Zealand for the events of this year, which regrettably are continuing.


This budget provides $2 million over three years to the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney to further inform policy discussions on Australia's alliance with the United States. The budget also provides for a departmental contribution of $168,000 over two years to fund the Commonwealth's involvement in the commission of inquiry into the Queensland floods.


In the arts, this budget provides $1.6 million across the forward estimates for the Contemporary Music Touring Program to provide grants for professional artists to perform original contemporary Australian music in regional and remote Australia where this otherwise would be commercially unviable. In order to support this new investment, this budget will deliver savings of $1.6 million over four years from the GetReading! program by promoting books and reading in a more cost-effective way, including utilising digital technology and e-publishing. This budget delivers on our election commitment to provide $10 million over five years in additional support for Australian artwork. In a significant contribution to Australian sport the government will provide up to $38 million to the organisation and staging of the 2015 Asian Football Confederation Asian Cup and to ensure the sustainability of football in the lead-up to the event. In addition, this budget provides some $4.6 million over five years to establish a task force to coordinate the Commonwealth's role in supporting the cup.


The government will achieve further savings of $5.6 million over four years from 2010-11 from the testing and research components of the Illicit Drugs in Sport Program and the research component of the Sport Anti-Doping Program. These savings will be redirected to support other government priorities such as the extension to the Active After-school Communities program. I commend the appropriation to the House.

 (Mackellar) (17:35):  Before I ask specific questions, I would like to have some indication as to whether the parliamentary secretary is going to adopt the practice of the minister previously, which is: if he cannot give an answer to a question he continues to read out blurb from the budget papers, which in no way responds to the question asked and just takes up five minutes of time, or whether we can go to the practice that used to pertain in this consideration in detail—which, if you like, is more of an estimates hearing for the lower house—whereby we can ask a question, have it responded to and have a to-and-fro of information without someone from the government getting up and speaking for five minutes and then the minister taking another five minutes and wasting the entire period.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  Order! The member for Mackellar will resume her seat. I ask the member for Mackellar whether her question is to the chair or whether it is part of her five-minute consideration in detail to the parliamentary secretary? I think you are asking the question of me. Is that correct?




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  No. It is a question to the parliamentary secretary. I do not think you would know what is in the mind of the parliamentary secretary. I am making the point that this whole process has really become something of a farce, which it never used to be before. It used to be used to elicit useful information and specific answers to questions. I might be kind to the parliamentary secretary and say that this was the practice that existed before he came to this place. It is a new and novel development that we are seeing here. With that prefix to my questions I will be interested to hear his response.


The questions that I specifically would like answers to relate to the funding of a review of illegal boat arrivals and the Ombudsman. I notice in budget paper No. 2 in the Prime Minister and Cabinet section that $900,000 has been earmarked over two years to continue the Ombudsman's scrutiny of processing refugee claims for irregular maritime arrivals by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. The budget paper claims that the funding will be used out of the Ombudsman's current resources. My first question that I would like a response to is: what duties will that mean that the Ombudsman cannot do that he would otherwise would have done with those resources, because $900,000 of his money has been earmarked for this specific purpose? My second question is: in 2007-08 there were 25 unauthorised arrivals. That was the result of our effective Pacific Solution policy, which of course was ended by the government in 2008 and the boat arrivals started to arrive. In 2009-10 there were 5,614 arrivals. If we start to see an increase, or the increase as we have seen continues, will the Ombudsman need more than $900,000 to fund these claims, and if he does will he be able to get that from an advance from the minister for finance or some other mechanism?


My third question is: by giving this responsibility, to the Ombudsman, does this effectively amount to a vote of no confidence in the department of immigration which I note has had its numbers increased to carry out its tasks? My fourth question is: does the scrutiny process entail reviewing every single refugee application, or doing a random sample of applications? Is there an anticipated individual assessment cost for each inquiry it makes? A further question is, has the scrutiny which the Ombudsman has already carried out revealed an increased number of refugee claims from irregular maritime arrivals in the past three years, and can we have precise details of that?

It was apparently some kind of expression of concern about the way in which the government here in the consideration in detail of appropriations is answering the questions. I listened intently to the previous consideration in detail over the hour that the Special Minister of State was answering questions posed by members of the opposition.



Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting—




Mr DREYFUS:
  What I heard very directly was the Special Minister of State indicating very clearly to opposition members in response to their questions that he would take on notice a range of the questions in respect of which—



Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting—




Mr DREYFUS:
  I listened in silence to the member for Mackellar and I think she should do me the same favour. I listened to the Special Minister of State taking on notice in saying he would get back honourable members in a timely fashion. That is how he ended his session here in consideration in detail. So I can assure the member for Mackellar that certainly we will be answering questions, and indeed if the member for Mackellar had looked at Hansard, because she was not here yesterday, she would have seen that I was here in the consideration in detail of the appropriations for the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency attending with the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Both of us answered questions and I think that were she to consult Hansard she would see that I indeed answered the opposition's questions from yesterday. Going to the question about the Ombudsman's $900,000 indicated for scrutiny of processing refugee claims, and the indication that he is—




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  No, asylum seeker claims.




Mr DREYFUS:
  Sorry, I am sure that you had said refugee claims, but we will take it as asylum seeker claims, which he is going to fund from current resources. With respect to the other questions that were directed to apparently additional unauthorised arrivals. Can I say that it is an excellent measure that the Ombudsman is now undertaking additional scrutiny for processing asylum seeker claims. Implied in the member for Mackellar's question is the suggestion that perhaps this scrutiny is not warranted. I can assure the House that this scrutiny is absolutely warranted, and it is reflective of much greater care in the way in which these asylum seeker claims are being handled, and indeed much greater care in the way in which the entire system is being run.


I need only refer in that regard to the appalling compensation bill that the Commonwealth is still facing, arising from people, some of them Australian citizens, detained in the immigration detention system by the Howard government before August 2007. There is a budget item that relates to the compensation bill. It is now over $16 million and these cases, and the compensation provision that is having to be made, almost all relate to the 247 cases that were referred by the department to the Ombudsman following the Palmer inquiry and the Comrie report with such notorious cases as the case of Vivian Solon, falsely deported from Australia by the former government, or Cornelia Rau, improperly and illegally detained over an extended period by the former government as a result of the appalling mismanagement of the immigration detention system by the former government and the lack of scrutiny, scrutiny which is now to be provided by the Ombudsman as indicated in the budget papers. The member for Mackellar was referring to the claim that in 2007 there were some 25 unauthorised arrivals, which of course is held out by the opposition as some claim to the success of their policies. It was no such thing. As I have just indicated, arising from the mismanagement of the immigration detention system, under the Howard government there were much larger numbers of people in immigration detention, an indication why we need to have scrutiny. We need the Ombudsman looking at these things. (Time expired)

 (Mackellar) (17:46):  Thank you for those non-answers, Parliamentary Secretary Dreyfus. I see that we are going to continue in this vein. I would ask you then the specific questions that I asked to be taken on notice and that you let me have them as soon as possible. I will try one more specific question. Considering the deal that your government is proposing with Malaysia, with the disgraceful trade in human flesh, whereby Australia sends one person to Malaysia to be either tagged or subject to Malaysian law and birchings, and we in return will receive five refugees who have been approved by the Malaysian government, does the $900 cover the costs of the Ombudsman scrutinising each one of those exchanges, those vile exchanges? If so, when will he be reporting upon them? Is that part of the government's overall plan? That is question No.1.


Question No. 2 for this section. I want to now turn to the Australian National Audit Office where there is outlined an expenditure of nearly $2 million to be spent on conducting a financial statement audit of the National Broadband Network and the NBN Tasmania between 1 April 2011 and 30 October 2013. I note that there is no confidentiality clause in the contract despite the government repeatedly making the excuse that much of the NBN's activities are commercial-in-confidence and that any scrutiny of this $50 billion project is impossible. In light of those things, is the audit which is to be conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers a comprehensive audit and will its cover all income and expenditure aspects of the NBN and NBN Tasmania? That is question 2(a).


Question 2(b) is: will the audited financial statement be published? 2(c), if so, how often will the audited financial statements be published and, if they are not to be published, why not? 2(d), how regularly will financial statements be audited and how often will the government receive audited financial statements from the auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers? Are you aware of any other companies who have been asked to conduct an audit of the NBN? And what audits of financial statements of the NBN had been conducted to date? At what cost would these audits have been done? Will the cost of the audit be included in the overall cost of the NBN, which, the best we can guess is likely to be $50 billion? They are very specific questions and if the parliamentary secretary is unable to answer those specific questions, I would simply ask him to take them on notice and reply in that way or, if he has specific information, I would very pleased to receive it.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:49):  They are very specific questions that have just been asked by the member for Mackellar. Before going to them, I had not quite completed my answer in relation to the Ombudsman, in respect of whom I need to point out that he is a statutory office holder. I certainly will take the more detailed questions that the member for Mackellar asked about the Ombudsman on notice and will endeavour to get a response to the member for Mackellar in a timely fashion.


At the moment the portfolio budget statement indicates, as the member for Mackellar said—and I have checked this—that there is a $900,000 measure to be funded from internal sources, so I will take those on notice. In respect of the detailed questions about the Australian National Audit Office, the Auditor-General is also a statutory office holder. Insofar as those questions relate to that statutory office holder, I will take them on notice as well. But the detailed questions that were asked about the NBN are misdirected and really need to be directed to the communications portfolio. I am sure that the member for Mackellar has means available in which she can so direct.


The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet does provide the Prime Minister with policy advice on matters that relate to the National Broadband Network, but the implementation of the National Broadband Network is the responsibility of NBN Co., its shareholder ministers and their respective departments, which are Senator Conroy and his Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, and Senator Wong and her Department of Finance and Deregulation. It is the case that senior officials from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet attend the National Broadband Network implementation steering committee, which covers a range of departments. But the kind of detailed financial questions relating to the NBN really should be directed to the department of communications.


To conclude—insofar as there is some information being sought in relation to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet appropriation—the government, through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, engaged the investment bank Greenhill Caliburn in November 2010 to review the NBN Co. corporate plan. The cost of that engagement was $1.1 million including GST, plus about $8,000 in expenses.


The other question the member for Mackellar asked, as best as I understood it, was about the current status of the negotiations with Malaysia—with some quite pejorative and needlessly, but typically, inflammatory statements made about this area of policy which I do not accept for a moment. I need to make it clear that, in answering this question, I reject entirely the way in which it was framed and put and the language used by the member for Mackellar, including her use of the word 'disgraceful'. The only thing which is disgraceful about the discussion of the negotiations with Malaysia is the way in which the opposition is approaching this question. There are advanced negotiations with Malaysia and with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Those discussions are progressing well. The talks are being conducted in a spirit of great goodwill. It is a very detailed arrangement. It is very important that we get it right. As the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has said, further details will be announced in the coming weeks. Our government is committed to breaking the people smugglers business model and to deterring people from making dangerous sea journeys so that we will not have a repetition of the tragic event that occurred on Christmas Island late last year.



While we are talking about 'disgraceful', what is actually disgraceful is that the member for Cook is now saying that he is going to visit Malaysia. It is apparent that the Leader of the Opposition is so worried that the arrangement with Malaysia is going to work and work well that he is sending the member for Cook for another stunt—another dumb stunt, I might say—to Kuala Lumpur in a deliberate attempt to wreck the current negotiations, and, indeed, while they are about it, to wreck our relations with Malaysia. It is a disgraceful act. It is an incredibly destructive stunt by the opposition and it amazes me that anyone who is contending for national leadership in this country, as is the Leader of the Opposition, would authorise one of his spokespeople to go to one of our regional neighbours for this purpose.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (17:54):  The minister failed to answer my specific question relating to the disgraceful and despicable deal that his government is doing with Malaysia to trade in human flesh. I find the so-called solution absolutely reprehensible. I am astounded the parliamentary secretary can stand there and attempt to defend it. The very specific question I asked him was: can you tell me whether the Ombudsman, out of his $900,000, will be reviewing each of those transfers should the deal be completed so that we will know whether people have been tagged like cattle to be immune from birching or whether they will be subject to Malaysian law and subject to the birching that is part of that law? That was my specific question, and I note he failed to answer it.


I now want to go to appointments to the Prime Minister's staff. I did ask some of these questions of the Special Minister of State, but he was unable to provide any information. We might get some from you. First of all, Amanda Lampe, who was the chief of staff to the Prime Minister, was farewelled with great parties in February but remained on the public payroll until, I understand, 3 June. Could the parliamentary secretary tell me, the rest of the parliament and the public generally why it was deemed necessary for there to be a four-month handover from Ms Lampe to Mr Hubbard, who had previously worked for the Prime Minister. Was it due to the incompetence of the Prime Minister that she needed two private secretaries? Was it the fact that Ms Lampe needed an income because she did not get the national secretary's job? You might then be able to confirm for me that she left the Public Service on 3 June and confirm for me that she has not been offered another position.


My second set of questions relates to Mr Ken Henry. I did ask the minister whether Mr Henry had left the Public Service. I ask that as a very specific question. If he has left the Public Service, is there any policy in place that says someone who has left the Public Service may not be re-engaged on what used to be referred to as a Friday-to-Monday appointment, which was used by people who were under the old Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme? To maximise their return they must leave no later than being 54 years and 11 months of age. I notice that Mr Henry is about to turn 54. 


If Mr Henry is still a public servant, what is the nature of the leave that has been referred to in the newspaper? Is it leave without pay? Is he still being paid at the rate of $535,000 a year? If not, could you give me the details? What is the specific nature of the appointment by the Governor-General under section 67 of the Constitution that requires this appointment to be made in this way? If you examine precedent, the sorts of people who are appointed by the Governor-General usually have not included former heads of departments onto the staff of the Prime Minister. 


I note in the press that it has been said that he is neither a consultant nor an employee—it is a mystical appointment—but he will be supported by Prime Minister and Cabinet. I would be grateful for details of what that support entails and precisely what the nature of his duties will be. I also asked the minister when the appointment will be gazetted and why it has not already been gazetted.


Perhaps I could have some specific answers to those questions. If I cannot have specific answers today, would the parliamentary secretary please take those questions on notice and give me specific answers as soon as possible.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (17:59):  I will start with Dr Ken Henry's appointment. The questions that I have just been asked seem to have been drawn from various instances of misreporting in the media. It has been made very clear that Dr Ken Henry AC has been appointed by the Governor-General as a special adviser and his senior appointment was announced on 1 June 2011. The result of this appointment is that Dr Henry's extensive knowledge and experience are going to continue to be a valuable resource, and I am pleased that those skills are going to continue to be available to the Australian government.


Dr Henry has had a very distinguished Public Service career which spanned more than 25 years, 10 of which were spent as the secretary to the Treasury. In that time Dr Henry has made major contributions to the wellbeing of Australians and to the prosperity of the nation, not least of which was the extraordinary, timely and invaluable advice he provided to the government with the onset of the global financial crisis. His appointment does not require a gazettal—there seems to be a misapprehension on the part of the member for Mackellar in that part of her question. He is appointed by the Governor-General. He is presently being remunerated at secretary level, but he is expected to work part time and will be paid on a pro rata basis.


I can point out that the most recent appointment under section 67 was that of Mr Fergus Ryan as strategic investment coordinator, and this expired in 2002. Other examples include Dr Paul Twomey as chief executive officer of the National Office for the Information Economy, Ms Gwenyth Andrews as chief executive of the Australian Greenhouse Office and Mr Michael Hutchinson as chief executive of the Office of Asset Sales and Information Technology, all in 1998—these appointments were made by the Howard government. It is a process recognised under the Constitution and it should be a surprise to anyone here that the opposition were expressing concern about it. We have a distinguished Australian who has provided distinguished service to the nation. It is an excellent thing that Dr Henry is going to continue to be able to provide service to the people of Australia.


Another question asked by the member for Mackellar related to the Prime Minister's former chief of staff Amanda Lampe. Again, as I indicated to the member for Mackellar in relation to some of her earlier questions, that question needs to be addressed to the finance portfolio, since prime ministerial staff are not paid out of the appropriation under consideration here for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It is the responsibility of the department of finance to operate the MOPS ministerial and parliamentary staff system.


The other matter is one that the member for Mackellar pursued, using inappropriate language and the word 'disgraceful' in relation to present negotiations with Malaysia, and asserting that I had not answered her earlier question about whether the Ombudsman would be reviewing each possible transfer under the yet-to-be-concluded arrangements with Malaysia. The question that she actually asked when she first stood up to ask about the Malaysia arrangement was in relation to whether or not the government would be making public details of the arrangement, not the question that the member for Mackellar now asserts that I have not answered. Again, it is a question that is better directed to— (Time expired)

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (18:04):  We can check Hansard to see the context of my question. My intent was clear to me; I am sorry it was not clear to you. But thank you for those answers. I will go again to the question of Dr Henry. You did not tell me whether or not he has left the Public Service or, if he has left, when he left. You said that he has been appointed as a special adviser, without saying to whom he is special adviser. You have said that he has been appointed to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and that is useful, but I would like to know the terms and conditions of his appointment. 


The parliamentary secretary has been at great pains to say that Dr Henry was a great public servant. In the eyes of many that may well have been true during much of his career, but at the end he certainly became very partisan. I am not at all surprised that he has been given this rather political appointment to take up advising the Prime Minister—




Mr Dreyfus:
  He was appointed by the Howard government.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  Yes; that was a mistake, I think. I am not surprised at this appointment, particularly since you have a Treasurer who is seen by the electorate as ineffectual and not across his portfolio at all. I can understand why you would want someone with more expertise around to give better advice. Nonetheless, I would like to know the terms and conditions of the appointment and why it was done under section 67 of the Constitution. There is no adequate reason. You made some comparisons and I can find you many other appointments made under section 67 of the Constitution, but I find it very difficult to find any precedent where a political appointment has been made, to assist the Prime Minister via the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, under section 67. All the other appointments are ones where there is a provision in legislation that the appointment be made under section 67.


I saw an official shake his head, but if he can find an example and convey it to the parliamentary secretary of anyone who has been appointed under that section by the Governor-General, as a political appointee, to assist the Prime Minister and advise the Prime Minister via the department, I would be very pleased to hear about it. Perhaps, when he is advising the parliamentary secretary on that issue, he could help him give the answer to what the terms and conditions are and what the job specification is for the position to which Mr Henry has been appointed. But I would particularly like to know whether he left the Public Service and is coming back as a contractor.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (18:08):  Dr Henry ended his appointment as Secretary to the Treasury on 26 April 2011 and he commenced in his new role as special adviser upon being appointed by the Governor-General. His duties are to be determined in discussions with the Prime Minister. I need to make it as clear as I possibly can to the member for Mackellar that this is not a political appointment, that the government does not accept her characterisation of the appointment of Dr Henry under section 67 as a political appointment and, further, that the comments that the member for Mackellar has just made to this House—that Dr Henry, when he ended his distinguished career or apparently at some unspecified point towards the end of his distinguished career, became partisan—are a disgrace. That is a disgraceful comment to make. We have here, in Dr Henry, someone who has served our nation for 25 years, 10 of them spent as Secretary to the Treasury. He was of course appointed as Secretary to the Treasury by the Howard government. After taking a well-earned period of leave, he will return to part-time government service, the terms of which will be determined in consultation with the Prime Minister later in the year. I want to take further issue with the whole way in which the member for Mackellar has sought to characterise this appointment. A legion of appointments have been made by successive Australian governments, not only under section 67 but in a range of other ways, sometimes not even under statutory authority or specifically under a particular provision of the Constitution but under the executive power of the Commonwealth. It is open to a Commonwealth government to appoint anyone in any capacity to serve the government, and it would be a sorry day if it were otherwise.


The government is entitled to engage the services of anyone to serve this nation if it is for the better government of the Commonwealth. It is not necessary to point to precedent. It is not necessary to point to anything other than the constitutional authority conferred on the government. Nor do we need to look for particular statutory authority because there is a whole range of conventions and institutions that serve the Commonwealth that nobody queries, other than those opposite, who wish to query governmental arrangements that they themselves have used on numerous occasions in government. They wish to challenge them because they are now in opposition and they wish to simply nit-pick or raise problems where none exist.


It is entirely appropriate that Dr Ken Henry, a distinguished Australian appointed to his former post by the former government and having served Australia well over many years, should continue to provide service to the people of Australia. Insofar as there is anything left of the question by the member for Mackellar I will take it on notice and provide anything more that might be needed to answer her questions in a timely fashion.


I would take issue also with her proposition that the examples that I gave of other appointments during the term of the former government, being Mr Fergus Ryan, Dr Paul Twomey, Ms Gwenyth Andrews, Mr Michael Hutchison, were not legislatively required to be made under section 67 of the Constitution. It is a facility put there when the Constitution was drafted in order to make it very clear that the Commonwealth will have at its disposal appropriate services of people with expertise, who could be employed in the manner envisaged by section 67 of the Constitution, as appointments of the Governor-General.


I reject on behalf of the government in the strongest possible terms the connotations which the member for Mackellar has sought to put on the engagement of Dr Henry or indeed the characterisation of his appointment by the member for Mackellar as a partisan or political appointment, which it is certainly not.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (18:12):  Thank you for the rhetoric. I stand by the comments I made earlier and I would simply ask you again: is Mr Henry still a member of the public service? If not, when did he retire, what is his position and what are the terms and conditions of his appointment? How is it possible that the government can legitimately ask the Governor-General to appoint Mr Henry at a salary of $535,000 a year without knowing what the job is?


He is no longer a person employed as the head of a department where the salary of $535,000 is established by the Remuneration Tribunal. He is now someone who is merely being appointed to assist the Prime Minister with advice of a political nature and he is being paid at the same level as the head of Treasury. I think the Australian people are entitled to know why the appointment is being made with no terms and conditions, no understanding of what the contract is or what his responsibilities are. And how you can possibly justify him being paid at the rate of the head of Treasury? I think it is an absolute disgrace but typical of the attitude of this government that thinks it can do anything in a panic to try and get some advice, which it thinks might help it out of a hole. If Mr Henry is still a member of the Public Service then I would like to know why he was not appointed in the ordinary way as a member of the executive service. Why was the decision taken to use section 67? Was it because this was the only way in which he could be paid this extraordinary amount of money, and otherwise he would be captured by a determination of the tribunal?


The parliamentary secretary can sit there and smirk all he likes. The bottom line is that this is taxpayers' money. We heard from the shadow minister for finance today that we are in debt wholly and solely due to the incompetence of this government—and, I might add, under the watch of the same Mr Henry as the head of Treasury, who backed up the extraordinary expenditure. We have only to look at your track record. We have only to look at pink batts, the waste of money in the BER or the $900 that went out to dead people or to people who lived overseas, only for us to be told, 'Oh, this is all perfectly ordinary.'


I asked you to give me one—just one—example of where anybody else had appointed a political appointee—that is, someone who was not part of a determination and was not someone like the sorts of people that you identified as being appointed quite properly under section 67. I asked you to give me one name of somebody who was appointed to a golden job with no job specification at $535,000 a year while still on leave, and you do not expect me to be outraged by that. Of course I am outraged by it. So I ask you again: is he still a member of the Public Service? If not, when did he leave? What are the terms and conditions? When will we know the terms and conditions of this supposed job? How can you possibly justify that salary when there is no job for him to go to? And what are the terms and conditions of his leave?


I simply sum up by saying that this epitomises the attitude that this government has to the people of Australia: you are totally unaccountable and totally without consideration of the way things should be done properly, whether it is sending people in a trade of human flesh to Malaysia to be subject to birching or to have a label attached to them like an animal, or the incompetence in putting any program in place. This appointment epitomises all the things that are wrong with this government and why, on the question of the carbon tax, we need to have that plebiscite to let the Australian people speak.

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (18:17):  It should come as no surprise that the member for Mackellar has ended with the reference to the dumb stunt that the Leader of the Opposition staged yesterday, referring in the news media to a plebiscite proposal that he was supposedly going to put to the parliament at 10 am yesterday, knowing that the parliament was not even sitting at 10 am—indeed, knowing what a piece of wrecking it was likely to be, but presumably guessing that it might just attract some news coverage. But it did not, of course, contribute in the slightest way to the government of this country. It did not contribute in the slightest way to the development of the carbon price that we need and that this government is working on.


To go back to the questions about Dr Henry—and I am glad the member for Mackellar is not actually leaving; it looked like she was for a moment there—




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  I'm getting a glass of water to put out the fire.




Mr DREYFUS:
  Yes, she has got very excited in asking those questions before. I would invite the member for Mackellar to examine the history of section 67, what was said about it in the convention debates and why it appears in the Constitution. Section 67 has traditionally been used because there is no coverage in existing legislation for the manner of appointment of a whole range of people who provide service to the Commonwealth.




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Just give me one political example.




Mr DREYFUS:
  I reject, as I did before, the characterisation of Dr Henry's appointment under section 67 of the constitution as in any way political. He is a distinguished Australian with immense expertise in Treasury matters, in fiscal matters and in economic matters who I am very pleased is going to continue to provide his services to our country. The member for Mackellar said that the Australian people are entitled to know. I think that the Australian people are entitled to know why it is that members of the opposition are in any way challenging the appointment of Dr Henry to the service of the Commonwealth, because the appointment of Dr Henry to the continuing service of the Commonwealth ensures that his abilities and his vast experience, recognised by the former government, are going to continue to be of service to our people. Section 67 is being used for Dr Henry because of the whole-of-government nature of the policy advice that he is going to be able to give the Commonwealth. It goes well beyond anything that a conventional appointment under the Australian Public Service Act might encompass. Dr Henry will be advising the government on issues that are of a whole-of-government nature, and details of that, as I have indicated in my previous answer to the member for Mackellar, will be determined with the Prime Minister. It is bizarre that the member for Mackellar should suggest that there has been even the slightest lack of accountability in relation to the appointment of Dr Henry. If it was so unaccountable, why was it that there was an announcement of Dr Henry's appointment, along with a number of senior appointments that the Prime Minister announced on 1 June 2011? It is hardly an act of unaccountability to make an announcement of the appointment of someone under section 67 of the Constitution. I would ask again, and I think the Australian people are entitled to know, why it is that the opposition are so set on criticising absolutely every feature of the administration of the Commonwealth in talking down this country and the government that they cannot conceive that someone with as distinguished a career as Dr Henry could and indeed will provide continuing service to our country.


Finally we had a reference from the member for Mackellar, who just cannot seem to leave it alone, to the negotiations that are ongoing with our neighbour Malaysia. For weeks now we have seen an attempt to destroy our relations with Malaysia and our government's work with our regional neighbours, something which the former government never did, in order to reach appropriate arrangements in relation to asylum seekers. Coming up now—and no doubt we will hear more about it—we have further destruction being planned by the member for Cook, who has been sent by the Leader of the Opposition to Kuala Lumpur.

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (18:22):  The reason I raised the question of Malaysia was to specifically ask you whether or not the Ombudsman would be using part of his $900,000 earmarked money—which is not extra money but money taken away from other duties he might be doing—to make reports on each and every one of the disgraceful trades in human flesh of one asylum seeker going from Australia and our receiving five here in Australia. I ask whether the ones being sent to Malaysia are to be tagged like animals or subject to the birch. If you find that acceptable behaviour then that is a big difference between you and me, because I sure do not.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms S Bird
):  I would just remind the member for Mackellar that she is not directing those questions to me as the chair. If you could direct them through the chair, that would be good.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  The parliamentary secretary, of course, has failed to answer that question. The second question he has failed to answer—and I have asked it, I think, three times now—is whether Mr Henry is still a member of the Public Service. I would like an answer to that question. If he is not, when did he leave the Public Service, and is his re-engagement as a contractor, even though the appointment is via section 67? I ask the parliamentary secretary to give me one name—just one—of any other political appointment or any appointment of a person to assist the Prime Minister out of a hole, which is exactly what this is. I can understand why the Prime Minister thinks she needs some additional advice, because she certainly cannot rely on the person who parades around as the Treasurer. She needs something to dig her out of the hole, so I can understand why they might seize on Mr Henry as being the answer. He served the government very well in the latter stages of his appointment, particularly when it came to assessing the budget savings that were put forward by the opposition prior to the last election.

Mr Ripoll:
  Deputy Speaker, a point of clarification: I understand that at 6.30 it changes and the time allocated has actually expired. I would like clarification just so we stick to the rules. 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  To clarify: 5.30 to 6.30 is a guide time and there is not another time frame that will come into play on that. In the interests of progressing the debate I am going to allow the member for Mackellar to finish and then the parliamentary secretary can handle it as he sees fit. The member for Mackellar.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. When the parliamentary secretary scrabbled off for the quorum and took the only remaining government member with him, of course this place had to close down because we no longer had a quorum.




Mr Dreyfus:
  It was called by the opposition in the chamber.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  Of course.




Mr Dreyfus:
  Shutting down debate in both places. 




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  Not at all. It is because of your behaviour previously. The long and the short of it is you might remember next time that, if you do not want to close down this place, you must leave one government member behind.


To go back to my question and to reiterate, it concerned Mr Ken Henry. I still do not have an answer and I specifically ask for one. Is he a member of the Public Service? If not, when did he leave the Public Service and what is the nature of his contract with the government via section 67? Who wrote the brief for the Governor-General? Who put together the information for her to make that appointment? I think that is a very important point to have on the public record. I repeat: how is it possible that you can ask the Governor-General to appoint someone to a position of $535,000 a year with no job specification, no description of the duties they will have to carry out and no notification to the general public as to why it was necessary to have this very special method of appointment? I make the point that it is special. I asked you for one name of anybody who had been appointed to a political position like this and you cannot supply me with one. All the other people that you have given me the names of are perfectly ordinary appointments under section 67 and I am perfectly familiar with the operation of that. This is an exceptional appointment. You, Parliamentary Secretary, have admitted here today that there are no terms and conditions that have been established. It is all going to be a nice chat when he comes back from leave and we do not even know the date on which he is to return. Would you also supply me with the date on which he will return?

Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (18:36):  We have gone over time, but I will respond as quickly as I can. I would say to the member for Mackellar that I will take on notice her questions, although I do feel I have answered quite a number of them now more than once. I will take on notice those of her questions that have not yet been answered and respond in a timely fashion.


I just want to make a point about the Ombudsman because, while attending the quorum call in the chamber, I have had occasion to reflect on the Ombudsman's position. It is a very curious thing that the member for Mackellar should be addressing questions to me about an independent statutory office holder. I know that those opposite do not have the same proper view of the independence of statutory office holders. It appears that the member for Mackellar has not read the Ombudsman's legislation, does not understand that the way in which the Ombudsman functions is to act on complaints and further that, insofar as there is any other jurisdiction available to him, it is a jurisdiction that he determines solely in his own absolute discretion as to how that discretion is to be exercised. The suggestion that I, appearing here in consideration in detail of the appropriations for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, should be able to say or indeed that it would even be proper for me to say how the Ombudsman is going to carry out his statutory functions is frankly ridiculous.


As to the continued appalling calling into question the excellent appointment of Dr Ken Henry, it is a sorry day that the opposition is seeking to deny to the Australian people the services of someone of the immense eminence and expertise of Dr Ken Henry, who I have no doubt could be commanding remuneration many times that which he is being provided from the public purse if he were to go into the private sector. We are all very well aware of the immense salaries that are being paid in the finance sector in Australia at the moment and indeed overseas, and the Australian people are being well served by obtaining the services of Dr Henry.


Lastly—and I say again, I will take on notice the questions that have been addressed to me, insofar as they are proper questions, by the member for Mackellar. Some of them were not—I need to put this on the record: I reject absolutely any statements of fact that were made here by the member for Mackellar and I completely reject the suggestion that I have admitted anything, which is the way in which she sought to characterise something that I said on the last question here. Proposed expenditure agreed to.


Remainder of bill—by leave—taken as a whole and agreed to.


Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (18:42):  I rise tonight to speak in condolence of the loss of two brave young Australian men: Lieutenant Marcus Case and Lance Corporal Andrew Jones. The tragedy of 30 May was deeply felt across my electorate of Hughes. Indeed, this sense of loss was felt across our entire country as we joined together in deep sympathy for their friends, family and colleagues, who without a doubt carry the greatest share of the nation's collective sorrow. My local community particularly mourned the loss of the second soldier based out of our local Holsworthy Barracks to fall in Afghanistan in recent weeks following the death of Sergeant Brett Wood, who was then followed by the tragic loss of Sapper Rowan Robinson.


Lieutenant Marcus Case was born in Melbourne in 1984. Marcus grew up in a large and very close family as the youngest of six children. He was a popular young man with many close friends who admired his bravery, loyalty and sense of adventure. Marcus' self-described No. 1 fans—his parents, Lee and Bernard—say their son was born to fly. His all too short life reflects this goal, which he worked towards and successfully achieved. Lieutenant Case first entered the Army Reserve in June 2002 as a student at the University of Melbourne before deferring his studies in 2003 to undertake the commando selection training process with the 1st Commando Regiment. Never forgetting his desire to fly, he commenced flying lessons and then transferred the Regular Army to undertake pilot training. In December 2009 he was posted to the 6th Aviation Regiment based out of Holsworthy. 


Lieutenant Case served his country with honour. His schoolmate at Xavier College said of his friend, 'There was no better person you could have wanting to represent this country.' Lieutenant Case served in a number of overseas deployments, including in Malaysia and East Timor, before his final deployment in Afghanistan. But perhaps he will be forever remembered as an angel in the sky, plucking victims to safety during Queensland's flood crisis earlier this year. I echo the words of the Queensland Premier, who said Lieutenant Case was someone who came and gave his all when we needed him. I also wish to express my sincere condolences to the family, friends and girlfriend of Lance Corporal Andrew Jones. Lance Corporal Jones has been described as a loyal, reliable and trustworthy bloke, someone who loved his job and was dedicated to serving his country and who also enjoyed a joke with his mates. His family remember him as a dependable yet cheeky character 'whom we will miss with all our hearts'. He served our nation with great distinction, also, with Lieutenant Case, having served in East Timor and Afghanistan. The noble efforts of these two young men and their lives will not be forgotten.


Before I close my contribution in this solemn debate, I want to reflect for a moment on one of the reasons we are in Afghanistan. I spoke earlier of Lieutenant Case's close family and the important role they played in his positive and happy upbringing, and note that he leaves behind two sisters, Jackie and Liz. Before the intervention in Afghanistan, it should be remembered that, under the Taliban regime, girls were not allowed to go to school. Women spent most of their time indoors and all women were forced to wear burkas, covering their heads, faces and bodies. But today, over 2.5 million Afghan women are receiving an education. Afghan women now serve in the country's parliament, they own their own small businesses and they work as teachers, lawyers, community health workers and even prosecutors. These advances in the lives of millions of Afghan women are thanks to the efforts of brave men like Lieutenant Marcus Case and Lance Corporal Andrew Jones. Our nation will never forget their sacrifices.

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Defence Materiel) (18:46):  I rise to express my condolences to the family and friends of Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case and Lance Corporal Andrew Jones. I also wish to offer my condolences to the family and friends of Sergeant Brett Wood and Sapper Rohan Robinson. The Australian War Memorial is less than 4,000 metres from here. Etched on its walls are the names of 102,734 men and women who have laid down their lives in the service of our nation. Four more men now join this list and, like the names they join, each of these men has their own story, their own family and their own legacy that they leave behind.


Sergeant Brett Wood lived an extraordinary life. He served across the world, in Bougainville, East Timor, Iraq and on three tours to Afghanistan. His many decorations speak of his courage, among them the Medal for Gallantry and a posthumously awarded United States Meritorious Service Medal. Brett was a commando, one of the Australian Army's most highly trained and important roles. He did that job since 1998. His 13 years in the special forces involved some of the most difficult and dangerous work that Australian forces have been asked to do. According to those who knew him well, he was not one to boast about it. At his funeral his wife, Elvie, said:


To say Brett was humble is an understatement. He did not want to be defined by his achievements and introduced himself as just an ordinary guy. His most frequent expression was 'no big deal'.


He was not an ordinary guy. He will be remembered as a decorated soldier, dedicated to the service of his country, and his death is a big deal for all Australians, as is the death of Lance Corporal Andrew Jones.


The photograph on our television sets and in our newspapers of Lance Corporal Jones, butcher's knife in hand and sharpening steel across his chest, tells us something very important. The work of our troops is not done just in the fields and in the mountains of Afghanistan; it is also done in the kitchens, the garages, the hospitals and the hangars, as well as at remote forward operating bases like FOB Mashal in the Chorah Valley where Lance Corporal Jones was killed. That he was taken from us by the actions of a rogue Afghan soldier makes his loss all the more painful and all the more difficult to accept. It is made no easier by the news yesterday of the death of that Afghan soldier who did this terrible act. The commander of Australian forces in the Middle East, Major General Angus Campbell, said: 'Lance Corporal Jones chose...to take the challenge of working in a patrol base and underwent additional weapons and other training to be part of the small, tight-knit teams that support our troops'. He said: 'the efforts of people like Lance Corporal Jones often go unrecognised, but they are much loved and respected for their contribution'. His efforts certainly do not go unrecognised in this place. They are appreciated. His sacrifice is remembered and his service is honoured by us all. In the words of Brigadier Mulhall, 'He was a bloody good soldier and bloody great cook,' and he will be remembered as such.


Our thoughts are also with the family, the five brothers and sisters and the parents of Lieutenant Marcus Case, who was killed when the Chinook he was in crashed in Afghanistan last month. He was a young man who packed a lot of living into a very short life. Many soldiers aspire to be a special forces commando, some to be an army aviator. Lieutenant Case was both. He served as a commando on his first deployment to East Timor in 2007 and as an aviator on his deployment to Afghanistan. Between those two deployments he was involved in another very important mission; he was part of Operation Queensland Flood Assist in January this year, flying reconnaissance missions across affected areas in a Kiowa helicopter. No wonder his family was so proud of him. At his funeral his brother Chris said, 'We are thankful he was born into our family.' They said he had a heart of gold. He will be remembered as a soldier, a pilot, a mate and a son. We are all grateful for his service and our thoughts remain with his family.


Finally, I take this opportunity to remember Sapper Rowan Robinson. As a sapper, he did one of the toughest jobs in Afghanistan, not only in combat construction, demolition and explosive work, but in all the other work of a soldier. Two weeks ago his unit uncovered one of the largest weapons caches found by the Australian Special Forces in Afghanistan this year. As they moved to the second part of the mission, Sapper Robinson was shot. He was providing covering fire for his mates. At his funeral, his father said, 'He was someone that others looked to when things got tough,' and you can understand why. His unit commander said this about Sapper Robinson:


He epitomised everything it means to be a special operations engineer … everything that one could be, he personified: bravery, mateship and a willingness to risk one's life so that others may live on. ... 


These were his qualities.


He was a brave Australian soldier. He was also a son. I am told that, even while deployed in Afghanistan, Sapper Robinson organised to send his mum flowers on Mother's Day. We remember his commitment to his family alongside his commitment to his country. His father made this promise at his funeral:


We will be there every Remembrance Day and Anzac Day to honour you and your fallen mates, 'til the day we die.


Sapper Robinson's family will not be alone. As a nation we will pause to remember Sapper Rowan Robinson every Remembrance Day and every Anzac Day, just as we will remember Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case, Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, Sergeant Brett Wood and the other 23 who have fallen in Afghanistan whose names are inscribed on our hallowed Wall of Remembrance.


In the space of four weeks, the loss of four young Australians forever lost has had an impact. Understandably it has caused some to question why we are in Afghanistan and how long we will remain. In these dark moments it is important to remember why we are in Afghanistan. We are there because it is in our national interest to be there. It is in our national interest to be there because the threat posed by an unstable Afghanistan reaches far beyond its own borders. It affects its neighbours; it affect us. We all remember where we were on September 11. We remember where we were when we heard about the Bali bombings. We also have to remember where these terrible acts were planned and who the men were that planned them. We are one of 48 countries contributing to the same effort under a mandate of the United Nations, and we are all there for the same reason—the threat posed to all countries by an Afghanistan where malign forces can take root again. As I said in the debate about our involvement in Afghanistan last year, we cannot pretend that what happens in Afghanistan does not affect us here in Australia; it does, and because it does it is right that we are there. That is why our troops are there today. That is why their work requires our support in good times and in bad. That is what these men whom we honour today would expect of us. Our responsibility is to be worthy of them and of their sacrifice and to honour their memories with deeds, not just words. Lest we forget.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (18:56):  I rise to speak to the condolence motion for Lance Corporal Andrew Gordon Jones and Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case. In paying my respects following their deaths, I acknowledge that their loss is supreme. The loss of any soldier is a tragedy, and to have lost two on a single day makes it all the more difficult. I offer my condolences to the families and friends of Lance Corporal Jones and Lieutenant Case.


Lance Corporal Jones shares my son's name. His middle name, Gordon, was probably the name I wanted for my son's first name anyway. We are of course not related, but the name Jones is popular; Smith is common. Lance Corporal Jones was described by his family and those in the Defence Force as 'dependable, loyal, with a sense of humour that all who knew him enjoyed'. He took his role as a cook very seriously. He even used family recipes in his quest to provide only the best for his mates. He spent time in Townsville at the mighty 1RAR, and his time there makes his passing all the more personal for me and those in my electorate. 


Lieutenant Marcus Case was a motivated and talented 27-year-old pilot, known for his ability on the rugby field and especially for his love of flying. Those who worked with him spoke admirably of his ambition as an Army pilot, having embraced his new challenge of operating a remotely piloted aircraft with the RAAF. The men and women of the 5th Aviation Regiment, C Squadron, in Townsville have spoken to me about the dangers our Army pilots face and the skills they display in Afghanistan. Lieutenant Case's training was not in vain. 


Both soldiers were widely respected by their superiors and their peers, and they will be missed by their close family and friends. To lose a member of our Defence Force in the circumstances in which we lost Lance Corporal Jones is a travesty and an act of cowardice in the extreme. But we must not forget the important work that was being done by Lance Corporal Jones and others in the Mentoring Task Force in training Afghan soldiers. This role is crucial in creating an Afghanistan that is free of terrorism and for ensuring that Afghanistan does not again become the threat that it is today. 


Further, I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm my support for our role in Afghanistan. Fighting terrorism at its source remains a vital mission in being a responsible player in the international community and, as we continue to make progress, the bravery of our fallen soldiers will not have been in vain. In offering my support to the troops in Afghanistan, I would like to make a special mention of the soldiers deployed there from Lavarack Barracks in Townsville. I recently had the honour of attending the farewell parade for 2RAR as they prepared for their deployment throughout Afghanistan to undertake their role in training Afghan soldiers and nationals in order to make that country a better place. I know that they have the support of the Townsville community and all Australians. When I say that we are behind our troops, the role that they are playing in helping Afghanistan towards being a better democratic country that values all its citizens equally, regardless of sex, religion or ethnicity, cannot be underestimated. To the family and friends of these brave soldiers: this tragic loss will not be forgotten and it will not be in vain as we continue in our fight against the threat of terrorism. It is cold comfort to any parent that they died bravely. No parent should ever have to bury a child. My heart and the hearts of all the ADF men and women, veterans and the people of Townsville extend to the families of Lance Corporal Jones and Lieutenant Case our deepest and most sincere sympathies. May they rest in peace. Lest we forget.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Minister for Indigenous Health) (19:00):  Today I rise in this place to express my sympathy at the deaths of two fine Australian soldiers. Firstly, I would like to extend my sympathy at the death of Lance Corporal Andrew Jones and express my condolences to his family. I was privileged to attend the funeral service for Corporal Jones as the acting Minister for Defence in Melbourne just recently. He was described as a dependable yet cheeky character by his family. He was a much loved son, brother and boyfriend who enjoyed his role in the Army and was an excellent soldier. 


Lance Corporal Andrew Jones was serving with the Force Support Unit when he was tragically killed on Monday, 30 May 2011 Afghanistan time. He was, sadly, shot by an Afghan National Army soldier while undertaking guard duty at the patrol base MASHAL in the Chora Valley. The rogue Afghan National Army soldier suspected of killing Lance Corporal Jones has been shot and killed in a coalition special forces operation in Khowst province. 


Lance Corporal Jones was born in Melbourne, Victoria in 1986. He was a young man. He joined the Army in 2004. He completed his initial employment training as a cook and was posted to the catering platoon of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. His was the first operational death in the Australian Army catering corps since Vietnam. In 2008 Lance Corporal Jones was posted to the 9th Force Support Battalion and deployed on his first operational deployment, Operation Astute, to East Timor in July 2008. He deployed on Operation Slipper in Afghanistan in November 2010. 


Lance Corporal Jones was admired by his mates within his unit not just for his great cooking but for the great soldier and man he was. His dedication to his role as a cook was second to none. I am told that he would always call on all his resources to provide the very best meals for his mates, including using his favourite family recipes. He was 25 at the time of his death—too early for such a vibrant, fun-loving man with so much to live for. 


Lance Corporal Jones was awarded the Australian Service Medal with clasp Timor-Leste and the Australian Defence Medal. At his ramp ceremony on Monday, 6 June in Melbourne, Lance Corporal Jones was posthumously presented with the Australian Active Service Medal with ICAT clasp, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal and the NATO ISAF medal. 


As I said, as acting defence minister I was privileged to pay my respects to Lance Corporal Jones at his funeral service. At that service Brigadier David Mulhall, commander of the 17th Combat Services Support Brigade, described Lance Corporal Jones as a true gentleman, kind hearted and decent. Brigadier Mulhall also described the courage of Lance Corporal Jones. He said:


Real courage is when you look at your family that you love, which is central to your being, and the girl you have fallen in love with and know that what you do is dangerous and there's a chance you won't come home. That is real courage.


On behalf of the Australian government, I offer my support to Lance Corporal Jones's family and friends through this difficult time. I hope they are able to draw some comfort from the knowledge that they are in the thoughts and prayers of so many Australians who are grateful for their loved one's service to our nation. We humbly thank Lance Corporal Jones for his courage, his selflessness and the ultimate sacrifice he has made on our behalf. At this difficult time I also remember the family and friends of Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case, who was killed on the same day as Lance Corporal Jones when an Australian Chinook helicopter crashed in Zabul Province, around 90 kilometres east of the Australian base at Tarin Kowt. I would like to offer my sympathy at the death of Lieutenant Marcus Case and express my deepest condolences to his parents and brothers and sisters, Robert, Michael, Jackie, Liz and Chris. His loss will be felt by his loved ones the most, but he will also be sorely missed by his friends and colleagues.


Lieutenant Marcus Case was born in Melbourne, Victoria, in 1984. He enlisted in the Active Army Reserves in June 2002 and was posted to 5th/6th Royal Victorian Regiment. In 2003 Lieutenant Case commenced the commando selection and training process with 1st Commando Regiment, before being posted to 1st Commando Regiment and an operational tour to East Timor. In March 2008, Lieutenant Case transferred to the Australian Regular Army, undertaking pilot training at the Army Aviation Training Centre at Oakey. In December 2009 he was posted to the 6th Aviation Regiment in Sydney. Lieutenant Case first deployed as an infantryman to Malaysia with Rifle Company Butterworth in 2005 and in January 2011 played a pivotal part as the Aviation Battle Group deployed to Queensland to provide assistance as part of the Australian Defence Force flood relief operation. 


Lieutenant Case's deployment to Afghanistan commenced in May of this year. He was taking part in a routine Task Force Thunder mission with the Rotary Wing Group when the aircrew of the Australian CH-47D Chinook were forced to make an uncontrolled landing. Lieutenant Case was killed in the incident and five other ADF personnel were wounded. My thoughts, as I am sure yours, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, also remain with the wounded and I wish them a speedy recovery.


Over a period of eight years service in the Army, Lieutenant Case has been awarded the Australian Service Medal with Clasp Timor-Leste and the Australian Defence Medal. At his ramp ceremony in Melbourne on 6 June Lieutenant Case was posthumously presented with the Australian Active Service Medal with ICAT Clasp, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal and the NATO ISAF Medal.


Lieutenant Case was an accomplished Kiowa pilot and was taking on a new challenge of a different kind of flying, operating a remotely piloted aircraft with the Royal Australian Air Force. He was a loyal, reliable and very trusted member of his unit. Though he was quiet and reserved, he enjoyed a joke with his mates and was always the first among them to volunteer when work was required to be done.


I also had the opportunity to pay my respects to Lieutenant Case at his funeral service, at which his brother Chris described him as 'a person of many colours and many layers', and one with a heart of gold. His brothers and sisters said that after the first five children their mother and father would keep trying for more until they got it right. They stopped with Marcus. He was described as a larrikin and as a ranga, as a kid who had thought he was born on a pirate ship, and as someone who was destined to become a pilot. As a close-knit family they were comforted to know that in death he was never alone, being accompanied all the way home to his family by a mate in Lieutenant Adrian Wilson.


Brigadier Gregory Lawler, Commander of 16th Aviation Brigade, said Lieutenant Case was 'a man with a strong desire to fly, who would get himself into the cockpit no matter what'. The desire and his generosity of spirit was no more evident during Operation Queensland Flood Assist this year. Lieutenant Case was described as 'coming in to work off leave asking what he could do to assist and, as he had no flying clothing, squeezing into a mate's borrowed flying suit'.


Lieutenant Case has brought honour to our nation, the Australian Defence Force, the Australian Army and, most especially, his family. He will be honoured by his colleagues. On behalf of the Australian government, I offer my prayers and support for Lieutenant Case's family and friends. I offer them my assurance that the sacrifice of this astounding young man, this outstanding young soldier, and all others serving their nation will be forever remembered. We will not forget him or Lance Corporal Jones. Lest we forget.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (19:10):  It is with great sadness that I rise to speak on the condolence motion for Lance Corporal Andrew Gordon Jones and Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case. Their deaths on 30 May, Lance Corporal Jones at the hands of an Afghan National Army soldier and Lieutenant Case in a Chinook helicopter crash, brought to 26 the number of Australian soldiers to tragically lose their lives on the battlefields of Afghanistan. These brave and committed men died defending Australia's security in this distant but critically important conflict. Afghanistan is at the front line in the war on terrorism, and the active service of our men and women in uniform has made and continues to make the lives of millions of Australians that much more safe. It is a sacrifice that a grateful nation will never forget.


Lieutenant Case was only 27 years of age. He was based in Sydney with the 6th Aviation Regiment. He was born in Melbourne and went to school at Xavier in my electorate of Kooyong. Lieutenant Case enlisted in the active Army Reserve in 2002 and was posted to the 5th/6th Battalion, Royal Victoria Regiment. In 2003, he commenced commando selection and training, which included an operational tour to East Timor in 2007. He had also been deployed to Malaysia with Rifle Company Butterworth in 2005. Most recently, in January 2011, he was part of the ADF's flood relief operation in Queensland. Lieutenant Case, who was tragically killed on his first tour of Afghanistan, had been deployed there as a Heron unmanned aerial vehicle operator. I attended the funeral of Lieutenant Case, with both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, at St Bede's Church only a few weeks ago. It was a very moving ceremony, with hundreds of Lieutenant Case's friends and colleagues coming to pay their respects to this very special young man and brilliant aviator.


He was clearly much loved by his parents and five siblings. The speeches of his brothers and sisters gave us all an insight into this young man, who drew pictures of helicopters as a young schoolboy and wanted to do his bit to make the world a better place. In the words of his brother Chris: 'He knew his greatest weapon and shield was his mind. We are thankful he was born into our family.' He was also a brilliant sportsman, playing rugby abroad, and was a cherished and close friend to many. He will be sorely missed but will never be forgotten.


Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, who was 25 years of age, was also from Melbourne and also on his first deployment to Afghanistan. He leaves behind his partner and his loving parents and two younger siblings. After joining the Army in 2004 and training as a cook, he was posted to the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, later moving to the 9th Force Support Battalion and then deploying to East Timor in 2008. He was deployed to Afghanistan in November 2010. Lance Corporal Jones was a skilled cook and a respected soldier. In the words of Brigadier David Mulhall, 'He was a bloody good soldier and a bloody great cook.' He was known for his selflessness and his commitment to others.


Australia's military involvement in Afghanistan makes for a difficult time for our country, but having recently visited our soldiers in Oruzgan and Kandahar as part of a bipartisan parliamentary delegation I saw first-hand the important work they are doing in bringing security and stability to this war-torn country. It is a difficult mission, but they are making a real difference. More significantly yesterday, today and tomorrow are difficult times for the Jones and Case families. Their pain is felt by all Australians. We stand ready to support them in every way we can. They need to know that their sacrifice and that of their families is not in vain and will never be forgotten by a grateful nation. Lest we forget.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter—Chief Government Whip) (19:15):  I join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and all members who either have or will make a contribution to this very, very important condolence motion for Lance Corporal Andrew Gordon Jones and Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case. Both died in separate incidents on 30 May this year while on operations in Afghanistan.


Lance Corporal Andrew Gordon Jones was from the 9th Force Support Battalion and was serving with the Force Support Unit in the Chora Valley, an area I know well. It is a shockingly rugged part of the world. He was an Army cook by trade and an Australian soldier by profession, on duty in uniform the day he died. Sadly, he was only 25 years old.


Lieutenant Marcus Sean Case was a member of the Sydney based 6th Aviation Regiment. He began his training as a reservist and deferred his university studies to serve in the Army full-time. He trained as a commando, which is a great achievement, and was deployed to East Timor. Marcus then trained as a pilot and had deployed to Afghanistan as a Heron unmanned aerial vehicle operator. He was taking part in a resupply sortie in southern Afghanistan when the helicopter in which he was being carried crashed. Again, very sadly, he was only 27 years of age.


I did not know either of these very fine Australians but, like all those who have gone before them, it is easy for us to almost feel that we have known them. We know what they were and what they were doing, and we certainly know that they believed in what they were doing. It is a great constant in this conflict, and I am sure in conflicts before it, that while we mourn their lives very deeply we take some comfort, as do their families and their friends, because I have spoken with many of them on previous occasions. We know that they believed in what they were doing, they were committed to what they were doing and they knew all of the risks. Just as importantly, having very sadly attended a number of ramp ceremonies and military funerals, I know their families and loved ones supported them in what they were doing. Generally speaking, although I do not know the families on this occasion, soldiers have the support of their loved ones and their loved ones support what they are doing because they know that that is what they want to be doing. Soldiers who spend so much time training want to put that training into effect, and there is no better way to do so than in defence of their nation's interest.


We are in Afghanistan for important reasons even though there seems to be some doubt in the public mind from time to time. The reality is that failed states pose a risk to countries like Australia and of course we know that many Australians who were killed in places like Bali and Jakarta were killed at the hands of people who had their training in Afghanistan. We have been there too long and we have lost too many young lives, but our mission remains an important one. Like the Prime Minister, I am very, very strongly of the view—as is the Chief of the Defence Force, who spoke quite strongly very recently at a press conference on the occasion of a death—that we need to stay and finish the task we have at hand. That immediate task of course, in addition to the disruption operations of our special forces is to train the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National Police to the point at which they are able to take care of their own security. When we have done so we should be in a position to bring our people home with our heads held high. 


There has been some speculation in recent days, and I suppose effectively confirmed by Secretary Gates of the United States that we are now going through a round of negotiations with the insurgents. I used to say when I was minister that there is a very big difference between negotiating with extremists and talking with moderates. The reality is that success in Afghanistan will not come by military means alone. It will only come when we have a political settlement, and of course when we have sufficiently built the systems of governance and effectively built the economic infrastructure that will be required to make Afghanistan what I might describe as a normal country. But finish the job we must. We cannot allow 27 Australians who have given their lives in Afghanistan to have given their lives in vain. Again, when I have spoken with families in the past they have asked that of me and us collectively—that is, do not let them down by not finishing the good work they began. 


I take this opportunity to thank families, friends and loved ones of these two very, very brave Australians for giving us their sons and for the sacrifices their sons made. And, of course, I take this opportunity to extend my own very, very deep sympathy to all those who have been affected by these two very great tragedies.

Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (19:21):  I would like to join with previous speakers, former defence minister, and other speakers that have made a contribution on the condolence motions for Lance Corporal Andrew Jones and Lieutenant Marcus Case. When you look at photographs of these two soldiers, there is a temptation that you could view them with the detachment of not having personally known those two men. But as a former member of the Australian Regular Army, I can quite easily imagine the moment when these photographs were taken, and how proud they were of the recent medal presentation I suspect in the case of Lance Corporal Jones, and of recently having received his wings in the case of Lieutenant Case. You can also imagine how proud their families were for the achievements that these two fine young soldiers and for what they had done.


When you look at the circumstances again, we think of Afghanistan and we think of the circumstances where most of our soldiers have died, under tragic circumstance of course, of improvised explosive devices, or the fire fights that are all part and parcel of armed conflict. When you think of that it is then hard to reconcile the fates of these two soldiers. I know that it was not that long ago, certainly in terms of the SAS's collective memory, that we have lost so many in the tragic Black Hawk crash. When we look at the case of Lieutenant Case losing his life in the crash of a Chinook helicopter, and the Afghan National Army soldier that killed Lance Corporal Jones, these are different circumstances then when you are not actually faced with that two-way fire fight, the improvised explosive device threat. To have lost two soldiers in these circumstances seems even more tragic than in the normal cases. But what I would say is that what we learn from this is that the profession of arms, the wearing of the uniform of the Australian Army, and in the case of the Air Force and Navy as well, it is a life of risk. It is a life where you open yourself to the possibilities of death and serious injury, and not just through the fire fights. The training, the activities that are undertaken and the way in which combat and military service is prosecuted open people to the risk of the worst case, the supreme sacrifice. So it is the case here. The death of Lance Corporal Jones, brutally and clearly without remorse, being shot down by a person that he thought he could trust, makes that betrayal even worse. And, whilst there might be some comfort for family that it would appear his killer has been brought to ultimate justice with his recent shooting, it is nevertheless a reminder to us of the threats that will always face our people.


The Taliban are a brutal opposition. They are a people that have never added any value to the world. They have only ever been a negative influence for the people of Afghanistan—for the children, for the women and for the girls of Afghanistan. They have only ever been negative. As I have said, they have never added value. I suspect that, in the case of the insurgent that killed Lance Corporal Andrew Jones, he was dealt with in the only way that he could have been dealt with in the end, so I certainly thank the Special Forces soldiers that were able to deal with him in the appropriate manner.


As for Lieutenant Case, Australia is no stranger to our soldiers losing their lives in aviation accidents. We have had the Black Hawk crash in the past that killed so many of our finest SAS soldiers, and we have had other military aviation accidents as well. It is an unfortunate part of operations, and in operating these sorts of aircraft there is a greater level of risk.


I guess in many ways it is cold comfort to the families that their loved ones were taken in these circumstances. But we must never forget that they were there in Afghanistan doing what had to be done, and that is what we should be concentrating on. That is what the families should be concentrating on. Regardless of the circumstances, these guys, these soldiers believed in the mission they were a part of and they believed that there will be a better world and a better Afghanistan for the fact that they were there. Despite what happened and despite the way in which they lost their lives, they have done great service for the people of Afghanistan and of course for the national interest of our great country.


So I pay tribute to Lance Corporal Andrew Jones and I have paid tribute to Lieutenant Marcus Case. Their lives were not in vain. There will be a better future for the sacrifice they have provided, and I hope that their families have some comfort in the fact that they lost their lives and paid the ultimate sacrifice for a very good cause. I wish their families all the best in the future and I express my condolences.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (19:35):  by leave—I rise to speak on the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill 2011. We on this side of the House understand that high-quality intelligence is arguably more important to government now than at any time since World War II. Global terrorism has transformed Australia's perceptions of its security, and intelligence is a key facet in Australia's response to this changed environment. Since September 2001 the coalition government provided over $10.4 billion of funding to 2010-11 to enhance Australia's national security and counterterrorism by increasing the capacity of our intelligence agencies and also by boosting Australia's aviation, maritime and border security.


I want to say at the outset that I am a supporter of our Australian intelligence services. They need tools in place so they can conduct their business efficiently and properly, and we need to provide them with these tools. Unfortunately, the Gillard Labor government's most recent budget was a blow for our intelligence and national security community. Labor's latest budget revealed that Labor is going to waste $1.75 billion in taxpayers' money on the blow-out in the immigration detention program, but in the meantime the Gillard Labor government has slashed Australia's national security and border protection budgets to pay for its costly immigration and border protection disaster.


Labor cut $6.9 million in funding to ASIO for its security checks for protection visa applicants. They have made this funding cut at a time when ASIO is under increasing pressure to pump through vast numbers of those security checks for those who have come to Australia illegally via boat. ASIO has also had funding cut for training overseas liaisons, to the tune of $8.8 million in slashed funds. ASIO was not the only national security agency that was targeted by this Labor government for cuts to help their budget bottom line. The Australian Federal Police were also badly affected by Labor's mismanagement of our national security. Labor cut funds to the AFP and also cut 72 of their staff. Considering the work the AFP do with counterterrorism and cybersecurity, in conjunction with our intelligence agencies, it raises grave concerns about how Labor is managing Australia's national security.


I now turn to the specifics of the bill. As outlined in the bill's explanatory memorandum, the purpose of this bill is to amend the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986 to provide the inspector-general with capacity to undertake own-motion preliminary inquiries and extend the capacity for own-motion full inquiries; to permit the delegation of the powers of the office of the inspector-general subject to ministerial approval; and to permit the inspector-general to release material to royal commissions at the discretion of the government of the day. The bill will also make a small number of technical amendments.


As a background to the amendments in this bill, it is important to note that the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security was created in response to the 1983 Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security, known as the Hope royal commission, to provide for oversight and review of the intelligence and security agencies, of which there are now six. The six are the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation, the Defence Intelligence Organisation, the Defence Signals Directorate and the Office of National Assessments.


As the act now stands, it allows the inspector-general to undertake preliminary inquiries, but only when a complaint is made to the office. Where an allegation is made but there has been no complaint to the office, the only formal option for examination of the matter is to commence a full inquiry. There is also an apparent anomaly in the act. The inspector-general can conduct an inquiry on his or her own motion into the activities of the Office of National Assessments, ASIO and DIO but has no such capacity in regard to the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation, DSD or ASIS.


Presently, the act also permits the inspector-general to provide to the Prime Minister a copy of any report covering the ONA but not the other five agencies within the inspector-general's jurisdiction. As the act presently stands, it does not provide for any power of delegation. All the powers of the office must be exercised personally. This limits the number of inquiries that can be conducted at any one time on top of the inspection and complaint handling functions. The provisions of the act relating to secrecy are intended to prevent court proceedings becoming an indirect channel for the disclosure of information and documents gathered as a result of the complete access to which the inspector-general is entitled. However, there are likely to be instances where the inspector-general could assist the work of a royal commission. The bill will make provision for regulations for a commission to seek such evidence. The inspector-general will not, however, be obligated to give evidence at the request of any royal commission.


In concluding, I would like to draw attention to the matter that the honourable member for Berowra brought up in the House yesterday when reporting on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. Following on from the comments I made earlier, I would also like to endorse the comments made by the member for Berowra about the serious impact of Labor's efficiency dividends and budget cuts to our national security and intelligence agencies. The need for intelligence agencies has in no way been diminished and we live in an increasingly uncertain world. Their workload is growing, especially in relation to counter-espionage and cyberterrorism with increasing worldwide threats to our national interest. The impact of efficiency dividends is likely to weaken the ongoing effectiveness and the capacity of these intelligence organisations which we on this side of the House have been trying to develop. The coalition believe the intelligence community should be adequately resourced at a time when it is facing increasing challenges. The coalition support the passage of this legislation through the House. However, it reserves the right to move amendments in the Senate, pending the report from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which is due to report on 7 July.


I will end as I began: we live in an increasingly uncertain world and the roles of our intelligence agencies remain very important in keeping Australia safe from myriad threats that we face in the national security environment. It is very important that the legislative basis for the actions of that intelligence community keeps pace with these changes and the opposition therefore support the passage of this bill, although with the caveat that we will be interested in the report from the relevant Senate committee and we reserve our right to make amendments on that basis.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2011-06-21,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (19:43):  by leave—Much has happened in the world in the more than 20 years since the creation of the inspector-general, which I understand was originally set up in response to the 1983 royal commission on intelligence and security. The world of 1983 is very different from the world that we see ourselves in today. In 1983, the Soviet Union was still in existence and our security and intelligence services continued to view the world through the prism of the Cold War. However, much has changed since that time. The Berlin Wall has fallen and the Soviet Union has broken apart. The security concerns of a generation ago seem now a distant memory and the security and intelligence concerns of today are more dynamic and complicated than the world of the Cold War. We have seen the rise of asymmetrical warfare. We have seen the rise of non-state players. We have seen the rise of Asia and in particular China. We have seen instability in our region. But perhaps, most importantly, we have been witness to the tragic events of September 11 2001 and the rise of Islamist terrorist organisations. The events of that day brought into stark reality the presence of not only a new threat to Australia's interests overseas but also a very real threat to the physical safety of Australians domestically and abroad. We have seen this with the Bali bombings and the attacks on hotels and our embassy in Jakarta. At home we have seen our security and intelligence services foil plans to attack military and civilian facilities. These events, both tragic and alarming, underscore the very real impacts of these new world threats on our way of life.


Apart from the change in the types of threats facing Australia, the world has also seen great technological change. In 1983 when the royal commission took place, who could have imagined the changes that we have now seen in technology, especially with the internet and social media. I was in India in 1996, and the internet had just actually hit the streets. I think that I was one of about 120 people in New Delhi, which is a city of some 20 million, using the internet. So we look at the changes that have taken place in just that time.


The use of the internet has been of particular use to al-Qaeda in its recruitment and propaganda. As the Director-General of Security noted in his statement to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee:


The internet helps al-Qaeda in its task. It is both a propaganda and a recruitment tool. It provides terrorists with both a platform to support operational activity and the means through which to project their ideology onto the international stage. The dissemination of violent extremist ideology through the internet poses the very real danger of drawing individuals down the path of radicalisation.


The new threats and the new technologies serve to highlight the importance of having a well-resourced and supported intelligence apparatus. The potential danger and tragedy that could result from not having one is too great. I believe very firmly that the only reason we have been spared the experience of a London bombing or a September 11 is because of the great work of ASIO and its sister agencies. However, it is a constant battle and one with the consequence of failure being very high. That is why this government has invested in increasing the capabilities and capacity of our security service.


In addition, I think these organisations do great work. I have had some dealings—both as a member of parliament and in my former life as someone who was with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and who consulted with the Department of Defence for 10 years—with those people who work in the intelligence community. The work of the staff in our intelligence agencies, by its nature, goes largely unsung. Unlike other public servants who can at least see or speak about the fruits of their work in the world, the members of these agencies must be silent and largely unseen.


It has often been said that the success of the intelligence agencies is usually measured by the things that do not happen—the terrorist attacks prevented and the assassinations that never took place. Thus, it is very easy for us to take their work for granted and possibly, in extreme cases, even claim that they serve no purpose. But we should avoid such simplistic analysis.


However, that is not to say that the intelligence services should be given an entirely free hand in what they do. There are obvious and at times well-founded concerns about the accountability and probity of intelligence services. The concerns are perhaps more relevant given that this parliament has in the past consented to the passage of new laws and regulations which, in the case of security related offences, provide the justice authorities and intelligence services with greater powers and flexibility than would apply in the usual criminal cases.


Our intelligence services are today armed and empowered to a much greater degree than ever before. Their capacity to gather information, and therefore their implied capacity to infringe on civil liberties, has never been greater. While this expansion in capacity is to the credit of the government—for it would be shirking its duty to defend the country if it did not do what it thought was necessary—we must consider the protection of the individual's liberty as well as their safety. I believe it is critical that whenever the state takes on new powers over the individual there must be built-in processes and protocols that ensure these new powers cannot be abused. It is in this light that we should consider this bill, for this bill is about oversight and scrutiny of the intelligence services. It is a true mark of a mature, liberal democracy that it can maintain and support effective covert intelligence services while at the same time ensure that the powers held by these services cannot be abused or used to infringe upon the liberties of its citizens. In this light, I would also like to recognise the work done by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and her staff in ensuring that our intelligence community are true servants of the Australian community and not their own.


The inspector-general of intelligence has oversight of ASIO and ASIS as well as the Defence Imagery and Geo-spatial Organisation, the Defence Signals Directorate, the Office of National Assessments and the Defence Intelligence Organisation. The inspector-general of intelligence has the responsibility to review and, where necessary, investigate the intelligence services to ensure their activities comply with ministerial direction and legislative requirements and with respect for human rights. The IGIS does so independently, with a capacity to generate their own investigations as well as in response to ministers and the public.


The amendments before this House today are designed to update and modernise this legislation to address issues that have become evident over time. This bill will ensure that the essential work of the inspector-general is carried out efficiently and effectively and will strengthen the accountability and oversight of the Australian intelligence community. The amendments in this bill expressly recognise the role of the inspector-general in assisting the government in providing the parliament and the public with assurances that the intelligence community is subject to scrutiny and is using its powers in accordance with law. It also strengthens the capacity of the IGIS to undertake its own-motion preliminary and full inquiries, provides for the ability to delegate the power of the office with ministerial approval and, as well, provides the IGIS with the capacity to release material to assist royal commissions.


It is a cliche, but true, that the price of democracy is eternal vigilance. I firmly believe that this includes appropriate and robust oversight of our intelligence community. This robust oversight is the reason the Australian public has such support for our intelligence services. This very oversight is the difference between a police state and a modern, liberal democracy. I commend the government for its commitment to national security as well as for its commitment to ensuring that our intelligence services are acting with integrity and propriety. I commend the bill to the House.

"Hawke, Alex, MP",LP,2011-06-21,"



Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (19:53):  by leave—I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill 2011. I rise simply to record a series of what I regard as concerns merely with what could be seen as some of the acts that this bill is seeking to change. The member for Canberra referred to modernising, and I do not think anybody has a problem with modernising, but my concerns are with some of the powers within this bill that we are discussing today. It is important to note at this juncture that we have referred the matter to a Senate committee, and I think that is probably a wise decision in relation to the power to delegate. The office of the IGIS was created in 1983 and there are now six intelligence agencies in Australia. The IGIS was set up to provide an oversight and review, and I think the member for Canberra makes an important point about having sufficient oversight and review functions of such important agencies in a liberal democracy. I want to record my support of those six agencies and the work that they do on behalf of our nation. Intelligence and the gathering of it is, by necessity, a secret business; nonetheless, I regard it as fundamental for our nation's security and its future. The act currently allows IGIS to undertake preliminary inquiries, but only when a complaint is made to its office. Where an allegation is made but there has been no complaint to the office, the only formal option for examination of the matter is to commence a full inquiry. There is also an apparent anomaly in this act in that IGIS can only conduct an inquiry on its own into the activities of agencies such as the ONA, ASIO and DIO but has no capacity in regard to DIGO, the Defence Signals Directorate or ASIS. That is an anomaly that does need to be corrected. I think that is a valid and important modernisation of this act. The act also permits IGIS to provide the Prime Minister a copy of any report covering ONA but not the other five agencies. There are plenty of discrepancies within this current act that certainly do need modernising and these amendments from the government are to be welcomed and bring us into line with what you would regard as a common-sense approach for this particularly important agency.


At present the act does not provide for any power of delegation. I think this is where as an opposition we have a concern. If you are proposing a power of delegation, that should be the subject of sufficient scrutiny and review to ensure that we are not giving extra power or additional ability that we may not ordinarily grant as a parliament to such agencies. There is very sensitive information that IGIS is able to gather and that needs to be closely held. The ability to delegate is probably something that should have a very rigorous examination by Senate committee.


The act also confers strong coercive powers on IGIS, which should not be allowed to proliferate. Those coercive powers in relation to calling witnesses and bringing people to provide evidence or information are very serious. It is the role of government to hold an exclusive monopoly on the right to use force and we allow agencies, particularly police and intelligence services, to use it on our behalf. They have to be subject to the appropriate protection and scrutiny for all citizens. This is a valid consideration that the opposition has in terms of ensuring that this is given broad scrutiny. That is why we have foreshadowed that we do not oppose this bill as it is currently drafted, but there could be potential amendments following an examination by the Senate committee. I think it is important that that consideration is given, particularly in regard to these powers of delegation.


I do not really have a lot of other objections or things I would like to comment on in relation to this bill. I note the submissions and concerns that will be provided to the Senate committee will deal with many of these provisions. There are some concerns from the Law Council of Australia. While I may not always agree with the Law Council of Australia, I think it is proper that they have the opportunity, as do other concerned stakeholders, to put their concerns to a properly comprised Senate committee where we can consider the scope for any further amendments to this act and to the provisions of the amendment bill before us today. While not opposing anything in particular, in fact there are some worthwhile provisions in this bill, it is important that it have rigorous scrutiny and that people be given the opportunity to make submissions on potential further amendments to this legislation.

Thus, it is very easy for us to take their work for granted and possibly, in extreme cases, even claim that they serve no purpose. But we should avoid such simplistic analysis.


However, that is not to say that the intelligence services should be given an entirely free hand in what they do. There are obvious and at times well-founded concerns about the accountability and probity of intelligence services. The concerns are perhaps more relevant given that this parliament has in the past consented to the passage of new laws and regulations which, in the case of security related offences, provide the justice authorities and intelligence services with greater powers and flexibility than would apply in the usual criminal cases.


Our intelligence services are today armed and empowered to a much greater degree than ever before. Their capacity to gather information, and therefore their implied capacity to infringe on civil liberties, has never been greater. While this expansion in capacity is to the credit of the government—for it would be shirking its duty to defend the country if it did not do what it thought was necessary—we must consider the protection of the individual's liberty as well as their safety. I believe it is critical that whenever the state takes on new powers over the individual there must be built-in processes and protocols that ensure these new powers cannot be abused. It is in this light that we should consider this bill, for this bill is about oversight and scrutiny of the intelligence services. It is a true mark of a mature, liberal democracy that it can maintain and support effective covert intelligence services while at the same time ensure that the powers held by these services cannot be abused or used to infringe upon the liberties of its citizens. In this light, I would also like to recognise the work done by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and her staff in ensuring that our intelligence community are true servants of the Australian community and not their own.


The inspector-general of intelligence has oversight of ASIO and ASIS as well as the Defence Imagery and Geo-spatial Organisation, the Defence Signals Directorate, the Office of National Assessments and the Defence Intelligence Organisation. The inspector-general of intelligence has the responsibility to review and, where necessary, investigate the intelligence services to ensure their activities comply with ministerial direction and legislative requirements and with respect for human rights. The IGIS does so independently, with a capacity to generate their own investigations as well as in response to ministers and the public.


The amendments before this House today are designed to update and modernise this legislation to address issues that have become evident over time. This bill will ensure that the essential work of the inspector-general is carried out efficiently and effectively and will strengthen the accountability and oversight of the Australian intelligence community. The amendments in this bill expressly recognise the role of the inspector-general in assisting the government in providing the parliament and the public with assurances that the intelligence community is subject to scrutiny and is using its powers in accordance with law. It also strengthens the capacity of the IGIS to undertake its own-motion preliminary and full inquiries, provides for the ability to delegate the power of the office with ministerial approval and, as well, provides the IGIS with the capacity to release material to assist royal commissions.


It is a cliche, but true, that the price of democracy is eternal vigilance. I firmly believe that this includes appropriate and robust oversight of our intelligence community. This robust oversight is the reason the Australian public has such support for our intelligence services. This very oversight is the difference between a police state and a modern, liberal democracy. I commend the government for its commitment to national security as well as for its commitment to ensuring that our intelligence services are acting with integrity and propriety. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (19:53):  by leave—I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill 2011. I rise simply to record a series of what I regard as concerns merely with what could be seen as some of the acts that this bill is seeking to change. The member for Canberra referred to modernising, and I do not think anybody has a problem with modernising, but my concerns are with some of the powers within this bill that we are discussing today. It is important to note at this juncture that we have referred the matter to a Senate committee, and I think that is probably a wise decision in relation to the power to delegate. The office of the IGIS was created in 1983 and there are now six intelligence agencies in Australia. The IGIS was set up to provide an oversight and review, and I think the member for Canberra makes an important point about having sufficient oversight and review functions of such important agencies in a liberal democracy. I want to record my support of those six agencies and the work that they do on behalf of our nation. Intelligence and the gathering of it is, by necessity, a secret business; nonetheless, I regard it as fundamental for our nation's security and its future. The act currently allows IGIS to undertake preliminary inquiries, but only when a complaint is made to its office. Where an allegation is made but there has been no complaint to the office, the only formal option for examination of the matter is to commence a full inquiry. There is also an apparent anomaly in this act in that IGIS can only conduct an inquiry on its own into the activities of agencies such as the ONA, ASIO and DIO but has no capacity in regard to DIGO, the Defence Signals Directorate or ASIS. That is an anomaly that does need to be corrected. I think that is a valid and important modernisation of this act. The act also permits IGIS to provide the Prime Minister a copy of any report covering ONA but not the other five agencies. There are plenty of discrepancies within this current act that certainly do need modernising and these amendments from the government are to be welcomed and bring us into line with what you would regard as a common-sense approach for this particularly important agency.


At present the act does not provide for any power of delegation. I think this is where as an opposition we have a concern. If you are proposing a power of delegation, that should be the subject of sufficient scrutiny and review to ensure that we are not giving extra power or additional ability that we may not ordinarily grant as a parliament to such agencies. There is very sensitive information that IGIS is able to gather and that needs to be closely held. The ability to delegate is probably something that should have a very rigorous examination by Senate committee.


The act also confers strong coercive powers on IGIS, which should not be allowed to proliferate. Those coercive powers in relation to calling witnesses and bringing people to provide evidence or information are very serious. It is the role of government to hold an exclusive monopoly on the right to use force and we allow agencies, particularly police and intelligence services, to use it on our behalf. They have to be subject to the appropriate protection and scrutiny for all citizens. This is a valid consideration that the opposition has in terms of ensuring that this is given broad scrutiny. That is why we have foreshadowed that we do not oppose this bill as it is currently drafted, but there could be potential amendments following an examination by the Senate committee. I think it is important that that consideration is given, particularly in regard to these powers of delegation.


I do not really have a lot of other objections or things I would like to comment on in relation to this bill. I note the submissions and concerns that will be provided to the Senate committee will deal with many of these provisions. There are some concerns from the Law Council of Australia. While I may not always agree with the Law Council of Australia, I think it is proper that they have the opportunity, as do other concerned stakeholders, to put their concerns to a properly comprised Senate committee where we can consider the scope for any further amendments to this act and to the provisions of the amendment bill before us today. While not opposing anything in particular, in fact there are some worthwhile provisions in this bill, it is important that it have rigorous scrutiny and that people be given the opportunity to make submissions on potential further amendments to this legislation.
