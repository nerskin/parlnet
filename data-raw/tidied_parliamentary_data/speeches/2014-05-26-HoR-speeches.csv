The SPEAKER
 (10:01):  I have a statement to make this morning concerning a question that was asked on the last day of sitting last week about posters in corridors. On 15 May 2014, the member for Moreton asked me a question about the display of posters in corridors. Posters had appeared on the outside of doors to several members' suites, and the member had asked that they be taken down. Consistent with the longstanding practice, upheld by successive Speakers, that signs and posters not be permitted in the corridors or on the doors leading off the corridors, the members concerned were asked to take those posters down, at my request, and they have since been removed. It remains the prerogative of members to place material inside the internal corridor windows of their suites. Also, all members are entitled to use their suites for their own purposes, but of course not for illegal purposes.

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (10:10):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Abbott government's decisions, since being elected, to underfund the education of our children will create a permanent underclass in this country. These decisions to underfund education at the national level will divide communities. These decisions to underfund education at the national level will increase inequity and unfairness. Labor, historically and today, remains and is the best party to look after education in this country.


This bill is consistent with Labor values. This bill constructively seeks to remedy the bad decisions—before too much damage is done to the educational opportunities of millions of Australian schoolchildren. The reasons why we put this bill forward are several. In part, we put this bill forward because our parliament has always taken an interest in education at the school level. In part, we put this bill forward because we already see the damage that some state jurisdictions are doing because they are not required to fund schools in the same manner in which the Commonwealth expects good state jurisdictions to do so.


This bill is also more urgently required than ever, because the budget brought down a fortnight ago is nothing short of a calamity and a disaster for Australian schoolchildren, for their parents and teachers, and for people who love education in this country. It is also the case that this bill should be passed by the House, because to do otherwise is to sell the future of this country short. And, most importantly perhaps, this bill should be passed because the finest minds in education, the many parents of Australian schoolchildren, and the hardworking teachers in our schools know that unless we fund education on a needs basis, we will create an underclass in this country.


Turning to the first of the reasons why this bill should be supported, and in moving this bill, we reject this latest argument of a promise-breaking and deceitful government: that somehow schools are not the responsibility in any fashion of the national government. I believe that most fair-minded Australians, when they watched the so-called Minister for Education—I would use that as a very loose term—and he said, 'It is not our responsibility to take a role in the schools of Australia,' rejected that abysmal rewriting of Australian political and education history. We acknowledge that the Constitution of Australia provides the states with a significant role and responsibility with regard to the schools of Australia. But there are many well recognised constitutional heads of power which allocate a responsibility to the federal government of Australia. Section 96 of our Constitution—and those faux conservatives on the other side who always believe in tradition seem to neglect actual constitutional history in this country—and other sections of our Constitution have been appropriately relied upon for many decades as the basis upon which the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth parliament take an interest in the schools and the children of Australia.


Indeed, this year is the 50th anniversary of a 1964 piece of legislation called the States Grants (Science Laboratories and Technical Training) Act. This was a decision by the Menzies Liberal government to provide capital grants for science laboratories and equipment in secondary schools. 




Mr Tudge:
  Great decision.




Mr SHORTEN:
  The member opposite says 'great decision'. It is just a shame that they have forgotten their own history. In 1969 there was the States Grants (Secondary Schools Libraries) Act. That was for financing library facilities—again, a federal government supporting schools. In 1972, there was the State Grants Act for broadening capital expenditure; in 1970, recurrent funding for non-government schools; in 1972-73, a Labor government ensured that there was recurrent spending for government schools; in 1974, targeted programs to assist with special education needs, professional development and, indeed, support for disadvantaged schools. 


Members of the House: one of the bases upon which this government seeks to reject this bill is that it says there is no role for the federal government in the funding of schools and making requirements. What a pack of hypocrites! How ignorant of their own history that they would now turn their backs on 50 years of support for government and non-government schools through the Parliament of Australia. I remind this government, who was so quick in its ideological desire to create extreme and unfair policies for this country: ignore your own history at your peril. This parliament is the custodian of the right of Australian children to have a good education. The right to a good education is now in the care of this parliament. Unless this parliament acts upon it, unless we continue to fight for the right of children to have a good education in this country, we will realise to our cost—not only to the cost of the children of Australia and their parents but to the cost of the future of this country—that the right to a good education will be more easily lost than it was won. 


We will fight hard to defend the right to a good education in this country. We will fight hard to ensure that we do not see the creation of a permanent underclass in this country. It is appropriate that we guard jealously the sensible use of Commonwealth funds. Since this government was elected and made its offering to pay some money to the states and territories, we have seen some states and territories take their own funding out of schools. We have seen the looting of schools in the Northern Territory by their own administration. We have seen the sacking of teachers and educational assistants in Western Australia by a state government that is freed of the leash of any requirements. What happened is that the Commonwealth government, which would hold itself up as some sort of guardian of fiscal prudential interests in decision making, wandered along to the state governments, with what the state governments could only have believed to be their good luck—and said, 'You can have the money, no strings attached.'


Sorry, did I say 'no strings attached'? There is one string attached. Only a government with obsessive detail to the irrelevant and who ignores the important would say on the one hand, 'It is not our responsibility to tell states how to fund schools'—except when it comes to chaplains. Why didn't we recognise that this party is no longer the party of Menzies, no longer the party of ensuring that the Commonwealth takes an interest in the education of our children? Of course, there is always one exception to prove their complete hypocrisy. They have made it clear when it comes to school chaplains that we do not want psychologists and welfare workers who are not attached to religious organisations. The government have put this requirement to the states of Australia. They are saying on one hand that we are not going to fund you properly in the future; but, on the other hand, we will make sure that your chaplain belongs to a religious organisation. The state governments scratch their heads when they deal with this government. 


In this budget, which emphasises even more the need to pass this bill, we have seen the states realise what an anti-education party is this government. State Premier Campbell Newman—someone whom I am not normally in agreement with, thus proving that even a stopped clock can be right twice a day—has said:


We're all in agreement that what the government is doing—


that would be the Abbott-Hockey government—


in relation to health and education is not acceptable.


Mike Baird, perhaps not in the most elegant of prose but certainly pithily, described cuts to education in New South Wales as 'a kick in the guts to the people of New South Wales'. Victorian Premier Dennis Napthine, no doubt feeling the hot breath of an election in September on his neck, in November said of these education cuts:


These are simply unaffordable and unsustainable, and those who will be affected are ordinary Australian families …


This is why this bill should be supported—because we will not stand idly by and watch the education system of Australia be attacked, looted and robbed.


I remind this House, in closing, that many Australians put a high value on education. Many people without money depend upon a well-funded public education system not as a luxury like Foxtel but as something that is a doorway to opportunity for their families. I commend this bill to the House.

Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (10:32):  I move:


That this House:


(1) recognises that the maintenance of safe, sustainable rates in the trucking industry is essential for ensuring community safety on our roads; and


(2) calls on the Government to retain the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal intact, and not to allow profit-taking to take precedence over the reasonable safety of motorists and truck drivers.


Like many Australians who understand the trucking industry, I am astounded that the government is considering abandoning the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. The link between trucking accidents and the contract conditions of owner-drivers has been established beyond reasonable doubt in report after report. We expect heavy haulage drivers to operate in a safe manner with proper fatigue management practices in place, but we know that unless owner-drivers are paid reasonable rates and are given reasonable delivery schedules the pressure will be on to cut corners to meet the high cost environments in which they operate. For many owner-drivers, many of whom I know, the stakes are very high. They mortgage their houses to buy their rigs. They cannot afford to turn down unsafe jobs. I have watched the pressure under which these truckies have operated over the last three decades. Indeed, I was in my 20s when I first learnt of the alternative meaning of the mixed grill, the cocktail of pills that is used to keep going on those punishing schedules like the Perth-Darwin run.


When I became the transport minister in WA I was appalled to see that same pressure to drive too long and overload was still being applied to drivers. It was appalling to see the resistance to the chain of responsibility legislation that would have made those cost-cutting principles take some responsibility. It is all very well for Coles and Woolworths and the like to engage in cost-cutting wars, but in the end someone pays. Here it is the truck drivers and their families and, tragically, very often other road users, people like Suzanne De Beer, a very wonderful, very compassionate WA woman whose husband was killed by a fatigued truck driver. She attended the trial of that truck driver, and she had this to say:


That day in court, hearing all the detail of the case and how long the guy had been on the road; my thought was he should not have been the only one on trial. You know there's the whole industry should've been on trial … that day.


And indeed they should.


We have made some progress. I was very pleased that in WA we were able to put in place the very first protective legislation in Australia in the Owner-Drivers (Contracts and Disputes) Act 2007. And, federally, the Labor government took this up with the establishment of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal in 2012, establishing a mandatory minimum rate of pay and related conditions for employed and self-employed truck drivers, removing that pressure to contribute to unsafe work practices—and it has worked. It has worked. The Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics has shown a 30 per cent fall in the number of fatal truck crashes involving articulated trucks over the last year.


We demand that the irresponsible history of denial by the minister for transport that there is a compelling link between the terms of contracts of truck drivers and the time and cost schedules under which they are put and the safety of truck drivers be addressed. We can no longer deny this link. We need to act now. We need to ensure that that legislation which has so comprehensively been demonstrated to produce sound results is supported and not repealed. On this matter, we must take a practical, pragmatic approach, put ideology on hold and make sure that we give our truck drivers a safe working environment and that we ensure that all of our road users are not being undermined by cost-cutting, reprehensible behaviour on the part of the trucking industry.

"Coulton, Mark, MP",Nats,2014-05-26,"



Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (10:37):  I too come into this place to debate the motion before us. I do not come here looking through the eyes of a union official or a Labor Party apparatchik. This is about a heavy vehicle drivers licence, so I come from having some experience of driving trucks up and down the roads. I can say as a member of the coalition that nothing concerns me more than safety on our roads, particularly the safety of those people who drive trucks and keep this country going. The electorate of Parkes has the Newell Highway traversing it from one end to the other. It is one of the largest and busiest freight corridors in Australia, so I know only too well the important role that the transport industry has and also the importance of safety.


The member for Perth, I believe, is jumping the gun, probably in an attempt to gain a favour from her friends in the TWU. The coalition agreed before the election to a review of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal legislation, and as yet we are waiting for the result. I would suggest to the member for Perth that perhaps we wait and see what the review shows up, what recommendations come out of it, before we jump to too many conclusions in this place.


The idea of tying the salary of truck drivers to road safety is indeed a tenuous one. I have to say that some of the items that are in this year's budget, which has just been released, around black-spot funding and increased road funding through infrastructure will also play major roles in the safety of our truck drivers. As we continue the duplication of the Pacific Highway and upgrade the Bruce Highway—and indeed, in my own backyard, create more overtaking lanes and stopping bays, properly serviced resting bays for truck drivers—that will lead to greater outcomes in road safety.


Recent developments include revised health and safety laws, the introduction of modern awards, the Fair Work Commission and the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator. Where the legislation comes unstuck is that, when a transport operator picks up a load of cattle from a remote cattle station from, say, a part of my electorate or somewhere up in Queensland, a contract will be exchanged that goes through the Fair Work Commission. It is bureaucracy and the TWU getting their fingers on all levels of the operation. Former transport union employees have spoken against the tribunal, noting that there is 'barely a specific case study where a death is involved to support the link between rates of pay and safety'. Concerns have also been raised by those within the road transport industry that the work of the tribunal could overlap with and undermine other regulations and could impose onerous and unnecessary compliance burdens, as I just mentioned. 


Consistent with our commitment, the government commissioned the review shortly after the election to be conducted by Mr Rex Deighton-Smith of Jaguar Consulting, who has 25 years of experience in public policy and whose expertise includes policy research and analysis, regulatory impact assessment, competition policy and stakeholder consultation. Mr Deighton-Smith also conducted research into safety in the road transport industry for the Rudd-Gillard government. The review is focused on eliminating duplication of regulation and ensuring that regulations and policies for improving safety performance in the road transport industry are based on credible evidence. The review involves the assessment of the regulatory and economic burden of the road safety and remuneration system on participants in the road transport industry and on the Australian economy generally; examination of whether other Commonwealth, state and territory regulations and initiatives provide a more appropriate means of improving safety outcomes in the road transport industry; examination of any available evidence about the impacts of the road safety remuneration system on improving road safety—for instance, accident data; assessment of the operation and conduct of the tribunal and the extent to which it has achieved its aims and objectives; and consultation with the relevant stakeholders where necessary. This motion is premature. There is a review underway and we should wait and see what it brings up.

Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (10:42):  I rise today to support the motion moved by the member for Perth and join her in calling on the government to retain the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal so that it can do its job to make our roads safer for all users. I note the comments by the member for Parkes and would say that I have not been here long but I have learnt one thing: defence is the best form of attack. So, yes, I too am jumping early and with good reason. Words like 'unstuck' and 'safety could be assumed to be a burden' have me on my feet today. 


The passing of the original legislation in 2012 was an important moment for all Australians. It sent a clear message about the then Labor government's commitment to road safety. But more than sending a message, it ensured that action would be taken to make our roads safer. It created the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, with specific powers to ensure pay and pay-related conditions for truck drivers and that they and the trucks they are driving are at their best when they are on our roads. It was introduced in response to alarming statistics in human cost. Between 2010 and 2012, around 250 people were killed and more than 1,000 suffered serious injuries on our roads in accidents involving trucks. It was the Australian industry with the highest incidence of fatal injuries, with 25 deaths per 100,000 workers in 2008-09. It was 10 times higher than the average for all industries. The legislation was passed to address specific issues: to reduce incentives for drivers to push themselves beyond what is fair, reasonable or safe to make unrealistic deadlines and a decent living; to reduce incentives to cut corners on safety and maintenance; and to make our roads safer for truck drivers and the general public. 


The tribunal was created to do all that was necessary to ensure that truck drivers, whether they are an employee or a self-employed owner-driver, have a safe and fair workplace, while sustaining the long-term viability of the road transport industry. The government of the day recognised the important role of small business, particularly owner-drivers, in the road transport industry. They acknowledged that the small businesses in this sector provide flexibility for businesses to meet demand for the delivery of goods, particularly in rural and regional areas. It was noted at the time of introducing the legislation that small businesses made up around 60 per cent of the road transport industry, yet they made up far less of the income earned in that industry. The Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal works with all stakeholders to ensure that pay and pay-related conditions encourage drivers to drive safely, to manage their hours, and to maintain their vehicles.


The safety of truck drivers and of the community is paramount. When your place of work is the cabin of a prime mover, work conditions and rates of pay that allow for rest are essential for your own safety, for the security of your family and for the safety of everyone else using the road. I heard the term 'road train'—long before I saw one for the first time on the Stuart Highway in 1984—from two brothers who were owner-drivers doing interstate haulage. I was taught by those same brothers to respect trucks on the road and to understand their capacities and limitations. I understand the variation of load on the way a truck manoeuvres, and I appreciate and admire the skill of experienced drivers as much as I admire those who load and secure trucks and ensure driver safety. I understand how important sleep is for truck drivers because, as a family, we lived it.


I also understand the pressures to meet the deadlines; the hours spent waiting to load and unload; the time off the road for repairs and maintenance, or because the roads are congested or flooded—and what it costs in terms of income. I understand the pressure to make the payments on the truck and to keep the business alive. I also understand the love for the work. With that, I also understand how unfair the industry can be, how cutthroat, and how an owner-driver has little time for politics, or organising, or lobbying. In my experience, there was no time for that—just the pressure to stay on the road and make a living. The Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal was established specifically to target this, in an industry that is essential for our economy: to make that industry safer and fairer. While the economic cost is important, it is the human cost that really counts. Very few Australians have not been affected by the loss of a loved family member, a workmate or a friend in a road accident. My family is no different; except that the one we lost was an owner-driver, thrown from his prime mover on a sweeping bend. My family have lived the nightmare of the police visit with the ghastly news. It was a single-vehicle accident so we were, thankfully, spared the worst news—that others might have been killed or injured. The effect was devastating.


As a society, we have changed the way we socialise to counter the damage of road accidents. We have spent millions of dollars on advertising and deterrence. I urge the government to let the tribunal get on with the job.

"Pasin, Tony, MP",LP,2014-05-26,"



Mr PASIN
 (Barker) (10:47):  I rise to debate this private member's motion. The proposition that remuneration equates to safety is flawed. It has no basis in fact. Yet it is this flawed and unsubstantiated thinking that led to the establishment of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not expecting you to take my word on that; rather, let us go to the government's own regulatory impact statement in 2012 on the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. Amongst other things, it said, 'data at this point in time is limited and being definitive around causal link between rates and safety is difficult'. It leads me to rise to speak on this motion today on two fronts.


Firstly, Barker is home to a large heavy vehicle industry. Indeed, some 2,000 of my constituents are long-haul truck drivers. The very establishment of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal does them a disservice, because it assumes that the majority of road accidents are actually the fault of the heavy vehicle driver. That is false and does them, as I say, a great disservice. Why then did we see the establishment of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal into 2012? Well, it might not surprise you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to learn that the Transport Workers Union have been campaigning for the introduction of so-called safe rates for a number of years, claiming that substantial wage increases for road transport drivers will have a positive effect on the safety record of the industry.


Any work-related injury or fatality in the road transport industry is one too many. I speak, as did the previous speaker, from a position of personal knowledge, so it hurts me when people come into this place and use workplace safety as a cloak to mask a different agenda. Clearly, this different agenda are the claims of the Transport Workers Union. Let us call this motion for what it is—it pains me to do this. This is cheap politicking by the member for Perth. Worse, it is a further example of the opposition putting the interest of union bosses in front of the national interest. It might be that the member for Perth is looking to improve her standing, given that she was the parliamentary secretary for Western Australia during what can only be described as an outrageous defeat of the ALP in WA.


I was thinking about union influence and was reminded briefly of the attempts by the Leader of the Opposition to crab walk from the influence of unions in the Labor Party and also, over the autumn recess, of the comments made by the member for Bendigo that, in fact, union bosses do not exert enough influence on the ALP. The reality is that in relation to the overall incidence rate of work related entries in the transport industry there was a 20 per cent reduction between 2002 and 2012—rates of accidents have decreased.


What, then, of the coalition's position? The coalition detailed their plan in May 2013, well before the last federal election. We undertook to undertake an urgent review of the operations of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. Consistent with our commitment, the government commissioned a review—that was conducted by Rex Deighton-Smith—shortly after the election. The review focused on eliminating duplication in regulation and ensuring that regulations and policies for approving safety performance in the road transport industry are based on credible evidence. The coalition government have received the review and are carefully considering it before making any decision.


As I have said, the motion from the member for Perth says cheap politicking and is deeply hurtful to me. It is yet another example of the opposition putting union bosses' interests ahead of those of the nation. If the opposition were genuinely interested in ensuring the safest possible roads they would wait to see the review and examine it in a calm and methodical manner, not simply come in here and move a motion on behalf of their mates in the TWU.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (10:52):  I commend the member for Perth for bringing this important motion to our attention. The government's lack of commitment to ensuring the highest level of safety on Australia's roads is of great concern, quite frankly. The government is yet to come clean on its plans for the future of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. This tribunal, bear in mind, was given the important task of establishing a safe road system based on safe rates for the Australian transport industry to ensure the safety of all road users. The tribunal should be left alone by this government and allowed to get on and do its job, which is to make our roads safer for everybody.


The road transport industry is one of the deadliest in Australia, with death rates 15 times higher than the national average. Fatality rates on road freight transport doubled between 2011 and 2013, which should be of concern to everybody. It is not only the workers in the industry who are affected: out of the 330 people who die each year in truck related accidents, between 50 and 70 are truck drivers; the rest are other motorists and pedestrians. Australian truck drivers work hard to make a living, but they should not be expected to die to make a living. In addition to the loss of life, accidents involving heavy vehicles result in high economic cost to this country. Staggeringly, that cost is approaching around $2.8 billion annually.


Safety standards in the road transport industry clearly have an effect on our overall road safety. When truck drivers are overworked the safety of all road users is compromised. Clearly, the financial pressures being placed on our road transport companies and in turn on truck drivers by their major clients are compromising road safety. Truck drivers and their families and other Australian road users are being squeezed to death by the overwhelming market power of big retailers, such as Coles and Woolworths, which account for 33 per cent of road freight movements each day. In 2012 an industry survey of Coles's supply chain showed that 46 per cent of drivers were pressured to skip rest breaks, 28 per cent were pressured to speed and 26 per cent were pressured to carry illegally overweight loads. Delivery schedules set by our major retailers take no account of traffic, road works or other delays and force our drivers to speed and skip rest breaks in order to meet those impossible deadlines. We know what happens if they do not meet these deadlines: they lose their contracts.


It should come as no surprise that a company like Coles, which has donated more than half a million dollars to the Liberal Party since 2004, was strongly opposed to the previous Labor government's measures to strengthen the road safety system. These companies are clearly profit driven; regrettably, concerns about safety are secondary. The government cannot afford to take the same position and needs to stand firm on the side of safety. No-one wants to see people die on our roads. This government cannot afford to abandon the extensive efforts initiated by the previous Labor government to improve road safety standards throughout our transport industry. Unfortunately, those opposite have already demonstrated their priorities, when, in 2012, they opposed the construction of new rest stops and parking bays to assist heavy-vehicle drivers to improve road safety.


I congratulate the Transport Workers Union—led by Tony Sheldon, who has fought long and hard to protect his members, who work in one of the deadliest industries in this country—for its important campaign, which is based on improving safety standards for all members of our community. I urge the government not to abandon the efforts of the Labor Party over the last couple of years to strengthen and support road safety by retaining the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal and not to compromise the safety of transport workers and all road users. It is clear that safety measures in Australia's deadliest industry need to be strengthened, not abandoned.

"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2014-05-26,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (10:57):  This discussion about the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal is very important for this nation. The coalition has a long history of supporting safety in the workplace, particularly in Australia's transport industry, but the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal has brought with it a lot of complexity that has not really addressed the safety issue. We all support safety on our roads. It is a given. One death on the roads is one too many. But how the so-called safe rates campaign translates into safety outcomes is not clear. Let us look at the safety record before the safe rates campaign came to fruition. In 2011, 185 people died in road-trucking accidents. One is too many, let alone 185, but if you look at the three years previous to that, before any of this came to fruition, there was overall a three per cent reduction in accidents involving articulated heavy vehicles. For heavy rigid trucks there was a 14.7 per cent reduction in accidents and fatalities. Overall, in the 10 years prior to the introduction of the tribunal there was a 20 per cent reduction in road-trucking accidents. When you look at the massive expansion of road transport in that time it is really showing a downward trend in accidents rather than an increase.


What really will make a difference to road safety is better roads. In the next few years we have in front of us the biggest road-building campaign by a federal government in the history of Australian government. In the Lyne electorate the road transport industry is front and centre of all our industries. Trucks bring stuff into the electorate and take it out of the electorate. Whether it is industry taking stuff in and out of Taree or Port Macquarie or over to Gloucester, we depend on roads. And what has the coalition got for the Lyne electorate? We have $16 million on the table for the Buckets Way—long overdue—to be delivered this budget. All that road transport going between the Manning Valley and out to Gloucester and down to Newcastle will benefit from it. Look at what we have got on the Pacific Highway: $1.129 billion committed to upgrades north of the Oxley Highway intersection up to Kempsie. We have got increased money for Roads to Recovery. We have got increased money for black spot funding. Safe roads make for improved safety. 


The other complexity concerning the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal is that as well as looking at pay rates for truckies and their conditions, it has factored them into commercial arrangements. In my particular situation, theoretically, when a cattle truck turns up to take a load of animals off to the saleyards or to the abattoirs everything should go through the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. For red tape, one only has to look at this situation. It does not make sense. We want to cut red tape and make the workplace and the arteries of our commerce and tourism safe. In the Pacific Highway upgrade we are going to get more rest stops. We are going to get separated dual-lane highway. This will lead to an increase in safety much more than using safety as a Trojan Horse for unnecessary regulation and for trade unions to be involved in commercial arrangements between customer and provider. We all support road safety and our initiative is going to achieve much more of that than trade unions being involved in commercial arrangements that are not part of the deal. So I think a long-term commitment to improving the transport infrastructure will be a great outcome for people in the trucking industry, for the tourists and for all those family members that have been affected by accidents on the roads.

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (11:02):  I rise in support of the motion and I want to thank my colleague the member for Perth for bringing it to the attention of the House. This is not the first time I have spoken on this issue in the parliament and, in fact, it is something I alluded to even in my first speech in this place. I recognise that truck drivers play a vital role in Australia's economy. In a country so large, they are essential in keeping our industries alive and putting food on our supermarket shelves. They are some of the hardest-working people I have ever met, and anyone in this place is probably ever likely to meet either.


But we also know that the unrealistic deadlines that are still placed on truck drivers squeeze them for every dollar they earn and can tragically even cost them their lives and the lives of others. The pressures that too many truck drivers are forced to perform under have made truck driving one of the most dangerous industries in our country with a workplace fatality rate of truck drivers 10 times the industrial average. I am privileged to represent around 1,500 professional drivers in my electorate of Greenway. My constituents, these truck drivers, often risk their lives each day when they go to work just so they can support themselves and their families. That is why the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal was established—to make sure that these people, just like the ones who live in my electorate, are treated with the respect they deserve.


The first order of the tribunal came into effect on 1 May. Essentially, this important order sets out minimum entitlements and requirements for certain road transport drivers, their employers or hirers, and those drivers in the supply chain. This covers drivers who transport any good or material destined for sale or hire by a supermarket chain, and long-distance drivers. This includes requirements regarding safe driving plans for long-distance drivers, work health and safety training, written contracts for drivers and payment requirements for payers. This order is essential to achieving safety and fairness in the road transport industry. For an industry that is expected to grow by 73,000 over the next five years, far exceeding workforce growth in many other parts of the economy, these safety provisions are more important now than ever. 


This issue is one very close to my heart. My late campaign director in Greenway, Blacktown resident and ex-truck driver of 45 years, Mr Brian Thomas, was a strong advocate for the safety of truck drivers. He often told me about his own experiences and the immense dangers that all truck drivers face because of the time pressures and the often impossible targets that are enforced. These dangers are the reason that the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal was established and why it should be retained by this government.


One of my friends from the 43rd Parliament, the former member for Hinkler, was a strong advocate for the safety of truckies on our roads. I am dismayed by the way in which some of the speakers in this debate fail to respect and uphold his grounded and concerned views. On repeal day, the so-called Regulatory Repeal Day, the tribunal was called 'just another bit of red tape'. I heard the previous speaker talk about road infrastructure and how that will be a key part of truck driver safety. Truck driver safety is not just about infrastructure; it is not just about roads. You can have the best road in the world, but a driver—as the member for Perth mentioned—on the deadly cocktail to help them stay awake is not safe. The best road in the world is not going to save that truck driver or people around him.


The Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal is not just another piece of red tape. Any industrial accident is one accident too many. The tribunal exists to ensure fairness for working families. It is there to ensure that women and children in my electorate have a husband and a father who leaves at the beginning of the day and returns safely at the end of it. That is not extra bureaucracy; it is a demonstration of inherent decency and responsible governance. 


On this issue, I highlight that in the Senate on 11 December Senator John Williams did call it another piece of red tape when he was talking about the draft road safety remuneration order. He said:


What I am getting to is red tape and paperwork that will not achieve anything. It will not provide safety and will be of no benefit.


I dispute that entirely. I also point to this fact, as the former Minister Albanese highlighted in March 2012 when the tribunal was established:


Road accidents involving heavy vehicles cost our economy an estimated $2.7 billion a year, but the cost to victim's families can't be measured.


If saving that amount of money is red tape, then I put it to this parliament that we should be doing everything we can not only to save that amount of money but to save lives.

"Broad, Andrew, MP",Nats,2014-05-26,"



Mr BROAD
 (Mallee) (11:07):  Can I just say how great it is to be in the chamber after a wonderful week away talking to the people across the electorate. And my electorate is an electorate that understands the trucking industry.


Unfortunately, for a very long time our rail has been let go. We have not spent or invested enough in rail as a country. But it does mean that we have been using trucks. And we do have the advantage of trucks. As a truck owner myself, and as someone who has a heavy combination licence, I do understand the trucking industry. I have used it to transport grain, wool and many products that we produce on our farm to the market. Across our electorate, we produce $5.3 billion worth of exportable commodities. That is quite a large amount of stuff.


But the thing that is driving safety is not so much the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal; it is improving roads. That is really what our focus should be. I do not have a problem per se with this attempt to move a motion in the House, except that we have conducted a review and the appropriate way to do governance is to look at things thoroughly. Information creates good policy, and when we want to grandstand on an issue, such as moving a motion like this before the results of that review have been released, you get the feeling that we are not actually allowing good information to create good policy.


Our trucking industry is important. But what is also very important is that our trucking industry is profitable. People get good wages when the business is profitable. And when you have profitable businesses they also invest significantly in newer trucks: those trucks have better braking capacity, they have airbags on their trailers and they have the capacity to be safer. My great concern with this motion is that it is attempting to hold up something, such as the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, which may be under the guise of a pay discussion rather than the guise of the safety discussion. Let us have our review, let us have our findings and let us then make a decision.


The review involves assessment of the regulatory and economic burden of the road safety remuneration system on participants in the road transport industry and the Australian economy generally. It is an examination of whether other Commonwealth, state and territory regulations and initiatives provide a more appropriate means of improving safety outcomes in the road transport industry; it is an examination of any available evidence about the impacts of the road safety remuneration system on improving road safety; it is an assessment of the operation and conduct of the tribunal and the extent to which it has achieved its aims and objectives; and it is a consultation with the relevant stakeholders as necessary.


The Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal has been running for a little bit of time, and so it is appropriate that we see the findings of that review. And seeing those findings will ultimately create a good outcome. The previous speaker mentioned the 'deadly cocktails to stay awake'. Can I tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker Broadbent, that the laws around drugs, or even having any drug in the cabin of a truck, are very strict. We are not removing 'deadly cocktails to stay awake' by paying truck drivers more as a result of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal; we are actually removing those drugs by very strong laws and very strong policing. That has been something that our truck drivers have been very involved with, and taken great ownership of.


In fact, mass management is something that our trucking industry and our small businesses have welcomed. It is the ability for a trucking business, provided that they do good record keeping and have really good maintenance, to be able to carry a little bit more on our roads. Things like that have really reaped great benefits, and they are the sorts of things we should be looking at.


As I come to my conclusion, can I say that our government is very committed to safe roads. I think everyone in this House is committed to safe roads. As a CFA member, I have spent all night holding onto a fire hose from a fire truck at fatalities. I do know how traumatic it is for the family involved. But the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal is having a review. We should let the review run its course, and then we will have the findings of the review before we have a debate about trying to say how good it is before the review has had a chance to hand down its findings.

"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports) (12:01):  I thank the House, I thank the government and I thank our representative the excellent member for Grayndler. The social media campaign to 'bring back our girls' has resonated worldwide. The question is: why? Partially it is because increasingly and commendably around the world people believe all young women are entitled to a proper education and all the benefits that come from education. But it was the grotesque insolence of Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, who said he would liberate these girls by selling them off into forced marriages, that triggered the international revulsion at these kidnappings. That happened about two or three weeks later, and that is when the international campaign took off. 


Whether we have a lack of international or Nigerian government leadership or not, people around the world, including the Islamic world—for instance a Twitter friend of mine in Turkey, a prominent compere on the popular Turkish station A9—understand that this cruelty to these young women is a threat to our common humanity, to civilisation and to all the advances in relations between the genders that we have seen since medieval times. 


Boko Haram are not, as some people have said, just extremists; they are jihadist terrorists. They hate modernity. They want us to return to 6th-century medievalism. They want to enslave women entirely and force them back into the Dark Ages, where they are owned, dressed and controlled by men. Boko Haram has come to mean 'Western education is forbidden', as the member for Berowra said, in the Hausa language. They are fighting against secular education, as the Nigerian jihadists see it. 


This al-Qaeda franchised group is amongst the world's most violent, having murdered nearly 5,000 of their fellow Nigerians in the last four years. Targeting Christian people particularly in Nigeria—the majority of the Nigerian population—is also one of their favoured tactics, which is explained, they claim, by the Koranic verse: 'Anyone who is not governed by what Allah has revealed is among the transgressors'. Other practices Boko Haram are opposed to include: voting in elections, wearing trousers or shirts, civil rights, gender equality, respect for minorities, freedom of movement and association, and freedom of religion—all of the things we must defend in what I regard as a civilisational struggle. 


Boko Haram is not only a disturbing force for evil in Nigeria but all over North Africa. We need to ask some tough questions of the Nigerian government and I am very grateful to the member for Brisbane for affording us that opportunity in a couple of days' time. 


I agree with the member for Berowra that the kidnapping of these girls is a threat to all of us. It is a symbolic challenge to all of human progress. Some people still regard the war on terror as politically incorrect. And if the forces of the United States, France, Israel and other countries kill some of the leaders of this group in their efforts to free these young women, which should be our absolute priority, that would not be something I would mourn. I regard this not as a criminal matter; this is a civilisational fight, a war against terrorism. Therefore, in the most profound way, I want to agree with the member for Canberra and the member for Brisbane when I say these young women in Nigeria represent all of us; they represent the progress of civilisation. I join the member for Canberra in saying: bring back our girls.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2014-05-26,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright—Government Whip) (12:06):  I take this opportunity to associate myself with the comments of the previous debate and congratulate the member for Brisbane for bringing this important international issue to the attention of the House. I thank the speakers who contributed to the debate. 


In my opening remarks, can I firstly say that for each of us as federal members there is an element of integrity that each of us try and uphold. Each of us has family members; each of us has those we try and protect to the best of our abilities in the course of our duties. I take this opportunity in the appropriations debate to condemn the Australian Labor Party for its attacks this week on the family of the Prime Minister. I suggest that they were repugnant. I suggest that they were uncalled for. I would suggest that as members of this House we do everything in our power to protect those people we love. In setting a benchmark, I would hope that in my political career, in whatever time is left available to me, I never fall to such a level where I find myself with such a lack of material that I am limited to attacking the family members of those who I oppose.


I was very fortunate to have a physical career playing contact sport. Whilst you are on the paddock, the intention is to play as hard as you can to achieve victory for your side. On occasion in contact sport your intent is to limit the movement of your opposition. But, nevertheless, the sporting field is a great place. You can go to the dressing shed of your opposition and share a cleansing ale in victory or loss. There are rules. So I take the opportunity to distance myself from the attack on the family of the Prime Minister and offer my sincere apologies. I hope that as ladies and gentlemen of this House we do not see a repeat performance of that.


Coming back closer to the appropriations bill, to properly and contextually discuss the budget you must start at the beginning. I will start with what we inherited—a mess that was left behind—and the challenges that we faced. We have been left with a situation where our economy is sluggish. We currently have an upward trend in our unemployment stats. The economy is transitioning from growth, led by investment in our resources projects, to economic activity driven from the services sector. This is underway at a time when the economy is growing below trend. More recently the Westpac-Melbourne Institute leading index, which indicates the likely pace of economic activity three to nine months into the future, fell for a second month in a row in February. It was down 0.72 percentage points, taking us to minus 0.09 per cent, indicating below trend economic growth. Gross GDP remains sluggish at 2.7 per cent in 2014. Since October last year, a Washington based institute has downgraded its Australian growth forecast to 2.6 per cent in 2014 and 2.7 per cent in 2015. It had previously expected growth of 2.8 per cent and 2.9 per cent in those years respectively. The downgrading of Australia's expected growth is a nail in the coffin for our increasing unemployment rate. The unemployment rate has been rising—from 4.9 per cent in 2011 to around 5.6 per cent this year. The economy needs to grow by more than three per cent a year to keep unemployment in check.


It is paramount that when we do our forecasts these assumptions are calculated on accurate growth rates. We need an economy that tracks at around three per cent for us to maintain suitable growth in our forecasts. It is irresponsible for outlook years to forecast rates in excess of those—3.9 per cent is unsustainable. It distorts assumptions and the forecast. I will come later in the speech to Labor's track record on their capacity to forecast.


We were left with a snowballing economic outlook as a result of the falling terms of trade. Commodity prices peaked in 2011. However, as they declined, the speed of the decline was even more rapid than many expected. In the September quarter of 2011, the terms of trade peaked, hitting a level of some 105 per cent above those prevailing around 2001-02. We were left with an economic perfect storm. We were left with a budget that was out of control. We were left with tough decisions to make in order to get our nation's books back on track. We were left with a fiscal situation where, quite frankly, the government of the day was spending more than they earned. They were borrowing from future generations to try to win favour and hearts in the political arena. They were shamefully spending money that was supposed to be generated by taxes that never generated anywhere near the revenue they suspected they would.


Labor failed to make the tough decisions during their six years in charge. They chose to make unaffordable promises, spending like drunken sailors and ignoring significant economic warnings. Labor delivered five record deficits. Labor had a habit of overpromising and underdelivering when it came to the budget. In the 2011-12 budget, Labor promised a deficit of $22.6 billion for the budget year and they ended up delivering a budget deficit of $43.4 billion. It was not a bad effort but they missed it by about $20 billion. In the 2012-13 budget they promised a surplus of $1.5 billion. They promised a surplus but in reality delivered an $18.8 billion deficit. Again, they missed it by about $20 billion. This opposition could not hit the side of a barn with an economic forecast. In the 2013-14 budget, which I have been prompted to speak about, Labor promised a deficit of $18 billion for the year and they came in at around $50 billion.


We are comfortable in managing the books because most of us on this side of the House come from business backgrounds whilst those on the other side come predominantly from union backgrounds. For the very few people on the other side of the House who have had businesses, I say to them that, in the majority, we are as confident managing the books as those on the other side are at manning picket lines.


Howard adopted from Labor a 17.5 per cent interest rate, 9.3 per cent inflation and 11 per cent unemployment. Successive budget deficits exceeded $10 billion per annum and government debt was at $96 billion. As a testament to our ability to run a safe set of books, Rudd adopted from Howard a 6.75 per cent interest rate, three per cent inflation, 4.4 per cent unemployment and a record surplus, around $20 billion, plus $60 billion put aside in the Future Fund. That is all gone. Labor left us looking at a budget deficit of $123 billion in four years and debt rising to $667 billion. They will try to distance themselves from their poor economic management and skill sets, but the figures will not lie, and they do not. Rising debt and a generational sacrifice means that we are going to have to make tough decisions to pay back the debt. In the words of the Grattan Institute, persistent budget deficits 'incur interest payments and limit future borrowings; they can unfairly shift costs between generations, and reduce flexibility in a crisis.' In Europe, the global financial crisis morphed into a sovereign debt crisis and demonstrated the pain that comes from persistent budget deficits. This budget seeks to correct our nation's deficits so that we do not find ourselves in a situation similar to that of our Northern Hemisphere brothers and sisters.


Labor left us with no surplus in sight. They will claim that they had the budget back on track, but I can assure you that the history books tell us that their forecasts were continually $12 billion to $20 billion out. Labor claim that there was no budget emergency. Irrespective of how you look at it, whether or not you want to claim that there is no budget emergency, we are now servicing an interest payment of $1 billion each month and climbing. A lot of what Labor claim should not be taken at face value.


They claim that this budget rips money from health. The budget papers clearly show that there is no cut to hospital funding in this budget, quite the opposite. In 2015-16 it increases by nine per cent or $1.4 billion a year. In 2016-17 it increases by another nine per cent or $1.5 billion a year. In 2017-18 over the forward estimates it increases by another six per cent or $1.1 billion a year. In this budget hospital funding increases by over $5 billion or around 40 per cent over four years. Those on the other side of the House will go into the out years and into the never-never because that is where they find solitude; that is where they find sanctuary. The real numbers presented in the budget show a 40 per cent increase over four years. The government will provide total hospital funding to the states of almost $70 billion over the four years to 2017-18. 


In typical fashion, Labor made big promises to increase hospital and schools funding out into the future, promises that could never be funded. They could never be funded because Labor's forecasts were based on growth rates well in excess of what the trends dictate. Labor claimed that they would increase hospital funding by over 10 per cent a year. That would have seen health funding skyrocket from $15 billion a year to around $40 billion a year within just a decade. The fact is that that was never sensible or affordable. It was a pipedream promised by a Labor government that never expected to have to deliver it.


Labor are claiming this budget rips money from education. The coalition is taking school funding to record highs. We are investing record recurrent funding of $64.5 billion in government and non-government schools over the next four years. This is $1.2 billion more than the previous government would have spent over the forward estimates to ensure that schools in all states and territories receive extra funding. From 2013-14 to 2017-18 total Commonwealth funding to all schools in Australia, as outlined in the 2014-15 budget papers, will have increased by 37 per cent or $4.6 billion. 


Earlier today, the Leader of the Opposition came into the House and spoke about education, commenting that it was the right of every child to have a good education. Let us look at Labor's track record on education. Yes, while we have got some new tuckshops and some new school halls, when we measure our educational outputs against those of our international partners, since that capital investment—the education revolution, which was going to transform the Australian education economy—we have gone backwards by international standards. Can I suggest that throwing more money at the problem is not the answer. It is about spending the money that we have more wisely. 


There are claims that this budget rips money from pensioners. The government promised before the election that there would be no cuts or changes to pensions during this term of government. This budget confirms this commitment. Current and future pensioners will not experience any decrease in their pension payments. I repeat: there will be no decrease in their pension payments. Pensions will continue to increase after the changes come in. The changes to payments represent forgone gains, not a reduction in dollar benefits—payments will still go up but will just be indexed differently. 


Labor are now standing in the way of nearly $40 billion of budget savings. Labor have already stood in the way of nearly $20 billion of savings over the forward estimates period, including around $5 billion of savings Labor themselves proposed before the last election. A member opposite spoke in the press about the introduction of co-payments but will dare to stand and oppose co-payments. The savings Labor proposed but are now opposing or have opposed are: $1.1 billion of research and development tax changes, $2.3 billion of higher education savings, $1.5 billion from the cancellation of the 2015-16 tax cuts linked to the carbon tax, and a $106 million childcare rebate saving resulting from extending the pause of the indexation of the childcare rebate for a further three years.


In the time remaining to me I will say that the co-payment is not a new phenomenon. There is evidence, going back to the Hawke and Keating days, where Labor actually introduced a co-payment. So whether you voted for the coalition or for Labor, I assure you that this opposition has a track record. I have no doubt that whether we were voted in or whether they were voted in, co-payments would have been introduced somewhere in the budget. Dr Leigh, a member opposite, wrote in a newspaper: 


But there's a better way of operating a health system, and the change should hardly hurt at all. As economists have shown, the ideal model involves a small co-payment—not enough to put a dent in your weekly budget, but enough to make you think twice before you call the doc. And the idea is hardly radical.

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (12:21):  This is a budget which is unravelling before our very eyes from a government which is united in its disunity as it tries to sell this atrocious budget. It is a budget which has been comprehensively rejected right across the country, and I am sure coalition members, in the week that just passed as they went back to their electorates, got the message loud and clear from their electorates just how bad this budget is for the people they represent. It is now up to them to stand up for the people they represent. Instead of giving a speech like the one we just heard, the member for Wright could actually have represented his electorate and stood up for his pensioners. Instead of claiming, falsely, that there are no cuts to the pension, he could stand up for the pensioners in his electorate, as all members opposite could. He could stand up for the schools and hospitals in his electorate which have had cuts. The Premier of Queensland knows they have had cuts, but the honourable member opposite seems incapable of realising they have suffered cuts in this budget—schools and hospitals. There have been cuts to family payments. People have been frozen out of Newstart, creating an underclass in this country. 


These are the measures which are being comprehensively rejected around the country, along with the trashing of the fundamental principles of Medicare, one of the great institutions of this nation, which Labor created and Labor will fight to defend. It is all very well for the member for Wright and other members opposite to say that $7 is not much for people in his electorate and around the country to pay to see a doctor. But the universality of Medicare, the universality of health care, is a fundamental principle which members right across the country should be defending and which members on this side of the House will defend. We will defend it in this House and in the other place and we will defend it right around the country. 


Members on the other side have a choice: they can come in here and stand up for their electorates, stand up for people's right to see a doctor, to take their children to a doctor free of charge, or they can stand up for their Prime Minister and their Treasurer. They cannot do both. They must decide. Are you for the people in your electorate or are you for your government? Because your government is launching an attack on the people in your electorates. We have seen the government, and we saw another example just then, scrambling to defend this budget, scrambling in an Orwellian attempt to deny that these fundamental changes in the budget are not broken promises—verbal gymnastics that we see from the Treasurer in particular, trying to say that this budget does not represent a fundamental breach of commitment to the Australian people. 


There are two big problems with this budget. One is that it shows that this government was elected on a web of wilful and consistent and systematic deceit, making false promises to the Australian people about the cost of living, false promises to the Australian people about the state of the budget and being able to return the budget to surplus without new taxes and without spending cuts over and above those which had been previously identified. It is a web of deceit in which the Liberal and National parties engaged up until and including the September election which has now been exposed by this budget. The other is that it is a fundamentally unfair manifesto. 


We saw the Treasurer's spin at work again on the weekend, with the leaking of Treasury analysis which apparently showed the impact on families was not that great; it was not that big. '""Nothing to see here,"" Treasury told us,' according to the spin from the Treasurer over the weekend. There is only one little problem with that: it was not Treasury analysis at all. It was not Treasury analysis at all. This is a Treasurer who said, when he came into office, 'I will never leak Treasury advice to defend my position; I will always stand up for myself.' I have to give him that; he has not done that. He has invented Treasury analysis. He has not leaked the real stuff; he has leaked false Treasury analysis, because it does not exist.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Craig Kelly
):  Order! I ask the member for McMahon to withdraw that accusation.




Mr BOWEN:
  On what basis, Mr Deputy Speaker?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  It is a reflection on a member. I would ask the member to assist the House and withdraw.




Mr BOWEN:
  I withdraw. The fact of the matter is that there is no such document in existence. There is no 'Treasury analysis'. It does not exist. The allegation that this document which has been released to the media is Treasury analysis is patently false. It does not exist. That is a statement of fact.


There is a pattern of behaviour here from this Treasurer. He sneakily releases these documents and claims they are Treasury analysis. Then, when further questions are asked, it turns out they were written in his office or the Prime Minister's office, not down at the Treasury. The Treasury should not be politicised in this way. The Treasury is a fine institution which has served the people of Australia well for 114 years. It is not the political plaything of this Treasurer, and he should not politicise its name in an attempt to justify his atrocious policies. If he wants to defend his policies, he should stand up for them, not claim that he has Treasury analysis which does not exist. If the government want to do little spreadsheets on the back of an envelope in their offices and work out little false calculations and then release them, that is up to them. But stand up for them. Admit to the Australian people what you are doing.


The fact of the matter is that there is analysis of this budget, and it is by NATSEM, a respected modelling outfit. They have actually been referred to by the Prime Minister as one of the most respected economic modelling outfits in this country. The evidence from them is stark: over 100,000 families in the lowest quintile will see $43 cut from their weekly budgets every week. If this is your idea of cost-of-living relief, next time don't bother: I say this to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker Kelly. Remember, the Prime Minister stood at the dispatch box and said they were 'riding to the rescue' of the Australian people. Well, don't turn up next time! This is what happens when those opposite ride to the rescue of the Australian people. A sole parent with an income of $55,000, with two kids, one in primary school and one in high school, will face a $20,000 hit to their budget. By just 2015, this family will face a 10 per cent annual hit to their current family income, or more than $5,700 a year. A couple on a single income of $75,000, with two kids, one not yet in school and one in primary school, will face a $2,000 decline in annual family income in 2015. By 2017-18, this family will have $7,400 less income than they would have had prior to this budget. 


They are the facts. I do not need to leak Treasury analysis which does not exist, as the Treasurer needs to do. I am happy to stand at this dispatch box and defend the analysis which has been commissioned by the opposition from a respected modeller. We will do that—and the Treasurer should have the courage to do the same, instead of leaking analysis which does not exist. Ben Phillips from NATSEM has stated:


We'd estimate around 1.2 million families that would be on average around $3,000 a year worse off by 2017-18, whereas the top income groups—so the top 20 per cent of households—would have either no impact or a very small positive impact—


a very small positive impact. That is what the independent analysis shows. That is what the documents that we are prepared to stand behind show, documents that have been released publicly and transparently. Let the Treasurer pick a hole in them. Let the Treasurer come in here and find an error, and let him argue that out with NATSEM, those respected modellers. He is not prepared to do so. What he does do is engage in Orwellian rhetoric and release to newspapers documents which are claimed to be Treasury analysis, which are clearly not.


As I said, this is a budget which has been rejected right across the country not only by people in communities, but also by premiers and state treasurers who are outraged, rightly, at their treatment by this government, the arrogant treatment of this Prime Minister and this Treasurer of the elected premiers of the states. I do not have universally positive views of all the premiers but they are people of accomplishment and they do not deserve to be treated this way, and the states they represent do not deserve to be treated in this arrogant and offhand way by this Prime Minister, who says they should be 'grown-ups'. That is an insult to the state premiers and to the states they represent.


Mike Keating, a respected former bureaucrat who has had to deal with some very difficult issues and deliver very difficult policies in his time, said:


This Government has cut the bottom rungs of the ladder of opportunity.


And of course he is right about that. This a fundamentally unfair document which the Treasurer and the Prime Minister do not even understand. They do not understand their own policy. Last week we saw the Prime Minister in a public relations triumph going out and blitzing talkback radio right across the country, getting basic facts wrong and telling university students that the cuts would not apply to them, when they clearly do. He said that because they were going to start university next year, the cuts would not apply to them. But they clearly do apply to them. We saw the Treasurer claim that the GP tax would not be paid by people with chronic illness. Wrong, just plain wrong. If the Prime Minister and the Treasurer do not understand the policies they are introducing, why should the Australian people pay for them? 


Then the Treasurer in the budget papers did not include the tables, which have traditionally been included in every single budget since 2005, on the impact of their changes on families with different incomes, showing how fair the budget is or otherwise. Peter Costello did it. Wayne Swan did it. Certainly in economic statements under  treasurers since 2005 those things have been included—and in budgets in particular. But it did not occur in this budget. When the Treasurer was asked about this he said: 'That is just not right. You cannot believe everything you read in the Sydney Morning Herald.' The Sydney Morning Herald is not the one with the credibility problem here. It is the Treasurer who has misled the Australian people here. It is the Treasurer who has produced a budget which very conveniently does not include those tables in the budget documents, because they would show just how unfair this budget is.


We just heard again from the member for Wright saying that Australians should make these contributions and these tough decisions and these payments—for example, the GP tax—to get the budget back on an even footing, to get it fiscally healthy and sound. There is only one problem with that, apart from the fact that it is fundamentally unfair and a trashing of the principle of universal health care. 



Mr Buchholz interjecting—




Mr BOWEN:
  The $7 GP tax does not even go to the budget bottom line; it goes to a new fund. Such is the budget emergency, they can trash the universality of Medicare and not even use the money to return the budget to surplus. They want to create a new fund to finance health and medical research. Who would disagree with more money for health and medical research? Nobody would. But the cures of today should not be paid for by taxing the sick of today, nor should the cures of tomorrow.



Mr Buchholz interjecting—




Mr BOWEN:
  The member for Wright and other honourable members should recognise that this GP tax is not being used to return the budget to surplus at all. These are the priorities and the value judgements of this government. 


The other thing they are doing of course is introducing an expensive and extravagant and unfair paid parental leave scheme, sending cheques of $50,000 to people, who may be millionaires, to have babies. Budgets are about priorities and this is the priority of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. They are saying to people: 'If you are under 30, we cannot afford to put you on Newstart. If you are a pensioner, we cannot afford to index your pension fairly. If you are a family, we cannot afford to let you go to the doctor for free. If you are a family on a low income or a single income, we need to take money from you. But if you are a millionaire, we can send you a cheque for $50,000 if you have a baby.' These are the priorities of this government. This is what this Prime Minister and this Treasurer are foisting on the Australian people and, I suspect, foisting on all those members opposite who do not actually support this policy but do not have the courage to stand up against this extravagant policy. It shows the warped and twisted priorities of this government. A budget is about choices and this government has made the choice to harm Australia's pensioners and, despite the protestations of the member for Wright, to take money from them. If you introduce unfair indexation, you are taking money from Australia's pensioners. You are saying to Australia's families, 'We will take money from you because we are going to charge you to go to the doctor.' You are saying to Australians, 'We are going to take money from you by forcing an underclass of those people under 30 and denying them any benefit when it comes to Newstart.' These are the priorities and values of this government: whilst sending cheques out for $50,000, taking money away from single-income families across Australia's cities and regions and rural areas. 


I know there are members opposite who know the impact of this. They know the impact of the family tax benefit changes and how bad they will be right across the country and in rural and regional areas as well, and what are they doing about it? They can do something about it. They can come and sit on this side of the chamber and vote accordingly. They can actually have the courage of their convictions if they have got them and stand up for their constituents. They can stand up against this government and this Prime Minister. They can roll them on the paid parental leave scheme. They can sit on this side and do the heavy lifting with this side of the House when it comes to defending Australians who deserve a better budget and a better government than the one they have got.


The Australian people have seen the values of this government over the last fortnight since the budget was delivered and they do not like them. They do not like the values of this government. It is not the government they were promised and it is not the government they deserve. They deserve so much better. Fundamentally, they deserve a government that is honest with them, that is upfront with them, which tells them before the election how much money they are going to take from them, instead of the false and misleading systematic campaign that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer masterminded before the election and the fundamentally unfair manifesto which is this budget, which takes from people and gives to others, which gives $50,000 cheques to some but takes away $20,000 over the next four years from others. These are values which the government is welcome to defend, but we will fight. We will fight in this place and the other place and across the community because it is an unfair budget.

"Pitt, Keith, MP",Nats,2014-05-26,"



Mr PITT
 (Hinkler) (12:36):  Last week I travelled from one end of my electorate to the other, from Bundaberg to Hervey Bay, stopping in Childers, Woodgate, Burrum Heads and Howard. I wanted to give Hinkler residents an opportunity to speak to me directly after the release of the coalition's first budget. I thought that if any electorate was going to be critical of the budget it would be mine. Hinkler has the fourth-highest unemployment rate in the country, we have more age pensioners than any other federal electorate and Bundaberg has the highest rate of disability in Queensland. And we also have amongst the highest rates of smoking and obesity.


Before the budget was released, the member for Maribyrnong, Bill Shorten, shamelessly targeted my electorate of Hinkler—just like Chicken Little scaring the vulnerable—by telling them that the coalition wanted to cut pensions. Let me assure the residents of my electorate that the sky is not falling. We promised not to change age pensions in this term of parliament and we have not. At the 2013 election we promised to get the budget under control and to grow the economy, and that is exactly what we are doing.


There is no doubt that this is a tough budget, but those difficult choices will reduce Labor's deficits by $43 billion and debt will be $275 billion lower over the decade. This is because governments, like households and businesses, must live within their means. Small business people know better than most that if you are going to borrow money to expand your operation or invest in capital, then you need a plan to pay that money back. When you start borrowing money to pay the staff and keep the lights on that is when you are in real trouble.


Likewise, it is ill-advised for households to spend money on luxuries they cannot afford. But that is exactly what the former Labor government did. Did they forget that at some point the credit card would have to be paid off? Or did they just not care? Labor had no plan to repair the budget when they were in government. Labor have no plan now. They offer no alternatives; just rhetoric and scaremongering. After six years of Labor, what did Australians get? We got the bill!


In his budget reply speech, the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said that this budget was drawn up by people who have never lived from pay cheque to pay cheque. I take great offence at remarks like that, and Labor's constant insistence that coalition members are out of touch with working families. I am a tradesperson. I did a four-year electrical apprenticeship at Fairymead Sugar Mill. I am a farmer: my wife and I own two cane farms, and my parents continue to operate a harvesting business. I am university educated: at the age of 22 I worked part time as a lifeguard to support myself through an engineering degree at the Queensland University of Technology. I have established a small business that employed up to 15 people at any one time. It delivered vocational training and consultancy services to industrial workplaces.


I have three children, and my wife works part time as a radiographer at one of the local hospitals. But the member for Maribyrnong, Bill Shorten, is private-school educated, studied arts and law at university and has since worked as a union bureaucrat and a politician. I would be interested to know how many times Mr Shorten has lived from pay cheque to pay cheque.


I can tell you there are plenty of people in my electorate of Hinkler who do live pay cheque to pay cheque every single fortnight. Some of them have been in my office this past week, deeply concerned about how the budget will affect them. But when you explain the detail, many realise just how much misinformation is being peddled by those opposite. Pensioners and children under 16 will pay no more than $70 per calendar year for medical treatment under the proposed $7 medical co-contribution. And the indexation of the fuel excise will add less than one cent per litre to the cost of petrol. The funds raised through these budget measures will go towards a medical research fund and road infrastructure.


To make matters worse, some media reports have been very one-sided or scant on detail. To promote my post-budget tour across the electorate last week, one local TV journalist asked if she and her cameraman could accompany me on a street walk. The three people I approached understood that tackling Labor's debt would require everyone to play a part, and that our current situation was unsustainable. However, the journalist overlooked all three of these supportive constituents, and instead ran grabs she later obtained from people who were unhappy with the budget. I am grateful to those Hinkler constituents who have read the detail for themselves—those who have contacted my office or approached me directly to seek answers to their questions. My door is always open.


There is no doubt this is a tough budget and it is only fair that everyone contributes to the repair task. Australians earning over $180,000 a year—who already pay significant taxes—will be required to pay a temporary budget repair levy of two per cent for three years. We have frozen politicians' pay and we will put an end to the gold pass travel entitlements.


Each year the government spends more on welfare than it does on the education of our children and the health of our people. The government is tightening the eligibility for family payments to ensure it supports those most in need of assistance because without policy changes the cost of the age pension is projected to increase by 70 per cent over the next decade, from almost $40 billion a year currently. The previous government increased the pension age to 67, and we are further increasing that age to 70 by 1 July 2035. Australians will still be able to retire at whatever age they choose, but those born after 1966 will have to be 70 before they can receive the age pension.


The government will introduce incentives of up to $10,000 to encourage businesses to employ people who are over the age of 50 who have been on unemployment benefits or the disability support pension for six months. From September 2017, pensions will be indexed to the CPI rather than wages. This way we can ensure that our pension system remains sustainable while pensions keep up with the cost of living. The family home will continue to be excluded from the social security means test.


This government recognises the contribution self-funded retirees make to the community, including saving the nation considerable pension costs. From 20 September 2014, the income thresholds for the Commonwealth seniors health card will be indexed annually to the CPI, enabling up to 27,000 additional people to qualify for the card over the next four years. Indexing the current income thresholds will mean more self-funded retirees will not lose out on entitlements because of changes in their income, giving them more freedom to actively contribute to their community.


Seniors health card holders will no longer receive the seniors supplement. However, they will continue to receive a range of concessional benefits, including lower co-payments for medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and access to the lower threshold for the extended Medicare safety net. Changes to the PBS will increase the cost of prescriptions for concessional patients by 80c to $6.90, and after 60 prescriptions it will be free for the rest of the calendar year.


But the budget contains plenty of good news too! This budget delivers on every one of my election commitments to the people of Hinkler:    $4.75 million for Old Toogoom Road and River Heads Road; $350,000 for the Hervey Bay Hockey Association to install synthetic turf; $500,000 for upgrades at the Hervey Bay and Bundaberg surf lifesaving clubs; $93,000 for Bundaberg Regional Council to install surf safety surveillance cameras at the Elliott River Mouth, Palmers Creek, Innes Park and Mon Repos; and, of course, $125,000 for the Centenary of Anzac Local Grants program across Hinkler


After repeated calls from local community groups, we have committed $245.3 million over four years to continue the National School Chaplaincy program. The coalition is delivering more than $12 billion in overall funding to the veteran community, including honouring our election commitment to deliver fair indexation for military superannuants.


Even after the carbon tax is repealed to save average households $550 per year, the associated tax breaks and energy supplements will remain in place to provide cost-of-living relief. Much to the relief of Hinkler farmers and commercial fishers, the diesel fuel rebate has been retained. The rebate will be indexed at the same rate as the fuel excise, meaning there will be no net increase in the cost of diesel for those who receive the rebate. The reintroduction of indexation on the fuel excise will cost an additional $24 per year for someone who uses 50 litres of fuel per week. As I previously mentioned, money raised from the indexation of the fuel excise will be spent on roads, bringing the government's infrastructure budget to a record $50 billion.


The coalition understands that well-planned infrastructure, delivered in a timely manner, is vital to our economy. It also facilitates service delivery to regional Australia and provides long-term employment and opportunities for training and development. That is why $13.4 billion will be spent in Queensland, including $6.7 billion on the ailing Bruce Highway. We are delivering a $1 billion National Stronger Regions Fund. Councils and community groups will be able to apply for grants for capital works projects that will regenerate communities with high unemployment. There is $300 million for the new bridges renewal program and $100 million to address mobile telephone black spots


I understand that transport infrastructure is not the only hurdle that regional businesses have to overcome. Here in Australia, regulation is high, input costs are high, labour costs are high, the Australian dollar is high and profits are low. We are working to change that. We are cutting the company tax rate by 1½ per cent to help around 800,000 businesses. Repealing the carbon tax will help business flourish because the electricity costs incurred through irrigation and refrigerant gases, for example, skyrocketed with the introduction of the tax. We are cutting red and green tape to save businesses time and money, which will lift productivity and boost economic growth.


Building on the free trade agreements we recently signed with South Korea and Japan, the government will provide $15 million to help small exporters. There is $9 million to support our recreational and commercial fishing bodies, $100 million extra for agricultural research and development and $20 million to build a stronger biosecurity and quarantine system.


Let me tell you why we are trying to make it easier, not harder, to do business in Australia. It is business that grows our economy. It is business that creates jobs. Small businesses are the backbone of regional Australia. They employ 50 per cent of all Australians working in the private sector. Jobs are sorely needed in my electorate of Hinkler. Unemployment is our single biggest issue. Unemployment is often a contributing factor in cases of marital breakdown, domestic violence, criminal activity, poor nutrition, health problems and declining school attendance. Employment gives people the ability to pay their own way and provide for their families. The people of this great nation should be able to depend on their elected representatives, but that does not mean we should be building a nation of dependants. Under the Rudd and Gillard governments, unemployment in the Hinkler electorate increased from six per cent in the September 2007 quarter to 9.6 per cent in the June 2013 quarter. That compares to an unemployment rate of 5.4 per cent for the nation or six per cent in Queensland. 


As promised, we are revitalising the Work for the Dole program to give people routine, structure, presentation skills and access to potential employers. Young people will now be required to earn, learn or work for the dole. We are fortunate to live in a country where this government provides a safety net to those who find themselves without employment. Requiring Australians to work for the dole ensures that that obligation is mutual. I recently spoke to the state member for Hervey Bay, Ted Sorensen, about the reintroduction of the Howard government's Work for the Dole program. When Ted was the local mayor, Work for the Dole participants helped construct all the walkways and bike paths along the esplanade. Ted cannot speak highly enough of the program. He says it built self-confidence and gave participants a sense of achievement. Many went on to gain long-term employment as a direct result of their involvement in Work for Dole.


Financial incentives will be provided to employers and employees to get young people into the workforce. Long-term unemployed Hinkler residents aged between 18 and 30 will receive $2,500 if they hold a job for a continuous period of 12 months and a further bonus of $4,000 when they attain 24 months of service. For the first time, those undertaking an apprenticeship will be able to apply for concessional loans of up to $20,000 in a scheme similar to HECS. Students with low socioeconomic backgrounds or from regional areas will have access to a new Commonwealth scholarship scheme. 


In the past eight months, seven federal ministers, three parliamentary secretaries and four coalition senators have visited the Hinkler electorate to hear about the issues impacting local residents and businesses. I also hosted the first Nationals party room meeting for 2014 in Bundaberg. Born and bred in the Bundaberg district, I take every opportunity to advocate on behalf of Hinkler residents. With this budget it will be no different. Constituents can rest assured that I will take their grievances to the relevant minister.


In closing, gone is the unstable Labor government that in a very short time gave us two prime ministers, two Treasurers and five Assistant Treasurers. Australians have elected a coalition government to repair the budget and build the stronger, more prosperous country that we all want. This budget starts that process. I commend the bills to the House.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (12:50):  This is a budget of broken promises. It is a bad budget for Australia and it is a bad budget for Australians. The broken promises of this budget reveal a government with a serious deficit—a values deficit. The budget's broken promises will hit low- and middle-income families and the elderly. The poorest will suffer the most, but everyone suffers. Before the election the Prime Minister said there would be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS. Every single one of those promises is broken in this budget.


Australians expect their government to run a strong economy, but that is just the start of what we expect. We expect the government to have a vision for the future of our country and a plan to get there. Australians value our egalitarian society. We want a society where hard work is rewarded but where a little bit of bad luck does not mean the end of the world; a society where no-one is left behind. This budget fails that fairness test. It hits the poorest the hardest. It makes life harder for millions of ordinary Australians struggling to balance their family budget. This budget makes it harder for people when they fill up at the petrol pump, when they go to the doctor, when they buy medicines. For that reason Labor will fight the unfair measures in this budget every step of the way.


The budget shows how starkly the differences between the two sides of politics play out. What kind of government would deliver a budget that will reduce the income of a couple who have a combined income of $95,000 and two kids by almost $5,000 a year? How do those members go back to their electorates and tell those families that this government is taking $5,000 a year from them? What kind of the government would deliver a budget that will reduce the income of a sole parent with two kids, earning $55,000 a year, by $6,000 a year? These are not our numbers; these are figures provided by NATSEM.


What has really surprised me, though, about the public anger in response to this budget is that people are not just angry about the broken promises and attacks on their own family budgets; they are angry about what is happening to other people. Parents with young kids who have lost the family tax benefit and the schoolkids bonus are not just talking to me about their family budget—they are talking to me about how unfair it is that pensioners who have worked hard all their lives are being told that their pensions will be cut. Pensioners who have never had a chance to go to university themselves are talking to me about their grandkids—and not even their own grandkids, but kids that age—who now have to choose between getting a decent university education and buying a home of their own one day. Young Australians, who are set to be slugged with these mind-boggling student debts, are talking to me about how it makes the decision to go to university much harder, but that is not all they are talking to me about. They are concerned about the $7.6 billion that this government is cutting from the aid budget, cuts made on the back of the world's poorest.




Mr Ewen Jones:
  Hear, hear!




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  'Hear, hear!' says the member for Herbert up there. These young people are concerned, too, about the cuts to the climate change programs that would mean Australia was contributing to reducing the likelihood of global warming passing that critical two degree benchmark that scientists tell us is so important. So, despite what the Treasurer says, the angry reaction to this budget is not because Australians are selfish: it is the exact opposite. Of course they are concerned for their own family budgets, but they are concerned for all of the people who are hit hardest by this budget as well. They do not want to see Australia become a two-tier system—a user-pays, American-style, 'you're fine if you're wealthy but God help you if you're not' style system. We will have a system that condemns kids who are born poor to grow up poor and to be sent to school in second-rate schools. We will have a health system that is world-class if you are wealthy and unattainable if you are not. Australians do not want a society of haves and have-nots. They value our way of life and that is why, while they want a strong economy, they want a fair society too. This budget fails on both counts.


I have had so many individual constituents stop me in the street to talk to me about the issues that will affect them. There are hundreds of little changes, as they come out over coming days and weeks, that will really impact them. A woman with cerebral palsy, who has managed to get back into the workforce with the help of the disability support pension, is terrified about what the changes mean for her in the future. A 23-year-old who has been saving up for his first home, using a first home saver account, says he feels cheated that the scheme has been cut. What is really scary about this is that it is not clear whether the members opposite really know what this budget is doing. You would think the Prime Minister would know, but we have had the Prime Minister say on Melbourne radio recently that an average person would only have to pay the $7 GP co-payment the first 10 times they went to the doctor: uh-uh! There is a safety net for people who are concession card holders and children but there is no safety net for ordinary working people, so mum's and dad's family budget will be under pressure. You know who will not be going to the doctor. You would think the Minister for Education would know: uh-uh! He said that the new arrangements for HECS debts and deregulated fees apply only for new students enrolling from 1 January 2016, but it seems the budget papers say the changes apply to all students enrolling from 14 May 2014 who will be studying in 2016, and to all people with a current HECS or HELP debt. It is not very reassuring, is it? The cuts are so deep and so brutal but the people who are supposed to be coming up with them and implementing them do not actually understand them.


As well as the values deficit, the economic arguments of this budget just do not stack up. The coalition's hysteria is built on a confected budget emergency. They hope that if they say often enough that the end is nigh, people will come to believe it. The most astonishing thing, given this hysteria around the confected budget emergency, is that they have actually managed to deliver bigger deficits. They have done a deal with the Greens for 'debt unlimited'. The deficits in the first three years, from 2014-15, are actually larger than the ones that were predicted in the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook statement—which was prepared not by us but by Treasury and Finance, before the election. It is worth reminding people that this Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook is a Peter Costello, Charter of Budget Honesty innovation and sets the benchmark for each party's election commitments going into the election. Why has that happened? Because they have added $68 billion to the deficit in just a few months by giving almost $9 billion—unasked for and unneeded—to the Reserve Bank by changing a number of economic parameters and by spending.


If there is a budget emergency, what should we do? Should we find $22 billion for a gold-plated paid parental leave scheme? It just shows how wrong the priorities of this budget are. Pensioners who are surviving on around $22,000 a year get a cut so that people who are earning $200,000, $300,000, $400,000 or $1 million a year can get $50,000 to have a baby. They cut superannuation support for low- and middle-income workers so that they could leave in place measures that allow the highest income workers to benefit most from super tax concessions. They will bring back petrol taxes that will hit everyone who drives but will hit those living in outer suburbs and in regional areas the worst. They are going to hit them with petrol taxes and then float the notion of a higher or broader GST at the same time as knocking back corporate tax avoidance and profit-shifting prevention measures that would have raised $1.1 billion. How on earth can anyone justify these priorities?


Then there is the abolition of the carbon tax and the minerals resource rent tax in favour of taxes that hit the family budget. There is the $80 billion cut from education and health. I always knew that many on those benches opposite were big supporters of outsourcing; well, they have really done well in this instance. They have outsourced $80 billion of hospital and education cuts to the states. They are not prepared to do it themselves. They have just snatched that money from the states. It is extraordinary to just say that the states can deal with it—'This thing that has always been a shared responsibility is no longer a shared responsibility. We are just going to shove it onto the states and they can deal with the longer waiting lists for elective surgery, they can deal with the longer waiting times in emergency departments and they can deal with the cuts to our schools.'


We met the budget rule of keeping real average spending growth to less than two per cent a year—the lowest four-year result in 23 years. We saved 200,000 jobs during the global financial crisis. We prevented Australia from falling into recession and we did it in a way that saw Australia coming back to surplus over the economic cycle because we agree that it is important that over time we do that. We delivered $180 billion in savings while we were in government. In fact, as health minister I delivered billions of dollars in savings but I did it by means testing the private health insurance rebate—opposed by those opposite—and by finding savings in the cost of generic medicines, by paying less for medicines as they came off patents. There were billions of dollars of savings that were opposed by those opposite.


The government's cuts to the health budget make no sense. Why would you cut prevention programs if you want to keep people out of hospital, where it is expensive to look after them? Why cut prevention when the greatest health challenges—smoking, obesity and excessive alcohol consumption—cost us so much as a community? How does it make sense to cut health costs by reducing access to the cheapest part of the health system, general practice, knowing that the outcome will be sicker people and more strain on the hospital system? These are health cuts designed by someone who does not care about patients, just about short-term cuts. They will cost us all in the long run. You can cut costs in the health system by keeping people healthy and out of hospital or you can cut costs by rationing the access that sick people have to medical treatment. Guess which this government has chosen?


I spoke earlier today about the massive cuts to foreign aid and what they will mean to the world's poorest people. I think it is so important to say that again as that is a stark example of just how different our values are. John Howard knew that Australia should be a nation of lifters not leaners when it came to international development assistance. John Howard knew that, but Tony Abbott does not. It is worth saying also that, if you are talking about our role in the world community, nations everywhere are looking at us now and asking: 'Why are you cutting an effective and cost-effective program to reduce air pollution, carbon pollution? Why are you cutting, for example, billions of dollars from environmental programs while finding $2.6 billion to pay big polluters to keep polluting? Why are you cutting from grassroots environmental programs, CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology and renewable energy initiatives?' Then there is the broken promise on Landcare funding, ripping $483 million out of Landcare and conservation programs; the $2.8 million cut from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority; the scrapping of climate change research across government agencies; and the abolition of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which actually makes money for the government. The world community is asking, 'Why are you doing these things at a time when everybody else is moving in the other direction, moving to tackle climate change?'


There is another broken promise on Landcare and another broken promise on the ABC and SBS. There are cuts of $43.5 billion over four years to the ABC and SBS and a cut of almost $200 million to the Australia Network. This is a budget of broken promises. It is a budget of wrong priorities. It is a budget that hurts the poorest the most. It is a budget that shows very clearly the values deficit of this government.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (13:04):  I have just listened to the shadow Treasurer and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for 30 minutes on these appropriation bills and there was not one solution proffered. There was 30 minutes of whingeing, moaning and carrying on. There was not one solution offered, so go back to the glory days. 


First and foremost I would like to pass on my personal best wishes and congratulations to the Treasurer, Joe B Hockey, and the leadership group of the coalition government for the job that they have done here. This budget lays the foundations for our nation to be more productive, more affluent and more inclusive. In September last year, just after Mr Hockey was made Treasurer, he gave a speech that has always stuck with me. He said we have to do three things: first, we have to tell the people what the problem is; second, we have to tell the people what we are going to do about it; and, third and most importantly, we have to take the people with us when we are working. 


So what was the problem? I have got only 15 minutes to go through the problems that we encountered over the last six years, but I will go as quickly as possible. Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister, has always said there is nothing new in politics, so it will not surprise anyone that in 1996 the then Howard coalition government faced a $96 billion gross debt problem and a $10 billion black hole. In 1996, because the previous Labor government reformed the way we did business in Australia and the way we acted as a government—and that was accepted in a bipartisan way—we had rising terms of trade. But the Howard government was still a government that made tough decisions.


Australia faced the Asian financial crisis in those days. This was very local and we were very exposed. It was a very worrying time in the auction industry, in which I was employed, and in the finance industry. Yet the Howard government went into deficit for one year only. We acted, supported and then corrected. Fast forward to the economic conservatism of the Rudd-Gillard era, when the GFC hit they acted and supported but they did not correct. When Andrew Robb, the member for Goldstein, was the shadow finance spokesperson he gave a speech in here in which he said that what happens in the GFC is sort of like when you are doing your house. You pay your mortgage and you have a set number of expenses then one year you decide you are going to do a renovation. So for that year your expenses, your outgoings, go up. But the next year, because you are no longer doing the renovations, your expenses come down to roughly what they were. What the Labor government did under Rudd and Gillard was raise expenses and that was the new floor. That was the problem we encountered. That was the new starting point so that was the problem.


When people come to me and say, 'I don't know what to believe', and 'Everyone can do projections', and 'Anyone can point the finger'—we have just seen how wonderful the Labor Party was in the last two speeches made by those members opposite, and yet we won 90 seats in the last election. I say to them: whether you believe our projections about gross debt going up to $667 billion is completely up to you. What no-one can deny is that over the past six years we had budget deficits totalling $191.5 billion, with the major expenses still to come on health, education, NBN and NDIS and no plan to pay for them. No-one can dispute those figures. So even if you accept those base figures, we are still left with a massive task quite similar to what was faced by the Howard government in 1996.


We are borrowing $1 billion per month to pay the interest on the debt at the moment. What do we do about it? This budget brings our gross figure down from the projected $667 billion by nearly $300 billion to $389 billion. This budget addresses the issues of the ageing population. Even the opposition leader in his speech, when he referred to taxpayers and pensioners, said that when he was at school there were 7.5 taxpayers per pensioner and today there are five taxpayers per pensioner. By 2050 there will be 2.5 taxpayers per person over the ages of 65 and 70. That is not a shrinking workforce; that is a growing ageing population with challenges that have to be faced.


This budget attempts to make the support the taxpayer extends to the community more sustainable, whether it be the pension, Medicare, health in general, education, defence: the lot has to be paid for by the taxpayers and the taxpayers' dollars. The Howard government did it before and was able to hand the benefits back to those who did the heavy lifting. Family tax benefit part B was initially installed by the Howard government because from 1996 through to 2001 the families of Australia did the heavy lifting. They paid off Labor's debt, and the then Prime Minister said, 'You deserve to be helped'. We are borrowing money to support a lifestyle. We cannot continue to do that. No-one likes losing a benefit, but when people sit down and actually start to think about it they understand why we are doing it.


What we said we would do in the last election—every day for three years the now Prime Minister said at every opportunity and every press conference that we would axe the carbon tax, we would stop the boats, we would build the roads of the 21st century and we would fix the budget. The boats: well and truly over 150 days since a successful arrival. Check; we have done it, and saved $2.5 billion by closing down detention centres inside Australia. As a first order of business in this place, we axed the carbon tax in this House of Representatives; it is sitting over there. Those opposite will sit there and tell you they are concerned about people's cost of living, and yet the average family is saving $550 per year, going up again on 1 July because the carbon tax will be extended again on 1 July this year. It is still sitting over there; it can be passed today if members opposite choose to do so. The carbon tax repeal has been passed by us in this place, so that is a check.


Roads: we have $50 billion worth of infrastructure projects—$25 billion worth of roads—approved under this government. There is $220 million alone on road projects in Townsville. The member for Grayndler will probably come in here and tell us that he actually turned the first sod on all of those, that was all done, all paid for previously. So we get down to fixing the budget. We went to the last election saying that we would extend a levy to the biggest companies to pay for a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme. We went to the last election saying we would raise a levy and support a raised levy to support the NDIS, so this notion about no new taxes—what do members opposite actually think we are going to do, win lotto? That we are going to take a system 25 each week and that is how we are going to get the budget back into order?


We need to take the people with us. I have concerns in relation to the way Australia is going, and I share the concerns of some people in this House. There are conversations we have to have in relation to where this country is going. The NDIS is an idea whose time has come, but we must make it affordable. We cannot afford to live in a country where someone is walking down the street and a man is mowing his lawn in an NDIS T-shirt and no-one knows what it stands for. I worry that we have parents still talking about the people that they love the most, their children with a disability, and that they still have to describe them in the worst possible way to get the help they need. I truly believe that Senator Fifield is the right man for the job and I truly believe that this place is bipartisan in its approach. But I cannot help but think that we are still going to be heading down that same track, where parents are still going to be dreadfully exposed in the way they are going to have to explain themselves to get the help they need. I will know that that is fixed when parents can come to me and tell me that they are happy with the way it is going.


I also share the concern about the timing of deregulation fees for the university sector. I have no problems with deregulation itself. I think that is a very healthy thing and I think the way we are going about it—extending it to TAFE students and to subdegree things and trade support loans to another 80,000 people—is a great idea. But you have third parties coming into the system now and they must be watched. We must make sure that we control not only the organisations but also the organisations that participate in that sector. We must have a very strong and effective authority. We cannot afford to see what happened in the VET sector—we saw an explosion of RTOs to more than 4,600 but more than 90 per cent of the results are still produced by less than 100 organisations—happen in our higher education sector. Again, I believe that Minister Pyne is the right person at the right time to take this debate forward. I believe that he is truly consultative with Universities Australia and with the education sector in general.


I want to see the white papers on taxation and the Federation happen as quickly as possible, and I want the discussions to be as open and frank and free as possible. We have a chance in this place to fundamentally change our country for a long time. We are a vastly different place to what we were in 1901. I see kids up  there behind the glass and they are watching us here. When you are older, I want to make sure that you are living in an Australia which is inclusive, I want to make sure that you are living in an Australia which is affordable, and I want to make sure that you are living in an Australia where you are not paying for the mistakes of my generation—where you are not paying for the profligacy of previous governments, because you kids deserve better.


So I want to make sure we have those open and frank conversations and I want to make sure that we do the right thing by people. I want to see the red tape reduction practices undertaken by this government to be the catalyst for freeing up business and industry and not an exercise in cost-shifting to other forms of government. The Townsville City Council in my electorate of Herbert—which I sometimes have a fractious relationship with—have seen many areas of regulation cut from other levels of government and simply had the cost of compliance and the cost of regulation lumped onto them with no benefit. This red tape reduction must be driven through COAG so we do not see one level of government reducing costs and another level rising. We must make sure this is a coordinated approach.


I want to see work done to the tender process for all government projects to make sure they support local government, local contractors and local communities. When Senator Arthur Sinodinos was in Charters Towers with me recently we heard a story about a local council out west of Charters Towers. The Flinders Shire Council had costed out a road at $9 million. It had to go to national tender. The cost came in at $27 million. The contractor who won it flew in their team, their workers, the camp—everything. They did the work and not one cent stayed in the local community. We cannot have a tender process where we are doing major jobs in places like Townsville where the only beneficiaries are McDonald's and the pie van. We want to make sure that our local contractors, our local people, are being looked after. We want to make sure that the money is going through the community.


I want to see an aviation hub in Townsville. I want to see the C27J turboprop replaced with the Caribou based at RAAF Base Garbutt. It makes sense. I want to see the cost of production spread away from Defence and into the private sector.


We talk a lot about Northern Australia and the white paper is to be handed down. I copped a bit of flak in Townsville because there weren't any projects in the white paper. We must get the foundations right and that means getting a baseline science right. That means backing CSIRO and backing James Cook University to make sure that we are looking at our freshwater options. Once we get the macro right, once we get the picture right, we can then develop. What I will not cop is being held accountable for some dodgy deal done between the member for Lilley and some Independent over a project that was absolutely stone motherless dead in 2011 and was still being kept in the federal budget for two years so they could throw a sling at the member for Herbert.


I want to see us have a better relationship and continue to grow our relationship with Papua New Guinea. PNG's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill spoke in Cairns just last week and he said: 'Suddenly we are back on the map with Australia. It is great to see. Funnily enough, Papua New Guinea was visited by no less than three different prime ministers inside 12 months.' He said, 'I don't think we'll ever see that time again.' He understands the need for trade and he understands the need to grow it organically. I think we can learn a lot from Papua New Guinea. They are in the 14th year of economic growth. Their economy is expected to grow at 15 per cent. There is some serious business being done up there. We must be more proactive in getting them to participate in the development of northern Australia. Townsville is the perfect place for it.


I do want to refer to the credibility argument that has been thrown down by those opposite. Last year in the budget reply speech, Tony Abbott, the then opposition leader, stared down the barrel of the camera and told people that we were axing the things from the mining tax—that there were things that would have to go because they were not affordable; that we would not be able to keep on spending the way we had. He told the people of Australia that we had to make some tough decisions, and we have. You have the opposition Treasurer now saying approximately 392 times that it was an unfair budget but he says nothing about what he is going to do!


Can I tell you finally, Deputy Speaker Mitchell, when I walk down the street there are a lot of people concerned about the budget but not one person has said to me, 'You know, I want to go back to the glory days of the Rudd-Gillard government.' No-one is saying that ever. I thank the House.

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Ms KING
 (Ballarat) (13:14):  I too rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015 and cognate bills representing the Abbott government's federal budget. This is indeed a budget of broken promises and, in my area of health, one that launches a fundamental attack on the fabric of Medicare. The Prime Minister promised before the election that there would be no cuts to health. He didn't just say it once; he said it many, many times. He promised before the election that there would be no new taxes. At no time during the election campaign did the Prime Minister telling the Australian people that they would be paying more to see a doctor, more for their medicines, more to access a specialist and that he would gut funding for public hospitals, for prevention and for dental care. But that is exactly what the Abbott government has done in this budget. This is what this budget delivers to the Australian people: cuts to public hospitals, cuts to prevention programs, cuts to dental care, a GP tax and more expensive medicines. When the population is ageing and the rate of chronic illness is increasing, it is inconceivable that the government would want to make the changes that it does, particularly those putting a barrier in the way of people accessing general practitioners. Medicare has served Australia well for the past 30 years, but this government appears to want to erode its very fabric—universal access.


When Bob Hawke as Prime Minister introduced Medicare all those decades ago, he warned that without it more than two million Australians faced potential financial ruin in the event of a major illness. Today that is not the case, because every Australian can rely on our universal health system, a universal insurance scheme that everybody contributes to according to their means, and that means that people can access health care on the basis of their need and not on the basis of their means to pay for it. If this Prime Minister gets his way he will be taking Australia back decades and putting millions of Australians in the same perilous position as pre-Medicare.


I want to take each of the cuts within this appropriation bill in turn, starting with public hospitals. The first thing we saw was the ripping up of Labor's historic agreements that were reached with the states and territories in health, agreements which had largely ended the blame game when it came to the Commonwealth and states, and which had started to wind back the erosion of the Commonwealth's contribution to public hospital funding that had occurred under the Liberals. In fact, the Abbott government's own election policy document, a document that was very scant on detail in any case, did promise that a coalition government would support the transition to the Commonwealth providing 50 per cent of growth funding of the efficient price of the hospital services as proposed. This was part of the coalition's election documentation.


What did we see after the election? Well, you will not find that promise on the coalition's website anymore. Amazingly, it has suddenly disappeared. So embarrassed is the coalition by this broken promise in health that it has taken its election policy off its website. And so ashamed is it of how badly it has broken this pre-election promise that, instead of providing the growth funding that was promised to the Australian public and promised to the states to run the public hospitals, this budget of broken promises cuts a whopping $50 billion from Australia's public hospitals. And it is no wonder that the Prime Minister is too embarrassed to meet with his state counterparts after this promise was so comprehensively broken. These are cuts that commence in just 35 days' time, on 1 July this year.


Only last fortnight, the Treasurer told Australians: the fact is we are honouring the four years of the agreements in both hospitals and schools that we said we would honour; we are doing that. That is simply untrue. The Treasurer does not even know what is in his own budget. The cuts to hospitals start this financial year, and we know that that will put services at jeopardy. States are already talking about hospital bed closures. We know that there will be changes in emergency department waiting times, that there will be changes and blow-outs in elective surgery times, that there are hospital beds that will close and that nurses and doctors will not be employed or will be employed less. At every point in the system we see that this government plans to cut funding and to break its promises.


In preventative health, the government is to rip up the $367 million agreement on preventive health funding. States and territories that entered into contracts for programs that are to start shortly are suddenly now finding themselves with a shortfall. This is coming at the same time as many states across the country have started to withdraw funding for preventive health programs as well, saying that they believe it is the role of the Commonwealth to engage in prevention. We have now seen with this budget that the Commonwealth is largely abdicating the field when it comes to health prevention. The National Partnership Agreement on Preventative Health is gone. Preventative health funding for programs to tackle obesity, alcohol abuse and smoking have been cut. We know the government does not care about preventive health because it is also planning to cut some $2.9 million from the national tobacco campaign. It is also axing, in a separate bill, the Australian National Preventive Health Agency, the agency charged with making sure preventive health is a priority. It works with states and territories to ensure that we do not duplicate effort, that we have a combined partnership agreement in order to get the maximum benefit for our preventative health dollar and that as a country we are actually tackling conditions that are preventable like diabetes and heart disease. The government does not seem to believe in these things. It is ripping down the preventative health website and the health star rating system and shutting down organisations like the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council. And I suspect there is a whole lot more to come in health space. These are short-sighted policy decisions that will take Australia's health system back decades.


And of course then there are the government's plans to introduce the GP tax. The government wants to basically put a significant barrier, a pay wall, in the way of people accessing their GPs. So flawed is this policy, the Treasurer and Prime Minister do not actually understand how it works. Last week, during interviews, the Prime Minister and Treasurer both said to the Australian public that if you have chronic disease you will not pay this tax; it will not apply to you. It was a plainly wrong and incorrect statement. No-one is exempt from the government's GP tax. The facts the Treasurer relied upon to introduce this tax are also wrong. A fortnight ago, the Treasurer was out there again on ABC's Q&A saying that, on average, Australians visit the doctor 11 times a year. This is simply not true. In fact, Australia is bang-on the OECD average and the correct number is fewer than seven times.


This is a tax based on a broken promise that no health policy expert has said is a good idea. The Australian Medical Association has said this is a very bad idea and is very bad policy. They Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association, the Royal Australian College of Emergency Physicians, the Royal Australian College of GPs—not necessarily known for radical campaigning—have actually started a #CoPayNoWay campaign, a significant campaign that is seeing hundreds of emails arrive in my inbox each day absolutely opposed to this government trying to put a barrier in the way of people accessing a doctor.


The Consumer Health Forum, a not-for-profit organisation that is charged with representing consumers and advocating for consumers, has very clearly said this policy will impact very significantly on those with chronic conditions, those who are on low and middle incomes and on some of the most vulnerable Australians in the country. I went and visited an Aboriginal medical service just recently. The staff there told me that they cannot possibly charge this tax and that will mean that, for their service delivery, they will have to find an extra $350,000 each year just to continue to employ doctors to meet the demand they have within their service. It is a cost they will have to absorb within their own system. They are very concerned about what that will mean for services right the way across their community.


All of these bodies have advised this government against this policy yet the government have determined that they will proceed with it. Not only will they proceed with the GP tax but they are also intending to tell states and territories that they should also impose a tax when people go to emergency departments. We have seen only one state to date, Western Australia, say that they would entertain such a thing.


These are changes that the former vice president of the Australian Medical Association has said will take Australia's health system back more than 50 years. I think he knows something about it. He absolutely knows something about the health system which unfortunately this government appears not to. Not only will health care be less affordable and less accessible, the government is also ripping $270 million—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. The honourable member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2014-05-26,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright—Government Whip) (12:06):  I take this opportunity to associate myself with the comments of the previous debate and congratulate the member for Brisbane for bringing this important international issue to the attention of the House. I thank the speakers who contributed to the debate. 


In my opening remarks, can I firstly say that for each of us as federal members there is an element of integrity that each of us try and uphold. Each of us has family members; each of us has those we try and protect to the best of our abilities in the course of our duties. I take this opportunity in the appropriations debate to condemn the Australian Labor Party for its attacks this week on the family of the Prime Minister. I suggest that they were repugnant. I suggest that they were uncalled for. I would suggest that as members of this House we do everything in our power to protect those people we love. In setting a benchmark, I would hope that in my political career, in whatever time is left available to me, I never fall to such a level where I find myself with such a lack of material that I am limited to attacking the family members of those who I oppose.


I was very fortunate to have a physical career playing contact sport. Whilst you are on the paddock, the intention is to play as hard as you can to achieve victory for your side. On occasion in contact sport your intent is to limit the movement of your opposition. But, nevertheless, the sporting field is a great place. You can go to the dressing shed of your opposition and share a cleansing ale in victory or loss. There are rules. So I take the opportunity to distance myself from the attack on the family of the Prime Minister and offer my sincere apologies. I hope that as ladies and gentlemen of this House we do not see a repeat performance of that.


Coming back closer to the appropriations bill, to properly and contextually discuss the budget you must start at the beginning. I will start with what we inherited—a mess that was left behind—and the challenges that we faced. We have been left with a situation where our economy is sluggish. We currently have an upward trend in our unemployment stats. The economy is transitioning from growth, led by investment in our resources projects, to economic activity driven from the services sector. This is underway at a time when the economy is growing below trend. More recently the Westpac-Melbourne Institute leading index, which indicates the likely pace of economic activity three to nine months into the future, fell for a second month in a row in February. It was down 0.72 percentage points, taking us to minus 0.09 per cent, indicating below trend economic growth. Gross GDP remains sluggish at 2.7 per cent in 2014. Since October last year, a Washington based institute has downgraded its Australian growth forecast to 2.6 per cent in 2014 and 2.7 per cent in 2015. It had previously expected growth of 2.8 per cent and 2.9 per cent in those years respectively. The downgrading of Australia's expected growth is a nail in the coffin for our increasing unemployment rate. The unemployment rate has been rising—from 4.9 per cent in 2011 to around 5.6 per cent this year. The economy needs to grow by more than three per cent a year to keep unemployment in check.


It is paramount that when we do our forecasts these assumptions are calculated on accurate growth rates. We need an economy that tracks at around three per cent for us to maintain suitable growth in our forecasts. It is irresponsible for outlook years to forecast rates in excess of those—3.9 per cent is unsustainable. It distorts assumptions and the forecast. I will come later in the speech to Labor's track record on their capacity to forecast.


We were left with a snowballing economic outlook as a result of the falling terms of trade. Commodity prices peaked in 2011. However, as they declined, the speed of the decline was even more rapid than many expected. In the September quarter of 2011, the terms of trade peaked, hitting a level of some 105 per cent above those prevailing around 2001-02. We were left with an economic perfect storm. We were left with a budget that was out of control. We were left with tough decisions to make in order to get our nation's books back on track. We were left with a fiscal situation where, quite frankly, the government of the day was spending more than they earned. They were borrowing from future generations to try to win favour and hearts in the political arena. They were shamefully spending money that was supposed to be generated by taxes that never generated anywhere near the revenue they suspected they would.


Labor failed to make the tough decisions during their six years in charge. They chose to make unaffordable promises, spending like drunken sailors and ignoring significant economic warnings. Labor delivered five record deficits. Labor had a habit of overpromising and underdelivering when it came to the budget. In the 2011-12 budget, Labor promised a deficit of $22.6 billion for the budget year and they ended up delivering a budget deficit of $43.4 billion. It was not a bad effort but they missed it by about $20 billion. In the 2012-13 budget they promised a surplus of $1.5 billion. They promised a surplus but in reality delivered an $18.8 billion deficit. Again, they missed it by about $20 billion. This opposition could not hit the side of a barn with an economic forecast. In the 2013-14 budget, which I have been prompted to speak about, Labor promised a deficit of $18 billion for the year and they came in at around $50 billion.


We are comfortable in managing the books because most of us on this side of the House come from business backgrounds whilst those on the other side come predominantly from union backgrounds. For the very few people on the other side of the House who have had businesses, I say to them that, in the majority, we are as confident managing the books as those on the other side are at manning picket lines.


Howard adopted from Labor a 17.5 per cent interest rate, 9.3 per cent inflation and 11 per cent unemployment. Successive budget deficits exceeded $10 billion per annum and government debt was at $96 billion. As a testament to our ability to run a safe set of books, Rudd adopted from Howard a 6.75 per cent interest rate, three per cent inflation, 4.4 per cent unemployment and a record surplus, around $20 billion, plus $60 billion put aside in the Future Fund. That is all gone. Labor left us looking at a budget deficit of $123 billion in four years and debt rising to $667 billion. They will try to distance themselves from their poor economic management and skill sets, but the figures will not lie, and they do not. Rising debt and a generational sacrifice means that we are going to have to make tough decisions to pay back the debt. In the words of the Grattan Institute, persistent budget deficits 'incur interest payments and limit future borrowings; they can unfairly shift costs between generations, and reduce flexibility in a crisis.' In Europe, the global financial crisis morphed into a sovereign debt crisis and demonstrated the pain that comes from persistent budget deficits. This budget seeks to correct our nation's deficits so that we do not find ourselves in a situation similar to that of our Northern Hemisphere brothers and sisters.


Labor left us with no surplus in sight. They will claim that they had the budget back on track, but I can assure you that the history books tell us that their forecasts were continually $12 billion to $20 billion out. Labor claim that there was no budget emergency. Irrespective of how you look at it, whether or not you want to claim that there is no budget emergency, we are now servicing an interest payment of $1 billion each month and climbing. A lot of what Labor claim should not be taken at face value.


They claim that this budget rips money from health. The budget papers clearly show that there is no cut to hospital funding in this budget, quite the opposite. In 2015-16 it increases by nine per cent or $1.4 billion a year. In 2016-17 it increases by another nine per cent or $1.5 billion a year. In 2017-18 over the forward estimates it increases by another six per cent or $1.1 billion a year. In this budget hospital funding increases by over $5 billion or around 40 per cent over four years. Those on the other side of the House will go into the out years and into the never-never because that is where they find solitude; that is where they find sanctuary. The real numbers presented in the budget show a 40 per cent increase over four years. The government will provide total hospital funding to the states of almost $70 billion over the four years to 2017-18. 


In typical fashion, Labor made big promises to increase hospital and schools funding out into the future, promises that could never be funded. They could never be funded because Labor's forecasts were based on growth rates well in excess of what the trends dictate. Labor claimed that they would increase hospital funding by over 10 per cent a year. That would have seen health funding skyrocket from $15 billion a year to around $40 billion a year within just a decade. The fact is that that was never sensible or affordable. It was a pipedream promised by a Labor government that never expected to have to deliver it.


Labor are claiming this budget rips money from education. The coalition is taking school funding to record highs. We are investing record recurrent funding of $64.5 billion in government and non-government schools over the next four years. This is $1.2 billion more than the previous government would have spent over the forward estimates to ensure that schools in all states and territories receive extra funding. From 2013-14 to 2017-18 total Commonwealth funding to all schools in Australia, as outlined in the 2014-15 budget papers, will have increased by 37 per cent or $4.6 billion. 


Earlier today, the Leader of the Opposition came into the House and spoke about education, commenting that it was the right of every child to have a good education. Let us look at Labor's track record on education. Yes, while we have got some new tuckshops and some new school halls, when we measure our educational outputs against those of our international partners, since that capital investment—the education revolution, which was going to transform the Australian education economy—we have gone backwards by international standards. Can I suggest that throwing more money at the problem is not the answer. It is about spending the money that we have more wisely. 


There are claims that this budget rips money from pensioners. The government promised before the election that there would be no cuts or changes to pensions during this term of government. This budget confirms this commitment. Current and future pensioners will not experience any decrease in their pension payments. I repeat: there will be no decrease in their pension payments. Pensions will continue to increase after the changes come in. The changes to payments represent forgone gains, not a reduction in dollar benefits—payments will still go up but will just be indexed differently. 


Labor are now standing in the way of nearly $40 billion of budget savings. Labor have already stood in the way of nearly $20 billion of savings over the forward estimates period, including around $5 billion of savings Labor themselves proposed before the last election. A member opposite spoke in the press about the introduction of co-payments but will dare to stand and oppose co-payments. The savings Labor proposed but are now opposing or have opposed are: $1.1 billion of research and development tax changes, $2.3 billion of higher education savings, $1.5 billion from the cancellation of the 2015-16 tax cuts linked to the carbon tax, and a $106 million childcare rebate saving resulting from extending the pause of the indexation of the childcare rebate for a further three years.


In the time remaining to me I will say that the co-payment is not a new phenomenon. There is evidence, going back to the Hawke and Keating days, where Labor actually introduced a co-payment. So whether you voted for the coalition or for Labor, I assure you that this opposition has a track record. I have no doubt that whether we were voted in or whether they were voted in, co-payments would have been introduced somewhere in the budget. Dr Leigh, a member opposite, wrote in a newspaper: 


But there's a better way of operating a health system, and the change should hardly hurt at all. As economists have shown, the ideal model involves a small co-payment—not enough to put a dent in your weekly budget, but enough to make you think twice before you call the doc. And the idea is hardly radical.

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (12:21):  This is a budget which is unravelling before our very eyes from a government which is united in its disunity as it tries to sell this atrocious budget. It is a budget which has been comprehensively rejected right across the country, and I am sure coalition members, in the week that just passed as they went back to their electorates, got the message loud and clear from their electorates just how bad this budget is for the people they represent. It is now up to them to stand up for the people they represent. Instead of giving a speech like the one we just heard, the member for Wright could actually have represented his electorate and stood up for his pensioners. Instead of claiming, falsely, that there are no cuts to the pension, he could stand up for the pensioners in his electorate, as all members opposite could. He could stand up for the schools and hospitals in his electorate which have had cuts. The Premier of Queensland knows they have had cuts, but the honourable member opposite seems incapable of realising they have suffered cuts in this budget—schools and hospitals. There have been cuts to family payments. People have been frozen out of Newstart, creating an underclass in this country. 


These are the measures which are being comprehensively rejected around the country, along with the trashing of the fundamental principles of Medicare, one of the great institutions of this nation, which Labor created and Labor will fight to defend. It is all very well for the member for Wright and other members opposite to say that $7 is not much for people in his electorate and around the country to pay to see a doctor. But the universality of Medicare, the universality of health care, is a fundamental principle which members right across the country should be defending and which members on this side of the House will defend. We will defend it in this House and in the other place and we will defend it right around the country. 


Members on the other side have a choice: they can come in here and stand up for their electorates, stand up for people's right to see a doctor, to take their children to a doctor free of charge, or they can stand up for their Prime Minister and their Treasurer. They cannot do both. They must decide. Are you for the people in your electorate or are you for your government? Because your government is launching an attack on the people in your electorates. We have seen the government, and we saw another example just then, scrambling to defend this budget, scrambling in an Orwellian attempt to deny that these fundamental changes in the budget are not broken promises—verbal gymnastics that we see from the Treasurer in particular, trying to say that this budget does not represent a fundamental breach of commitment to the Australian people. 


There are two big problems with this budget. One is that it shows that this government was elected on a web of wilful and consistent and systematic deceit, making false promises to the Australian people about the cost of living, false promises to the Australian people about the state of the budget and being able to return the budget to surplus without new taxes and without spending cuts over and above those which had been previously identified. It is a web of deceit in which the Liberal and National parties engaged up until and including the September election which has now been exposed by this budget. The other is that it is a fundamentally unfair manifesto. 


We saw the Treasurer's spin at work again on the weekend, with the leaking of Treasury analysis which apparently showed the impact on families was not that great; it was not that big. '""Nothing to see here,"" Treasury told us,' according to the spin from the Treasurer over the weekend. There is only one little problem with that: it was not Treasury analysis at all. It was not Treasury analysis at all. This is a Treasurer who said, when he came into office, 'I will never leak Treasury advice to defend my position; I will always stand up for myself.' I have to give him that; he has not done that. He has invented Treasury analysis. He has not leaked the real stuff; he has leaked false Treasury analysis, because it does not exist.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Craig Kelly
):  Order! I ask the member for McMahon to withdraw that accusation.




Mr BOWEN:
  On what basis, Mr Deputy Speaker?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  It is a reflection on a member. I would ask the member to assist the House and withdraw.




Mr BOWEN:
  I withdraw. The fact of the matter is that there is no such document in existence. There is no 'Treasury analysis'. It does not exist. The allegation that this document which has been released to the media is Treasury analysis is patently false. It does not exist. That is a statement of fact.


There is a pattern of behaviour here from this Treasurer. He sneakily releases these documents and claims they are Treasury analysis. Then, when further questions are asked, it turns out they were written in his office or the Prime Minister's office, not down at the Treasury. The Treasury should not be politicised in this way. The Treasury is a fine institution which has served the people of Australia well for 114 years. It is not the political plaything of this Treasurer, and he should not politicise its name in an attempt to justify his atrocious policies. If he wants to defend his policies, he should stand up for them, not claim that he has Treasury analysis which does not exist. If the government want to do little spreadsheets on the back of an envelope in their offices and work out little false calculations and then release them, that is up to them. But stand up for them. Admit to the Australian people what you are doing.


The fact of the matter is that there is analysis of this budget, and it is by NATSEM, a respected modelling outfit. They have actually been referred to by the Prime Minister as one of the most respected economic modelling outfits in this country. The evidence from them is stark: over 100,000 families in the lowest quintile will see $43 cut from their weekly budgets every week. If this is your idea of cost-of-living relief, next time don't bother: I say this to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker Kelly. Remember, the Prime Minister stood at the dispatch box and said they were 'riding to the rescue' of the Australian people. Well, don't turn up next time! This is what happens when those opposite ride to the rescue of the Australian people. A sole parent with an income of $55,000, with two kids, one in primary school and one in high school, will face a $20,000 hit to their budget. By just 2015, this family will face a 10 per cent annual hit to their current family income, or more than $5,700 a year. A couple on a single income of $75,000, with two kids, one not yet in school and one in primary school, will face a $2,000 decline in annual family income in 2015. By 2017-18, this family will have $7,400 less income than they would have had prior to this budget. 


They are the facts. I do not need to leak Treasury analysis which does not exist, as the Treasurer needs to do. I am happy to stand at this dispatch box and defend the analysis which has been commissioned by the opposition from a respected modeller. We will do that—and the Treasurer should have the courage to do the same, instead of leaking analysis which does not exist. Ben Phillips from NATSEM has stated:


We'd estimate around 1.2 million families that would be on average around $3,000 a year worse off by 2017-18, whereas the top income groups—so the top 20 per cent of households—would have either no impact or a very small positive impact—


a very small positive impact. That is what the independent analysis shows. That is what the documents that we are prepared to stand behind show, documents that have been released publicly and transparently. Let the Treasurer pick a hole in them. Let the Treasurer come in here and find an error, and let him argue that out with NATSEM, those respected modellers. He is not prepared to do so. What he does do is engage in Orwellian rhetoric and release to newspapers documents which are claimed to be Treasury analysis, which are clearly not.


As I said, this is a budget which has been rejected right across the country not only by people in communities, but also by premiers and state treasurers who are outraged, rightly, at their treatment by this government, the arrogant treatment of this Prime Minister and this Treasurer of the elected premiers of the states. I do not have universally positive views of all the premiers but they are people of accomplishment and they do not deserve to be treated this way, and the states they represent do not deserve to be treated in this arrogant and offhand way by this Prime Minister, who says they should be 'grown-ups'. That is an insult to the state premiers and to the states they represent.


Mike Keating, a respected former bureaucrat who has had to deal with some very difficult issues and deliver very difficult policies in his time, said:


This Government has cut the bottom rungs of the ladder of opportunity.


And of course he is right about that. This a fundamentally unfair document which the Treasurer and the Prime Minister do not even understand. They do not understand their own policy. Last week we saw the Prime Minister in a public relations triumph going out and blitzing talkback radio right across the country, getting basic facts wrong and telling university students that the cuts would not apply to them, when they clearly do. He said that because they were going to start university next year, the cuts would not apply to them. But they clearly do apply to them. We saw the Treasurer claim that the GP tax would not be paid by people with chronic illness. Wrong, just plain wrong. If the Prime Minister and the Treasurer do not understand the policies they are introducing, why should the Australian people pay for them? 


Then the Treasurer in the budget papers did not include the tables, which have traditionally been included in every single budget since 2005, on the impact of their changes on families with different incomes, showing how fair the budget is or otherwise. Peter Costello did it. Wayne Swan did it. Certainly in economic statements under  treasurers since 2005 those things have been included—and in budgets in particular. But it did not occur in this budget. When the Treasurer was asked about this he said: 'That is just not right. You cannot believe everything you read in the Sydney Morning Herald.' The Sydney Morning Herald is not the one with the credibility problem here. It is the Treasurer who has misled the Australian people here. It is the Treasurer who has produced a budget which very conveniently does not include those tables in the budget documents, because they would show just how unfair this budget is.


We just heard again from the member for Wright saying that Australians should make these contributions and these tough decisions and these payments—for example, the GP tax—to get the budget back on an even footing, to get it fiscally healthy and sound. There is only one problem with that, apart from the fact that it is fundamentally unfair and a trashing of the principle of universal health care. 



Mr Buchholz interjecting—




Mr BOWEN:
  The $7 GP tax does not even go to the budget bottom line; it goes to a new fund. Such is the budget emergency, they can trash the universality of Medicare and not even use the money to return the budget to surplus. They want to create a new fund to finance health and medical research. Who would disagree with more money for health and medical research? Nobody would. But the cures of today should not be paid for by taxing the sick of today, nor should the cures of tomorrow.



Mr Buchholz interjecting—




Mr BOWEN:
  The member for Wright and other honourable members should recognise that this GP tax is not being used to return the budget to surplus at all. These are the priorities and the value judgements of this government. 


The other thing they are doing of course is introducing an expensive and extravagant and unfair paid parental leave scheme, sending cheques of $50,000 to people, who may be millionaires, to have babies. Budgets are about priorities and this is the priority of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. They are saying to people: 'If you are under 30, we cannot afford to put you on Newstart. If you are a pensioner, we cannot afford to index your pension fairly. If you are a family, we cannot afford to let you go to the doctor for free. If you are a family on a low income or a single income, we need to take money from you. But if you are a millionaire, we can send you a cheque for $50,000 if you have a baby.' These are the priorities of this government. This is what this Prime Minister and this Treasurer are foisting on the Australian people and, I suspect, foisting on all those members opposite who do not actually support this policy but do not have the courage to stand up against this extravagant policy. It shows the warped and twisted priorities of this government. A budget is about choices and this government has made the choice to harm Australia's pensioners and, despite the protestations of the member for Wright, to take money from them. If you introduce unfair indexation, you are taking money from Australia's pensioners. You are saying to Australia's families, 'We will take money from you because we are going to charge you to go to the doctor.' You are saying to Australians, 'We are going to take money from you by forcing an underclass of those people under 30 and denying them any benefit when it comes to Newstart.' These are the priorities and values of this government: whilst sending cheques out for $50,000, taking money away from single-income families across Australia's cities and regions and rural areas. 


I know there are members opposite who know the impact of this. They know the impact of the family tax benefit changes and how bad they will be right across the country and in rural and regional areas as well, and what are they doing about it? They can do something about it. They can come and sit on this side of the chamber and vote accordingly. They can actually have the courage of their convictions if they have got them and stand up for their constituents. They can stand up against this government and this Prime Minister. They can roll them on the paid parental leave scheme. They can sit on this side and do the heavy lifting with this side of the House when it comes to defending Australians who deserve a better budget and a better government than the one they have got.


The Australian people have seen the values of this government over the last fortnight since the budget was delivered and they do not like them. They do not like the values of this government. It is not the government they were promised and it is not the government they deserve. They deserve so much better. Fundamentally, they deserve a government that is honest with them, that is upfront with them, which tells them before the election how much money they are going to take from them, instead of the false and misleading systematic campaign that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer masterminded before the election and the fundamentally unfair manifesto which is this budget, which takes from people and gives to others, which gives $50,000 cheques to some but takes away $20,000 over the next four years from others. These are values which the government is welcome to defend, but we will fight. We will fight in this place and the other place and across the community because it is an unfair budget.

"Pitt, Keith, MP",Nats,2014-05-26,"



Mr PITT
 (Hinkler) (12:36):  Last week I travelled from one end of my electorate to the other, from Bundaberg to Hervey Bay, stopping in Childers, Woodgate, Burrum Heads and Howard. I wanted to give Hinkler residents an opportunity to speak to me directly after the release of the coalition's first budget. I thought that if any electorate was going to be critical of the budget it would be mine. Hinkler has the fourth-highest unemployment rate in the country, we have more age pensioners than any other federal electorate and Bundaberg has the highest rate of disability in Queensland. And we also have amongst the highest rates of smoking and obesity.


Before the budget was released, the member for Maribyrnong, Bill Shorten, shamelessly targeted my electorate of Hinkler—just like Chicken Little scaring the vulnerable—by telling them that the coalition wanted to cut pensions. Let me assure the residents of my electorate that the sky is not falling. We promised not to change age pensions in this term of parliament and we have not. At the 2013 election we promised to get the budget under control and to grow the economy, and that is exactly what we are doing.


There is no doubt that this is a tough budget, but those difficult choices will reduce Labor's deficits by $43 billion and debt will be $275 billion lower over the decade. This is because governments, like households and businesses, must live within their means. Small business people know better than most that if you are going to borrow money to expand your operation or invest in capital, then you need a plan to pay that money back. When you start borrowing money to pay the staff and keep the lights on that is when you are in real trouble.


Likewise, it is ill-advised for households to spend money on luxuries they cannot afford. But that is exactly what the former Labor government did. Did they forget that at some point the credit card would have to be paid off? Or did they just not care? Labor had no plan to repair the budget when they were in government. Labor have no plan now. They offer no alternatives; just rhetoric and scaremongering. After six years of Labor, what did Australians get? We got the bill!


In his budget reply speech, the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said that this budget was drawn up by people who have never lived from pay cheque to pay cheque. I take great offence at remarks like that, and Labor's constant insistence that coalition members are out of touch with working families. I am a tradesperson. I did a four-year electrical apprenticeship at Fairymead Sugar Mill. I am a farmer: my wife and I own two cane farms, and my parents continue to operate a harvesting business. I am university educated: at the age of 22 I worked part time as a lifeguard to support myself through an engineering degree at the Queensland University of Technology. I have established a small business that employed up to 15 people at any one time. It delivered vocational training and consultancy services to industrial workplaces.


I have three children, and my wife works part time as a radiographer at one of the local hospitals. But the member for Maribyrnong, Bill Shorten, is private-school educated, studied arts and law at university and has since worked as a union bureaucrat and a politician. I would be interested to know how many times Mr Shorten has lived from pay cheque to pay cheque.


I can tell you there are plenty of people in my electorate of Hinkler who do live pay cheque to pay cheque every single fortnight. Some of them have been in my office this past week, deeply concerned about how the budget will affect them. But when you explain the detail, many realise just how much misinformation is being peddled by those opposite. Pensioners and children under 16 will pay no more than $70 per calendar year for medical treatment under the proposed $7 medical co-contribution. And the indexation of the fuel excise will add less than one cent per litre to the cost of petrol. The funds raised through these budget measures will go towards a medical research fund and road infrastructure.


To make matters worse, some media reports have been very one-sided or scant on detail. To promote my post-budget tour across the electorate last week, one local TV journalist asked if she and her cameraman could accompany me on a street walk. The three people I approached understood that tackling Labor's debt would require everyone to play a part, and that our current situation was unsustainable. However, the journalist overlooked all three of these supportive constituents, and instead ran grabs she later obtained from people who were unhappy with the budget. I am grateful to those Hinkler constituents who have read the detail for themselves—those who have contacted my office or approached me directly to seek answers to their questions. My door is always open.


There is no doubt this is a tough budget and it is only fair that everyone contributes to the repair task. Australians earning over $180,000 a year—who already pay significant taxes—will be required to pay a temporary budget repair levy of two per cent for three years. We have frozen politicians' pay and we will put an end to the gold pass travel entitlements.


Each year the government spends more on welfare than it does on the education of our children and the health of our people. The government is tightening the eligibility for family payments to ensure it supports those most in need of assistance because without policy changes the cost of the age pension is projected to increase by 70 per cent over the next decade, from almost $40 billion a year currently. The previous government increased the pension age to 67, and we are further increasing that age to 70 by 1 July 2035. Australians will still be able to retire at whatever age they choose, but those born after 1966 will have to be 70 before they can receive the age pension.


The government will introduce incentives of up to $10,000 to encourage businesses to employ people who are over the age of 50 who have been on unemployment benefits or the disability support pension for six months. From September 2017, pensions will be indexed to the CPI rather than wages. This way we can ensure that our pension system remains sustainable while pensions keep up with the cost of living. The family home will continue to be excluded from the social security means test.


This government recognises the contribution self-funded retirees make to the community, including saving the nation considerable pension costs. From 20 September 2014, the income thresholds for the Commonwealth seniors health card will be indexed annually to the CPI, enabling up to 27,000 additional people to qualify for the card over the next four years. Indexing the current income thresholds will mean more self-funded retirees will not lose out on entitlements because of changes in their income, giving them more freedom to actively contribute to their community.


Seniors health card holders will no longer receive the seniors supplement. However, they will continue to receive a range of concessional benefits, including lower co-payments for medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and access to the lower threshold for the extended Medicare safety net. Changes to the PBS will increase the cost of prescriptions for concessional patients by 80c to $6.90, and after 60 prescriptions it will be free for the rest of the calendar year.


But the budget contains plenty of good news too! This budget delivers on every one of my election commitments to the people of Hinkler:    $4.75 million for Old Toogoom Road and River Heads Road; $350,000 for the Hervey Bay Hockey Association to install synthetic turf; $500,000 for upgrades at the Hervey Bay and Bundaberg surf lifesaving clubs; $93,000 for Bundaberg Regional Council to install surf safety surveillance cameras at the Elliott River Mouth, Palmers Creek, Innes Park and Mon Repos; and, of course, $125,000 for the Centenary of Anzac Local Grants program across Hinkler


After repeated calls from local community groups, we have committed $245.3 million over four years to continue the National School Chaplaincy program. The coalition is delivering more than $12 billion in overall funding to the veteran community, including honouring our election commitment to deliver fair indexation for military superannuants.


Even after the carbon tax is repealed to save average households $550 per year, the associated tax breaks and energy supplements will remain in place to provide cost-of-living relief. Much to the relief of Hinkler farmers and commercial fishers, the diesel fuel rebate has been retained. The rebate will be indexed at the same rate as the fuel excise, meaning there will be no net increase in the cost of diesel for those who receive the rebate. The reintroduction of indexation on the fuel excise will cost an additional $24 per year for someone who uses 50 litres of fuel per week. As I previously mentioned, money raised from the indexation of the fuel excise will be spent on roads, bringing the government's infrastructure budget to a record $50 billion.


The coalition understands that well-planned infrastructure, delivered in a timely manner, is vital to our economy. It also facilitates service delivery to regional Australia and provides long-term employment and opportunities for training and development. That is why $13.4 billion will be spent in Queensland, including $6.7 billion on the ailing Bruce Highway. We are delivering a $1 billion National Stronger Regions Fund. Councils and community groups will be able to apply for grants for capital works projects that will regenerate communities with high unemployment. There is $300 million for the new bridges renewal program and $100 million to address mobile telephone black spots


I understand that transport infrastructure is not the only hurdle that regional businesses have to overcome. Here in Australia, regulation is high, input costs are high, labour costs are high, the Australian dollar is high and profits are low. We are working to change that. We are cutting the company tax rate by 1½ per cent to help around 800,000 businesses. Repealing the carbon tax will help business flourish because the electricity costs incurred through irrigation and refrigerant gases, for example, skyrocketed with the introduction of the tax. We are cutting red and green tape to save businesses time and money, which will lift productivity and boost economic growth.


Building on the free trade agreements we recently signed with South Korea and Japan, the government will provide $15 million to help small exporters. There is $9 million to support our recreational and commercial fishing bodies, $100 million extra for agricultural research and development and $20 million to build a stronger biosecurity and quarantine system.


Let me tell you why we are trying to make it easier, not harder, to do business in Australia. It is business that grows our economy. It is business that creates jobs. Small businesses are the backbone of regional Australia. They employ 50 per cent of all Australians working in the private sector. Jobs are sorely needed in my electorate of Hinkler. Unemployment is our single biggest issue. Unemployment is often a contributing factor in cases of marital breakdown, domestic violence, criminal activity, poor nutrition, health problems and declining school attendance. Employment gives people the ability to pay their own way and provide for their families. The people of this great nation should be able to depend on their elected representatives, but that does not mean we should be building a nation of dependants. Under the Rudd and Gillard governments, unemployment in the Hinkler electorate increased from six per cent in the September 2007 quarter to 9.6 per cent in the June 2013 quarter. That compares to an unemployment rate of 5.4 per cent for the nation or six per cent in Queensland. 


As promised, we are revitalising the Work for the Dole program to give people routine, structure, presentation skills and access to potential employers. Young people will now be required to earn, learn or work for the dole. We are fortunate to live in a country where this government provides a safety net to those who find themselves without employment. Requiring Australians to work for the dole ensures that that obligation is mutual. I recently spoke to the state member for Hervey Bay, Ted Sorensen, about the reintroduction of the Howard government's Work for the Dole program. When Ted was the local mayor, Work for the Dole participants helped construct all the walkways and bike paths along the esplanade. Ted cannot speak highly enough of the program. He says it built self-confidence and gave participants a sense of achievement. Many went on to gain long-term employment as a direct result of their involvement in Work for Dole.


Financial incentives will be provided to employers and employees to get young people into the workforce. Long-term unemployed Hinkler residents aged between 18 and 30 will receive $2,500 if they hold a job for a continuous period of 12 months and a further bonus of $4,000 when they attain 24 months of service. For the first time, those undertaking an apprenticeship will be able to apply for concessional loans of up to $20,000 in a scheme similar to HECS. Students with low socioeconomic backgrounds or from regional areas will have access to a new Commonwealth scholarship scheme. 


In the past eight months, seven federal ministers, three parliamentary secretaries and four coalition senators have visited the Hinkler electorate to hear about the issues impacting local residents and businesses. I also hosted the first Nationals party room meeting for 2014 in Bundaberg. Born and bred in the Bundaberg district, I take every opportunity to advocate on behalf of Hinkler residents. With this budget it will be no different. Constituents can rest assured that I will take their grievances to the relevant minister.


In closing, gone is the unstable Labor government that in a very short time gave us two prime ministers, two Treasurers and five Assistant Treasurers. Australians have elected a coalition government to repair the budget and build the stronger, more prosperous country that we all want. This budget starts that process. I commend the bills to the House.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (12:50):  This is a budget of broken promises. It is a bad budget for Australia and it is a bad budget for Australians. The broken promises of this budget reveal a government with a serious deficit—a values deficit. The budget's broken promises will hit low- and middle-income families and the elderly. The poorest will suffer the most, but everyone suffers. Before the election the Prime Minister said there would be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS. Every single one of those promises is broken in this budget.


Australians expect their government to run a strong economy, but that is just the start of what we expect. We expect the government to have a vision for the future of our country and a plan to get there. Australians value our egalitarian society. We want a society where hard work is rewarded but where a little bit of bad luck does not mean the end of the world; a society where no-one is left behind. This budget fails that fairness test. It hits the poorest the hardest. It makes life harder for millions of ordinary Australians struggling to balance their family budget. This budget makes it harder for people when they fill up at the petrol pump, when they go to the doctor, when they buy medicines. For that reason Labor will fight the unfair measures in this budget every step of the way.


The budget shows how starkly the differences between the two sides of politics play out. What kind of government would deliver a budget that will reduce the income of a couple who have a combined income of $95,000 and two kids by almost $5,000 a year? How do those members go back to their electorates and tell those families that this government is taking $5,000 a year from them? What kind of the government would deliver a budget that will reduce the income of a sole parent with two kids, earning $55,000 a year, by $6,000 a year? These are not our numbers; these are figures provided by NATSEM.


What has really surprised me, though, about the public anger in response to this budget is that people are not just angry about the broken promises and attacks on their own family budgets; they are angry about what is happening to other people. Parents with young kids who have lost the family tax benefit and the schoolkids bonus are not just talking to me about their family budget—they are talking to me about how unfair it is that pensioners who have worked hard all their lives are being told that their pensions will be cut. Pensioners who have never had a chance to go to university themselves are talking to me about their grandkids—and not even their own grandkids, but kids that age—who now have to choose between getting a decent university education and buying a home of their own one day. Young Australians, who are set to be slugged with these mind-boggling student debts, are talking to me about how it makes the decision to go to university much harder, but that is not all they are talking to me about. They are concerned about the $7.6 billion that this government is cutting from the aid budget, cuts made on the back of the world's poorest.




Mr Ewen Jones:
  Hear, hear!




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  'Hear, hear!' says the member for Herbert up there. These young people are concerned, too, about the cuts to the climate change programs that would mean Australia was contributing to reducing the likelihood of global warming passing that critical two degree benchmark that scientists tell us is so important. So, despite what the Treasurer says, the angry reaction to this budget is not because Australians are selfish: it is the exact opposite. Of course they are concerned for their own family budgets, but they are concerned for all of the people who are hit hardest by this budget as well. They do not want to see Australia become a two-tier system—a user-pays, American-style, 'you're fine if you're wealthy but God help you if you're not' style system. We will have a system that condemns kids who are born poor to grow up poor and to be sent to school in second-rate schools. We will have a health system that is world-class if you are wealthy and unattainable if you are not. Australians do not want a society of haves and have-nots. They value our way of life and that is why, while they want a strong economy, they want a fair society too. This budget fails on both counts.


I have had so many individual constituents stop me in the street to talk to me about the issues that will affect them. There are hundreds of little changes, as they come out over coming days and weeks, that will really impact them. A woman with cerebral palsy, who has managed to get back into the workforce with the help of the disability support pension, is terrified about what the changes mean for her in the future. A 23-year-old who has been saving up for his first home, using a first home saver account, says he feels cheated that the scheme has been cut. What is really scary about this is that it is not clear whether the members opposite really know what this budget is doing. You would think the Prime Minister would know, but we have had the Prime Minister say on Melbourne radio recently that an average person would only have to pay the $7 GP co-payment the first 10 times they went to the doctor: uh-uh! There is a safety net for people who are concession card holders and children but there is no safety net for ordinary working people, so mum's and dad's family budget will be under pressure. You know who will not be going to the doctor. You would think the Minister for Education would know: uh-uh! He said that the new arrangements for HECS debts and deregulated fees apply only for new students enrolling from 1 January 2016, but it seems the budget papers say the changes apply to all students enrolling from 14 May 2014 who will be studying in 2016, and to all people with a current HECS or HELP debt. It is not very reassuring, is it? The cuts are so deep and so brutal but the people who are supposed to be coming up with them and implementing them do not actually understand them.


As well as the values deficit, the economic arguments of this budget just do not stack up. The coalition's hysteria is built on a confected budget emergency. They hope that if they say often enough that the end is nigh, people will come to believe it. The most astonishing thing, given this hysteria around the confected budget emergency, is that they have actually managed to deliver bigger deficits. They have done a deal with the Greens for 'debt unlimited'. The deficits in the first three years, from 2014-15, are actually larger than the ones that were predicted in the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook statement—which was prepared not by us but by Treasury and Finance, before the election. It is worth reminding people that this Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook is a Peter Costello, Charter of Budget Honesty innovation and sets the benchmark for each party's election commitments going into the election. Why has that happened? Because they have added $68 billion to the deficit in just a few months by giving almost $9 billion—unasked for and unneeded—to the Reserve Bank by changing a number of economic parameters and by spending.


If there is a budget emergency, what should we do? Should we find $22 billion for a gold-plated paid parental leave scheme? It just shows how wrong the priorities of this budget are. Pensioners who are surviving on around $22,000 a year get a cut so that people who are earning $200,000, $300,000, $400,000 or $1 million a year can get $50,000 to have a baby. They cut superannuation support for low- and middle-income workers so that they could leave in place measures that allow the highest income workers to benefit most from super tax concessions. They will bring back petrol taxes that will hit everyone who drives but will hit those living in outer suburbs and in regional areas the worst. They are going to hit them with petrol taxes and then float the notion of a higher or broader GST at the same time as knocking back corporate tax avoidance and profit-shifting prevention measures that would have raised $1.1 billion. How on earth can anyone justify these priorities?


Then there is the abolition of the carbon tax and the minerals resource rent tax in favour of taxes that hit the family budget. There is the $80 billion cut from education and health. I always knew that many on those benches opposite were big supporters of outsourcing; well, they have really done well in this instance. They have outsourced $80 billion of hospital and education cuts to the states. They are not prepared to do it themselves. They have just snatched that money from the states. It is extraordinary to just say that the states can deal with it—'This thing that has always been a shared responsibility is no longer a shared responsibility. We are just going to shove it onto the states and they can deal with the longer waiting lists for elective surgery, they can deal with the longer waiting times in emergency departments and they can deal with the cuts to our schools.'


We met the budget rule of keeping real average spending growth to less than two per cent a year—the lowest four-year result in 23 years. We saved 200,000 jobs during the global financial crisis. We prevented Australia from falling into recession and we did it in a way that saw Australia coming back to surplus over the economic cycle because we agree that it is important that over time we do that. We delivered $180 billion in savings while we were in government. In fact, as health minister I delivered billions of dollars in savings but I did it by means testing the private health insurance rebate—opposed by those opposite—and by finding savings in the cost of generic medicines, by paying less for medicines as they came off patents. There were billions of dollars of savings that were opposed by those opposite.


The government's cuts to the health budget make no sense. Why would you cut prevention programs if you want to keep people out of hospital, where it is expensive to look after them? Why cut prevention when the greatest health challenges—smoking, obesity and excessive alcohol consumption—cost us so much as a community? How does it make sense to cut health costs by reducing access to the cheapest part of the health system, general practice, knowing that the outcome will be sicker people and more strain on the hospital system? These are health cuts designed by someone who does not care about patients, just about short-term cuts. They will cost us all in the long run. You can cut costs in the health system by keeping people healthy and out of hospital or you can cut costs by rationing the access that sick people have to medical treatment. Guess which this government has chosen?


I spoke earlier today about the massive cuts to foreign aid and what they will mean to the world's poorest people. I think it is so important to say that again as that is a stark example of just how different our values are. John Howard knew that Australia should be a nation of lifters not leaners when it came to international development assistance. John Howard knew that, but Tony Abbott does not. It is worth saying also that, if you are talking about our role in the world community, nations everywhere are looking at us now and asking: 'Why are you cutting an effective and cost-effective program to reduce air pollution, carbon pollution? Why are you cutting, for example, billions of dollars from environmental programs while finding $2.6 billion to pay big polluters to keep polluting? Why are you cutting from grassroots environmental programs, CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology and renewable energy initiatives?' Then there is the broken promise on Landcare funding, ripping $483 million out of Landcare and conservation programs; the $2.8 million cut from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority; the scrapping of climate change research across government agencies; and the abolition of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which actually makes money for the government. The world community is asking, 'Why are you doing these things at a time when everybody else is moving in the other direction, moving to tackle climate change?'


There is another broken promise on Landcare and another broken promise on the ABC and SBS. There are cuts of $43.5 billion over four years to the ABC and SBS and a cut of almost $200 million to the Australia Network. This is a budget of broken promises. It is a budget of wrong priorities. It is a budget that hurts the poorest the most. It is a budget that shows very clearly the values deficit of this government.

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2014-05-26,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (13:04):  I have just listened to the shadow Treasurer and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for 30 minutes on these appropriation bills and there was not one solution proffered. There was 30 minutes of whingeing, moaning and carrying on. There was not one solution offered, so go back to the glory days. 


First and foremost I would like to pass on my personal best wishes and congratulations to the Treasurer, Joe B Hockey, and the leadership group of the coalition government for the job that they have done here. This budget lays the foundations for our nation to be more productive, more affluent and more inclusive. In September last year, just after Mr Hockey was made Treasurer, he gave a speech that has always stuck with me. He said we have to do three things: first, we have to tell the people what the problem is; second, we have to tell the people what we are going to do about it; and, third and most importantly, we have to take the people with us when we are working. 


So what was the problem? I have got only 15 minutes to go through the problems that we encountered over the last six years, but I will go as quickly as possible. Tony Abbott, the Prime Minister, has always said there is nothing new in politics, so it will not surprise anyone that in 1996 the then Howard coalition government faced a $96 billion gross debt problem and a $10 billion black hole. In 1996, because the previous Labor government reformed the way we did business in Australia and the way we acted as a government—and that was accepted in a bipartisan way—we had rising terms of trade. But the Howard government was still a government that made tough decisions.


Australia faced the Asian financial crisis in those days. This was very local and we were very exposed. It was a very worrying time in the auction industry, in which I was employed, and in the finance industry. Yet the Howard government went into deficit for one year only. We acted, supported and then corrected. Fast forward to the economic conservatism of the Rudd-Gillard era, when the GFC hit they acted and supported but they did not correct. When Andrew Robb, the member for Goldstein, was the shadow finance spokesperson he gave a speech in here in which he said that what happens in the GFC is sort of like when you are doing your house. You pay your mortgage and you have a set number of expenses then one year you decide you are going to do a renovation. So for that year your expenses, your outgoings, go up. But the next year, because you are no longer doing the renovations, your expenses come down to roughly what they were. What the Labor government did under Rudd and Gillard was raise expenses and that was the new floor. That was the problem we encountered. That was the new starting point so that was the problem.


When people come to me and say, 'I don't know what to believe', and 'Everyone can do projections', and 'Anyone can point the finger'—we have just seen how wonderful the Labor Party was in the last two speeches made by those members opposite, and yet we won 90 seats in the last election. I say to them: whether you believe our projections about gross debt going up to $667 billion is completely up to you. What no-one can deny is that over the past six years we had budget deficits totalling $191.5 billion, with the major expenses still to come on health, education, NBN and NDIS and no plan to pay for them. No-one can dispute those figures. So even if you accept those base figures, we are still left with a massive task quite similar to what was faced by the Howard government in 1996.


We are borrowing $1 billion per month to pay the interest on the debt at the moment. What do we do about it? This budget brings our gross figure down from the projected $667 billion by nearly $300 billion to $389 billion. This budget addresses the issues of the ageing population. Even the opposition leader in his speech, when he referred to taxpayers and pensioners, said that when he was at school there were 7.5 taxpayers per pensioner and today there are five taxpayers per pensioner. By 2050 there will be 2.5 taxpayers per person over the ages of 65 and 70. That is not a shrinking workforce; that is a growing ageing population with challenges that have to be faced.


This budget attempts to make the support the taxpayer extends to the community more sustainable, whether it be the pension, Medicare, health in general, education, defence: the lot has to be paid for by the taxpayers and the taxpayers' dollars. The Howard government did it before and was able to hand the benefits back to those who did the heavy lifting. Family tax benefit part B was initially installed by the Howard government because from 1996 through to 2001 the families of Australia did the heavy lifting. They paid off Labor's debt, and the then Prime Minister said, 'You deserve to be helped'. We are borrowing money to support a lifestyle. We cannot continue to do that. No-one likes losing a benefit, but when people sit down and actually start to think about it they understand why we are doing it.


What we said we would do in the last election—every day for three years the now Prime Minister said at every opportunity and every press conference that we would axe the carbon tax, we would stop the boats, we would build the roads of the 21st century and we would fix the budget. The boats: well and truly over 150 days since a successful arrival. Check; we have done it, and saved $2.5 billion by closing down detention centres inside Australia. As a first order of business in this place, we axed the carbon tax in this House of Representatives; it is sitting over there. Those opposite will sit there and tell you they are concerned about people's cost of living, and yet the average family is saving $550 per year, going up again on 1 July because the carbon tax will be extended again on 1 July this year. It is still sitting over there; it can be passed today if members opposite choose to do so. The carbon tax repeal has been passed by us in this place, so that is a check.


Roads: we have $50 billion worth of infrastructure projects—$25 billion worth of roads—approved under this government. There is $220 million alone on road projects in Townsville. The member for Grayndler will probably come in here and tell us that he actually turned the first sod on all of those, that was all done, all paid for previously. So we get down to fixing the budget. We went to the last election saying that we would extend a levy to the biggest companies to pay for a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme. We went to the last election saying we would raise a levy and support a raised levy to support the NDIS, so this notion about no new taxes—what do members opposite actually think we are going to do, win lotto? That we are going to take a system 25 each week and that is how we are going to get the budget back into order?


We need to take the people with us. I have concerns in relation to the way Australia is going, and I share the concerns of some people in this House. There are conversations we have to have in relation to where this country is going. The NDIS is an idea whose time has come, but we must make it affordable. We cannot afford to live in a country where someone is walking down the street and a man is mowing his lawn in an NDIS T-shirt and no-one knows what it stands for. I worry that we have parents still talking about the people that they love the most, their children with a disability, and that they still have to describe them in the worst possible way to get the help they need. I truly believe that Senator Fifield is the right man for the job and I truly believe that this place is bipartisan in its approach. But I cannot help but think that we are still going to be heading down that same track, where parents are still going to be dreadfully exposed in the way they are going to have to explain themselves to get the help they need. I will know that that is fixed when parents can come to me and tell me that they are happy with the way it is going.


I also share the concern about the timing of deregulation fees for the university sector. I have no problems with deregulation itself. I think that is a very healthy thing and I think the way we are going about it—extending it to TAFE students and to subdegree things and trade support loans to another 80,000 people—is a great idea. But you have third parties coming into the system now and they must be watched. We must make sure that we control not only the organisations but also the organisations that participate in that sector. We must have a very strong and effective authority. We cannot afford to see what happened in the VET sector—we saw an explosion of RTOs to more than 4,600 but more than 90 per cent of the results are still produced by less than 100 organisations—happen in our higher education sector. Again, I believe that Minister Pyne is the right person at the right time to take this debate forward. I believe that he is truly consultative with Universities Australia and with the education sector in general.


I want to see the white papers on taxation and the Federation happen as quickly as possible, and I want the discussions to be as open and frank and free as possible. We have a chance in this place to fundamentally change our country for a long time. We are a vastly different place to what we were in 1901. I see kids up  there behind the glass and they are watching us here. When you are older, I want to make sure that you are living in an Australia which is inclusive, I want to make sure that you are living in an Australia which is affordable, and I want to make sure that you are living in an Australia where you are not paying for the mistakes of my generation—where you are not paying for the profligacy of previous governments, because you kids deserve better.


So I want to make sure we have those open and frank conversations and I want to make sure that we do the right thing by people. I want to see the red tape reduction practices undertaken by this government to be the catalyst for freeing up business and industry and not an exercise in cost-shifting to other forms of government. The Townsville City Council in my electorate of Herbert—which I sometimes have a fractious relationship with—have seen many areas of regulation cut from other levels of government and simply had the cost of compliance and the cost of regulation lumped onto them with no benefit. This red tape reduction must be driven through COAG so we do not see one level of government reducing costs and another level rising. We must make sure this is a coordinated approach.


I want to see work done to the tender process for all government projects to make sure they support local government, local contractors and local communities. When Senator Arthur Sinodinos was in Charters Towers with me recently we heard a story about a local council out west of Charters Towers. The Flinders Shire Council had costed out a road at $9 million. It had to go to national tender. The cost came in at $27 million. The contractor who won it flew in their team, their workers, the camp—everything. They did the work and not one cent stayed in the local community. We cannot have a tender process where we are doing major jobs in places like Townsville where the only beneficiaries are McDonald's and the pie van. We want to make sure that our local contractors, our local people, are being looked after. We want to make sure that the money is going through the community.


I want to see an aviation hub in Townsville. I want to see the C27J turboprop replaced with the Caribou based at RAAF Base Garbutt. It makes sense. I want to see the cost of production spread away from Defence and into the private sector.


We talk a lot about Northern Australia and the white paper is to be handed down. I copped a bit of flak in Townsville because there weren't any projects in the white paper. We must get the foundations right and that means getting a baseline science right. That means backing CSIRO and backing James Cook University to make sure that we are looking at our freshwater options. Once we get the macro right, once we get the picture right, we can then develop. What I will not cop is being held accountable for some dodgy deal done between the member for Lilley and some Independent over a project that was absolutely stone motherless dead in 2011 and was still being kept in the federal budget for two years so they could throw a sling at the member for Herbert.


I want to see us have a better relationship and continue to grow our relationship with Papua New Guinea. PNG's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill spoke in Cairns just last week and he said: 'Suddenly we are back on the map with Australia. It is great to see. Funnily enough, Papua New Guinea was visited by no less than three different prime ministers inside 12 months.' He said, 'I don't think we'll ever see that time again.' He understands the need for trade and he understands the need to grow it organically. I think we can learn a lot from Papua New Guinea. They are in the 14th year of economic growth. Their economy is expected to grow at 15 per cent. There is some serious business being done up there. We must be more proactive in getting them to participate in the development of northern Australia. Townsville is the perfect place for it.


I do want to refer to the credibility argument that has been thrown down by those opposite. Last year in the budget reply speech, Tony Abbott, the then opposition leader, stared down the barrel of the camera and told people that we were axing the things from the mining tax—that there were things that would have to go because they were not affordable; that we would not be able to keep on spending the way we had. He told the people of Australia that we had to make some tough decisions, and we have. You have the opposition Treasurer now saying approximately 392 times that it was an unfair budget but he says nothing about what he is going to do!


Can I tell you finally, Deputy Speaker Mitchell, when I walk down the street there are a lot of people concerned about the budget but not one person has said to me, 'You know, I want to go back to the glory days of the Rudd-Gillard government.' No-one is saying that ever. I thank the House.

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Ms KING
 (Ballarat) (13:14):  I too rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-2015 and cognate bills representing the Abbott government's federal budget. This is indeed a budget of broken promises and, in my area of health, one that launches a fundamental attack on the fabric of Medicare. The Prime Minister promised before the election that there would be no cuts to health. He didn't just say it once; he said it many, many times. He promised before the election that there would be no new taxes. At no time during the election campaign did the Prime Minister telling the Australian people that they would be paying more to see a doctor, more for their medicines, more to access a specialist and that he would gut funding for public hospitals, for prevention and for dental care. But that is exactly what the Abbott government has done in this budget. This is what this budget delivers to the Australian people: cuts to public hospitals, cuts to prevention programs, cuts to dental care, a GP tax and more expensive medicines. When the population is ageing and the rate of chronic illness is increasing, it is inconceivable that the government would want to make the changes that it does, particularly those putting a barrier in the way of people accessing general practitioners. Medicare has served Australia well for the past 30 years, but this government appears to want to erode its very fabric—universal access.


When Bob Hawke as Prime Minister introduced Medicare all those decades ago, he warned that without it more than two million Australians faced potential financial ruin in the event of a major illness. Today that is not the case, because every Australian can rely on our universal health system, a universal insurance scheme that everybody contributes to according to their means, and that means that people can access health care on the basis of their need and not on the basis of their means to pay for it. If this Prime Minister gets his way he will be taking Australia back decades and putting millions of Australians in the same perilous position as pre-Medicare.


I want to take each of the cuts within this appropriation bill in turn, starting with public hospitals. The first thing we saw was the ripping up of Labor's historic agreements that were reached with the states and territories in health, agreements which had largely ended the blame game when it came to the Commonwealth and states, and which had started to wind back the erosion of the Commonwealth's contribution to public hospital funding that had occurred under the Liberals. In fact, the Abbott government's own election policy document, a document that was very scant on detail in any case, did promise that a coalition government would support the transition to the Commonwealth providing 50 per cent of growth funding of the efficient price of the hospital services as proposed. This was part of the coalition's election documentation.


What did we see after the election? Well, you will not find that promise on the coalition's website anymore. Amazingly, it has suddenly disappeared. So embarrassed is the coalition by this broken promise in health that it has taken its election policy off its website. And so ashamed is it of how badly it has broken this pre-election promise that, instead of providing the growth funding that was promised to the Australian public and promised to the states to run the public hospitals, this budget of broken promises cuts a whopping $50 billion from Australia's public hospitals. And it is no wonder that the Prime Minister is too embarrassed to meet with his state counterparts after this promise was so comprehensively broken. These are cuts that commence in just 35 days' time, on 1 July this year.


Only last fortnight, the Treasurer told Australians: the fact is we are honouring the four years of the agreements in both hospitals and schools that we said we would honour; we are doing that. That is simply untrue. The Treasurer does not even know what is in his own budget. The cuts to hospitals start this financial year, and we know that that will put services at jeopardy. States are already talking about hospital bed closures. We know that there will be changes in emergency department waiting times, that there will be changes and blow-outs in elective surgery times, that there are hospital beds that will close and that nurses and doctors will not be employed or will be employed less. At every point in the system we see that this government plans to cut funding and to break its promises.


In preventative health, the government is to rip up the $367 million agreement on preventive health funding. States and territories that entered into contracts for programs that are to start shortly are suddenly now finding themselves with a shortfall. This is coming at the same time as many states across the country have started to withdraw funding for preventive health programs as well, saying that they believe it is the role of the Commonwealth to engage in prevention. We have now seen with this budget that the Commonwealth is largely abdicating the field when it comes to health prevention. The National Partnership Agreement on Preventative Health is gone. Preventative health funding for programs to tackle obesity, alcohol abuse and smoking have been cut. We know the government does not care about preventive health because it is also planning to cut some $2.9 million from the national tobacco campaign. It is also axing, in a separate bill, the Australian National Preventive Health Agency, the agency charged with making sure preventive health is a priority. It works with states and territories to ensure that we do not duplicate effort, that we have a combined partnership agreement in order to get the maximum benefit for our preventative health dollar and that as a country we are actually tackling conditions that are preventable like diabetes and heart disease. The government does not seem to believe in these things. It is ripping down the preventative health website and the health star rating system and shutting down organisations like the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council. And I suspect there is a whole lot more to come in health space. These are short-sighted policy decisions that will take Australia's health system back decades.


And of course then there are the government's plans to introduce the GP tax. The government wants to basically put a significant barrier, a pay wall, in the way of people accessing their GPs. So flawed is this policy, the Treasurer and Prime Minister do not actually understand how it works. Last week, during interviews, the Prime Minister and Treasurer both said to the Australian public that if you have chronic disease you will not pay this tax; it will not apply to you. It was a plainly wrong and incorrect statement. No-one is exempt from the government's GP tax. The facts the Treasurer relied upon to introduce this tax are also wrong. A fortnight ago, the Treasurer was out there again on ABC's Q&A saying that, on average, Australians visit the doctor 11 times a year. This is simply not true. In fact, Australia is bang-on the OECD average and the correct number is fewer than seven times.


This is a tax based on a broken promise that no health policy expert has said is a good idea. The Australian Medical Association has said this is a very bad idea and is very bad policy. They Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association, the Royal Australian College of Emergency Physicians, the Royal Australian College of GPs—not necessarily known for radical campaigning—have actually started a #CoPayNoWay campaign, a significant campaign that is seeing hundreds of emails arrive in my inbox each day absolutely opposed to this government trying to put a barrier in the way of people accessing a doctor.


The Consumer Health Forum, a not-for-profit organisation that is charged with representing consumers and advocating for consumers, has very clearly said this policy will impact very significantly on those with chronic conditions, those who are on low and middle incomes and on some of the most vulnerable Australians in the country. I went and visited an Aboriginal medical service just recently. The staff there told me that they cannot possibly charge this tax and that will mean that, for their service delivery, they will have to find an extra $350,000 each year just to continue to employ doctors to meet the demand they have within their service. It is a cost they will have to absorb within their own system. They are very concerned about what that will mean for services right the way across their community.


All of these bodies have advised this government against this policy yet the government have determined that they will proceed with it. Not only will they proceed with the GP tax but they are also intending to tell states and territories that they should also impose a tax when people go to emergency departments. We have seen only one state to date, Western Australia, say that they would entertain such a thing.


These are changes that the former vice president of the Australian Medical Association has said will take Australia's health system back more than 50 years. I think he knows something about it. He absolutely knows something about the health system which unfortunately this government appears not to. Not only will health care be less affordable and less accessible, the government is also ripping $270 million—

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (13:30):  The 26th of May is a significant date in our national calendar. Today we reflect on the profound grief and trauma experienced by members of the stolen generations as we mark National Sorry Day. National Sorry Day this year marks the 17th anniversary of the 1997 Bringing them home report which outlined the extent of forcible removal policies that had been used to separate Indigenous children from their families. It is an opportunity for each and every Australian to reflect and pay tribute to the stolen generations and their families, and to acknowledge the pain, grief and intergenerational impacts of forced removal policies, not only on the children that were taken but also on their families and communities.


In 2008, the Australian government delivered the national apology on behalf of the nation. Kevin Rudd stood up and delivered it in this place. We said sorry for the pain and suffering caused by past government policies and practices, in particular to the stolen generations, who were robbed of families, language, culture and land. It was a watershed moment and an important step in our journey of healing and reconciliation.


I would like to acknowledge the special place of the Healing Foundation and the vital role it continues to play in the ongoing efforts towards traditional healing and social and emotional wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Healing is an important part of our national reconciliation journey and I encourage all Australians to come together to commemorate National Sorry Day. (Time expired)

I am very pleased to be able to reassure the Leader of the Opposition that while we are making some savings in this area, as we are making savings across the board, we believe that by collapsing some 100 separate programs into five broad programs we can achieve efficiencies in service delivery that will mean, with somewhat less money, that we will achieve better outcomes. This is our objective: to achieve better outcomes for the Indigenous people of our country. What we are absolutely committed to doing is to ensuring that children go to school, that adults go to work and that people are safe in their own homes. These changes were thoroughly discussed with the Prime Minister's Indigenous Advisory Council. As anyone who has read Warren Mundine's speech given last weekend would know, the council is satisfied that the government are heading in the right direction.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (14:28):  Concessions are essentially a matter for the state governments and for local councils.



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  There will be silence to listen to the answer.




Mr ABBOTT:
  My understanding is that of pensioner concessions some 90 per cent of the burden is quite properly and appropriately carried by the state government. If I could address the shadow minister's general point: yes, we are asking some sacrifices of our people. 




Ms Macklin:
  Madam Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. It is very clear—



The SPEAKER:  There is no point of order. The member will resume her seat.




Ms Macklin:
  in the budget papers the government is taking 1.3—



The SPEAKER:  I ask the member to resume her seat and I would point out that once you add your political tag you open the question up for a very wide range of answers. I call the Prime Minister.




Mr ABBOTT:
  We are asking for some sacrifices, and everyone is making a contribution. As I said before, high-income earners are paying the deficit levy, members of parliament are forgoing a pay rise, motorists are bearing fuel excise indexation. This is a budget where all of us need to make a contribution so that all of us can be better off in the medium and long term.


The sad truth is that every single Australian was a loser because of the incompetence of the former government. We did not cause the debt and deficit disaster that members opposite gave us.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2014-05-26,"



The SPEAKER
 (15:12):  I have a question from the member for Watson but before we go to that, I want to make a statement on a question I was asked last time we sat. This is a question on the tabling of documents by private members.


During question time on 15 May 2014, the member for Jagajaga sought leave to table a document during the response by the Prime Minister to a question from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. A number of points of order were taken at the time and reference was made to earlier rulings concerning tabling of documents by private members. I said that I would look at the precedents and advise the House.


The relevant standing order 199 provides that only ministers may table documents without leave and only when there is no motion before the House. Members other than ministers or parliamentary secretaries require leave of the House, at any time, to present documents.


Two speakers have ruled on the question of the presentation of documents, by leave, by private members. In 2004, Speaker Hawker held that a request from a private member for leave to present a document during question time would not be put to the House where the document was already on the public record. In 2012, on four separate occasions, Speaker Jenkins stated that he would not permit a private member other than the person asking the question to seek to table a document during question time. Subsequent to Speaker Jenkins' departure from office his rulings were not sustained, with members other than the questioner being permitted to seek leave to table a document during question time.


As I see it, the purpose of allowing a private member to present documents to the House is to inform the House in relation to the matter raised by that member in his or her remarks. What is not permitted is the use of this procedure as a disruptive device, particularly during question time. With this being the underlying principle, and consistent with earlier rulings, I propose to uphold the rulings of Speakers Hawker and Jenkins so:


(1) only the member speaking or, at question time, the questioner may seek leave to table a document, and only then after the minister has concluded his or her answer;


(2) a request by a private member for leave to table a document will not be put where the document is already on the public record; and


(3) a request for leave by a private member to table a document will not be permitted when used as a disruptive device.



Ms Burke interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  I beg your pardon. I resent that implication. I would ask that to be withdrawn.




Ms Burke:
  I will withdraw, but it was on the basis of the interjections by the member at the time.



The SPEAKER:  I do not care what the reason was. I find it an offensive interjection.

On 15 May 2014, the member for Moreton asked me a question about the display of posters in corridors. Posters had appeared on the outside of doors to several members' suites, and the member had asked that they be taken down. Consistent with the longstanding practice, upheld by successive Speakers, that signs and posters not be permitted in the corridors or on the doors leading off the corridors, the members concerned were asked to take the posters down at my request and they have since been removed. It remains the prerogative of members to place material inside the internal corridor windows of their suites. Also, all members are entitled to use their suites for their own purposes, but of course not for illegal purposes. That is the answer to your question.

Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (16:03):  by leave—On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit I present the committee's report No. 442: Inquiry into the 2012-13 Defence Materiel Organisation Major Projects Report.


Today I table the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit's review of the  Defence Materiel Organisation's 2012-13Major Projects Report.


This was the sixth annual major projects report to be produced by the Audit Office and the DMO. This year's report covers 29 projects with a combined budget of over $44 billion.


The committee's aim in reviewing the MPR is to help to maximise transparency and accountability in the Defence acquisition process. The committee has made a range of recommendations directed towards this.


The DMO MPR constitutes the ANAO's review and analysis of the progress of selected major Defence acquisition projects managed by DMO, and aims to consider cost, schedule, and capability performance and to function as a longitudinal analysis of procurement projects over time.


The JCPAA assesses the overall content, accessibility and transparency of the information provided in the MPR, and also reviews and endorses the guidelines that constitute the MPR.


The committee is committed to ensuring the information presented in the major projects report helps to maximise transparency and accountability in the Defence acquisition process for major projects managed by DMO.


Specific areas of focus in the committee's review of this year's report include cost, schedule, and capability performance, and governance and business processes.


Defence major projects are inherently complex. Meeting cost, schedule and capability targets must be considered in this context, particularly for developmental projects.


There are a range of issues affecting the completion of major projects. These include:


Managing schedule delays as a result of budgetary constraints;


Employing and maintaining an appropriately skilled workforce;


Contractor overestimation of the technical maturity of proposed equipment solutions;


Contractor underestimation of the level of effort and complexity required to deliver new equipment;


Unavailability of in-service equipment (due to operational requirements) limiting the ability of projects to install, and test new or upgraded equipment; and


Complying with increasingly demanding certification and regulatory requirements.


The committee acknowledges these various challenges.


The creation of DMO and the evolving improvements in how it operates were a significant step forward for Australia. The MPR is an important element of this progression along with the corresponding parliamentary scrutiny.


The committee's report makes 10 recommendations directed at:


Improving the reporting of budget estimates and actual expenditure;


Improving the line of sight between the MPR, the portfolio budget statements and portfolio budget estimates statements;


Developing a more effective methodology for reporting sustainment activity and expenditure;


Improving the reporting of slippage post second past approval and acquisition type by approval date;


Improving the assessment and reporting of statements relating to capability;


Retaining the publication of project maturity scores until they are no longer required by the JCPAA; and


Improving reporting on exited major projects.


On behalf of the committee, I would like to express my appreciation for the work done by the DMO and the Australian National Audit Office in producing the major projects report each year. I would like to thank the committee secretariat for their assistance in preparing this report. I also thank the witnesses from the DMO and the ANAO for their participation in the committee's review. I commend the report to the House.

Mr CONROY
 (Charlton) (16:07):  by leave—I rise to briefly speak to the report. First off, I commend the chair on the excellent process that produced this report. This is the latest in a series of major project reports conducted by the DMO and the ANAO at the request of the JCPAA. The key table in this report that people should look at is table 5, which demonstrates that significant improvements have been made in the performance of major defence procurement in this country. But there is a stark contrast between projects approved before the Kinnaird and Mortimer reforms and projects approved post that time. It is in this context that I raise deep concerns about any move to reduce the independence of the DMO or attempts to reintegrate it into the Department of Defence, because I fear that we could return to an era where the average slippage in schedule was 87 per cent, which is what occurred in projects pre the Kinnaird reforms. That is the real lesson that came out of the major projects report. 


A key recommendation of the report was around sustainment reporting, and I again commend the committee on the constructive way it approached this issue, trying to balance the very serious national security issues around the disclosure of information that may be of use to potential adversaries versus the right of the parliament and the people of Australia to know how their defence dollars are being spent and how that platform is performing. It is fair to say that the committee is still not fully satisfied with how Defence is reporting on sustainment, which is quite opaque in the portfolio budget statements. Hopefully, hard work between the Audit Office, the DMO and the committee can resolve this issue over the coming year.


Finally, I would like to touch on the performance of some individual projects that are in this report, particularly the patrol boats and the air warfare destroyer, which was also subject to a separate ANAO report. In that case, as is highlighted in the major projects report, there is a clear link between a decline in the boom and bust of the shipbuilding industry and the performance of that project. The audit report clearly states that we are paying the price for a run-down of work post the ANZAC projects. It also notes the ongoing problems with the patrol boats. In my firm view, this adds more evidence to the case that we need to bridge the shipbuilding 'valley of death', where we have 4,000 naval shipbuilding jobs at risk. We can get greater performance for the defence department, for the Navy, by bringing work forward and at the same time save 4,000 jobs. I was deeply disappointed that the budget of a fortnight ago had no information and no certainties for those 4,000 workers and their families. 


I commend this report to the House. I congratulate all participants in the hearing process, particularly the ANAO and the DMO. I echo the chair's thanks to the committee for delivering an excellent report.

"Marles, Richard, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Mr MARLES
 (Corio) (16:11):  I rise to oppose the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Repeal Bill 2014. This bill seeks to repeal the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Act that was introduced by the Labor government only last year—2013.


The resources sector is an enormous part of Australia's prosperity. According to the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics, at the end of October 2013 there were 63 projects at the committed stage, representing a combined value of $240 billion. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, there are 273,000 people employed in mining, oil and gas projects. So, given the size of this industry, it is essential that any move to regulate the environment that this industry operates within is done carefully. Firstly, regulation must take into account the safety and conditions of the persons working on these projects. Secondly, regulation must take into account the unique contribution that this industry makes to the Australian economy through the creation of jobs, trade and export value.


The Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Act 2013, introduced by the then Labor government, sought to clarify the status of persons working in offshore marine zones, in response to the case Allseas Construction SA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2012]. It is also known as the Allseas case. In Allseas, the Federal Court found that pipe-laying vessels and noncitizens working on those vessels were not within or working within the migration zone as defined under section 5 of the Migration Act 1958. This meant that workers on board those vessels did not require a visa. 


The then Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen, announced that the government would legislate to amend the Migration Act 1958 and clarify the situation regarding workers in Australia's offshore maritime zones by expanding the scope of the migration zone. The department then commenced a review and established the Migration Maritime Taskforce to inform the best way to address the situation. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee also examined the bill then, noting that it complied with Australia's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and recommended that it be passed. During each of these processes, extensive stakeholder engagement was conducted.


It is important to note that Labor's act is not due to commence until 30 June this year. This was to allow adequate time for further facilitation and stakeholder engagement regarding the specifically tailored visa pathway for offshore resource workers that was to be developed and was prescribed in the Migration Regulations 1994. Primarily, Labor's act sought to ensure that persons who participate in or support an 'offshore resources activity' are deemed to be in the migration zone, thereby requiring all noncitizens engaged in offshore resources activities to hold either a specific or permanent visa. At the time it was acknowledged that there was a need to strike a balance between encouraging investment in our offshore environments and the need to ensure that Australia's offshore jobs are regulated under Australian laws.


Labor's position on this has not changed. It is critical that Australia maintains a healthy investment environment in its offshore projects. This will not only make sure that the industry has ongoing viability, but also ensures that we maximise the capacity of these projects to employ the right people with the right skills. Winding back the Labor government's reforms will re-open a significant loophole in Australia's ability to regulate the conditions of our offshore resources industry and to regulate the workers who are employed on these valuable national assets. This could lead to situations where those working on these projects are working under conditions that do not adhere to Australian standards. This in turn reduces work opportunities for Australian citizens and permanent residents and puts businesses that only engage workers who hold valid visas at a competitive disadvantage.


A return to the absence of a regulated visa scheme in offshore resources projects also poses potential security risks. In the absence of visa character tests, the government has no information on some of the workers engaged on these offshore projects. By repealing this legislation, this government is returning to a situation that undermines the integrity of Australia's migration framework. It is important that Australia maintains an approach to skilled migration that allows for flexibility to fill gaps in the labour market when there are no Australian workers to do the job.


However, the offshore resources sector is part of Australia's labour market. If there are Australians who are capable of doing the job, they should be employed to do it and under Australian safety standards, Australian wages and Australian conditions. This bill seeks to repeal the conditions and standards that Labor regards as vital to the ongoing success of our offshore resources industry, and it is for these reasons Labor is opposing this bill before the House.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2014-05-26,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (16:18):  I spoke on a similar bill to this when it was brought through the House previously and I am pleased to do so again. In speaking to the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Repeal Bill 2014, I need to make a few preliminary observations and then speak to the core of the bill.


Basically, the bill looks to simplify what was going to become under Labor an extremely complex set of arrangements for those international maritime workers and businesses who sought to help build our nation's capacity in the resources sector for the benefit of all Australians. It seems to have become commonplace for coalition members such as myself to stand here and speak on bills which seek to clean up the mess left by Labor when it relates to migration—and, if I have time, I will go into that later. 


But I say at the outset I have raised this in my own party room and I have raised this in this House before: there is no conflict in my mind as to who should have jobs priority in Australia. It should be Australians. There is no conflict whatsoever. It is nondebatable. But the problem is that every now and again we find a specialised sector of the workforce where Australians do not have the qualifications required. When I have raised the issue previously—and you may recall my raising this, Mr Deputy Speaker—we found there are anomalies. We get the anomaly in a special skills set where you could have a welder, for example, who is quite capable of doing everyday welding and even some specialty welding, but when he is required to do special alloy welding, such as welding under the ocean with special rods, not everybody has that skill set readily available. I am sure that there are Australians that do have that skill, but they are not readily available and on the spot. I have made the point previously that where these shortfalls are occurring, it is the onus of the businesses and, dare I say, the governments of Australia, to make sure that Australians are upskilled so that they can do these jobs. There is not enough compulsion on those wanting to be involved in these sectors to make sure that they are value-adding to their workers so that they can take on specific projects. I make that caveat before I continue and say anything else in relation to this bill.


What needs to be understood in relation to this bill—and the previous speaker, the member for Corio, raised this—was that in May 2012 the Federal Court precipitated this bill because they found that Allseas pipe-laying vessels and noncitizens working on these vessels were not within, or not working within, migration as defined by the Migration Act at the time when laying these pipes. That was an unusual set of circumstances and needed to be clarified and the court ruled that way. 


The Labor Party decided on a legislative response. The decision was in response to the action taken by Allseas against the Labor government after assertions were made that Allseas should be employing deckhands and crews on 457 visas. Normally, the Labor Party is railing against 457 visas, and we have seen the union ads about how terrible 457 visas are. As I said, Australians first—but if you cannot get an Australian you have to get the job done.


The complication with this particular bill is that many of these people never came to the Australian shore. They did not even get to step foot on mainland Australia. They were coming on boats—for example, on transport rigs or pipe-laying boats—that never actually entered the territorial zone of Australian waters. They were in the wider territorial zone, 200 kilometres out. And, dare I say, there is another technicality with people who flew into an international airport, like Broome—I understand that Karratha has the ability too—in that technically, they never actually set foot on Australian soil and they never had to provide a visa. They were picked up from the airport and flown out to the rigs or the barges. So it was an interesting complication and, correctly, it had to be dealt with.


The original offshore resources activity migration bill to change this was rushed through the parliament in the dying days of the Gillard government. This bill was not introduced to meet an urgent and essential concern of the industry or government; it was introduced basically as a favour to their mates in the union, because they were anti anyone who was not a member of the union.


In his dying days as the minister for immigration, the member for Gorton put this bill forward to facilitate a further union power grab on the offshore resources industry. We know that offshore at the moment we have all these demarcation disputes. We have Martin Ferguson, the former resources minister, railing against this big time, that it is un-Australian and it is hurting Australia. And, of course, they have turned on him now. The demarcation dispute is between the AWU, the MUA and the CFMEU. You have all this argy-bargy and trying to muscle in on the territory to make sure that they are all members of their unions. This is what this is about. This is not trying to resolve it; this is about a power grab for their particular union.


Why was it introduced on the 30th by the then Minister O'Connor, the member for Gorton, and not the then soon-to-be minister for immigration, the member for—Chris—




Mr Briggs:
  Bowen. McMahon.




Mr RANDALL:
  The member for McMahon. Why was it not introduced by him? You have to understand the history of somebody who has come to this place with the agenda that the member for Gorton had. We know that when he came to Australia he and most of his family found a home in the union movement.


I do not have any problem with the unions. I think that quite often they are a good idea for collective bargaining and as a way to get better terms and conditions for their workers. But when they become a political force, basically for and on behalf of the Labor Party, then they have to be looked at. I was a union representative myself as a schoolteacher. I was happy to try and get better terms and conditions for my colleagues in the teaching profession. But when that same union started collecting money from both me and my wife, who is a schoolteacher, and decided that they were going to use that money in campaigns against us, I drew the line. Why should we be paying union dues when that money was being used in a campaign waged against us?


This is not what the bill is about; this is about a power grab by the unions to control the offshore resources industry, as I have already said. Obviously, it is about shoring up the member for Gorton's base and those who got him here. We know that his brother, Michael O'Connor, is one of the head CFMEU bosses. He has a lot of influence. That is how you get in here; if you have influence through the unions you get preselected. So it is about paying back debts. This is about throwing international agreements to the four winds around the Arafura and Timor seas, and imposing unnecessary and harsh regulations on the offshore industries that serve us. It is not completely in the best interests of Australia.


In relation to the comments made by the member for Corio, I find it very interesting that he said this visa would not pass the character test. Well, goodness me! Please, Labor Party, do not talk about visas and character tests! We can hark back to those entering who burnt a boat and five people were seriously hurt. Five people were taken to court and convicted, and they still got visas from those opposite! So much for a character test! I will not go into the contentious activity of today too much, other than to say that somebody who is a drug dealer and wants a visa in Australia might not pass the character test either. So they should not lecture us about character tests and visas. There is a whole range of people who should not be allowed to stay in Australia who have been caught in pretty nefarious and illegal activities, and under this lot opposite they are still in Australia. We are going to apply the character test as it should be applied.


The member for Corio also said that this is about safety. Well, good—I am all for safety. But I know, as somebody who has been inducted onto these rigs in the resource areas, that you have to go through a massive induction program before you get on there. This is another thing—and this is one of the reasons why it is difficult for the resources industry to comply with a whole lot of the ambit claims given by these unions—they have to fly the union rep out by helicopter and house him out there. It has been reported that some offshore employees have had to charter special service flights as seats were not available on normal flights because the workers were actually using them. It has resulted in critical expenses that saw an operator have to outlay something like an extra $80,000 to placate the unions and their mates and just get them out on the barge or the platform.


The irony of all this is that when we talk about visas like this, the member for Brand was roundly criticised because he tried to organise 457 visas especially for our resources industry in Western Australia and—who was it?—Paddy Crumlin and the MUA wanted to threaten his preselection. And then there was the former member for Batman, Martin Ferguson, who said that the MUA was threatening all these jobs and that it was going to hurt our resources sector. At the moment we are seeing the MUA threatening to take all the tugboat guys out on strike. They get paid $135,000 just for six months work and the unions want to see them get paid 40 per cent more 40 per cent more and reduce their on-time to 4½ months. That sort of workplace is not sustainable.


The reality of what this ambit claim is in relation to this visa is that if somebody wants to come to this country and operate without coming into our migration zone they should be allowed to be employed by that company. Just put the reverse: if we go and do a fair bit of work in the Middle East in both the oil and gas sectors off Saudi or off the Emirates and we do not go ashore in one of those countries, they do not have unions up there but do we have to belong to their regime? Do we have to get a visa to enter? We do not. You go straight to the job site. This is what we are talking about, so this is sensible legislation.


The Labor Party will oppose it all the way. I point out again, and confirm, that this is no more than a power grab by the unions and the Labor Party in this place looking after their union mates. The Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, went to Western Australia before the last federal election. He said one thing in Western Australia and something else over here. What he said in Western Australia was: 'I want to see unions more like the MUA, because they are more militant. I want to see them raise their head and take on people in an aggressive way.' I will bring the cuttings in next time I speak on one of these bills and table them because I think they are very interesting reading. Yet when he comes back over this side of the country he says, 'No, no, we don't want that sort of militant action from unions,' but he has got the CFMEU, a militant union, and the MUA, a militant union, trying to impose themselves.


This legislation clearly fixes up the mess that the Labor Party would have taken us into—and thank goodness that was rushed through and not proclaimed properly. As a result we are going to make sure that by 1 July this year this sort of legislation is improved so that it does not hurt the Australian resources sector and that it is actually in the best interests of our productivity and the workers in the north-west, not the union bosses in the north-west and their beneficiaries here in Canberra, the members of the Labor Party.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (16:32):  I oppose the passage of the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Repeal Bill 2014. Currently in Australia noncitizens working on offshore resources and installations such as offshore or exploration platforms are required to have a visa that entitles them to work on those platforms and that entitles them to work rights and to be subject to Australian laws. That is the law of Australia: anyone working on an offshore oil platform must have a visa. But noncitizens who are working nearby, in some cases closer to the Australian shore, on vessels that may be laying pipes and are not stationary but moving around from day to day are not required to have a visa and therefore are not subject to Australian laws and work rights. In anyone's book this is completely illogical and inconsistent. That is why the previous Labor government introduced the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Bill last year to clear up the confusion that currently exists between two groups of workers who, for all intents and purposes, are doing similar work in similar zones but with different outcomes.


On 15 October 2012 the former Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen, announced that the government would legislate to clarify the situation around workers in Australia's offshore maritime zones. That clarification was brought about because of confusion that arose because of a Federal Court case, Allseas Construction v the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in 2012. In that case the court found that vessels that were laying pipes offshore in Australia's migration zone and had noncitizens working on them were not within or working within the migration zone as defined by the act. This meant that workers on board those vessels did not require a visa. So you had people who were working within the zone that would ordinarily be accepted as Australia's migration zone, but because the vessels they were working on were not stationary they were not in the migration zone as defined in that decision and therefore Australian laws did not apply.


In the wake of this the Labor government did not act in a knee-jerk manner. We did not rush legislation into the parliament. What did we do? The Labor government undertook a process. The Migration Maritime Task Force, comprising various Department of Immigration and Citizenship experts, was developed to explore options to determine the most appropriate way to ensure that foreign workers in Australia's offshore maritime zones came within the ambit of the act. It was this independent task force that found that any question as to whether a person was in the migration zone or not should not be solely dependent on where the person was physically located but should also be dependent on the sorts of activities the person was conducting. It was acknowledged that there was a need to strike a balance between encouraging investment in Australia's offshore environments and ensuring that Australia's offshore jobs were regulated under Australian laws. This finding was also in line with a longstanding practice of the Labor Party of ensuring that all Australian employment and industries are regulated under Australian law, including those located on the landward side of the outer limits of Australia's territorial sea, in the exclusive economic zone, or in the waters above the continental shelf, which is where this work was being conducted in the Allseas case.


As a result of this research and the extensive consultation with stakeholders, the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Bill was introduced to provide that a person is taken to be in the migration zone while he or she is in an area to participate in, or support, an offshore resources activity in relation to that area. The bill defines offshore resources activity as activity administered under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and the Offshore Minerals Act or under the law of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory, as determined by a minister in writing. The bill sought to bring offshore persons into the migration zone and thereby require them to hold a visa under Australian law. This new, comprehensive framework was designed to ensure that workers in Australia's offshore resources industry are regulated under the act and required to hold specific visas.


Overwhelmingly, I believe that this is a view that is supported by Australians. Individuals who engage in offshore resources activities in Australia's offshore maritime zones should be subject to existing compliance measures in the act that address breaches of work and visa conditions. A specifically tailored visa pathway for offshore resources workers was to be developed, in conjunction with stakeholders, to meet the needs of industry groups. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea gives Australia the jurisdiction to do this, as it provides sovereign rights with respect to the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of Australia's exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf.


In his second reading speech on this particular Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Repeal Bill that is before the House today the minister for immigration, Scott Morrison, spoke of the importance of the offshore resources industry to the Australian economy. He pointed out that it generates $28 billion in revenue and contributes $9 billion in direct taxes to our country. The continued success of the oil and gas industries is indeed vital to the energy needs and economic prosperity of our nation. But this industry is also a great generator of jobs—jobs for Australians—and it is on this issue that Labor differs from a coalition government. It has become painfully obvious that when it comes to jobs this government does not have Australia's best interests at heart. The minister in his speech also alluded to the difficulty of determining with any level of accuracy who is working in the offshore resources industry from overseas, what they are doing and how much they are paid—precisely the requirement for this type of visa category to be introduced in Australia.


We believe there is a principle at stake here. These are jobs which Australians can perform within our territorial waters which should be subject to Australian law, and winding back the Labor government's reforms will reopen a significant gap in Australia's ability to apply decent Australian working conditions to our offshore resources industry and regulate how foreign workers are employed on these valuable national assets.


The absence of a regulated visa scheme in offshore resources projects also poses a security risk. In the absence of a visa character test, the government has no information at all on some of the workers who are performing work on these projects. There is also a safety issue at stake here. The member for Canning pointed out that if you go onto an offshore oil platform you will go through one of the most stringent induction processes and occupational health and safety tests. There is a good reason for that, and it is that Australian occupational health and safety laws apply on those offshore oil resources. Australian workplace laws apply because those resources are subject to Australian law and within our migration zone, and that is the same approach that should be taken to projects such as the laying of pipes in similar circumstances. The inability of the government to regulate foreign workers in Australia's offshore resources industries undermines the integrity of Australia's migration program and visa regime in regulating work entitlements. This can obviously lead to scenarios where this important work is being carried out under conditions and standards that are not up to scratch in comparison with Australian laws and standards.


Just as concerning is the inability to effectively regulate these workers. Opportunities for Australians to gain access to this highly skilled work may be reduced or removed, while putting workers who hold a valid visa at a competitive disadvantage. Labor acknowledges that there is a requirement for 457 visas in certain industries under certain circumstances, but only where it is clearly demonstrated by an employer that Australians do not have the necessary skills or capabilities or are not readily available to perform that work. Only under those circumstances should 457 visas be allowed. The 457 visa program has a valid role to play not just in the migration program but also in the overarching economic framework of labour mobility generally.


Labor accepts the need to strike a balance with the legislation introduced when we were in government in 2013. We believe that strikes the right balance between encouraging investment in Australia's offshore environment and ensuring that Australia's offshore jobs are regulated under Australian laws. That is why workers who are working in these resources projects should be subject to Australia's migration laws. They should hold valid Australian visas and, importantly, they should work under conditions and safety rules which apply to the rest of the Australian workforce. That is why this bill must be voted down.

Ms PRICE
 (Durack) (16:44):  I rise today to speak on one of this government's key repeal bills which, if the act is left in its current form and not revoked, has the ability to significantly hinder Australia's future economic viability, and trade and employment relations, both domestically and on an international scale. The purpose of the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Repeal Bill 2014 is to repeal the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Act 2013, or ORA act as it is more commonly known. The ORA act sought to regulate the employment of noncitizens working in the offshore resources industry by way of a visa arrangement. This is regardless of whether they are actually working on a resources installation or not.


For those in this House who are not aware, the former government introduced these legislative changes in response to a Federal Court decision in May 2012, known as the Allseas case. In this judgment, the Federal Court ruled that noncitizens who work aboard vessels not within the migration zone are not required to hold work visas. This was part of an exemption in the Migration Act where vessels that are not being used for a resources installation are viewed in the act as being outside of the migration zone.


The intention of the ORA act was to remove this exemption with the overall aim to regulate the employment of overseas workers in the offshore resources industry and to impose Australian terms and conditions of employment, or rates of pay, to all noncitizens working in the industry. Noncitizen employees working on installations would therefore be required to hold and comply with a valid visa.


The ORA act was implemented by the former government and received royal assent on 29 June 2013. The operative provisions of this act, however, have not yet commenced—something I am sure industry and my colleagues who understand the former government's true intent for introducing this legislation can all be thankful for.


But let's not beat around the bush: the reality is that the ORA act was nothing more than an attempted power grab by the Labor Party on behalf of their union brothers. It was an attempt to tie our resource projects up in union red tape. We can all sit in this place and tell ourselves that it must be because the former government wanted to increase the number of Australians who work on these offshore resource projects—something I must say I, of course, fully support. Who doesn't? But when you get to the heart of the act, the truth is much simpler. The truth is exactly what we would expect from the former government—the introduction of legislation to this House to give more power to the unions who fund their political party.


While making this power play, those opposite of course did not think about the regulatory impact and additional implementation costs it would have on Australia's offshore resources industry or the significant impact it could potentially have on Australia's international investment and commercial viability. After all, those opposite introduced a mining tax which created these same uncertainties, so we cannot expect much more from the Labor Party.


Labor's only thought is to pander to their union mates, rather than thinking about Australia's economy, the viability of one of our key export industries or our international standing. If this act is not repealed, it will simply lead to duplication in regulation for the offshore resources industry and will hinder Australia's commercial viability for future investments. If the red tape surrounding our industries is considered too much work by international standards, then these investments will simply be made elsewhere. Australia is not the only country with offshore resource activity or minerals.


A key concern of industry groups is that offshore resource companies require highly skilled workers who are often sought globally. This is not because these companies do not want to hire Australian workers but because Australia simply does not have tradesmen and women with these skills, or enough of them. To keep the ORA act in place, we would therefore be forcing industry to adhere to additional visa enforcements for no other benefit than being able to confirm the status of a foreign national in the migration zone.


What needs to be understood is the fact that noncitizens who work on resource installations or who come to the Australian mainland to work are already required to hold visas. Noncitizens must also hold a valid visa to be immigration cleared when they transit through an Australian airport on their way to and from resource installations and vessels. Simply put, all workers entering Australia are still subject to stringent immigration controls—we aren't just letting people waltz into our country without knowing who they are, where they are from and their reason for entering Australia. All the ORA act does is duplicate this process.


It is also important to note that the ORA act would introduce a significant regulatory burden on the offshore resources industry in terms of the cost to comply with the ORA act and the associated visa arrangements. This is despite all indications being that the number of noncitizens working in the industry, who are not currently required to hold visas, is relatively small. One estimate has in fact put the total at approximately 2,000 people per year, with only a proportion of these people being in Australia at any given time, given the prevalence of fly-in fly-out workers in the resources industry.


According to Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration, known as APPEA, the peak national body representing Australia's upstream oil and gas exploration and production industry: 'The oil and gas industry is a major driver of Australia's prosperity. In 2011-12 Australian LNG cargoes earned almost $12 billion in export revenue and put $29.4 billion dollars into the Australian economy.' They also said: 'In the same year, the oil and gas industry also paid more than $8 billion in taxation to governments across Australia. With $200 billion worth of new projects now under construction, the industry's contribution is set to grow substantially, having generated more than 100,000 direct and indirect jobs across the Australian economy in 2013.'


Any legislation that has the potential to stymie investment in Australia's resources industry should therefore be of great concern to all who sit in this chamber, to industry, and to Australian taxpayers. It is of particular concern to me, given that my electorate of Durack accounts for some 85 per cent of Western Australia's resources sector. As many of my colleagues would be aware, Western Australia's resources sector generated the largest contribution to GDP of any state resources sector, at 53 per cent of the national resources industry value added or $89 billion, in 2011-12. What my colleagues on both sides of this house may not be aware of is that the majority of these resource projects are in my electorate of Durack and, in particular, the Pilbara region, which contributed over $22 billion annually or some 75 per cent of total output in 2010-11.


Adjacent to the Durack electorate, we also have a number of offshore resource projects with the companies office headquarters predominantly based in the Pilbara region or in Perth. This includes but is not limited to Chevron's Barrow Island project, Woodside's North West Shelf, Pluto LNG projects, and Apache and BHP projects. Needless to say, these are major resource projects that require highly skilled and competent workers. In turn, it will not—or at least it should not—come as a shock to those in the chamber, that Australia substantially relies on the wealth that is, or will be, generated from these projects. However, it seems that, by implementing this act, those opposite managed to forget these important facts and were instead too focused on the narrow-mindedness of their union mates, who failed to see the big picture. They failed to see how an act such as this can hinder an entire country, all for the small benefit of being able to confirm the status of a foreign national in the migration zone.


On the scale of things, I think Australia's international competitiveness and ensuring that companies with offshore resource projects are able to continue hiring the skilled workers they need to get the job done safely and productively far outweighs the former government's unionist focus on industrial relations laws. Industry has consistently opposed the ORA act, with APPEA in particular highlighting significant economic and safety concerns as a result of the act's implementation by the former government. In their submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the act's repeal, APPEA in fact stated:


In APPEA's view, ORA 2013 has been formulated to service an industrial relations agenda rather than a skills or health, safety or environmental agenda.


Extending Australia's migration zone through ORA 2013 in order to extend industrial relations laws to vessels and workers undertaking highly specialised work for a short time only adds to the regulatory burden applying to offshore construction and operations with no palpable benefit.


It goes on to say:


The industry is truly global in nature and must compete for a limited pool of international investment capital. Investment lost from the Australian oil and gas industry will be redirected to overseas competitors …


Even small delays can add significant costs to industry and, in turn, the Australian economy.


This sentiment was reiterated in submissions by the Australian Mines and Metals Association and, of particular note, in submissions by the Business Council of Australia, the Department of Industry, and in a joint submission by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and the Border Protection Service. In fact, I think the Department of Industry summed up the former government's overall policy strategy—or lack thereof—for the full six years they were in government, in their review of the ORA act: 


The ORA Act has created an unnecessary regulatory burden for the offshore resources sector that is significantly disproportionate to the original policy intent. Its application is unclear and confusing for industry.


Repeal of the ORA Act would support Australia's international competitiveness and encourage investment to maintain the economic benefits of a strong offshore resources sector.


I could not have said it better. The department also felt the need to re-emphasise 'the importance of appropriate consultation with industry on legislative changes that will have implications for them'. Apparently having a chat with the industry about this act was not too high on Labor's agenda. But as we have already established, those opposite were only concerned with how the act could benefit their own coffers and that of the unions they represent, rather than the regulatory burden it would place on such an important industry for Australia's economic prosperity.


When we take a look at the former government's overall strategy throughout the six years they were in government, I think we can safely say that little thought was given to many of their policies. Let us look at the big picture. If those opposite cared about our taxpayers, as they claim, they would not have introduced the carbon tax. If they cared about our resources industry, they would not have introduced a fiscally unstable mining tax that generated little revenue. The fact that they spent predicted revenue from the mining tax before it was generated, let alone in the coffers, apparently was not an issue either. 


The only thing that was generated under the former government was more red tape. That is why, on 26 March, the Abbott government marked a historic occasion when we held our first ever red tape repeal day. This effectively removed over 10,000 pieces and 50,000 pages of legislation and regulation, saving over $700 million in compliance costs. This repeal day was part of the government's overall strategy to cut $1 billion in red and green tape each year to improve productivity, investment and employment opportunities for all Australians.


You see, the comparison is clear: while the former government was focused on creating additional administrative and regulatory costs for pretty much every Australian business or industry across all portfolios, this government is focused on helping industry to grow and ensuring that Australia is best placed to take advantage of international investment opportunities as they arise and without delay. This will create growth and prosperity for our nation, something that Australians regrettably have not seen for the past six years.


 By repealing the ORA act, this government will give the greatest certainty to business and individuals engaged in offshore resources activities. It would ensure that no changes are made to existing arrangements and would provide certainty regarding the relationship between the migration zone and the offshore resources industry, consistent with the Allseas Federal Court ruling. This is critical in a sector that is already facing growing global competition for future investment. Reducing regulatory burdens and scrapping legislation that makes Australia and our key industries internationally uncompetitive, such as the ORA act and the mining tax, is the only way we can achieve this and is something that every member in this place should be fighting for. I commend this bill to the House.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2014-05-26,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (16:58):  I rise to make a few remarks in opposing the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Bill.  Resources in Australia, including in Australia's exclusive economic zone, are there to be used for the benefit of this country, first and foremost. Over many years, when it comes to a lot of those resources, the bulk of the benefits have been flowing overseas. In the mining sector, 83 per cent of the profits flow overseas, largely to institutional shareholders. There are similar problems when it comes to Australia as a country, including Australia's workers, getting a fair share from the resources under our oceans as well. The thing about these resources is you only get to dig them up or extract them and sell them once. Once they are gone, they are gone. You would hope that in the process of doing that, we would ensure that people in Australia, in the Commonwealth of Australia and the states of Australia, receive a fair return. We are finding that that is not happening. We may as well wake up on the other side of this mining and resources boom to find that we are a hollowed out, uneducated quarry. It is not just the profits that have gone overseas but also the profits that have been left here that have been squandered by successive generations of Liberal and Labor governments. Instead of putting the profits away for some day in the future when the rest of the world tells us to stop digging, we have spent and spent and spent, and it will come back and haunt us. 


More than that, there is a real question about whether local workers in Australia are getting a fair share of the benefits from this resources boom. There is a very real risk that we are going to wake up and find that the profits have not been invested in transitioning us to the clean energy society that will set us up well for the 21st century. There is also a very real risk that we will wake up and find that the skills have gone overseas as well—in other words, the once in a generation chance to train up a body of people in the skills needed for construction, manufacturing and maintenance will have passed us by. There have been several attacks on this front. There has been the exploitation and overuse of 457 visas. Our approach here is from this principle: the Greens have no problem in saying that if you cannot find someone locally for a job, you should be able to bring someone in from overseas—we have no problem with that at all—but we do think that you should look locally first. Part of the problem has been that there has been no obligation to look locally first. 


This legislation relates to a decision that a lot of people in this country would be quite stunned about. They probably would not have expected that the practice was happening in the first place or that the existing legislation fixed the problem. The Allseas decision of the Federal Court said this about an offshore resources platform that may be within Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone and may be extracting Australian resources and then sending them off somewhere else, but certainly someone would be making money from them: provided the vessel does not actually connect with that platform and pulls away again, people on that vessel do not need to be covered by Australian wages and conditions. That would come as a shock to very many people, that in Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone they are extracting Australia's resources and they do not have to apply Australian labour law as the minimum standard. 


Legislation to close that loophole was passed through the last parliament which we proudly supported. It simply said that if you are working in Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone extracting Australian resources, you apply Australian labour laws. It should not be that hard. Of course along comes this government and they want to repeal that protection. They want to make it so that when you are extracting Australian resources, it does not matter that there are no locals employed on that project and it does not matter that the people who are employed on the project might be employed on half the wages and conditions that apply under Australian law. They do not care because, as we have heard from the last speaker, all they need to hear is a list of submissions from big business that says, 'We'll make a bit more money if we do it this way,' and that is enough for them. 


This legislation is especially needed in the maritime industry because, by their very nature, ships and resources activity are mobile. This legislation ignores the specifics of this industry. In my experience, certainly before coming to this place but also since then, when I have been representing many Australian workers, especially low-paid workers as well as a number of unions, you hear example after example of local workers turning up to work on ships only to find that there is an existing crew from a country that is not as rich as Australia and are paid less. They find an existing crew already signed up with an existing enterprise agreement. I do not fault the people who are coming here from other countries seeking to better their own lives. But what is happening is that the floor, the minimum set of wages and conditions, is being lowered. Those people should be entitled to Australian minimum wages and conditions as well, and it is not happening. Instead, this government are saying: 'How low can we make the bar? How quickly can we make the floor rot so that there is no longer a uniform set of minimum wages and conditions in Australia?' 


The idea that we can start carving out bits of this country where fewer protections apply is something that previous Labor and Liberal governments have form on when it comes to migration laws. They cannot move quickly enough to say bits of Australia are not Australia and therefore the same human rights standards do not apply. But now we are seeing that same philosophy creeping into our industrial relations laws. If this legislation passes, it will just increase the race to the bottom. People who come here to work will be on substantially lower wages and conditions than what would apply under Australian labour law. That does two things. It puts those people who have come here to work under extraordinary pressure. They will be subject to incredible exploitation and they know they will be able to be flicked back to where they came from if they misbehave. But more than that, it lowers the floor for everyone in this country. If this legislation passes and if you are running an offshore oil or gas platform, why on earth would you employ an Australian resident if you have to pay Australian wages when you can just ship someone in from elsewhere and pay them half as much? That is ultimately what this legislation is about. The government needs to answer to the people whose wages, conditions and jobs it is attacking through this legislation. I have no doubt, as we heard from previous speakers, that there is a long list of big business representatives who want this legislation passed. They will make even more money if this legislation gets passed. But the losers will be not only the people who cannot work on those platforms anymore but all workers here, because the minimum level of wages and conditions in this country will start to drop. That is ultimately what this legislation is about. For that reason we will be opposing it.

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (17:08):  I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Repeal Bill 2014. The purpose of this bill is to repeal the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Act 2013, otherwise known as the ORA act. I rise with my colleagues the member for Canning and the member for Durack to support this repeal of the bill. The ORA act seeks to unduly regulate the employment of noncitizens working in the offshore resources industry by way of a visa arrangement, regardless of whether or not they are actually working on a resource installation. The bill was another example of Labor creating a market for unions. As we have just heard, it was supported also by the Greens.


Amendments were introduced by the previous government, who, because of the unions, went after legitimate businesses operating in Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone. The previous government took to the Federal Court in May 2012 a case that became known as the Allseas case. The Allseas case involved two vessels attaching gas pipelines to the seabed within Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone and the waters of the continental shelf. In its judgement, the Federal Court ruled that noncitizens aboard the two vessels were not within the migration zone and therefore not required to hold work visas. This was due to the fact that, as the offshore resources industry had maintained, both vessels fell within an exemption in the Migration Act that specifically provides that a vessel that is used or is to be used wholly or principally in manoeuvring a resources installation, or in operations relating to the attachment of a resources installation to the Australian seabed, is not a resources installation and therefore not part of the migration zone.


Labor and the unions—and, as we have just heard, the Greens—were not happy with the ruling from the Federal Court, and, despite not having a good understanding of the impact of the bill, they set about amending the Migration Act. At the time this legislation was introduced, it is important to note, the previous government stated that it had an incomplete picture of the number of noncitizens working on board vessels who did not hold visas. Instead of seeking to understand the impact of the legislation, they pushed it through. While it is true that determining a precise number of people who are affected by this regulation is difficult, consultation with the industry and the migration advice profession and across government indicates that the number is actually relatively small. One estimate has put the total at no more than 2,000 per year, while others have put the number at considerably fewer than this. When we compare this with the 68,000 overseas workers who were granted 457 visas during the last financial year, let alone with the number who are granted permanent visas each year under the migration program, it becomes even clearer just how small the number really is.


In undertaking to repeal this particular piece of overly burdensome regulation, it is important to note that the offshore resources industry is vital to the Australian economy. The member for Corio spoke earlier about the prosperity supplied by the mining industry to Australia. If he was that concerned about the prosperity supplied by the mining industry to Australia, he would have made sure that the mining tax and the carbon tax were never introduced, which directly affect the mining industry, particularly in Western Australia. 


Australia is the world's ninth largest energy producer, and the oil and gas industry accounts for 2½ per cent of our GDP, generating $28 billion in revenue and contributing $9 billion in direct tax payments. The development of Australia's offshore resources contributes significantly to the Australian economy and employs thousands of Australians. It is also critical for our future energy security, accounting for 58 per cent of Australia's primary energy needs.


If we are to continue to derive the substantial economic benefits that this industry provides, it must be allowed to remain internationally competitive and be able to operate in line with international best practice. The industry should not be expected to operate under an increased regulatory burden or additional cost pressures that would put the viability of current and future projects at risk. However, the ORA act will do exactly that.


The offshore resources industry is a global industry and it competes for a limited pool of skilled labour. It employs a highly mobile workforce and relies on the capacity to be able to transfer workers with specialist skills from project to project and from country to country. This means that our migration arrangements must be relatively flexible and not impose an undue administrative burden on industry or create unnecessary barriers for overseas workers when they are genuinely needed, especially when their skills are unavailable in Australia. A leading offshore resource industry group has said:


Australian jobs and our overall economic success relies on a confident, growing offshore oil and gas industry able to do business consistent with international laws and practices ... With this much at stake, it is vital that sectional interests do not come before the national interest and that parliament delivers sustainable, proportionate and balanced regulation affecting offshore operations.


The government could not agree more. Hence we are seeking to repeal the union-led extension of the Migration Act.


The issue of Australia's offshore maritime zones is highly complex. In addition to international conventions, the offshore resources industry is subject to complex and overlapping regulatory frameworks imposed by Commonwealth, state and territory legislation. We therefore need to consider any regulatory changes in this context very carefully and to pursue considered and measured policies.


Repealing this legislation does not mean that the industry is or will be in any way unregulated. For example, noncitizens working on a resource installation will still be required to hold valid visas. They will also still be required to hold the appropriate visa if they wish to come to the Australian mainland. Hence, if a particular employer wants to transfer their overseas workers to a project on the mainland, they must hold a visa with an appropriate work condition, such as a 457 visa.


The ORA act also fails to take into account the fact that many persons engaged on resource installations and vessels use fly-in fly-out arrangements and frequently transit through an Australian airport, which requires them to hold a valid visa to be immigration cleared. Hence, many of those persons who are not currently required to hold visas for the work they are doing on a vessel are still subject to immigration controls when they enter or leave Australia.


 To the extent that persons working in Australia's offshore maritime zones are subject to Australian domestic laws, these laws will still be policed and enforced by the appropriate authorities. Terms and conditions of employment, for example, will continue to be protected under domestic law and, where appropriate, under international law through the Maritime Labour Convention. The National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Authority, and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, will continue to ensure the safety of those persons working on board resource installations and vessels operating in Australia's exclusive economic zone and the waters of the continental shelf.


The government is committed to promoting the development of Australia's offshore resources, to adhering to Australia's international obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and to maintaining the integrity of Australia's borders. Repealing the ORA act would remove an unnecessary and disproportionate legislative burden on an industry that is critical to Australia's future economic growth and the wellbeing of all Australians. I commend the bill to the House.

"MacTiernan, Alannah, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (17:16):  I cannot believe what we have heard here today in this debate on the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Repeal Bill 2014. The surrender monkeys of Australian jobs are at it again, falling over themselves one after another to get up here and justify stripping back great opportunities for Australian employment. Let us be very clear about this: this is not an argument against 457 visas. The Labor government legislation, which we are here defending today, protects Australian jobs by saying that if you want to bring in workers to work on our oil and gas installations, you need to establish that there is no Australian who is capable of doing that. Under all of this language that has been used about deregulation, today we have a proposal, saying that we are in fact going to have open slather on our oil and gas industry.


I thought the member for Durack made some quite appalling statements, basically suggesting that Australians did not have the capacity to do these sorts of jobs and therefore we needed to allow people to come in. We are the second biggest exporter of oil and gas around the world. The question has to be asked: why are we not developing this capacity? We should be the centres of excellence, of skill development in oil and gas, not putting up our hands and saying, 'No, we can't do that work; we're going to allow those well-paid jobs to be taken offshore.'


There is a particular stupidity about this proposal that is ignoring a development in this industry, a development which I have been prepared, as has my colleague the member for Brand, to support as the industry moves towards floating LNG platforms. This technology has indeed been of considerable concern to the unions and also to some of my erstwhile colleagues in the state parliament. But, quite frankly, we are taking the pragmatic approach that this appears to be the technology of the future and that we have to go with that technology. But the way in which we ensure that this is viable, that it is a good outcome for the Australian community, is to ensure that the jobs on those LNG platforms are indeed jobs for Australians. This is not insignificant. 


Figures have been quoted today by various members. I think the member for Canning and the member for Durack talked about there not being very many people concerned about this matter and that we are talking of only a couple of thousand jobs and even that is probably at the high end. I put it to you that, firstly, we should be looking very carefully at even a couple of thousand very well-paid jobs and, secondly, we have to be very mindful of the direction in which the industry is going.


I am going to talk a little bit about the scale of the floating LNG industry that is emerging. In Western Australia in particular we are very conscious of this because we are seeing the first project in Australia that will be coming on stream, hopefully in the next couple of years, with the Shell Prelude project off the Kimberley coast.


APPEA projects that investment in floating LNG in Australia could top $65 billion over the next six years. That is a massive industry, which is a complete transformation of the way in which we have done offshore oil and gas in the past. It means that the jobs go offshore and that the vast bulk of the jobs that are associated with the oil and gas industry will be offshore jobs. And now we have the surrender monkeys in here tonight, telling us that we are not even going to require a 457 visa—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The member for Perth will not refer to members opposite as monkeys—




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. Surrender persons—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  and will withdraw the use of—




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw the use of the word 'monkey' and, instead, say we have these surrenderers, these people who do not have the guts to stand up for Australian jobs. Equally frightening, they appear to have no knowledge, although they claim to be representatives from Western Australia, of the very seismic shift that we are seeing in the nature of this industry.


If I could quote David Byers, the CEO of APPEA. He acknowledges that, with this technology, potentially there are fewer jobs for Australians in the construction phase. But he says that more benefits and job growth will come through the operational phase. He makes the point that if we do this right Perth is placed to become a global centre for FLNG development and technology. So we lose out in the construction phase but the gains really come in that operational phase. We have this potential. We are now looking at, first of all, the Prelude facility, for which there has been a final investment decision, so that is going ahead. We have got Woodside now looking at their Browse project. There has also been floating LNG and we hope that there will be a final investment decision on that next year. We know that Exxon and BHP Billiton are looking at FLNG for their Scarborough field. Similarly in the Northern Territory we see in the Bonaparte Gulf they are looking at going down the path of floating LNG. There is a seismic change in this industry, a seismic change that will be profoundly affected by this legislative proposal that we have here before us today.


I would really like to hear a response from the government on where in this new environment this industry is going. How do we then ensure that Australians have an opportunity to compete for these jobs? Not even a 457 visa will be required into the future. We have got this great opportunity as this industry emerges to be right at the forefront of that. We should be developing a centre of excellence for FLNG and I would obviously like to see that in Perth. I believe that we at the same time have to ensure that we are training those people that are going to be the world leaders in the maintenance and the operation of these facilities. That simply will not happen if we lay down the gauntlet and say that we are not going to put any protections on these jobs for Australians. So we have, as I say, a profound ignorance of the direction in which this industry is going and it appears that this legislation may have been developed without any cognisance of that. It certainly will be a great lost opportunity.


I think it will be a very bad outcome for the companies involved, because companies like Shell and Woodside realise that there is a battle that is going on for their technology. Just last week in the state parliament in Western Australia the blue team and the red team combined to put out a report that was highly critical of the move to FLNG, the members of the committee wanting to support Mr Barnett's ill-founded dream of a gas hub at James Price Point. They point to the loss of jobs that will occur by going offshore. But what we have to do and what these companies should be realising that they need to do is go out there and win the hearts and minds of Western Australians and of Australians with this new technology and assure them that there will be these fantastic job opportunities, long-term jobs. These floating platforms have a projected lifespan of around 25-30 years on these gas fields in Australia. These are really stable, long-term jobs that we should be conserving for Australians and making sure that we do what is necessary to skill our workers up to be able to take their rightful place in the oil and gas industry given our ascendancy in this industry worldwide.


But this is not just a problem for the future. I have no shame in saying that I support the unions standing up for Australian jobs; I 100 per cent support the unions standing up for Australian jobs. There are around 500 unemployed seafarers at the moment in Western Australia and I have been told today that Saipan, the Italian company that is subcontracting to Inpex in terms of the laying of the pipes for the pipeline from Western Australia to Darwin, have indicated that they propose, presumably once this legislation is through, to bring in eight foreign vessels to be doing that work, that they will not be employing Australian workers on that job. They will be having foreign crewed vessels laying those pipes from that Inpex project. That is already an immediate loss of Australian jobs. We have seafarers that are trained and skilled, we have got young guys and women doing their training that want that opportunity with that Inpex project, and once this legislation is through those opportunities are going to vanish. 


I just do not know how you justify this. These companies overwhelmingly are owned by overseas interests. One of the ways in which the Australian community gets benefit out of these oil and gas projects is by the creation of these well-paid jobs for Australian workers. That is what has caused Australian workers to get in there and be behind the oil and gas industry. If we see this wholesale employment of overseas workers without even requiring a 457 visa, without even the most rudimentary test being applied to see if there were Australians that can do that job, the oil and gas industry will start losing the support of the Australian community.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2014-05-26,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (17:28):  The bill that is now before us seeks to undo the knee-jerk policy undertaken by the previous government which was, frankly, pandering to special interests that make-or-break every member of this Labor Party from the leader down, and that is the union movement. Once again we have heard from members opposite in speaking to this bill the usual demonisation of skilled migration. I am not sure whether they undertake those same attacks against skilled migrants when they out in the community visiting many different ethnic communities and talking about skilled migration and the way they come in here and vote on skilled migration, but one thing I do know is that skilled migration has been one of the key pillars on which this country is built. It always amazes me that those opposite are always happy to encourage those who are coming the wrong way and do nothing about that but seem to take great issue when people come the right way, particularly when people come and get involved in the economy, contribute to the bottom line of this country and live the whole principle of Australia that those who get a fair go are those who have a go. Those opposite seem to have a real problem with that, and that has been demonstrated again in this bill, as it was when the original act that this bill seeks to repeal was introduced.


The act that this bill seeks now to repeal sprung wholly from the attempts of the previous government to force what I would argue is an anticompetitive regulation upon industry after it discovered that existing legislation did not permit the extension of union power to offshore installations beyond the universally accepted reach of Australia's migration zone. Members opposite talk about unions standing up for the workers—if only they did—but they tend to stand up for union officials, which seems to be their record in this place. In this debate we have seen those attacks and those positions maintained by those opposite.


A previous minister for immigration—and there were quite a few last year; we had three in the space of six months—sought to challenge the long-held convention and impose domestic migration law on workers far outside Australia's migration zone. The influence of the unions on that government was so strong that it bowed to their demands and tied up resource projects, installations and pipelines with union red tape, stifling business and investment. In the case of Allseas Construction SA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship the government were challenged to provide any just reason or justification for their attempt to impose domestic migration regulation upon offshore workers, and they could not do that. In May 2012 the Federal Court ruled that the two vessels in question were not Australian resources installations within the meaning of the Migration Act whilst they were wholly or principally engaged in operations relating to the installation of offshore pipelines. The court ruled that the vessels and the noncitizens working on board these vessels were not within the migration zone and, therefore, were not working within the migration zone as defined by section 5(1) of the act and could not be required to hold visas in order to undertake the work they had been contracted to perform.


Contrary to the claims of the then immigration minister of the previous government, the Allseas litigation did not expose any loophole in Australia's migration system that was being exploited by the industry. There was no loophole. No loophole in fact existed. In this vein the same motivations were glaringly apparent when the previous minister for immigration launched his attack on skilled migration in the 457 visa legislation. The previous Labor government sought, through the offshore resources amendment, to create a problem where there actually was none and to demonise the legitimate employment of highly skilled workers who were beyond the reach of unions and added to the productivity of those projects.


Australia is one of the top 10 energy producers in the world and each year our oil and gas industries make up about 2.5 per cent of GDP. This activity generates nearly $30 billion in revenue every year. Energy producers contribute around $9 billion in direct tax payments and supply 58 per cent of Australia's primary energy needs. At the time when the act that this bill seeks to repeal was introduced into this place the then government could not provide any indication, nor indeed sought to acknowledge in any significant way, the increased costs that the extension of Australia's migration zone must necessarily burden the energy and resources industry with.


Apart from the not insignificant costs attached to formally sponsoring workers, union interests clearly sought to force outrageous wage demands upon the industry. In May last year the maritime workers' union sought to impose wage requirements for cooks working on offshore north-west gas projects of $230,000 a year. How can Australia possibly hope to compete with the rest of the world and attract critical growth industries to projects in our territorial waters if this sort of union driven, anticompetitive and highly interventionist regulation is allowed to be forced on industry with union red tape at the behest of union interests, represented in those who sit opposite? 


Not every worker needed for every energy industry project can be found in Australia. Where they can be, they should be employed. That is what the law is designed to achieve. Much of the work undertaken on offshore installations is highly specialised, requiring someone who has considerable expertise performing very specific tasks. Often the projects of the type being developed off Australia have never been established here before. It is entirely reasonable, therefore, to expect that some portion of the experts required must necessarily be sourced from outside of Australia. An inquiry by the Inspector of Transport Security in 2012 into the offshore oil and gas resources sector security clearly identified the legitimate need for an internationally sourced workforce and found that companies are increasingly recruiting personnel from overseas due to skill shortages in Australia. Forcing industry to wade through unnecessary red tape simply to bring these critical workers to their operations will inevitably slow down productivity and thus the attractiveness of investing in Australia.


When the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee conducted an inquiry into the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Bill last year the key resources industry body—the Australian Mines and Metals Association—offered a very clear warning of the detrimental impact on the continued attraction of foreign investment that the former government's reforms to their recruitment and movement of specialist workers would bring about. Executive Director Mr Scott Barklamb stated:


Australia is not the only place in the world with offshore oil and gas resources. International investors are all too aware of and are in the business of evaluating competing resource destinations. 


Despite the clear significance of the impact of the reforms upon the future growth of the energy and resources sector in Australia, at the time of the introduction of the act that this bill now seeks to repeal the previous government could not even quantify or estimate the number of foreign workers in the offshore maritime zone. So absurd was the entire basis for that act that the previous government could not even show how significant the apparent issue it sought to address was. One would have imagined that any government with even a remote sense of responsibility would have made some effort to determine the nature of the problem before they just willingly accepted the union's proposed solution.


The Federal Court may have found that Australia's migration zone did not extend to certain offshore installations or vessels, but these workplaces hardly operate in a secret vacuum. The offshore resources industry is subject to a plethora of domestic regulatory systems set out in a variety of often overlapping pieces of federal, state and territory legislation. Through these, Australian law provides a wide range of mechanisms that operate to safeguard those who work on board installations or vessels in our waters.


A large proportion of these installations operate under the oversight of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, which has responsibility for the regulation of the occupational health and safety of workers on offshore facilities, wells and well operations in Australian waters and in waters where state powers have been conferred. By law, offshore petroleum activities cannot begin before the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority has assessed and approved a detailed risk management plan, including how an organisation will manage risks to workers' safety and health.


Despite the claims of the maritime workers union and other union interests, no need exists to extend any additional protection or safeguards to workers on offshore installations. The claim simply formed part of a concerted campaign to render it near impossible for the energy and resources industry to employ foreign workers. As I have stated, and many industry specialists have also asserted, this protectionist stance is simply not sustainable. It adds to sovereign risk in relation to investments, it undermines the flow of foreign investment to Australia and places significant hindrances on the efforts of any company to develop offshore installations in Australia's territorial waters and therefore generate revenue and further employment opportunities within Australia.


The Prime Minister has said Australia is open for business, and this bill is consistent with and seeks to demonstrate this objective. The coalition government will support the suite of structures that operate to protect workers, but we will not implement policy to serve the anticompetitive will of special interests, in particular the unions seeking to protect the interests of unions. The bill helps restore the confidence that both industry and the Australian people can have in our nation's future growth and opportunities in this sector. I commend the bill to the House.

"Marles, Richard, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Mr MARLES
 (Corio) (16:11):  I rise to oppose the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Repeal Bill 2014. This bill seeks to repeal the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Act that was introduced by the Labor government only last year—2013.


The resources sector is an enormous part of Australia's prosperity. According to the Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics, at the end of October 2013 there were 63 projects at the committed stage, representing a combined value of $240 billion. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, there are 273,000 people employed in mining, oil and gas projects. So, given the size of this industry, it is essential that any move to regulate the environment that this industry operates within is done carefully. Firstly, regulation must take into account the safety and conditions of the persons working on these projects. Secondly, regulation must take into account the unique contribution that this industry makes to the Australian economy through the creation of jobs, trade and export value.


The Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Act 2013, introduced by the then Labor government, sought to clarify the status of persons working in offshore marine zones, in response to the case Allseas Construction SA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2012]. It is also known as the Allseas case. In Allseas, the Federal Court found that pipe-laying vessels and noncitizens working on those vessels were not within or working within the migration zone as defined under section 5 of the Migration Act 1958. This meant that workers on board those vessels did not require a visa. 


The then Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen, announced that the government would legislate to amend the Migration Act 1958 and clarify the situation regarding workers in Australia's offshore maritime zones by expanding the scope of the migration zone. The department then commenced a review and established the Migration Maritime Taskforce to inform the best way to address the situation. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee also examined the bill then, noting that it complied with Australia's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and recommended that it be passed. During each of these processes, extensive stakeholder engagement was conducted.


It is important to note that Labor's act is not due to commence until 30 June this year. This was to allow adequate time for further facilitation and stakeholder engagement regarding the specifically tailored visa pathway for offshore resource workers that was to be developed and was prescribed in the Migration Regulations 1994. Primarily, Labor's act sought to ensure that persons who participate in or support an 'offshore resources activity' are deemed to be in the migration zone, thereby requiring all noncitizens engaged in offshore resources activities to hold either a specific or permanent visa. At the time it was acknowledged that there was a need to strike a balance between encouraging investment in our offshore environments and the need to ensure that Australia's offshore jobs are regulated under Australian laws.


Labor's position on this has not changed. It is critical that Australia maintains a healthy investment environment in its offshore projects. This will not only make sure that the industry has ongoing viability, but also ensures that we maximise the capacity of these projects to employ the right people with the right skills. Winding back the Labor government's reforms will re-open a significant loophole in Australia's ability to regulate the conditions of our offshore resources industry and to regulate the workers who are employed on these valuable national assets. This could lead to situations where those working on these projects are working under conditions that do not adhere to Australian standards. This in turn reduces work opportunities for Australian citizens and permanent residents and puts businesses that only engage workers who hold valid visas at a competitive disadvantage.


A return to the absence of a regulated visa scheme in offshore resources projects also poses potential security risks. In the absence of visa character tests, the government has no information on some of the workers engaged on these offshore projects. By repealing this legislation, this government is returning to a situation that undermines the integrity of Australia's migration framework. It is important that Australia maintains an approach to skilled migration that allows for flexibility to fill gaps in the labour market when there are no Australian workers to do the job.


However, the offshore resources sector is part of Australia's labour market. If there are Australians who are capable of doing the job, they should be employed to do it and under Australian safety standards, Australian wages and Australian conditions. This bill seeks to repeal the conditions and standards that Labor regards as vital to the ongoing success of our offshore resources industry, and it is for these reasons Labor is opposing this bill before the House.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2014-05-26,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (16:18):  I spoke on a similar bill to this when it was brought through the House previously and I am pleased to do so again. In speaking to the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Repeal Bill 2014, I need to make a few preliminary observations and then speak to the core of the bill.


Basically, the bill looks to simplify what was going to become under Labor an extremely complex set of arrangements for those international maritime workers and businesses who sought to help build our nation's capacity in the resources sector for the benefit of all Australians. It seems to have become commonplace for coalition members such as myself to stand here and speak on bills which seek to clean up the mess left by Labor when it relates to migration—and, if I have time, I will go into that later. 


But I say at the outset I have raised this in my own party room and I have raised this in this House before: there is no conflict in my mind as to who should have jobs priority in Australia. It should be Australians. There is no conflict whatsoever. It is nondebatable. But the problem is that every now and again we find a specialised sector of the workforce where Australians do not have the qualifications required. When I have raised the issue previously—and you may recall my raising this, Mr Deputy Speaker—we found there are anomalies. We get the anomaly in a special skills set where you could have a welder, for example, who is quite capable of doing everyday welding and even some specialty welding, but when he is required to do special alloy welding, such as welding under the ocean with special rods, not everybody has that skill set readily available. I am sure that there are Australians that do have that skill, but they are not readily available and on the spot. I have made the point previously that where these shortfalls are occurring, it is the onus of the businesses and, dare I say, the governments of Australia, to make sure that Australians are upskilled so that they can do these jobs. There is not enough compulsion on those wanting to be involved in these sectors to make sure that they are value-adding to their workers so that they can take on specific projects. I make that caveat before I continue and say anything else in relation to this bill.


What needs to be understood in relation to this bill—and the previous speaker, the member for Corio, raised this—was that in May 2012 the Federal Court precipitated this bill because they found that Allseas pipe-laying vessels and noncitizens working on these vessels were not within, or not working within, migration as defined by the Migration Act at the time when laying these pipes. That was an unusual set of circumstances and needed to be clarified and the court ruled that way. 


The Labor Party decided on a legislative response. The decision was in response to the action taken by Allseas against the Labor government after assertions were made that Allseas should be employing deckhands and crews on 457 visas. Normally, the Labor Party is railing against 457 visas, and we have seen the union ads about how terrible 457 visas are. As I said, Australians first—but if you cannot get an Australian you have to get the job done.


The complication with this particular bill is that many of these people never came to the Australian shore. They did not even get to step foot on mainland Australia. They were coming on boats—for example, on transport rigs or pipe-laying boats—that never actually entered the territorial zone of Australian waters. They were in the wider territorial zone, 200 kilometres out. And, dare I say, there is another technicality with people who flew into an international airport, like Broome—I understand that Karratha has the ability too—in that technically, they never actually set foot on Australian soil and they never had to provide a visa. They were picked up from the airport and flown out to the rigs or the barges. So it was an interesting complication and, correctly, it had to be dealt with.


The original offshore resources activity migration bill to change this was rushed through the parliament in the dying days of the Gillard government. This bill was not introduced to meet an urgent and essential concern of the industry or government; it was introduced basically as a favour to their mates in the union, because they were anti anyone who was not a member of the union.


In his dying days as the minister for immigration, the member for Gorton put this bill forward to facilitate a further union power grab on the offshore resources industry. We know that offshore at the moment we have all these demarcation disputes. We have Martin Ferguson, the former resources minister, railing against this big time, that it is un-Australian and it is hurting Australia. And, of course, they have turned on him now. The demarcation dispute is between the AWU, the MUA and the CFMEU. You have all this argy-bargy and trying to muscle in on the territory to make sure that they are all members of their unions. This is what this is about. This is not trying to resolve it; this is about a power grab for their particular union.


Why was it introduced on the 30th by the then Minister O'Connor, the member for Gorton, and not the then soon-to-be minister for immigration, the member for—Chris—




Mr Briggs:
  Bowen. McMahon.




Mr RANDALL:
  The member for McMahon. Why was it not introduced by him? You have to understand the history of somebody who has come to this place with the agenda that the member for Gorton had. We know that when he came to Australia he and most of his family found a home in the union movement.


I do not have any problem with the unions. I think that quite often they are a good idea for collective bargaining and as a way to get better terms and conditions for their workers. But when they become a political force, basically for and on behalf of the Labor Party, then they have to be looked at. I was a union representative myself as a schoolteacher. I was happy to try and get better terms and conditions for my colleagues in the teaching profession. But when that same union started collecting money from both me and my wife, who is a schoolteacher, and decided that they were going to use that money in campaigns against us, I drew the line. Why should we be paying union dues when that money was being used in a campaign waged against us?


This is not what the bill is about; this is about a power grab by the unions to control the offshore resources industry, as I have already said. Obviously, it is about shoring up the member for Gorton's base and those who got him here. We know that his brother, Michael O'Connor, is one of the head CFMEU bosses. He has a lot of influence. That is how you get in here; if you have influence through the unions you get preselected. So it is about paying back debts. This is about throwing international agreements to the four winds around the Arafura and Timor seas, and imposing unnecessary and harsh regulations on the offshore industries that serve us. It is not completely in the best interests of Australia.


In relation to the comments made by the member for Corio, I find it very interesting that he said this visa would not pass the character test. Well, goodness me! Please, Labor Party, do not talk about visas and character tests! We can hark back to those entering who burnt a boat and five people were seriously hurt. Five people were taken to court and convicted, and they still got visas from those opposite! So much for a character test! I will not go into the contentious activity of today too much, other than to say that somebody who is a drug dealer and wants a visa in Australia might not pass the character test either. So they should not lecture us about character tests and visas. There is a whole range of people who should not be allowed to stay in Australia who have been caught in pretty nefarious and illegal activities, and under this lot opposite they are still in Australia. We are going to apply the character test as it should be applied.


The member for Corio also said that this is about safety. Well, good—I am all for safety. But I know, as somebody who has been inducted onto these rigs in the resource areas, that you have to go through a massive induction program before you get on there. This is another thing—and this is one of the reasons why it is difficult for the resources industry to comply with a whole lot of the ambit claims given by these unions—they have to fly the union rep out by helicopter and house him out there. It has been reported that some offshore employees have had to charter special service flights as seats were not available on normal flights because the workers were actually using them. It has resulted in critical expenses that saw an operator have to outlay something like an extra $80,000 to placate the unions and their mates and just get them out on the barge or the platform.


The irony of all this is that when we talk about visas like this, the member for Brand was roundly criticised because he tried to organise 457 visas especially for our resources industry in Western Australia and—who was it?—Paddy Crumlin and the MUA wanted to threaten his preselection. And then there was the former member for Batman, Martin Ferguson, who said that the MUA was threatening all these jobs and that it was going to hurt our resources sector. At the moment we are seeing the MUA threatening to take all the tugboat guys out on strike. They get paid $135,000 just for six months work and the unions want to see them get paid 40 per cent more 40 per cent more and reduce their on-time to 4½ months. That sort of workplace is not sustainable.


The reality of what this ambit claim is in relation to this visa is that if somebody wants to come to this country and operate without coming into our migration zone they should be allowed to be employed by that company. Just put the reverse: if we go and do a fair bit of work in the Middle East in both the oil and gas sectors off Saudi or off the Emirates and we do not go ashore in one of those countries, they do not have unions up there but do we have to belong to their regime? Do we have to get a visa to enter? We do not. You go straight to the job site. This is what we are talking about, so this is sensible legislation.


The Labor Party will oppose it all the way. I point out again, and confirm, that this is no more than a power grab by the unions and the Labor Party in this place looking after their union mates. The Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, went to Western Australia before the last federal election. He said one thing in Western Australia and something else over here. What he said in Western Australia was: 'I want to see unions more like the MUA, because they are more militant. I want to see them raise their head and take on people in an aggressive way.' I will bring the cuttings in next time I speak on one of these bills and table them because I think they are very interesting reading. Yet when he comes back over this side of the country he says, 'No, no, we don't want that sort of militant action from unions,' but he has got the CFMEU, a militant union, and the MUA, a militant union, trying to impose themselves.


This legislation clearly fixes up the mess that the Labor Party would have taken us into—and thank goodness that was rushed through and not proclaimed properly. As a result we are going to make sure that by 1 July this year this sort of legislation is improved so that it does not hurt the Australian resources sector and that it is actually in the best interests of our productivity and the workers in the north-west, not the union bosses in the north-west and their beneficiaries here in Canberra, the members of the Labor Party.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (16:32):  I oppose the passage of the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Repeal Bill 2014. Currently in Australia noncitizens working on offshore resources and installations such as offshore or exploration platforms are required to have a visa that entitles them to work on those platforms and that entitles them to work rights and to be subject to Australian laws. That is the law of Australia: anyone working on an offshore oil platform must have a visa. But noncitizens who are working nearby, in some cases closer to the Australian shore, on vessels that may be laying pipes and are not stationary but moving around from day to day are not required to have a visa and therefore are not subject to Australian laws and work rights. In anyone's book this is completely illogical and inconsistent. That is why the previous Labor government introduced the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Bill last year to clear up the confusion that currently exists between two groups of workers who, for all intents and purposes, are doing similar work in similar zones but with different outcomes.


On 15 October 2012 the former Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen, announced that the government would legislate to clarify the situation around workers in Australia's offshore maritime zones. That clarification was brought about because of confusion that arose because of a Federal Court case, Allseas Construction v the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in 2012. In that case the court found that vessels that were laying pipes offshore in Australia's migration zone and had noncitizens working on them were not within or working within the migration zone as defined by the act. This meant that workers on board those vessels did not require a visa. So you had people who were working within the zone that would ordinarily be accepted as Australia's migration zone, but because the vessels they were working on were not stationary they were not in the migration zone as defined in that decision and therefore Australian laws did not apply.


In the wake of this the Labor government did not act in a knee-jerk manner. We did not rush legislation into the parliament. What did we do? The Labor government undertook a process. The Migration Maritime Task Force, comprising various Department of Immigration and Citizenship experts, was developed to explore options to determine the most appropriate way to ensure that foreign workers in Australia's offshore maritime zones came within the ambit of the act. It was this independent task force that found that any question as to whether a person was in the migration zone or not should not be solely dependent on where the person was physically located but should also be dependent on the sorts of activities the person was conducting. It was acknowledged that there was a need to strike a balance between encouraging investment in Australia's offshore environments and ensuring that Australia's offshore jobs were regulated under Australian laws. This finding was also in line with a longstanding practice of the Labor Party of ensuring that all Australian employment and industries are regulated under Australian law, including those located on the landward side of the outer limits of Australia's territorial sea, in the exclusive economic zone, or in the waters above the continental shelf, which is where this work was being conducted in the Allseas case.


As a result of this research and the extensive consultation with stakeholders, the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Bill was introduced to provide that a person is taken to be in the migration zone while he or she is in an area to participate in, or support, an offshore resources activity in relation to that area. The bill defines offshore resources activity as activity administered under the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 and the Offshore Minerals Act or under the law of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory, as determined by a minister in writing. The bill sought to bring offshore persons into the migration zone and thereby require them to hold a visa under Australian law. This new, comprehensive framework was designed to ensure that workers in Australia's offshore resources industry are regulated under the act and required to hold specific visas.


Overwhelmingly, I believe that this is a view that is supported by Australians. Individuals who engage in offshore resources activities in Australia's offshore maritime zones should be subject to existing compliance measures in the act that address breaches of work and visa conditions. A specifically tailored visa pathway for offshore resources workers was to be developed, in conjunction with stakeholders, to meet the needs of industry groups. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea gives Australia the jurisdiction to do this, as it provides sovereign rights with respect to the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of Australia's exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf.


In his second reading speech on this particular Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Repeal Bill that is before the House today the minister for immigration, Scott Morrison, spoke of the importance of the offshore resources industry to the Australian economy. He pointed out that it generates $28 billion in revenue and contributes $9 billion in direct taxes to our country. The continued success of the oil and gas industries is indeed vital to the energy needs and economic prosperity of our nation. But this industry is also a great generator of jobs—jobs for Australians—and it is on this issue that Labor differs from a coalition government. It has become painfully obvious that when it comes to jobs this government does not have Australia's best interests at heart. The minister in his speech also alluded to the difficulty of determining with any level of accuracy who is working in the offshore resources industry from overseas, what they are doing and how much they are paid—precisely the requirement for this type of visa category to be introduced in Australia.


We believe there is a principle at stake here. These are jobs which Australians can perform within our territorial waters which should be subject to Australian law, and winding back the Labor government's reforms will reopen a significant gap in Australia's ability to apply decent Australian working conditions to our offshore resources industry and regulate how foreign workers are employed on these valuable national assets.


The absence of a regulated visa scheme in offshore resources projects also poses a security risk. In the absence of a visa character test, the government has no information at all on some of the workers who are performing work on these projects. There is also a safety issue at stake here. The member for Canning pointed out that if you go onto an offshore oil platform you will go through one of the most stringent induction processes and occupational health and safety tests. There is a good reason for that, and it is that Australian occupational health and safety laws apply on those offshore oil resources. Australian workplace laws apply because those resources are subject to Australian law and within our migration zone, and that is the same approach that should be taken to projects such as the laying of pipes in similar circumstances. The inability of the government to regulate foreign workers in Australia's offshore resources industries undermines the integrity of Australia's migration program and visa regime in regulating work entitlements. This can obviously lead to scenarios where this important work is being carried out under conditions and standards that are not up to scratch in comparison with Australian laws and standards.


Just as concerning is the inability to effectively regulate these workers. Opportunities for Australians to gain access to this highly skilled work may be reduced or removed, while putting workers who hold a valid visa at a competitive disadvantage. Labor acknowledges that there is a requirement for 457 visas in certain industries under certain circumstances, but only where it is clearly demonstrated by an employer that Australians do not have the necessary skills or capabilities or are not readily available to perform that work. Only under those circumstances should 457 visas be allowed. The 457 visa program has a valid role to play not just in the migration program but also in the overarching economic framework of labour mobility generally.


Labor accepts the need to strike a balance with the legislation introduced when we were in government in 2013. We believe that strikes the right balance between encouraging investment in Australia's offshore environment and ensuring that Australia's offshore jobs are regulated under Australian laws. That is why workers who are working in these resources projects should be subject to Australia's migration laws. They should hold valid Australian visas and, importantly, they should work under conditions and safety rules which apply to the rest of the Australian workforce. That is why this bill must be voted down.

"Price, Melissa, MP",LP,2014-05-26,"



Ms PRICE
 (Durack) (16:44):  I rise today to speak on one of this government's key repeal bills which, if the act is left in its current form and not revoked, has the ability to significantly hinder Australia's future economic viability, and trade and employment relations, both domestically and on an international scale. The purpose of the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Repeal Bill 2014 is to repeal the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Act 2013, or ORA act as it is more commonly known. The ORA act sought to regulate the employment of noncitizens working in the offshore resources industry by way of a visa arrangement. This is regardless of whether they are actually working on a resources installation or not.


For those in this House who are not aware, the former government introduced these legislative changes in response to a Federal Court decision in May 2012, known as the Allseas case. In this judgment, the Federal Court ruled that noncitizens who work aboard vessels not within the migration zone are not required to hold work visas. This was part of an exemption in the Migration Act where vessels that are not being used for a resources installation are viewed in the act as being outside of the migration zone.


The intention of the ORA act was to remove this exemption with the overall aim to regulate the employment of overseas workers in the offshore resources industry and to impose Australian terms and conditions of employment, or rates of pay, to all noncitizens working in the industry. Noncitizen employees working on installations would therefore be required to hold and comply with a valid visa.


The ORA act was implemented by the former government and received royal assent on 29 June 2013. The operative provisions of this act, however, have not yet commenced—something I am sure industry and my colleagues who understand the former government's true intent for introducing this legislation can all be thankful for.


But let's not beat around the bush: the reality is that the ORA act was nothing more than an attempted power grab by the Labor Party on behalf of their union brothers. It was an attempt to tie our resource projects up in union red tape. We can all sit in this place and tell ourselves that it must be because the former government wanted to increase the number of Australians who work on these offshore resource projects—something I must say I, of course, fully support. Who doesn't? But when you get to the heart of the act, the truth is much simpler. The truth is exactly what we would expect from the former government—the introduction of legislation to this House to give more power to the unions who fund their political party.


While making this power play, those opposite of course did not think about the regulatory impact and additional implementation costs it would have on Australia's offshore resources industry or the significant impact it could potentially have on Australia's international investment and commercial viability. After all, those opposite introduced a mining tax which created these same uncertainties, so we cannot expect much more from the Labor Party.


Labor's only thought is to pander to their union mates, rather than thinking about Australia's economy, the viability of one of our key export industries or our international standing. If this act is not repealed, it will simply lead to duplication in regulation for the offshore resources industry and will hinder Australia's commercial viability for future investments. If the red tape surrounding our industries is considered too much work by international standards, then these investments will simply be made elsewhere. Australia is not the only country with offshore resource activity or minerals.


A key concern of industry groups is that offshore resource companies require highly skilled workers who are often sought globally. This is not because these companies do not want to hire Australian workers but because Australia simply does not have tradesmen and women with these skills, or enough of them. To keep the ORA act in place, we would therefore be forcing industry to adhere to additional visa enforcements for no other benefit than being able to confirm the status of a foreign national in the migration zone.


What needs to be understood is the fact that noncitizens who work on resource installations or who come to the Australian mainland to work are already required to hold visas. Noncitizens must also hold a valid visa to be immigration cleared when they transit through an Australian airport on their way to and from resource installations and vessels. Simply put, all workers entering Australia are still subject to stringent immigration controls—we aren't just letting people waltz into our country without knowing who they are, where they are from and their reason for entering Australia. All the ORA act does is duplicate this process.


It is also important to note that the ORA act would introduce a significant regulatory burden on the offshore resources industry in terms of the cost to comply with the ORA act and the associated visa arrangements. This is despite all indications being that the number of noncitizens working in the industry, who are not currently required to hold visas, is relatively small. One estimate has in fact put the total at approximately 2,000 people per year, with only a proportion of these people being in Australia at any given time, given the prevalence of fly-in fly-out workers in the resources industry.


According to Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration, known as APPEA, the peak national body representing Australia's upstream oil and gas exploration and production industry: 'The oil and gas industry is a major driver of Australia's prosperity. In 2011-12 Australian LNG cargoes earned almost $12 billion in export revenue and put $29.4 billion dollars into the Australian economy.' They also said: 'In the same year, the oil and gas industry also paid more than $8 billion in taxation to governments across Australia. With $200 billion worth of new projects now under construction, the industry's contribution is set to grow substantially, having generated more than 100,000 direct and indirect jobs across the Australian economy in 2013.'


Any legislation that has the potential to stymie investment in Australia's resources industry should therefore be of great concern to all who sit in this chamber, to industry, and to Australian taxpayers. It is of particular concern to me, given that my electorate of Durack accounts for some 85 per cent of Western Australia's resources sector. As many of my colleagues would be aware, Western Australia's resources sector generated the largest contribution to GDP of any state resources sector, at 53 per cent of the national resources industry value added or $89 billion, in 2011-12. What my colleagues on both sides of this house may not be aware of is that the majority of these resource projects are in my electorate of Durack and, in particular, the Pilbara region, which contributed over $22 billion annually or some 75 per cent of total output in 2010-11.


Adjacent to the Durack electorate, we also have a number of offshore resource projects with the companies office headquarters predominantly based in the Pilbara region or in Perth. This includes but is not limited to Chevron's Barrow Island project, Woodside's North West Shelf, Pluto LNG projects, and Apache and BHP projects. Needless to say, these are major resource projects that require highly skilled and competent workers. In turn, it will not—or at least it should not—come as a shock to those in the chamber, that Australia substantially relies on the wealth that is, or will be, generated from these projects. However, it seems that, by implementing this act, those opposite managed to forget these important facts and were instead too focused on the narrow-mindedness of their union mates, who failed to see the big picture. They failed to see how an act such as this can hinder an entire country, all for the small benefit of being able to confirm the status of a foreign national in the migration zone.


On the scale of things, I think Australia's international competitiveness and ensuring that companies with offshore resource projects are able to continue hiring the skilled workers they need to get the job done safely and productively far outweighs the former government's unionist focus on industrial relations laws. Industry has consistently opposed the ORA act, with APPEA in particular highlighting significant economic and safety concerns as a result of the act's implementation by the former government. In their submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the act's repeal, APPEA in fact stated:


In APPEA's view, ORA 2013 has been formulated to service an industrial relations agenda rather than a skills or health, safety or environmental agenda.


Extending Australia's migration zone through ORA 2013 in order to extend industrial relations laws to vessels and workers undertaking highly specialised work for a short time only adds to the regulatory burden applying to offshore construction and operations with no palpable benefit.


It goes on to say:


The industry is truly global in nature and must compete for a limited pool of international investment capital. Investment lost from the Australian oil and gas industry will be redirected to overseas competitors …


Even small delays can add significant costs to industry and, in turn, the Australian economy.


This sentiment was reiterated in submissions by the Australian Mines and Metals Association and, of particular note, in submissions by the Business Council of Australia, the Department of Industry, and in a joint submission by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and the Border Protection Service. In fact, I think the Department of Industry summed up the former government's overall policy strategy—or lack thereof—for the full six years they were in government, in their review of the ORA act: 


The ORA Act has created an unnecessary regulatory burden for the offshore resources sector that is significantly disproportionate to the original policy intent. Its application is unclear and confusing for industry.


Repeal of the ORA Act would support Australia's international competitiveness and encourage investment to maintain the economic benefits of a strong offshore resources sector.


I could not have said it better. The department also felt the need to re-emphasise 'the importance of appropriate consultation with industry on legislative changes that will have implications for them'. Apparently having a chat with the industry about this act was not too high on Labor's agenda. But as we have already established, those opposite were only concerned with how the act could benefit their own coffers and that of the unions they represent, rather than the regulatory burden it would place on such an important industry for Australia's economic prosperity.


When we take a look at the former government's overall strategy throughout the six years they were in government, I think we can safely say that little thought was given to many of their policies. Let us look at the big picture. If those opposite cared about our taxpayers, as they claim, they would not have introduced the carbon tax. If they cared about our resources industry, they would not have introduced a fiscally unstable mining tax that generated little revenue. The fact that they spent predicted revenue from the mining tax before it was generated, let alone in the coffers, apparently was not an issue either. 


The only thing that was generated under the former government was more red tape. That is why, on 26 March, the Abbott government marked a historic occasion when we held our first ever red tape repeal day. This effectively removed over 10,000 pieces and 50,000 pages of legislation and regulation, saving over $700 million in compliance costs. This repeal day was part of the government's overall strategy to cut $1 billion in red and green tape each year to improve productivity, investment and employment opportunities for all Australians.


You see, the comparison is clear: while the former government was focused on creating additional administrative and regulatory costs for pretty much every Australian business or industry across all portfolios, this government is focused on helping industry to grow and ensuring that Australia is best placed to take advantage of international investment opportunities as they arise and without delay. This will create growth and prosperity for our nation, something that Australians regrettably have not seen for the past six years.


 By repealing the ORA act, this government will give the greatest certainty to business and individuals engaged in offshore resources activities. It would ensure that no changes are made to existing arrangements and would provide certainty regarding the relationship between the migration zone and the offshore resources industry, consistent with the Allseas Federal Court ruling. This is critical in a sector that is already facing growing global competition for future investment. Reducing regulatory burdens and scrapping legislation that makes Australia and our key industries internationally uncompetitive, such as the ORA act and the mining tax, is the only way we can achieve this and is something that every member in this place should be fighting for. I commend this bill to the House.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2014-05-26,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (16:58):  I rise to make a few remarks in opposing the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Bill.  Resources in Australia, including in Australia's exclusive economic zone, are there to be used for the benefit of this country, first and foremost. Over many years, when it comes to a lot of those resources, the bulk of the benefits have been flowing overseas. In the mining sector, 83 per cent of the profits flow overseas, largely to institutional shareholders. There are similar problems when it comes to Australia as a country, including Australia's workers, getting a fair share from the resources under our oceans as well. The thing about these resources is you only get to dig them up or extract them and sell them once. Once they are gone, they are gone. You would hope that in the process of doing that, we would ensure that people in Australia, in the Commonwealth of Australia and the states of Australia, receive a fair return. We are finding that that is not happening. We may as well wake up on the other side of this mining and resources boom to find that we are a hollowed out, uneducated quarry. It is not just the profits that have gone overseas but also the profits that have been left here that have been squandered by successive generations of Liberal and Labor governments. Instead of putting the profits away for some day in the future when the rest of the world tells us to stop digging, we have spent and spent and spent, and it will come back and haunt us. 


More than that, there is a real question about whether local workers in Australia are getting a fair share of the benefits from this resources boom. There is a very real risk that we are going to wake up and find that the profits have not been invested in transitioning us to the clean energy society that will set us up well for the 21st century. There is also a very real risk that we will wake up and find that the skills have gone overseas as well—in other words, the once in a generation chance to train up a body of people in the skills needed for construction, manufacturing and maintenance will have passed us by. There have been several attacks on this front. There has been the exploitation and overuse of 457 visas. Our approach here is from this principle: the Greens have no problem in saying that if you cannot find someone locally for a job, you should be able to bring someone in from overseas—we have no problem with that at all—but we do think that you should look locally first. Part of the problem has been that there has been no obligation to look locally first. 


This legislation relates to a decision that a lot of people in this country would be quite stunned about. They probably would not have expected that the practice was happening in the first place or that the existing legislation fixed the problem. The Allseas decision of the Federal Court said this about an offshore resources platform that may be within Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone and may be extracting Australian resources and then sending them off somewhere else, but certainly someone would be making money from them: provided the vessel does not actually connect with that platform and pulls away again, people on that vessel do not need to be covered by Australian wages and conditions. That would come as a shock to very many people, that in Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone they are extracting Australia's resources and they do not have to apply Australian labour law as the minimum standard. 


Legislation to close that loophole was passed through the last parliament which we proudly supported. It simply said that if you are working in Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone extracting Australian resources, you apply Australian labour laws. It should not be that hard. Of course along comes this government and they want to repeal that protection. They want to make it so that when you are extracting Australian resources, it does not matter that there are no locals employed on that project and it does not matter that the people who are employed on the project might be employed on half the wages and conditions that apply under Australian law. They do not care because, as we have heard from the last speaker, all they need to hear is a list of submissions from big business that says, 'We'll make a bit more money if we do it this way,' and that is enough for them. 


This legislation is especially needed in the maritime industry because, by their very nature, ships and resources activity are mobile. This legislation ignores the specifics of this industry. In my experience, certainly before coming to this place but also since then, when I have been representing many Australian workers, especially low-paid workers as well as a number of unions, you hear example after example of local workers turning up to work on ships only to find that there is an existing crew from a country that is not as rich as Australia and are paid less. They find an existing crew already signed up with an existing enterprise agreement. I do not fault the people who are coming here from other countries seeking to better their own lives. But what is happening is that the floor, the minimum set of wages and conditions, is being lowered. Those people should be entitled to Australian minimum wages and conditions as well, and it is not happening. Instead, this government are saying: 'How low can we make the bar? How quickly can we make the floor rot so that there is no longer a uniform set of minimum wages and conditions in Australia?' 


The idea that we can start carving out bits of this country where fewer protections apply is something that previous Labor and Liberal governments have form on when it comes to migration laws. They cannot move quickly enough to say bits of Australia are not Australia and therefore the same human rights standards do not apply. But now we are seeing that same philosophy creeping into our industrial relations laws. If this legislation passes, it will just increase the race to the bottom. People who come here to work will be on substantially lower wages and conditions than what would apply under Australian labour law. That does two things. It puts those people who have come here to work under extraordinary pressure. They will be subject to incredible exploitation and they know they will be able to be flicked back to where they came from if they misbehave. But more than that, it lowers the floor for everyone in this country. If this legislation passes and if you are running an offshore oil or gas platform, why on earth would you employ an Australian resident if you have to pay Australian wages when you can just ship someone in from elsewhere and pay them half as much? That is ultimately what this legislation is about. The government needs to answer to the people whose wages, conditions and jobs it is attacking through this legislation. I have no doubt, as we heard from previous speakers, that there is a long list of big business representatives who want this legislation passed. They will make even more money if this legislation gets passed. But the losers will be not only the people who cannot work on those platforms anymore but all workers here, because the minimum level of wages and conditions in this country will start to drop. That is ultimately what this legislation is about. For that reason we will be opposing it.

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (17:08):  I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Repeal Bill 2014. The purpose of this bill is to repeal the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Act 2013, otherwise known as the ORA act. I rise with my colleagues the member for Canning and the member for Durack to support this repeal of the bill. The ORA act seeks to unduly regulate the employment of noncitizens working in the offshore resources industry by way of a visa arrangement, regardless of whether or not they are actually working on a resource installation. The bill was another example of Labor creating a market for unions. As we have just heard, it was supported also by the Greens.


Amendments were introduced by the previous government, who, because of the unions, went after legitimate businesses operating in Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone. The previous government took to the Federal Court in May 2012 a case that became known as the Allseas case. The Allseas case involved two vessels attaching gas pipelines to the seabed within Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone and the waters of the continental shelf. In its judgement, the Federal Court ruled that noncitizens aboard the two vessels were not within the migration zone and therefore not required to hold work visas. This was due to the fact that, as the offshore resources industry had maintained, both vessels fell within an exemption in the Migration Act that specifically provides that a vessel that is used or is to be used wholly or principally in manoeuvring a resources installation, or in operations relating to the attachment of a resources installation to the Australian seabed, is not a resources installation and therefore not part of the migration zone.


Labor and the unions—and, as we have just heard, the Greens—were not happy with the ruling from the Federal Court, and, despite not having a good understanding of the impact of the bill, they set about amending the Migration Act. At the time this legislation was introduced, it is important to note, the previous government stated that it had an incomplete picture of the number of noncitizens working on board vessels who did not hold visas. Instead of seeking to understand the impact of the legislation, they pushed it through. While it is true that determining a precise number of people who are affected by this regulation is difficult, consultation with the industry and the migration advice profession and across government indicates that the number is actually relatively small. One estimate has put the total at no more than 2,000 per year, while others have put the number at considerably fewer than this. When we compare this with the 68,000 overseas workers who were granted 457 visas during the last financial year, let alone with the number who are granted permanent visas each year under the migration program, it becomes even clearer just how small the number really is.


In undertaking to repeal this particular piece of overly burdensome regulation, it is important to note that the offshore resources industry is vital to the Australian economy. The member for Corio spoke earlier about the prosperity supplied by the mining industry to Australia. If he was that concerned about the prosperity supplied by the mining industry to Australia, he would have made sure that the mining tax and the carbon tax were never introduced, which directly affect the mining industry, particularly in Western Australia. 


Australia is the world's ninth largest energy producer, and the oil and gas industry accounts for 2½ per cent of our GDP, generating $28 billion in revenue and contributing $9 billion in direct tax payments. The development of Australia's offshore resources contributes significantly to the Australian economy and employs thousands of Australians. It is also critical for our future energy security, accounting for 58 per cent of Australia's primary energy needs.


If we are to continue to derive the substantial economic benefits that this industry provides, it must be allowed to remain internationally competitive and be able to operate in line with international best practice. The industry should not be expected to operate under an increased regulatory burden or additional cost pressures that would put the viability of current and future projects at risk. However, the ORA act will do exactly that.


The offshore resources industry is a global industry and it competes for a limited pool of skilled labour. It employs a highly mobile workforce and relies on the capacity to be able to transfer workers with specialist skills from project to project and from country to country. This means that our migration arrangements must be relatively flexible and not impose an undue administrative burden on industry or create unnecessary barriers for overseas workers when they are genuinely needed, especially when their skills are unavailable in Australia. A leading offshore resource industry group has said:


Australian jobs and our overall economic success relies on a confident, growing offshore oil and gas industry able to do business consistent with international laws and practices ... With this much at stake, it is vital that sectional interests do not come before the national interest and that parliament delivers sustainable, proportionate and balanced regulation affecting offshore operations.


The government could not agree more. Hence we are seeking to repeal the union-led extension of the Migration Act.


The issue of Australia's offshore maritime zones is highly complex. In addition to international conventions, the offshore resources industry is subject to complex and overlapping regulatory frameworks imposed by Commonwealth, state and territory legislation. We therefore need to consider any regulatory changes in this context very carefully and to pursue considered and measured policies.


Repealing this legislation does not mean that the industry is or will be in any way unregulated. For example, noncitizens working on a resource installation will still be required to hold valid visas. They will also still be required to hold the appropriate visa if they wish to come to the Australian mainland. Hence, if a particular employer wants to transfer their overseas workers to a project on the mainland, they must hold a visa with an appropriate work condition, such as a 457 visa.


The ORA act also fails to take into account the fact that many persons engaged on resource installations and vessels use fly-in fly-out arrangements and frequently transit through an Australian airport, which requires them to hold a valid visa to be immigration cleared. Hence, many of those persons who are not currently required to hold visas for the work they are doing on a vessel are still subject to immigration controls when they enter or leave Australia.


 To the extent that persons working in Australia's offshore maritime zones are subject to Australian domestic laws, these laws will still be policed and enforced by the appropriate authorities. Terms and conditions of employment, for example, will continue to be protected under domestic law and, where appropriate, under international law through the Maritime Labour Convention. The National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Authority, and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, will continue to ensure the safety of those persons working on board resource installations and vessels operating in Australia's exclusive economic zone and the waters of the continental shelf.


The government is committed to promoting the development of Australia's offshore resources, to adhering to Australia's international obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and to maintaining the integrity of Australia's borders. Repealing the ORA act would remove an unnecessary and disproportionate legislative burden on an industry that is critical to Australia's future economic growth and the wellbeing of all Australians. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (17:16):  I cannot believe what we have heard here today in this debate on the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Repeal Bill 2014. The surrender monkeys of Australian jobs are at it again, falling over themselves one after another to get up here and justify stripping back great opportunities for Australian employment. Let us be very clear about this: this is not an argument against 457 visas. The Labor government legislation, which we are here defending today, protects Australian jobs by saying that if you want to bring in workers to work on our oil and gas installations, you need to establish that there is no Australian who is capable of doing that. Under all of this language that has been used about deregulation, today we have a proposal, saying that we are in fact going to have open slather on our oil and gas industry.


I thought the member for Durack made some quite appalling statements, basically suggesting that Australians did not have the capacity to do these sorts of jobs and therefore we needed to allow people to come in. We are the second biggest exporter of oil and gas around the world. The question has to be asked: why are we not developing this capacity? We should be the centres of excellence, of skill development in oil and gas, not putting up our hands and saying, 'No, we can't do that work; we're going to allow those well-paid jobs to be taken offshore.'


There is a particular stupidity about this proposal that is ignoring a development in this industry, a development which I have been prepared, as has my colleague the member for Brand, to support as the industry moves towards floating LNG platforms. This technology has indeed been of considerable concern to the unions and also to some of my erstwhile colleagues in the state parliament. But, quite frankly, we are taking the pragmatic approach that this appears to be the technology of the future and that we have to go with that technology. But the way in which we ensure that this is viable, that it is a good outcome for the Australian community, is to ensure that the jobs on those LNG platforms are indeed jobs for Australians. This is not insignificant. 


Figures have been quoted today by various members. I think the member for Canning and the member for Durack talked about there not being very many people concerned about this matter and that we are talking of only a couple of thousand jobs and even that is probably at the high end. I put it to you that, firstly, we should be looking very carefully at even a couple of thousand very well-paid jobs and, secondly, we have to be very mindful of the direction in which the industry is going.


I am going to talk a little bit about the scale of the floating LNG industry that is emerging. In Western Australia in particular we are very conscious of this because we are seeing the first project in Australia that will be coming on stream, hopefully in the next couple of years, with the Shell Prelude project off the Kimberley coast.


APPEA projects that investment in floating LNG in Australia could top $65 billion over the next six years. That is a massive industry, which is a complete transformation of the way in which we have done offshore oil and gas in the past. It means that the jobs go offshore and that the vast bulk of the jobs that are associated with the oil and gas industry will be offshore jobs. And now we have the surrender monkeys in here tonight, telling us that we are not even going to require a 457 visa—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The member for Perth will not refer to members opposite as monkeys—




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. Surrender persons—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  and will withdraw the use of—




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw the use of the word 'monkey' and, instead, say we have these surrenderers, these people who do not have the guts to stand up for Australian jobs. Equally frightening, they appear to have no knowledge, although they claim to be representatives from Western Australia, of the very seismic shift that we are seeing in the nature of this industry.


If I could quote David Byers, the CEO of APPEA. He acknowledges that, with this technology, potentially there are fewer jobs for Australians in the construction phase. But he says that more benefits and job growth will come through the operational phase. He makes the point that if we do this right Perth is placed to become a global centre for FLNG development and technology. So we lose out in the construction phase but the gains really come in that operational phase. We have this potential. We are now looking at, first of all, the Prelude facility, for which there has been a final investment decision, so that is going ahead. We have got Woodside now looking at their Browse project. There has also been floating LNG and we hope that there will be a final investment decision on that next year. We know that Exxon and BHP Billiton are looking at FLNG for their Scarborough field. Similarly in the Northern Territory we see in the Bonaparte Gulf they are looking at going down the path of floating LNG. There is a seismic change in this industry, a seismic change that will be profoundly affected by this legislative proposal that we have here before us today.


I would really like to hear a response from the government on where in this new environment this industry is going. How do we then ensure that Australians have an opportunity to compete for these jobs? Not even a 457 visa will be required into the future. We have got this great opportunity as this industry emerges to be right at the forefront of that. We should be developing a centre of excellence for FLNG and I would obviously like to see that in Perth. I believe that we at the same time have to ensure that we are training those people that are going to be the world leaders in the maintenance and the operation of these facilities. That simply will not happen if we lay down the gauntlet and say that we are not going to put any protections on these jobs for Australians. So we have, as I say, a profound ignorance of the direction in which this industry is going and it appears that this legislation may have been developed without any cognisance of that. It certainly will be a great lost opportunity.


I think it will be a very bad outcome for the companies involved, because companies like Shell and Woodside realise that there is a battle that is going on for their technology. Just last week in the state parliament in Western Australia the blue team and the red team combined to put out a report that was highly critical of the move to FLNG, the members of the committee wanting to support Mr Barnett's ill-founded dream of a gas hub at James Price Point. They point to the loss of jobs that will occur by going offshore. But what we have to do and what these companies should be realising that they need to do is go out there and win the hearts and minds of Western Australians and of Australians with this new technology and assure them that there will be these fantastic job opportunities, long-term jobs. These floating platforms have a projected lifespan of around 25-30 years on these gas fields in Australia. These are really stable, long-term jobs that we should be conserving for Australians and making sure that we do what is necessary to skill our workers up to be able to take their rightful place in the oil and gas industry given our ascendancy in this industry worldwide.


But this is not just a problem for the future. I have no shame in saying that I support the unions standing up for Australian jobs; I 100 per cent support the unions standing up for Australian jobs. There are around 500 unemployed seafarers at the moment in Western Australia and I have been told today that Saipan, the Italian company that is subcontracting to Inpex in terms of the laying of the pipes for the pipeline from Western Australia to Darwin, have indicated that they propose, presumably once this legislation is through, to bring in eight foreign vessels to be doing that work, that they will not be employing Australian workers on that job. They will be having foreign crewed vessels laying those pipes from that Inpex project. That is already an immediate loss of Australian jobs. We have seafarers that are trained and skilled, we have got young guys and women doing their training that want that opportunity with that Inpex project, and once this legislation is through those opportunities are going to vanish. 


I just do not know how you justify this. These companies overwhelmingly are owned by overseas interests. One of the ways in which the Australian community gets benefit out of these oil and gas projects is by the creation of these well-paid jobs for Australian workers. That is what has caused Australian workers to get in there and be behind the oil and gas industry. If we see this wholesale employment of overseas workers without even requiring a 457 visa, without even the most rudimentary test being applied to see if there were Australians that can do that job, the oil and gas industry will start losing the support of the Australian community.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook—Minister for Immigration and Border Protection) (17:28):  The bill that is now before us seeks to undo the knee-jerk policy undertaken by the previous government which was, frankly, pandering to special interests that make-or-break every member of this Labor Party from the leader down, and that is the union movement. Once again we have heard from members opposite in speaking to this bill the usual demonisation of skilled migration. I am not sure whether they undertake those same attacks against skilled migrants when they out in the community visiting many different ethnic communities and talking about skilled migration and the way they come in here and vote on skilled migration, but one thing I do know is that skilled migration has been one of the key pillars on which this country is built. It always amazes me that those opposite are always happy to encourage those who are coming the wrong way and do nothing about that but seem to take great issue when people come the right way, particularly when people come and get involved in the economy, contribute to the bottom line of this country and live the whole principle of Australia that those who get a fair go are those who have a go. Those opposite seem to have a real problem with that, and that has been demonstrated again in this bill, as it was when the original act that this bill seeks to repeal was introduced.


The act that this bill seeks now to repeal sprung wholly from the attempts of the previous government to force what I would argue is an anticompetitive regulation upon industry after it discovered that existing legislation did not permit the extension of union power to offshore installations beyond the universally accepted reach of Australia's migration zone. Members opposite talk about unions standing up for the workers—if only they did—but they tend to stand up for union officials, which seems to be their record in this place. In this debate we have seen those attacks and those positions maintained by those opposite.


A previous minister for immigration—and there were quite a few last year; we had three in the space of six months—sought to challenge the long-held convention and impose domestic migration law on workers far outside Australia's migration zone. The influence of the unions on that government was so strong that it bowed to their demands and tied up resource projects, installations and pipelines with union red tape, stifling business and investment. In the case of Allseas Construction SA v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship the government were challenged to provide any just reason or justification for their attempt to impose domestic migration regulation upon offshore workers, and they could not do that. In May 2012 the Federal Court ruled that the two vessels in question were not Australian resources installations within the meaning of the Migration Act whilst they were wholly or principally engaged in operations relating to the installation of offshore pipelines. The court ruled that the vessels and the noncitizens working on board these vessels were not within the migration zone and, therefore, were not working within the migration zone as defined by section 5(1) of the act and could not be required to hold visas in order to undertake the work they had been contracted to perform.


Contrary to the claims of the then immigration minister of the previous government, the Allseas litigation did not expose any loophole in Australia's migration system that was being exploited by the industry. There was no loophole. No loophole in fact existed. In this vein the same motivations were glaringly apparent when the previous minister for immigration launched his attack on skilled migration in the 457 visa legislation. The previous Labor government sought, through the offshore resources amendment, to create a problem where there actually was none and to demonise the legitimate employment of highly skilled workers who were beyond the reach of unions and added to the productivity of those projects.


Australia is one of the top 10 energy producers in the world and each year our oil and gas industries make up about 2.5 per cent of GDP. This activity generates nearly $30 billion in revenue every year. Energy producers contribute around $9 billion in direct tax payments and supply 58 per cent of Australia's primary energy needs. At the time when the act that this bill seeks to repeal was introduced into this place the then government could not provide any indication, nor indeed sought to acknowledge in any significant way, the increased costs that the extension of Australia's migration zone must necessarily burden the energy and resources industry with.


Apart from the not insignificant costs attached to formally sponsoring workers, union interests clearly sought to force outrageous wage demands upon the industry. In May last year the maritime workers' union sought to impose wage requirements for cooks working on offshore north-west gas projects of $230,000 a year. How can Australia possibly hope to compete with the rest of the world and attract critical growth industries to projects in our territorial waters if this sort of union driven, anticompetitive and highly interventionist regulation is allowed to be forced on industry with union red tape at the behest of union interests, represented in those who sit opposite? 


Not every worker needed for every energy industry project can be found in Australia. Where they can be, they should be employed. That is what the law is designed to achieve. Much of the work undertaken on offshore installations is highly specialised, requiring someone who has considerable expertise performing very specific tasks. Often the projects of the type being developed off Australia have never been established here before. It is entirely reasonable, therefore, to expect that some portion of the experts required must necessarily be sourced from outside of Australia. An inquiry by the Inspector of Transport Security in 2012 into the offshore oil and gas resources sector security clearly identified the legitimate need for an internationally sourced workforce and found that companies are increasingly recruiting personnel from overseas due to skill shortages in Australia. Forcing industry to wade through unnecessary red tape simply to bring these critical workers to their operations will inevitably slow down productivity and thus the attractiveness of investing in Australia.


When the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee conducted an inquiry into the Migration Amendment (Offshore Resources Activity) Bill last year the key resources industry body—the Australian Mines and Metals Association—offered a very clear warning of the detrimental impact on the continued attraction of foreign investment that the former government's reforms to their recruitment and movement of specialist workers would bring about. Executive Director Mr Scott Barklamb stated:


Australia is not the only place in the world with offshore oil and gas resources. International investors are all too aware of and are in the business of evaluating competing resource destinations. 


Despite the clear significance of the impact of the reforms upon the future growth of the energy and resources sector in Australia, at the time of the introduction of the act that this bill now seeks to repeal the previous government could not even quantify or estimate the number of foreign workers in the offshore maritime zone. So absurd was the entire basis for that act that the previous government could not even show how significant the apparent issue it sought to address was. One would have imagined that any government with even a remote sense of responsibility would have made some effort to determine the nature of the problem before they just willingly accepted the union's proposed solution.


The Federal Court may have found that Australia's migration zone did not extend to certain offshore installations or vessels, but these workplaces hardly operate in a secret vacuum. The offshore resources industry is subject to a plethora of domestic regulatory systems set out in a variety of often overlapping pieces of federal, state and territory legislation. Through these, Australian law provides a wide range of mechanisms that operate to safeguard those who work on board installations or vessels in our waters.


A large proportion of these installations operate under the oversight of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, which has responsibility for the regulation of the occupational health and safety of workers on offshore facilities, wells and well operations in Australian waters and in waters where state powers have been conferred. By law, offshore petroleum activities cannot begin before the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority has assessed and approved a detailed risk management plan, including how an organisation will manage risks to workers' safety and health.


Despite the claims of the maritime workers union and other union interests, no need exists to extend any additional protection or safeguards to workers on offshore installations. The claim simply formed part of a concerted campaign to render it near impossible for the energy and resources industry to employ foreign workers. As I have stated, and many industry specialists have also asserted, this protectionist stance is simply not sustainable. It adds to sovereign risk in relation to investments, it undermines the flow of foreign investment to Australia and places significant hindrances on the efforts of any company to develop offshore installations in Australia's territorial waters and therefore generate revenue and further employment opportunities within Australia.


The Prime Minister has said Australia is open for business, and this bill is consistent with and seeks to demonstrate this objective. The coalition government will support the suite of structures that operate to protect workers, but we will not implement policy to serve the anticompetitive will of special interests, in particular the unions seeking to protect the interests of unions. The bill helps restore the confidence that both industry and the Australian people can have in our nation's future growth and opportunities in this sector. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr WATTS

 (
Gellibrand
) (
21:00
):  There is no issue that I struggle with more as a representative in this House than the issue of asylum seekers. Parliamentarians are rarely asked to make decisions that have immediate life-or-death consequences. But, in making asylum seeker policy, we are constantly being asked to play God. Once you recognise that Australia cannot resettle all 10.4 million refugees of concern to the UNHCR today, you are left in a situation where you are forced to make life-altering decisions between equally deserving people. I feel the realities of this responsibility as a member of this chamber keenly. 


George Orwell wrote in Writers and Leviathan that wrestling with political dilemmas like this is often painful because, 'most of us still have a lingering belief that every choice, even every political choice, is between good and evil and that if a thing is necessary then it is also right.' Orwell famously rejected this dichotomy, going on to say:


We should, I think, get rid of this belief …


In politics, one can never do more than decide which of the two evils is lesser, and there are some situations from which one can only escape by acting like a devil or a lunatic.


There are few contemporary issues for which this famous dictum is more apt than our response to asylum seekers. If we cannot take everyone, how do I explain to my constituents whose need was greater—their African-Australian friend who spent the first 15 years of his life in a refugee camp; or their neighbour, a recently resettled Hazara asylum seeker who arrived by boat? And how to deal with the deserving asylum seekers who we do not choose yet come anyway? There are few straightforward right answers here. As Orwell said, it leaves one feeling 'like a devil or a lunatic'.


But our choices still have consequences that force us to weigh the costs as best we can. In this vein, I believe it is important that we do everything we can to discourage the arrival of asylum seekers to this country by boat. I believe this because the journey by sea from Indonesia to Australia is one of the most dangerous in the world and I believe that, if we control our resettlement intake, we can provide a greater equality of opportunity across asylum seekers in need throughout the world. I concede this approach creates different injustices; however, I believe that they are lesser than the alternative. Similarly, on balance, I believe that offshore processing and resettlement are necessary to deter asylum seekers from seeking to come to this country by boat. 


Determining the right approach on these issues requires a difficult moral and policy calculus upon which people of good faith can disagree. That being said, there is no room for disagreement on three aspects of asylum seeker policy. Firstly, while offshore processing is necessary to deter boat arrivals, what is absolutely not necessary is for this offshore processing to be administered in the unsafe, traumatic and dehumanising manner that is currently occurring under this government. The death of Reza Barati on Manus Island in February this year is an unambiguous moral failure and a shame on this minister and the government. We already failed this young man in our obligation to ensure his safety while he was in our care; we must not now fail him again by allowing those responsible for his death to escape accountability.


Secondly, in the face of such enormous need around the world, we absolutely must agree to resettle as many legitimate refugees as possible. Unfortunately, under this government we have slashed our humanitarian intake of refugees from 20,000 people per year under the previous Labor government to only 13,750 today. This is an Abbott government cut that will undoubtedly cost lives. It represents a failure to assist 6,250 people in need every year that we have the capacity to help. 


Finally, we should all be able to agree to talk about asylum seekers as the human beings that they are, not in dehumanising terms like 'illegals' or, even worse, simply named as the boats on which they arrive, but as some of the most unlucky and desperate people in the world who have come to us looking for our help. We cannot help every deserving asylum seeker in need. But the least we can do is recognise them as the grandmothers and grandfathers, aunts and uncles, fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, and brothers and sisters that they are.


In a policy full of difficult moral judgements and complex policy decisions, surely we can all agree that we should guarantee the safety and dignity of those in our care, that we should offer assistance to as many people as possible and that we should treat each other as human beings. Thank you.

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (10:30):  I recently had the privilege of helping Footscray City College open their fantastic new environmental science and horticultural centre and their science technology centre. Our economy is changing. The traditional manufacturing jobs of the past are evolving into highly skilled and highly competitive roles. In my electorate in Melbourne's west, the closure of the Toyota plant in Altona and the uncertainty surrounding the future of the BAE shipyard in Williamstown have sent shockwaves through my community. Furthermore, youth unemployment in Melbourne's west is currently at 13 per cent, one of the highest rates in the state.


Giving our students the right training is essential to ensuring that young people in our community are given the best possible opportunity in the workplace, and giving our nation a workforce ready to meet the challenges of the decades ahead. That is why I was so pleased to attend the opening of the Footscray City College environmental science and technology centres. These centres will kindle a love of science and technology in students, opening their minds to new career paths in the years to come.


I am very proud that the previous Labor government was able to support the construction of these facilities through a grant of $2.2 million under the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program. This policy recognised not only that investment in trades was desperately needed but also that it should be directed through collaboration with industry. The previous government worked with schools and local industry to determine where the jobs of the future will be and to ensure that students were trained with the skills needed for these jobs.


Along with the trades training centres, the federally funded Partnership Brokers program is helping young people in my community make a successful transition from school to further education, training and employment. The Partnership Brokers program creates partnerships between schools, local businesses and the broader community to ensure that the tailored training students receive results in real employment outcomes.


The trades training centres program and the Partnership Brokers program work hand in hand to link local industry with local educational providers to ensure that both students and employers get the skills they need. Nationwide, the Partnerships Brokers program has established over 2,500 partnerships in just four years. The return on public investment is clear. Our local Partnership Brokers program estimates that the cost of running the program annually is equivalent to the annual cost of Newstart benefits for 28 unemployed Australians.


Unfortunately, the Abbott government has axed both the trades training centres program and the Partnership Brokers program. The Abbott government's recent budget was an attack on what makes Australia a fair and egalitarian society. Not happy to simply introduce a 'learn, earn or starve' policy for young Australians without a job, the Abbott government has also sought to make it more difficult for young people to acquire the skills they need to find work. If the Abbott government were serious about helping people into the workforce, it would retain policies like the trades training centre program and the Partnership Brokers program and invest in the skills of our young people, instead of throwing them to the wolves.

Ms SUDMALIS
 (Gilmore) (11:00):  I move:


That this House:


(1) notes that the recent Strategic Review of the National Broadband Network (NBN) revealed that the:


(a) Government's broadband plan can be completed using a mix of technologies to save $32 billion, keep monthly bills lower and deliver the NBN to all Australians four years sooner than under Labor's plan; and


(b) NBN is in a fundamentally worse position than Labor ever disclosed to Parliament or the Australian public;


(2) notes with concern that the review found that:


(a) if Labor's policies are left in place, Australian households could pay up to 80 per cent more for broadband each month; and


(b) the cost of completing the NBN under Labor's plan has blown out to $73 billion; and


(3) acknowledges that the Government is delivering on its election commitment to complete the NBN sooner, cheaper to consumers and more affordably for the Australian taxpayer.


Gilmore is an exciting and wondrous place to live with contrasting scenery, contrasting lifestyles and certainly contrasting technology. One part of Gilmore, the seaside village of Kiama, has been blessed according to the previous government regarding the rollout of the NBN while other parts of Gilmore struggle to get an ADSL connection. 


During the past three years, the NBN was put on a technology pedestal that was not only impossible to maintain but impossible in application. Everyone, according to the policymakers of the day, deserved to have fibre to the home technology with 100 megabits per second, and people were adamant in their demands. They, of course, did not need 100 megabits per second. They were only downloading the odd movie and their favourite music; everything else was average with emails and the occasional mini YouTube download. That need is between eight and 12 megabits per second.


In the beginning, the people of Kiama were delighted to be one of the pilot rollout areas. I cannot report that the enthusiasm continued throughout the project and new names for the NBN were developed: 'Not blah, blah Necessary' or the 'National Broadband Nightmare'. More recently this has improved. Originally, the cables were all supposed to be underground, but someone forgot to check the local geology. Kiama is built on basalt, so you can imagine how many engineer's drills were broken or had to be replaced because they were blunt. In fact, the entire project was put under pressure by unrealistic construction times and untrained technicians—typical, really, pushing a project for the big media grab but not making sure the best solutions were applied. 


The Labor government's desire to rollout the infrastructure according to their political timetable was unrealistic, badly planned and absolutely reflected a lack of business acumen. It is no wonder the project blew the budget bottom line and had thousands of homes not connected according to their schedule. Apart from the cabling change, some streets in Kiama were without water for five days, there were power losses and there were homes connected but, oops, it should have been the neighbour's place. Cable was connected to the home then the owners were told there was an additional cost to put cable throughout the house. Driveways were dug up, medical alerts were not being connected and connection appointments were not kept, triggering paperwork—in some cases, eight copies of the same material and eight rescheduled connection times. 


At the same time, there were complaints from other areas in Gilmore demanding immediate connection—if only they knew. Many residents in Kiama wished they were not a guinea pig site. There are so many residents who assisted in having the medical alert facility accelerated as part of the changeover. Thank you for your passion and persistence. Thank you also to the many others who have shown great fortitude and patience in what has been to date a very frustrating experience. They include Rod Cork, who told us that businesses had been caught up in the problems; Peter Snelling, whose patience is beyond belief; John Holdgate, with multiple correspondence copies; Ross and Joyce Brown, who had no water. But, most of all, thank you to Robert G and Michael T, regional managers for NBN Telstra. Some would say you are both just doing your job, but your efforts in defusing myriad issues have been amazing. When a government lacks business experience there are problem consequences. Putting unrealistic expectations on provider companies without listening to their concerns and their knowledge to improve the system, causes waste, inefficiency and customer frustration, and the list goes on. 


Straight after the election, we carried out a strategic review. The startling summary of findings, if we had followed Labor's plan, includes: that the cost would end up being almost $73 billion—that is, $29 billion more than the public have been told—that it would not reach the final rollout destinations until 2024; an 80 per cent increase in the cost of broadband for the average family; and $6.5 billion had been spent with only three per cent of the scheduled connections completed.


The new plan is a combination of technologies. It is cost efficient, time efficient and technologically flexible to grow with advances over time. The plan includes extending the interim satellite service; $34 million has been allocated to upgrade the services for existing users, expand the service availability and establish a subsidy scheme for the cost of on-premise equipment and installation. 


The fixed wireless review also showed that Labor had not fully catered for the needs of regional areas like Gilmore. In the September quarter, the summary of the reviews is due. It will describe a mix of technologies for NBN as an updated 2014 to 2017 corporate plan, including a detailed rollout schedule. It is essential for everyone to know that their village has not fallen off the map, as some of our local media imply, and to know that they will not have an NBN that is somehow inferior or be ignored, as those on the opposite side will pretend. The government's NBN plan will be far more a rational and national approach to the development of broadband infrastructure where those areas with little or no internet at present will be seen as a priority. A faster and most cost-effective rollout is the action of an experienced and responsible government.

Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland) (11:05):  I do not think this government could lie straight in bed. Two weeks ago, the government handed down a budget which included broken promises on education, on health—




Ms Henderson:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the unparliamentary language used by the member opposite. I ask that he withdraw that.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Specifically?




Ms Henderson:
  In relation to accusing the government of lying.




Mr CLARE:
  I did not say that. I said that this government could not lie straight in bed.




Ms Henderson:
  That is unparliamentary language.




Mr CLARE:
  Let me make it very clear, this government has broken promises.




Ms Henderson:
  I ask for your ruling on that, Mr Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  It was a play on words. I will let it pass.





Mr CLARE:
  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. They have broken promises on education, on health, on pensions and on taxes. Then they come into the parliament and move this motion where they are proselytising, keeping their promises on the NBN. Quick news flash: they have broken promises on the NBN as well. In April last year, the Prime Minister said that, if elected, everyone would have access to 25 megabits per second by the end of 2016. That promise has been broken as well.


On the last sitting day in this parliament, when everyone was distracted by the closure of Holden, Malcolm Turnbull, the Minister for Communications, came into the parliament and said that the government was breaking that promise as well. It is not the only promise they have broken on the NBN. They promised nine million households would get fibre to the node. Now only about three million households will get that. There is also this ripper. In February last year, the then opposition leader Tony Abbott said:


If we don't go ahead with the NBN in its current form, that's about $50 billion less that the Commonwealth will need to borrow.


That is not true either and the budget papers prove it. Last year's budget—our last budget—showed that we would allocate $30.4 billion in government equity to build the NBN. In this budget the Liberal Party shows that it will allocate $29.5 billion. It is not a $50 billion difference; it is a $1 billion difference. The real difference is what the people of Australia will get. Under Labor they would have got the real NBN, fibre to the premises, a game-changing project that would change the way we live and change the way we work. Under this government, only 25 per cent of Australia will get fibre to the premises. The rest of Australia will miss out. They will get a second-rate NBN from a third-rate government.


We have to ask ourselves why this is happening. I think it is because the Liberal Party do not understand how important the NBN is. The Prime Minister says he is the infrastructure Prime Minister of Australia but he describes the NBN as, effectively, a video entertainment system. He wants to tear down this project but at the same time build a paid parental leave scheme that gives $50,000 to rich mums who do not need it. I make this point for this reason: the cost of the paid parental leave scheme over the next decade will be more than the cost of building the NBN over the next decade. Which one do you think will have a bigger impact on the Australian economy? I can tell you it is the NBN. The member for Gilmore should know better because in her electorate is the town of Kiama, one of the first places to get the NBN. The people in Kiama who are using it love it.



Ms Sudmalis interjecting—




Mr CLARE:
  I have. A woman named Sharon Parker, who lives in your electorate, said this:


Downloading, uploading, fast, brilliant. Sending emails, instant. Downloading really big documents, we get it straight away.


   …   …   …


Brilliant. We don't have any dramas, none whatsoever.


By her actions, the member for Gilmore is denying the rest of her electorate the same service that Sharon Parker is getting. Towns like Nowra, Gerringong and Gerroa will all miss out on what Kiama is getting. They will get the second-rate NBN.


Do not worry; we will tell them about it. If they do not know about it already, we will tell them, come the next election in 2016. We will tell the people of Nowra, Gerringong and Gerroa that they are missing out on the real NBN because of this short-sighted government. We will remind them of the promises—on education, on health, on pensions, on taxes and on the NBN—that this Prime Minister has broken. They are missing out because they trusted this untrustworthy government.

Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (11:10):  What we have just heard from the member for Blaxland is another example of the Labor Party living in La La Land. The figures that we have just heard are absolutely rubbish—




Ms Hall:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I do not think that the term 'La La Land' is really respectful or worthy of being used within the parliament, and I think that the member should be asked to rephrase her language and use some more parliamentary-type language, language that is in line with what one would expect from a member of parliament.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Member for Corangamite, do you—




Ms HENDERSON:
  No, I do not allow the member to intervene. As I say, this is another example of the Labor Party living in La La Land. We have seen how the Labor Party, the previous federal government, has driven our country into monumental debt and deficit. It has shown that it does not know how to run the economy, and despite the attempts by the member opposite to shut me down in this debate—

  I will proudly say loud and clear—and it is unfortunate that she is trying to do it again—




Ms Hall:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I have another question I would like to ask the member under standing order 66A.




Ms HENDERSON:
  A member can only intervene on one occasion, Mr Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  That is right.




Ms HENDERSON:
  I return to the debate, and I remind those who are watching this and seeing the display opposite of Labor's mess. I look at page 52 of Labor's Mess 2007-2013, which is also on my website. There is no more monumental example of an infrastructure mess than the NBN. The document says:


In 2007 Labor promised a National Broadband Network costing $4.7 billion and which would be completed by 2013. In 2009 they switched to an NBN costing ten times as much.


…   …   …


After six years of Labor government, only 3% of Australians had access to the NBN and fewer than 100,000 were using it. Labor's NBN achieved only 16% of its original rollout target for June 2013 and only 7% of its target for paying customers.


What we have seen again from Labor, from the previous federal government, is an example of incompetence. This is an infrastructure project that Labor failed to deliver, and the member for Blaxland has got his figures dramatically wrong.


As we know from our strategic review, we have costed this project at $78 billion. We are proudly delivering about 26 per cent of fibre to the premises for homes right around the country. Let me just remind the people of my electorate in Corangamite that, when Labor decided to roll out the NBN, one of the big differences was that it did not prioritise those who needed the NBN the most: those in rural and regional areas. Frankly, it is a disgrace that Labor completely excluded from the rollout the people in southern Geelong and in places like Highton, Belmont, Grovedale, Waurn Ponds and Marshall, where people in my electorate are absolutely desperate for internet connections. Once again we have seen Labor's absolute failure to care for country people, to regard country people as a priority. The rollout in southern Geelong is a very good example of that.


I also remind the House that, apart from the massive cost blow-out, as we see in the booklet Labor's Mess, not only were the targets appalling but without policy changes, as the independent review has revealed, up to 200,000 households and businesses in regional, rural and remote areas were going to miss out entirely on a connection under Labor's NBN. This has been a monumental infrastructure disaster. We are proudly fixing Labor's mess. We are proudly rolling out the NBN quickly and efficiently and delivering fast broadband right across Australia, which is what the Labor Party, unfortunately, failed to do as it did with so many other things.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (11:16):  This motion unwittingly reveals one of the few qualities of the Abbott government. I know that after their first chaotic budget not too many people are talking up the qualities of the government. Watching them sell what has been described as a stinking carcass of a budget—high praise from their side—it is painfully obvious that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are struggling in talking up themselves and their own qualities. Considering this, I thought I would lend them a hand, using the motion of the member for Gilmore.


You see, this motion champions one of the greatest hidden attributes of the government, which is its sense of irony. Look hard and you will find that that quality is on display in everything that the government does. That quality has been on show from their first swearing-in right through to their first budget. If members are having trouble identifying it, check out the responsibilities they have set up for their ministers. A Prime Minister who shaped a ministry with the lowest level of female representation in living memory is the minister for women. They have an industry minister who oversees the closure of industries; a health minister whose biggest job right now is to discourage the sick from seeing a doctor; a social services minister who is cutting the incomes of young employed people, making sure they have less money for things such as food and rent but making sure they have a couple of hundred dollars for marriage counselling; and an infrastructure minister who has distanced himself from any infrastructure project that does not involve building a road—he should just rebadge himself the 'Minister for Tar'; he is helped by the member for Mayo, the 'Assistant Minister for Tar'. But the greatest, the finest, blaring example of irony, is the Minister for Communications, who is tasked with the slow death of one of the biggest communications projects in the country, the NBN, and he is ably supported by backbenchers who run interference, creating confusion and dismay about a project that will actually benefit their own electorates.


This motion was moved by a regional member of parliament, the member for Gilmore, backed up by three regional members of parliament arguing against improving the quality of infrastructure in their own patch. What are we going to see next, a conservative government argue for lifting the taxes on the well off? No, they have done that one, too!


We have here the government turning the NBN into what has been described as a CBN—a copper broadband network. They are not doing anything inventive. All they are doing is reverting to type—the type that has dogged them since the last time they were in government, when they had 20 failed broadband plans—tinkering with copper when fibre is what will be required to get the job done and done right. Instead of 93 per cent of homes being connected with fibre the coalition will connect only 26 per cent this way. That is what these regional members are applauding today. Instead of ensuring complete coverage by satellite and wireless in those hard to reach areas, these members are chanting for an $80 million mobile phone tower program where data costs will be higher and speeds will be slower. They are presiding over a plan described by veteran analysts, such as Paul Budde, as a dog's breakfast. It is so bad that the promises they made at the election have already been dropped—for example, that of 25 megabits per second by 2016.


So what is the member for Gilmore talking about when she talks about the NBN? Her motion is not about the network itself; she focused on reviews. Since the government have come to office they have not been rolling out fibre, they have been rolling out red carpet to consultants. I have seen the minister out and about wearing a fluoro vest. I do not know why. He is not building a network; he is building a Brandisesque library of consultant reviews and reports.


If they are not rolling around in glee making snow angels out of the invoices that the consultants have sent them, they are working hard to suppress different views on the NBN. I have been surprised to see, for instance, reports that the ABC are withholding reports about the NBN because they do not want to upset their new masters, and they are failing to report on the National Broadband Network.


Have no doubt about it: people want fibre to the premises. They do not want the coalition's CBN; they want the NBN. I know this from my own area, where I have often raised the concerns of local residents in Woodcroft and Doonside. Fortunately, and to their credit, in April the government reversed a terrible decision they made in December where they dropped these suburbs from the rollout. But, while one half will get the NBN, the other half will not. There are patches of these suburbs that are bizarrely omitted.


The shadow minister for communications attended a forum I held earlier this month where residents expressed a clear view they wanted the job done properly. In words that I think signal a firm view across modern Australia, he was told: 'This is Australia, not a Third World country. There are other countries worse than us that have better broadband service. If I have a right to vote, I should have a right to better broadband.' That is the expectation of modern Australia, not what these people are delivering. (Time expired)

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Government Whip) (11:21):  I commend the member for Gilmore for this motion. She knows, as I do, that regional Australia needs better broadband sooner. Regional Australia needs to catch up to the major metropolitan centres and have access to the type of broadband service that allows businesses to grow and compete and individuals to enjoy an equivalent level of support.


Labor in government failed to prioritise regional communities in the original NBN plan, and many regional areas with no broadband service were left behind and had to watch as metropolitan areas were upgraded. Labor underestimated the number of Australians in regional and remote areas who want the NBN by a factor of two to three. This is easily demonstrated by their bungling of the NBN interim satellite service, which provides temporary internet access for premises in metropolitan fringe, regional and remote areas with no other way of getting broadband. In December 2013 the ISS reached its capacity of 48,000 customers and registrations were closed. In July 2013 Labor told 250,000 households and businesses, many with other broadband options, that they were eligible for the ISS. Tens of thousands were left demanding the service but unable to obtain it.


Labor spent $351 million on the ISS—$7,300 per user—yet it delivers dial-up service to many users. By comparison, the coalition has made unserviced and underserviced regions a priority. The government moved in April 2014 to fix Labor's mistakes and $34 million was committed to improving the ISS to improve service quality for existing users, allow new connections and establish a subsidy scheme for the cost of on-premises equipment and installation.


The government is committed to rolling out the National Broadband Network as quickly as possible, at less cost to taxpayers and more affordably for consumers. In nine months the number of premises covered has increased 65 per cent, from 348,000 to 573,000. The rollout is proceeding using a multi-technology mix that matches the right technology to the right location and leverages existing infrastructure.


The NBN Co strategic review found that, if Labor's NBN proceeded, it would cost $72.6 billion—a mere $29 billion more than the public were told. It would lift broadband costs by up to 80 per cent and take until 2024. The government's approach will save taxpayers $32 billion, get the NBN finished four years sooner and enable nine out of 10 Australians in the fixed line footprint to have access to download speeds of 50 megabits per second or more by 2019.


In my own electorate of Forrest, NBN Co has recently announced new services to be provided by fibre and fixed wireless technologies in Brunswick, Stratham and Boyanup. This will add to the 44,000 homes and businesses in Western Australia with access to the NBN. I was especially glad to see the media release from NBN Co announcing the additional services in the electorate. That release states:


For many homes, farms and businesses in rural and regional Western Australia the rollout of the NBN will provide access to internet speeds and bandwidth that many in the big cities take for granted.


That is how it is in rural and regional Australia.


We saw the overbuild. We heard repeatedly about the overbuild in Labor's NBN. Instead of prioritising rural and regional, they overbuilt in areas where there were sometimes two services already available. It has taken the installation of a coalition government to get that recognition, and I am very glad that we have it. NBN Co will release an updated 2014-17 corporate plan in the September quarter of 2014. This will include detailed information about the rollout schedule, and I look forward to seeing it spell out how to deliver better broadband in Forrest.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (11:25):  Looking at the motion that is before us, on every single point the mover has stumbled, perhaps unwittingly, into the realms of what I call Turnbullistan. It is almost as if this motion was drafted in the minister's office. It talks about the strategic review of the NBN. The minister—because this really does look like it was drafted in the minister's office—likes to claim that the strategic review tells him that Labor's plan for its NBN would cost $72.6 billion, increase prices for consumers and not be complete until 2024. On every single one of these claims made by the minister, he is wrong. He is deliberately misleading the community. I am very concerned, also, that he is unwittingly misleading the member for Gilmore.


On the issue of cost, it is absolutely false to claim that the strategic review identified that completing the NBN under Labor's plan would cost $72.6 billion, because the revised outlook in the strategic review did not represent the cost of building a fibre-to-the-premises network, which was Labor's NBN. It was a hypothetical exercise based on a series of forward projections and assumed that management of the project would not achieve any efficiencies. Furthermore, the minister continually and incorrectly refers to the three different concepts of cost used in describing the NBN, these being the sum total of all capital expenditure; the peak funding requirement, which is the sum of capital expenditure plus operating losses until the project becomes cash flow positive; and levered peak funding requirement, which assumes that only a portion of the peak funding is provided by government equity contributions, and that the portion raised by private debt funding includes costs incurred in raising the debt.


The minister's own strategic review reveals two things about the cost: firstly, that the only real difference in the cost to the Commonwealth between Labor's plan and the government's plan is less than $1 billion in equity financing; and, secondly, that choosing levered peak funding inflates the result by including costs of debt. Therefore, it could be just as reasonably claimed that the strategic review showed that the fibre-to-the-premises NBN could be built for the capital expenditure included in the corporate plan.5


I would also note that this was the mob running around prior to the election saying the cost of the NBN was $90 billion. Even the hapless member for Moncrieff used that figure in the House a few weeks ago. Just to make it clear how out of date he is, on the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network on 19 April last year—a hearing of the parliament—I asked:


… I want to go back to your briefing at the start, just to be crystal clear. The NBN costs $37.4 billion. What veracity should then be given to assertions that the NBN cost could in fact be around $90 billion?


He said:


I can only repeat that we are confident of the $37.4 billion figure. 


So I asked him:


Do you know how that $90 billion figure was derived?


That is the figure that those opposite were running around talking about. The answer was no. 


But perhaps the most galling point in this motion regards election commitments. Before this government became expert on breaking election commitments, they were breaking promises on the NBN. We all remember the laughable press conference with the then opposition leader and the member for Wentworth and Sonny Bill Williams. During that press conference the now Prime Minister said:


Under the coalition by 2016 ... there will be minimum download speeds of 25 megabits ... we will deliver a minimum of 25 megabits ... by the end of our first term.


That promise was broken in December last year. It barely lasted a couple of months.


I want to draw the attention of the member for Gilmore to the success story6 that is Labor's NBN in her electorate. The Illawarra Mercury recently featured a story on one of the member for Gilmore's constituents, Ms Maree Shepherd, who is enjoying the benefits of Labor's high-speed fibre broadband network, which has allowed her to work from home. The story quotes Maree:


""When I studied Australian history, we studied the tyranny of distance, about the problems for Australia being so far away,"" Ms Shepherd said.


""The internet and the NBN in particular for me down here in Kiama, that tyranny of distance is gone now. The world is right here in my living room because I've got a good connection.""


These are the lived experiences of people enjoying the transformational and enabling powers of ICT investment.


I believe the member for Gilmore should be there listening to their needs rather than putting through these extraordinarily ill-thought out motions. I would like to point out that, while we talk about the regions and how concerned these people are about them, what are they doing about equivalent wholesale pricing? Gone. Selling out on equivalent wholesale pricing. We were supposed to end the disparity between metro and bush prices, and they have completely sold out the regions on each one of those. (Time expired)

Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (11:30):  There can be few issues of more importance to the people of Hume than telecommunications. We have over 18,000 people a day travelling into Sydney and Canberra for work, and each one of them wants a connection so that they can work outside of office hours when they need to. The Hume corridor between Sydney and Canberra is the tree change capital of Australia with huge numbers of people moving out of those cities for a wonderful rural lifestyle.


I also have the electorate of small businesses. I have lots of edges and not many centres, and that means small business proliferates right across the electorate and those small businesses need telecommunications for the effectiveness of their business.


I understand rural Australia. The member for Greenway does not because she does not come from that area. We understand how disastrous Labor's policies were on the NBN for rural Australia. There is a long list of rivals for Labor's worst, most disastrous program, but the rural NBN has to be at the top of the list. 


Let us touch on just one aspect of their failure to deliver for rural Australia and that is the interim satellite service. The NBN interim satellite service attempts to provide temporary internet access for premises in metropolitan fringe and particularly more remote areas where there is no other means of getting the internet. In July 2013 Labor told 250,000 households and businesses, many with other broadband options, that they were eligible for the interim satellite solution. But in December 2013, less than six months later, the interim satellite solution reached its capacity of 48,000 customers, having promised it to 250,000—another of Labor's extravagant claims that prove to be a huge problem for the people of rural Australia. What is worse is they spent $351 million on the interim satellite solution—that is $7,300 per user—and it delivered little more than dial-up broadband speeds. What an extraordinary waste.


In my electorate of Hume this was real people with real businesses. The Dysons moved into my electorate, hoping to run an education business using broadband. They were promised they would be able to achieve 20 megabits per second or thereabouts of download speeds to run their business. They quickly found that that was impossible and had to move their business into town where they could get higher speeds.


This government moved in April 2014 to fix Labor's mistakes and $34 million was committed to improving the interim satellite service and to improve broadband quality. That is just one of the problems. I could stand here and talk for 30 minutes or however long you like about the rest of them. 


What is important is to talk about where we are going with all of this. We understand that better telecommunications is the key to unlocking growth in regional Australia. In March I announced the first towers in my electorate for fixed wireless services near Cowra and Young. Six new towers are under construction in Cowra and Young—in fact most of them are now up—and they will provide fast broadband access to thousands of residents as part of our reprioritisation to rural Australia. The towers are at Koorawatha, the Olympic Highway between Cowra and Koorawatha, Gooloogong, the Lachlan Valley Way between Gooloogong and Cowra, south of Canowindra and between Derbys Falls and Wyangala—all areas with huge problems with the internet.


Recently, I was at the Koorawatha show and saw one of these sparkling new towers that have been a long time coming. There is still a wait for these areas to be connected. It will take up to 12 months, but the residents can at last see hope. Around the town of Goulburn we will also be seeing a rapid rollout in the coming 12 months of fixed wireless internet towers.


So this government is moving on the problems in rural Australia. We understand the need for reprioritisation, but we also understand the need to allow the private sector to play a role. In the village of Harden the community has taken this problem into its own hands and is rolling out its own fixed wireless solution. Around Palerang, just on the edge of Canberra, Wireless4U has been rolling out fixed wireless towers for some time.


Our NBN is not seeking to push out private sector providers. In fact, we are seeking to encourage them. That is a critical part of our strategy. I commend this motion to the House.

Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (11:35):  I would like to start my contribution to today's debate on the National Broadband Network with a quote from one of the co-founders of Australia's most successful software company, Atlassian. Yesterday, on Channel 9's Financial Review Sunday program, Atlassian's Mike Cannon-Brookes said:


The biggest problem the government has at the moment is that it doesn't understand technology broadly.


That pretty much sums it up. I was amazed that this private members' business was brought to the House, considering how viciously this government is tearing apart the National Broadband Network. The Abbott government is systematically destroying the world-class network that was going to be built under Labor and is replacing it with a hotchpotch of different networks at a slower timetable than promised and at much lower speeds.


In particular, I find it astonishing that their strategic review of the NBN is being waved around as a showcase in this debate. The Senate Select Committee on the National Broadband Network tabled its first report in March this year and was scathing of the strategic review and the processes that the government is undertaking in its rollout. In essence, the interim report found that the assumptions of the strategic review are flawed and unreliable, and that the government should direct NBN Co to accelerate the fibre-to-the-premises rollout, not stop it.


I would now like to concentrate on the second point made by the Senate select committee about accelerating the fibre-to-the-premises rollout, not stopping it. Labor's National Broadband Network was to deliver superfast broadband to the front door of 93 per cent of all Australians, about 70 per cent more than what will be delivered by this government. My electorate of Newcastle was due to have 100 per cent of coverage with fibre to all premises by the end of 2016—superfast access that would connect them to the rest of the country and the world. Every home, school, hospital, health clinic and business was set to be connected. Businesses made decisions to locate themselves, based on the availability of the NBN and were making long-term plans to move operations into Newcastle. Construction on the network commenced in the suburb of Mayfield last year. Planned works and interchange upgrades were underway or completed in New Lambton and Hamilton.


Some residents in Thornton, Stockton and Beresfield were to benefit from broadband access for the first time. That is right: there are still places in Newcastle, a major regional economic hub, that have no broadband access whatsoever. My entire electorate now sits on a scrap heap of broken promises of this government, completely removed from the rollout schedule altogether. They have no idea of when they will receive the NBN or what level of service they will actually receive. Business plans are in disarray, with small and large enterprises heading back down the freeway to the Central Coast and Sydney, to access the big pipe of superfast broadband. 


Last week I was surprised to hear some good broadband news for the region, with rumours that the NBN was back on and that there would be a fibre rollout announcement. I thought they might restart the work at Mayfield and that maybe the people of Thornton or Stockton were going to get broadband for the very first time. I was, however, left disappointed with the detail when the announcement came out. Do not get me wrong: I am happy for the residents who are going to get the NBN close to Newcastle, but I am obviously disappointed to read that it was not coming to my constituents or businesses in my electorate but was to be rolled out in East Maitland just outside my electorate in the Liberal held seat of Paterson. 


One of the listed fundamentals of NBN Co's rollout is the prioritisation of construction of the NBN in communities in regional and rural Australia, with limited or no current access to broadband. Based on this fundamental and the announcement of the construction commencing in East Maitland, I naturally assumed that they were in the same boat as Thornton, about five kilometres away, with no broadband access at all. Research, however, shows that this was not the case. Using the Department of Communications MyBroadband checker, I got a quick insight into broadband availability and quality in East Maitland and nearby Thornton. According to the checker, the residents of East Maitland already have high levels of access to ADSL. Unfortunately, when I checked for Thornton it was still very much the case. The ratings, quite aptly given the situation there, came up as D, E and D, the lowest rankings possible on all measures.

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (16:03):  I rise to speak about a great community victory on the North Coast of New South Wales on 15 May when the gas company Metgasco had its drilling licence suspended at Bentley near Lismore. I take this opportunity to thank all of those in the community who worked so hard to force the New South Wales state government to suspend this licence. We know it is only a suspension and we have to remain vigilant to ensure that all forms of unconventional gas mining do not occur in our area. We can only achieve this with the Northern Rivers being declared gas field free. We will keep this campaign going.


We had such a variety of people involved in this community protest: farmers, families, grandparents, kids, locals, people from all around our region, people from right around the state, people from interstate and people from outside Australia. Everyone helped us. This is a victory for all those community workers who worked so hard; for those people who camped at Bentley; for the thousands who showed up at Bentley; for those who supported the Bentley blockade; for the people who wrote letters and signed petitions; for the people who marched in those rallies; for the people who declared their streets and communities gas field free; for all the people at Lock the Gate, including Ian Gaillard, Michael McNamara, Phil Laird; and for our local media, who highlighted the community's concerns, particularly the Byron Echo, the ABC at Lismore and the Northern Star.


This victory is a community one. It is not one that the National Party have been trying to claim. They have been pushing CSG for years. People were upset when they, pathetically, tried to claim this victory as their own. The fact is, they ignored the concerns that had been brought to them by thousands of people over the years.


Make no mistake: it was a community victory that brought about this outcome, because our community stood together. Many individuals—and I congratulate all of those individuals—and community groups worked so hard. This is your victory. You should own it. Congratulations for the great work that you did in protecting our beautiful north coast.

Mr BROAD
 (Mallee) (16:49):  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker Andrews. It is nice to see you in that chair as opposed to in a helicopter. I would like to be in this place, like any member of parliament, and happily give away money. No member of parliament really comes to the House and wants to be the person who has to say no.



Ms Hall interjecting—




Mr BROAD:
  Let me continue. But my curse, I suppose, is that I do understand economics and I understand that you actually have to have a strong economy in order to attract and be able to build a great society.



Ms Hall interjecting—




Mr BROAD:
  In having a strong economy, you have to be able to afford a certain number of things, and how you do it is quite challenging. I hear someone across the chamber here interjecting, but what I can say is this: we need to find the balance between what we invest in and what we spend, and this has been the challenge in this budget. In this budget, we have found some difficult choices.


It needs to be said that for a very long time we have not adjusted the structural flaws in the budget. We have been spending more as a country than we have been getting in in income tax, and that leaves us with two choices. It leaves us with the choice of putting taxes up or finding some savings. We had to find that balance. In working through that balance, there have been some challenges. But I believe we have actually met the challenge very well.



Ms Hall interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs Andrews
):  Order! The member will be heard in silence.




Mr BROAD:
  The challenge is to ensure that businesses can continue to function. Across my electorate, we could have fallen in the trap. We could have removed the diesel fuel rebate. We could have not invested in roads. But instead we have chosen to keep the diesel fuel rebate, which is a recognition of agricultural productivity, and we have also chosen to invest in roads.


I hark back to a great cartoon series that I used to watch when I was a child, and that was The Simpsons. One time Homer Simpson ran for mayor by saying, 'Can't somebody else do it?' As I said at the start, we would love to turn up to this place and give away money, but what defines us as a government compared to the previous government is that we are prepared to make the difficult choices. When Homer Simpson ran for mayor with his slogan of 'Can't somebody else do it?' that very much reflects the budget-in-reply speech that we saw from Bill Shorten, talking about us being mean, talking about us being harsh. But what he essentially was saying was, 'Can't somebody else do it?' And that is us. We have been handed the hard task of running the country and deciding what the hard decisions are.


There have been a lot of lies out there and a lot of discussion out there in the public discourse. Winston Churchill once said, 'A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.'




Dr Leigh:
  I preferred it when you quoted Simpson!




Mr BROAD:
  No, you will learn something from Churchill, because Churchill was a man—I kid you not—who had the strength of his convictions to make the tough call when the tough call had to be made. And this is a tough call that had to be made. In our current deficit, you will notice that we still have $49.9 billion of loss this year. Our projections next year are $29.8 billion, and even by 2017-18 we will see a deficit of $2.8 billion. So even then we are still only closing the gap, but the tough calls need to be made.


We have made some tough calls, but we have also invested very much in our future. I got emails all last week saying what we can and cannot do, and many of those emails would have us go down the same way as the Argentinian economy, where they put in huge disincentives for people to earn. We have not done that. We have not made that mistake. We have actually invested in building capacity. Cutting company tax rates has been fantastic. That will mean that a small business in my electorate will put on an extra apprentice, and that is what we have to do. If we can get one extra person—



Ms Hall interjecting—




Mr BROAD:
  Well, you should listen because you are going to learn something. If you can put on one extra person, that is an extra job in a country community. I did an apprenticeship, and a first-year apprenticeship is very tough to live on. In fact, if you are on a first-year wage, on $200 a week, it is quite a struggle. We have recognised this. We are actually the party for the worker, and we have recognised this. We have given a help scheme for apprentices. I know that as a first-year apprentice it was a very big deal for me to be able to buy the tyres on my car, but with a help scheme there is real recognition of this. For the first time, students who study at Longerenong agricultural college or at SuniTAFE will be able to access a help scheme. This has been an instrumental thing that we have campaigned for for a very long time—a recognition that rural trades are essential to growing our economy and growing our wealth.


We have expanded the research and development in agriculture by $100 million. We have also invested in our roads—our first mile of road. Did you know that the average truck now weighs 60 tonnes? We have to be able to get down that country road. We have added another $350 million for Roads to Recovery and another $300 million overall for Bridges to Recovery. This has been a great investment and real recognition that investing in roads is going to be key.


One of the tough decisions has been to put an excise on fuel and to index that excise. It is easy for the Labor opposition to sit back and say, 'That's a broken promise.' But we are linking the excise to road infrastructure. My electorate makes up one-third of the state of Victoria, and there are a lot of country roads. The people in my electorate say to me that they want to be able to make a phone call and they want to be able to drive on a country road. For a very long time we have seen not enough investment in country roads. It has been the coalition, which championed the Roads to Recovery policy, that has boosted that. That is recognition of the fact that boosting our investment in infrastructure lets us enhance our export capacity, which increases our wealth. Even out of my electorate, there is $5.3 billion of economic activity. I would say that there are not many electorates across Australia that have that level of economic activity.


We continue to invest in looking after our land. There is $525 million for the Green Army Program. I am going to have three Green Army projects in my electorate and I am going to try to get some more. The thing I like about the Green Army Program is that it gets young men and women aged 17 to 25 outdoors, breathing the fresh country air and getting involved in hands-on environmental management. This is how you actually move people away from being armchair environmentalists, of which we have seen too many, to being people who have a passion and an affinity for looking after the land. Not only will those people undertaking Green Army projects be doing something of value that will lift their self-esteem; they will also be getting some skills and doing some good environmental work that will help the region. We have $342 million in the Community Development Grants Program. That is money that will go into our communities to help build small infrastructure. Also part of the budget is the National Stronger Regions Fund. That is $1 billion that will be spent right across Australia to build those small projects that are very important to people.


For my electorate in the budget there is also an additional 3,000 places for the Clontarf Foundation. I met with some of these guys last week. They are young Aboriginal men who use sport as a motivation for getting them back to school and getting them back into learning. One of the key factors about this budget is that, unlike the previous government, which was not prepared to put some tough love into unemployment benefits and in driving people to work, we have introduced an earn or learn program. The earn or learn program will not have people living on $2 noodles for six months, as those opposite would have us believe; it will have some very good programs that will help people get a job. That is what we want.


Mr Deputy Speaker Randall—I think that is the right title. It sounds very regal for you, doesn't it? We want to see people get a job. Getting a job builds your self-esteem. Getting a job builds your self-worth. We do not want people to see themselves as unemployed. We want to see them as employable and looking for work. That is something we need to do right across Australia. In my electorate there are jobs, and a lot of them are currently being filled by Irish and German backpackers. We want our young Australians to get involved in the workforce. That does not mean you start off in the job that you always want. I never started off in the job I always wanted, and I am not sure I am in the job I always wanted now, but here I am. The point is—



Dr Leigh interjecting—




Mr BROAD:
  You could try. I think you had a good go but did not quite—I think you polled 17 per cent. Across my electorate we want to have people who are active and take a job. That is going to be very critical, Mr Deputy Speaker Randall. Is that the correct title?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Randall
):  Correct.




Mr BROAD:
  Even the senior Australians in my electorate can see the value of what we are doing with the GP co-payment. I have talked to pensioners, and whilst they do not particularly like it they know there is value in their covering some of the hard yards that are ahead, particularly when you tell them that it is going to go into the Medical Research Future Fund. This is a fund that could have huge benefits for Australia, not only in the way it could solve some illnesses that we need research into. One thing I have seen when I have studied extensively overseas is that medical research becomes something that links very much our universities, and if we can do this right then we can actually have some of our top research universities accessing some of these funds and driving not only training but also the research and the cures for the next century.


For people who are over 50, being unemployed is a big challenge. I want to make sure that those people in my electorate are very aware that, if they have been unemployed for six months, we are going to introduce a program that is going to help them get a job. There is nothing that does more for an older person's self-esteem than to see that they are still of value, that they can still get a job and that they can still contribute to the Australian economy and to their own pocket. We are introducing $10,000 over 24 months to help senior Australians get jobs. If you have been on welfare for six months or more, an employer will work with you and get $10,000 over 24 months to employ you. So there is a length of tenure for which you are going to have to stay there—for which they are going to have to keep you on. That measure, I think, will be very well received.


If you do have the chance—and many of you are very busy workers, I understand, as members of parliament—the Queen's Birthday long weekend is a good time to go on a road trip. One of the things that is great about the electorate of Mallee is that it has such fantastic places to visit. We have the Grampians, where you can have a kangaroo bounce up right to your front step. We have the Murray River, where you can take a houseboat. We want to drive tourism dollars in the Grampians. We want to drive tourism dollars along the Murray River. We understand that tourism is a very important part of the Australian economy. So the budget has a $43 million Tourism Demand-Driver Infrastructure Program, with small expenditures right across Australia that will make sure that people get out and experience Australia. I think this is another a great part of this budget.


We have not shirked our responsibility. When I have been out talking to people across my electorate, they are not saying, 'Woe is me!' What they are saying, without any political spin, is: 'We know that we have been living beyond our means for too long. We are not buying the line that there is no budget emergency. We are not buying the line that the Labor government should have continued the way it had been going for five years previously.' People are telling me that the budget is tough but fair. They are prepared to wear some of the cuts because they know that if they can walk with us we can walk through a few difficult years and there will be light on the other side. We have done it before. Unfortunately, we have been elected to have to do it again. But it is the tough decisions that define members of parliament, not just turning up and whingeing and throwing away money like a drunken sailor. We are prepared to make those tough decisions, and that is something that will define this government.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (17:02):  Whether you ask parents, pensioners or conservative premiers, it is pretty clear that this budget is deeply unpopular—perhaps the most unpopular budget since polling began. One of the reasons for this is that it breaks so many promises: pledges of no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts to pensions, no cuts to the ABC and no new taxes are smashed like plates at a Greek wedding. Broken too is the pledge not to cut more than 12,000 public servants, a broken promise which falls particularly hard on my electorate, and the promise not to make further cuts to foreign aid: now Australia will see itself doing less vaccination and building fewer sanitary projects—saving fewer lives. It appears that, when Mr Abbott was sermonising for the previous three years about the need for politicians to keep their word, he was referring to everyone but himself.


The other reason that people are angry about this budget is that it does not reduce the deficit. Let us not compare Hockey 2013 with Hockey 2014. Let us make the only fair comparison. As the Charter of Budget Honesty sets out, the fair comparison is with today's budget and the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, independently prepared by the secretaries of Treasury and Finance during the caretaker period. By that comparison, this budget has a higher deficit this year, a higher deficit next year and a higher deficit across the forwards. The PEFO had us returning to surplus in 2016-17; this budget has us returning to surplus in 2017-18. The Treasurer's hyperbole about Australia's deficit levels are out of touch with the international reality, where Australia's debt levels are relatively low. But if the Treasurer were to care about the level of Australia's debt and deficits, he does himself no favours by bringing down a budget which increases them.


But the biggest reason that this budget sent shivers through the community is that it fails the fair go test. So many people in my community and other communities around Australia are asking about the budget, 'How will it make my life harder?' A single parent recently contacted me. She has worked hard all her life supporting herself and her two boys and was to be made redundant this year. As the redundancy date loomed closer she did her best to secure another job to guard against unemployment and to avoid disadvantaging her two boys, who rely on her income. But she struggled. 'I went for interview after interview,' she said. No-one was willing to give her a go. 'Our government are much the same,' she reflected. 'They look after those who are capable and successful and they leave the rest behind.'


An age pensioner got in touch. She told me about her life of contribution to the nation, her four working children and her six grandchildren. Throughout her life she has done her best, paying her taxes and raising a family, but now she tells me she feels like a burden on society. She said: 'I am one of those pensioners whose sole income is the pension—no superannuation payments, nothing. I feel sad, depressed and scared for my ability to pay my way when all the cuts start.'


And yet this is a budget which, while it takes away from pensioners, gives to those at the top of the distribution. You heard nothing on budget night about the $50,000 for millionaires parental leave scheme. It is a scheme I know the member for Mitchell has commented on in the past, and he has very astutely pointed to the shortcomings in his speech. I certainly do not want to traduce your impartiality, Deputy Speaker, but when he is in the House the member for Mitchell is a brave speaker on the evident flaws in paid parental leave. I commend him for so doing.


While I am quoting members of the other side of the House it is apposite to mention that today was an opportunity for the Minister for Education to quote from an excellent book, if I do say so: Battlers and Billionaires! I am very happy to continue in the vein that the education minister pursued in question time in making very clear that this is a budget for billionaires, not a budget for battlers.


For six years the non-concessional superannuation cap has stayed at $150,000. In this budget it was raised to $180,000. Let us think for a moment about who benefits from the $40 million of new expenditure over the forwards. Who is putting more than $150,000 a year into superannuation? Say you put 15 per cent of your income into superannuation—a relatively high contribution. That would mean you would need to have more than $1 million income every year to benefit from this measure.


So the talk of heavy lifting rings hollow in a budget which puts aside $40 million for people with seven-figure incomes to benefit and spends $50,000 on the most affluent families to have children. We have, of course, some modelling that has been done on that. How good is the modelling, you would have to ask? I do not want to verify the authority of the modelling; let me go directly to the Prime Minister, who said on 17 August 2010 that NATSEM is 'the most reputable and authoritative modelling organisation in Australia'. So what does NATSEM, the Prime Minister's No. 1 modelling firm, say about this budget? The analysis carried out by Ben Phillips shows very clearly the impact on households in the budget. We will go to 2017-18 and the results of the STINMOD model in that year show that, for couples with children, those in the bottom quintile are losing 6.6 per cent of their disposable income—on average nearly a $3,000 annual hit—while those in the top quintile are getting a benefit of 0.3 per cent, or about $500. Let me also go to single parents. Single parents in the bottom quintile are losing 11 per cent of their income—nearly $4,000 a year.


Overall, the budget is clearly redistributive from the bottom to the top. Those in the bottom quintile in 2017-18 are losing 2.2 per cent of their income and those in the top quintile are gaining 0.2 per cent of their income. So, on average, there is $991 taken away from the bottom quintile and $316 given to the top quintile. What is the context in which this is being done? It is being done at a time in which we have had an unprecedented rise in inequality.


Over the past generation, earnings for the top 10 per cent have risen three times as fast as earnings for the bottom 10 per cent. The top one per cent income share has doubled. The top 0.1 per cent income share has tripled. The richest three Australians, who could fit in the back seat of a limousine, have more wealth than the poorest one million Australians, which is about the population of Adelaide. Yet this is a budget which seems apparently to have been framed in the expectation that inequality in Australia was falling rather than rising. It is the kind of budget you might expect from a Prime Minister of whom Peter Costello once wrote:


He used to tell me proudly that he had learned all of his economics at the feet of Bob Santamaria. I was horrified.


I had the pleasure last week of visiting the youth and family centre in Devonport with Senator Urquhart and speaking to some of the youth workers there. We were speaking about the overall impact of the budget, but one of the measures that concerns them in particular is the impact on twentysomething young people in Tasmania who lose their job and have to wait six months to get unemployment benefits.


There is a deep concern among these youth workers, who had between them decades of experience, that this will lead to an exacerbation of mental illness and to people sleeping rough in their cars if they have them or on the streets if they do not. It could lead people to turn to crime as a way of simply feeding themselves. The philosophy that underpins the six-month waiting time to receive unemployment benefits is the notion that unemployment is a personal failing. It is not the fault of people in the north-west of Tasmania that jobs are scarce in that part of Australia.


The reason that one in 10 people who want a job cannot find one in north-west Tasmania is not that there has been an outpouring of laziness or a lack of willingness to work; it is the structural factors—the decline of the manufacturing and forestry sectors in Tasmania, which has led to this situation. To punish Tasmanians for that is cruel and unnecessary in the extreme. Tasmania, having one of the lowest income levels in the country, will be particularly hard hit by this budget.


The burden of the budget will also fall heavily upon National Party electorates, whose incomes are on average lower than the rest of Australia. So it is quite surprising to me that members of the National Party are lining up to support a budget which is hurting their electors.


Of course, as you transfer resources from the poor to the rich, you effectively transfer resources from spenders to savers. We know this because, if we look at the spending rates by quintile, a recent Reserve Bank working paper estimated that low-income families spend all of their income while high-income families save a quarter of their income. The effect of moving $10 billion from the bottom quintile to the top quintile is you are going to decrease spending by $2½ billion. That money is going to go into savings, and you would expect to see a hit on retail trade, and that is precisely what we have seen.


A report in the Financial Review last Friday noted that retail sales fell 5.1 per cent in the seven days after the budget, following a 4.6 per cent drop in the week beforehand according to the Australian Retail Index. The ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence indicator recorded a 3.2 per cent fall in the week ending 18 May, taking the decline in the measure to 14 per cent over the past four weeks. That is the most rapid drop in that index since the global financial crisis.


The Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer confidence survey has dropped to 92.9, which is nearly a three-year low. Confidence has fallen among Labor voters, where the index is a lousy 74.9. I can tell you a secret, Deputy Speaker, retailers do not care whether the money is coming out of the wallets of Labor voters or coalition voters. So, if you tank the consumer confidence of Labor voters, you will hurt the economy.


We have a Treasurer, who is really a shadow Treasurer in drag, trash-talking the economy at every opportunity. It is showing up not just in the retail sales numbers, not just in the two consumer confidence indicators I have mentioned, but also in a survey of the Australian Institute of Company Directors. Fewer than one in three company directors now believes the federal government is having a positive impact on their business decisions and consumer confidence. As it turns out, only eight per cent expressed support for the government's proposed unfair Paid Parental Leave scheme at last year's election. The member for Mitchell is with 92 per cent of company directors—a better place to be than both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, who are with just eight per cent of company directors. The result of this is that we have a government which is not speaking proudly about the economy on the national stage. When the Prime Minister went to Davos he did not speak about the two decades of uninterrupted growth and the bipartisan reforms which have underpinned that. Instead he trash-talked his own nation on the world stage. As political scientist Judith Brett wrote recently, the government is behaving like 'a bunch of winners taking it out on the losers'. She said: 'It all feels a bit like student politics in its short-term point scoring, its payback and its intense personal antagonisms.'


The Abbott-Hockey budget not only breaks promises and fails to address the deficit; it is deeply unfair and, because of that, it is hurting consumer confidence. The impact of this will continue to be felt until the Prime Minister and the Treasurer step out of the role of attacking the economy and step into the role of supporting the economy—recognising that although, in government, they have made Australian debt levels worse, they remain relatively low by international standards. Maybe talking about a budget emergency is the member for North Sydney's way of boosting his numbers in the coalition party room, but it is having a detrimental effect on economic confidence. Unnecessary talk of emergencies is one of the factors that are driving down retail sales and hurting consumer confidence. This government should govern for all Australians, not pursue measures which in effect take from the most vulnerable to give to the most affluent. This is an unfair budget and Australia can do better. (Time expired)

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry) (17:18):  I rise to speak on these appropriation bills which will start to set the course to get Australia back into a good position. Oh for the days of being elected as a new government in 2007 facing the budget that they inherited! Here we are as an incoming government that has been given a financial mess—not one we created—to clean up. Listening to lectures by the economic academics on the other side on how wrong this budget is defies belief. To think that they actually put these thoughts into books—I am worried about the education of young people who may pick them up and actually believe in them! It is well known and well documented that, when Labor came to power, they inherited a $20 billion surplus, they inherited cash in the bank. What have we received? It is deja vu 1996—budget black holes, debt. I want to remind people of their track record while they were in power. In 2008-09 they promised a $21.7 billion surplus. It would not have been too hard considering the fact that they had already inherited a $20 billion surplus and $50 billion in the bank. But what did they deliver? A $27 billion deficit. In fact, that is a $48.7 billion turnaround in just one year. To show you the enormity of that, in 1996, when we were elected, the whole of the deficit was only $96 billion.


In 2009-10, they promised a $57.6 billion deficit, so perhaps they were starting to speak about the true Labor ways of deficit, and still only delivered a $54.5 billion deficit. They improved their bottom line by $3.1 billion. In 2010-11, they promised a $40.8 billion deficit and blew that out by $6.7 billion to a $47.5 billion deficit. In 2011-12, they promised a $22.6 billion deficit and delivered a $43.4 billion deficit, a blow-out of $20.8 billion. And the cracker is 2012-13, from these great economic minds. They promised the Australian people a $1.5 billion surplus. They had the economy under control; they knew what they were doing; the GFC had finished. Instead, what did they deliver? They delivered an $18.8 billion deficit, a turnaround of $20.3 billion.


So to stand in this House and listen to Labor lecture the coalition on economic management defies belief. In fact, they could not even lie straight in bed if they intended to. They made all these promises and all these inferences. They knew what they were doing. The thing that really galls me is that they based everything on the global financial crisis. The global financial crisis did not run for six or seven years; in fact, the main part occurred in northern Europe and the US, in the Northern Hemisphere, and the effect of that was only over months. But this Labor Party, when in government, used it as the excuse to spend, spend, spend. It is as though they believed in Mark Latham's magic pudding.


As I said right at the very outset, we did not create this economic mess, but we have been charged with the responsibility to address it and to fix it. Wishful thinking will not fix the problem. No amount of rhetoric will address the issue. Only by addressing the core fundamentals of economic management can we get this economy onto a pathway to recovery. I say this: through the MYEFO period, we were to have a deficit accumulation of $667,000 million—$667 billion. Through the measures that have been implemented by this government, it has been able to be reduced to $389 billion. The problem is not fixed; it has just been reduced. I give all credit to the Treasurer and the financial team of Mathias Cormann for being able to get it down that far.


I do not like delivering a budget where people feel pain, because when I was here during the Howard government we had the budget under so much control with growth and prosperity that we were able to hand out tax cuts and cheques and still deliver budget surpluses. This mob opposite destroyed the confidence of the Australian people, overspent, overreached and were never apologetic for it. In fact, they thought it was their God given right to continue to spend, spend and spend. If they had kept going, my great-great-great-great grandchildren, who have not even been thought of—I am not even a grandfather yet—would be paying off their debt. They would have entrenched it so hard that there would be no way to recover. It is only when you do the hard yards and the heavy lifting as a government that you can turn it around.


One of the other areas that concerns me is the fact that we are paying in excess of $12,000 million each and every year in interest—$1 billion a month. At the same time, the Labor opposition criticised the government in relation to health, in relation to Gonski and in relation to the NDIS. The interest bill alone, per annum, is more than the cost of Gonski and NDIS together. I would like to think what $1,000 million a month would do for much-needed roadworks.


The other thing I take great umbrage at is when members opposite get up and deliberately mislead the House when they say we are cutting funding for health. The facts in the budget are that New South Wales hospital funding will increase each year, from $4.6 billion in 2014-15 to $5.9 billion in 2017-18, and hospital funding for New South Wales will increase from $4.2 billion this financial year to $4.6 billion on 1 July in the 2014-15 year. So I ask myself the question. I thought that when you actually increased, when the numbers went up, that was more money going out. But I can understand the comments of those opposite, because they actually believe that their deficits are surpluses. They told us on so many occasions that budgets would keep returning to surplus. But do you know what? They had no intention at all.


There is confusion out there. It is not like me to make negative comments on my state colleagues in the New South Wales parliament. I say this of my New South Wales colleagues because I want to be honest in relation to this budget. The fear that is being whipped up amongst our pensioners and concession cardholders is palpable. The fact is that the Commonwealth will provide—no adjustment to it—twice a year pension increases by the CPI. This year the CPI will be the highest form of measurement. So that is the benefit to our seniors. We are not cutting their pensions. All of the Commonwealth government concessions stay there. They stay there for pensioner concession cardholders, they stay there for Commonwealth healthcare cardholders and they stay there for Commonwealth senior cardholders. They stay there.


According to some of the numbers in relation to the New South Wales concessions, and to the New South Wales Treasury analysis on the information provided to me, over the next four years, or the forward estimates, $732 million in public transport concessions, $323 million in council rate discounts, $643 million in water bill exemptions, $881 million in electricity rebates and $1.2 billion in fee exemptions for drivers licence tests and mobility parking schemes are to be paid out to pensioners. The federal contribution to the New South Wales government is but $107 million from 1 July this year and $450 million through the forward estimates. So if you work out that, of the $807 million that New South Wales will be paying this year, we are paying $107 million. If all of these concessions are to go, I do not think it is actually the federal government's funding that is cutting these concessions. I think that the state government should be a little bit more honest, if it intends to cut concessions, as to whose budget it is playing with—because it is not the federal budget. As I said, those concessions are primarily the responsibility of the state government. The state should be honest enough—not just New South Wales; other states have jumped in on this—to fess up to the people where the cuts are coming from and why. They are not coming because of cuts made by the federal budget.


There are a couple of key reasons why I support this budget. First and foremost, it starts to get our economy back under control, reduces the deficit and therefore reduces interest bills. Also, there are particular aspects of this budget and appropriation which will help work with mobile telephone black spots in my electorate and the rollout of NBN in my electorate in particular, as I now have three more towers going up for fixed wireless networking in my electorate. As you would know, Deputy Speaker, as you have been up in my area a number of times, the geographic and topographic restrictions in my area and the spread of the population means that the broad land mass of my electorate will not receive cable to the home under any form of government. So fixed wireless installations are the answer, and they are getting underway.


Addressing mobile phone black spots was part of the $100 million package put up by the coalition prior to the election and is now in our budget. Particularly impressive is the money that will be spent with our defence forces. After $30 billion worth of cutbacks in Defence, we are starting to catch up. There is the allocation not just for the acquisition of the joint strike fighter but also for the support services, of which $986 million will be spent at Williamtown RAAF base, upgrading facilities for them to come, making sure that our national interest and our national security are protected by the best platforms available.


Making sure that the men and women of our nation have the best possible assets and face the minimum personal risk to themselves is paramount for any government. The decision by the coalition to invest in the air warfare destroyers, the LHDs, and now the joint strike fighters as a continuation of that, shows we are providing the best assets for our people. I look forward to that investment at Williamtown because the base upgrade will mean jobs for local people, as contractors will be engaged to upgrade runways and build new buildings, and because Lockheed Martin will be engaging a lot of people to work in a private capacity through contractors as a part of the project. There will also be flow-on effects to local companies such as Varley, to name but one, that will be manufacturing parts for the joint strike fighter in and around my region.


I also welcome the road funding aspect of the budget. I congratulate the Prime Minister and also the Deputy Prime Minister for wanting this government to be known as an infrastructure building government. For too long we heard the Labor Party, in particular the member for Hunter, bang on about things like the Scone bypass. There were many years of rhetoric, but we have put the money in place and work is commencing. We have put up the hard cash in the budget—it is a line item, not just a rhetorical promise days before an election. The money is there. The former Deputy Prime Minister in the days before an election promised there would be money for the Tourle Street Bridge, but it was not in their budget. There were all the promises by the former Labor member for Newcastle but they never amounted to anything. The money is there now and work is beginning. My colleague and friend to the north, the member for Lyne, will appreciate the $16 million for Bucketts Way. That is great funding, although it should come down into my patch a little bit more. He has been doing a tremendous job up there.


We are starting to see a greater rollout of roads of importance that will fix traffic congestion. We are starting to build the infrastructure of the future. Upgrades on the now M1, which used to be the F3, and the important piece of infrastructure, the connection between the M1 and the M2, so people no longer have to battle with traffic lights all the way through to get on the M1 and M2, are critically important. The best and brightest minds in the Labor Party lecture us when it comes to the economy, but I say to my constituent, and to the Australian community: have a look at their track record. They could not even get their projections right, let alone the outcome. They promised surpluses umpteen times, and delivered only deficits in the entire period they were in government.

Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (17:33):  For all the bluster, for all the wannabe Churchillian posturing we have seen in the past couple of weeks, this is fundamentally a government that lacks the courage of its convictions. The budget makes this clear—sadly, with devastating effects for our society. It presents a deeply ideological agenda, shrinking our sense of the public good, suggesting it is something that somehow arises out of necessity—but this simply is not so. The rationale underpinning this budget of broken promises is that there is an emergency. However, there seems to be some confusion, to say the least, amongst members opposite about the exact nature of this supposed emergency. We have heard the Prime Minister claim the house was on fire and then, confusingly, that Labor itself was the fire. On the other hand, we have heard the Treasurer downgrading the fire, saying it was just the kitchen, not the house, on fire. This is a government that cannot get its metaphors straight, let alone give a true account of its actions and purpose. Since then we have heard the Prime Minister say:


You see, we had a fire, and the budget is the fire brigade. And sure, sometimes the fire brigade knocks over a few fences in order to put out the fire.


'A few fences'? What the Prime Minister refers to as a few fences being knocked over are in fact people, families, communities, neighbourhoods—all of whom quite reasonably expected their government to be on their side and not to be using dehumanising rhetoric to justify knocking them over.


Of course, there is no fire, no emergency. The notion of an emergency is one that has been refuted by every economist in the country and, I might add, in other countries too. Even the National Commission of Audit chairman, Tony Shepherd, says so. If the government cannot convince one of the budget's architects that there is an emergency, then the argument is running threadbare, to say the least. The only crisis here is in the government's credibility and it is telling that they will not directly say what they mean, but they want to divide Australia and divide Australians, to take us back to the future, before Medicare, before higher education was opened up and before modern Australia.


There are, however, some clues as to what is meant. In his second reading speech, the Treasurer said, invoking Menzies, that we are a nation of lifters, not leaners. In this budget it is the most vulnerable Australians who are doing most of the lifting. The Treasurer spoke also of fairness and intergenerational responsibility, and yet young people will bear the brunt of this government's cruelty. The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling found that low-income couples, children and single parents will lose up to 15 per cent of their disposable income when these measures are fully implemented. NATSEM Principle Research Fellow, Ben Phillips, told Emma Griffiths from ABC News that around 1.2 million families would be, on average, around $3,000 a year worse off by 2017-18. An unemployed single parent of two school-age children would lose over $4,000 a year, or nearly 15 per cent of their disposable income, by 2017. This parent would still lose this amount if they found a job that paid $40,000. A couple with two school-age children who both work to bring in a combined income of $60,000 would lose $6,000 a year of their disposable income. Even if their annual income climbed to $90,000, the loss would remain the same. Mr Phillips described this as 'a substantial hit and these are of course to the families who are already in the most precarious positions'. I am inclined to stronger language. It is taking the most from those who have the least.


In addition, research by the Crawford School of Public Policy at the ANU has found that those receiving government benefits do the heavy lifting, as the Treasurer would say, in this budget. This research found that an unemployed single parent with an eight-year-old child would lose $54 a week, 12 per cent of their disposable income. The GP tax, which is another broken promise, whatever members opposite might say, will also hit the most vulnerable the hardest, tearing down a signal Australian achievement—universal health care—and undermining great steps forward that have been taken in terms of preventative health. The Scullin electorate has the highest rate of bulk-billing in Victoria and I would like to keep it this way. Those opposite have other ideas. We have seen the Prime Minister and the Treasurer mislead the public about who would have to pay the GP tax. The coalition have also been repeating the canard that people are seeing a GP too often, using an inaccurate and inflated figure. Surely a general practitioner is better qualified than a right-wing ideologue in assessing someone's medical condition or someone's health needs. The sick are doing the lifting in this budget.


The Treasurer has spoken about values being more important than figures in this budget—and I am sure that is true; I agree with him on that—but these are the wrong values that inform these budget decisions. The values message here is all too clear: if you are poor, then do not get sick. Or, more starkly: do not be poor—or young, for that matter. And the government's message to motorists, most of us, is just as blunt: if you drive, you will pay more. If you want to get public transport in the outer suburbs, good luck, because the coalition is ideologically opposed to investing in public transport infrastructure, much to the frustration of state colleagues in Victoria, at least. People in Scullin are crying out for public transport infrastructure investment because they have no choice but to drive all too often, and now they will pay at the pump for this government's broken promise on the petrol tax and its refusal to invest in Melbourne Metro and other public transport infrastructure projects. People in Scullin see through the accountancy tricks of this self-described infrastructure Prime Minister. They see no vision to keep our cities productive and liveable.

Mr GILES:
 Finally, I note the biggest lifters of all in this budget are the world's most vulnerable, as 21 per cent in budget savings come from our foreign aid budget. The cruellest cuts of all fall on those who are unable to defend themselves or even be heard here, those who rely on us the most. That is perhaps the most shameful aspect of this budget.


The public's instinctive awareness of the unequal distribution of budget pain has been backed up by NATSEM research, which found that the temporary two per cent income tax increase for the nation's top earners would have a token impact. As Mr Phillips stated:


If you're on $200,000 … your impact would be around $400 per year, and that compares to a single-earner family … who may be losing $3,000 to $4,000 per year by 2017-18 … the top income groups - so the top 20 per cent of households - would have either no impact or a very small positive impact.


A key difference between the government's debt tax and the attacks on low- and middle-income earners is that the debt tax is temporary. The cuts to family payments and other cuts are permanent. It is also worth mentioning, and it is quite interesting, that these figures would have been included in previous budget papers but in this budget they were missing—funny that.


I want to touch briefly on the impact this budget will have on young Australians, on our future. Firstly, I regard spending on education as investment not some dead-weight cost, which is how those opposite seem to treat it. Investing in our young and sometimes our not so young through lifelong learning is how we grow our economy in large part. Making education unaffordable by crippling students with large high-interest loans does not help grow our economy. It does not enable us to get the best and brightest into the most productive vocations.


I think of the conversations I have had with constituents in recent days. One constituent was fearful and angry at the government's proposal to allow for an increase in university fees and the impact this would have on his two daughters—one at university and another aspiring to study medicine at the University of Melbourne—and on the community in general. He was of the view that, as a country, we need to ensure at least that if people apply themselves then they have the same opportunities no matter their economic background. I could not agree more with my constituent but I am disappointed that I was unable to assure him that this government would hold to that maxim.


Prior to the election, when asked about increasing university fees, the Minister for Education, the member for Sturt, said:


 … we have no plans to increase fees …


And after the election he said: 



I
'
m not even considering it because we promised that we wouldn
'
t.


So much for that: another broken promise, another callous disregard and breach of faith with the Australian community.


Secondly, in terms of young people, I note the complete cut-off of any form of support for those under 30 is simply unconscionable in a society such as ours. The Treasurer and Prime Minister insist with robotic insistence that young people will simply find a job, even though Australia's youth unemployment rate is persistently at 12 per cent. The budget projections offer no prospect of this falling in the near future. Where are the jobs to come from, let alone the investment in these young Australians?


The government has also cut programs like Youth Connections which helped young people remain engaged in education and training, and to find work. Why would the government make education more expensive, shut down youth employment programs and then cut off the safety net—any safety net—for young people? It is difficult not to arrive at the conclusion that this government just wants to hurt young, vulnerable Australians. So much for the rhetoric of intergenerational fairness and responsibility.


Last week, I spoke with members of the Whittlesea and District Greek Elderly Citizens Club about the budget—or rather, they spoke to me. I did most of the listening as they told me in heartbreaking detail how difficult their lives would become because of decisions contained in this budget. They wanted to know why, if there was supposedly a budget emergency, there were still tax concessions for the wealthy to contribute to their superannuation and, in particular, how there could be $50,000 cheques sent to millionaires. They wanted to know how a one-off pay freeze to politicians pay was fair compared to a permanent cut to the pension. I had—and I have—no answer to these basic questions of fairness, because this budget is fundamentally unjust. It is also dishonest in its pretence at fairness when there is none. Constituents I hear from are in disbelief and are angry about what this government is seeking to do, and this is compounded by the words of the member for Higgins, who unselfconsciously wrote today in The Australian Financial Review:


Selfishness has taken over from self-reliance. For our children's sake, we need to reverse the trend.


This budget entrenches and embodies selfishness. And for our children's sake, I am seeking to reverse this trend—the trend of the government's making.


I do not think people want to get into a mathematical debate about the price of everything, but people are right to be concerned with the standard and quality of living. It is no accident that in recent weeks inequality has become a hot topic right across the developed world. Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century has shone the light on intergenerational inequality—something much spoken about by this government but little attended to. And yet this government seems determined to return Australia to a gilded age of inequality, whereby if you are not born into wealth, the game of life is rigged against you. 


As Piketty writes: 


The history of inequality is shaped by the way economic, social and political actors view what is just and what is not, as well as by the relative power of those actors and the collective choices that result.


This budget before us is an enactment of the excesses of wealth and power over the poor and vulnerable. It is unjust, and the Labor Party chooses to stand against these excesses.


The Prime Minister promised—I think this was a solemn promise—that this would be a 'no surprises, no excuses' government. On Melbourne radio, the day before the election, the Prime Minister said: 'The fact is the most important thing I can do for our country in the coming months is to ensure that it is possible once more to have faith in your polity, to have faith in your government and that means keeping commitments.' I could not agree more with the then opposition leader and now Prime Minister. But, sadly, the months since that day show that the people of Australia can have no faith whatever in this government, a government that treats the promises it made before the election as mere statements of puffery which can be walked away from, if not openly laughed at, as the Minister for Education seemed to do in the chamber today.


I am holding them to account for the broken promises of their government. The Treasurer of Australia described this process as 'silly populist games'. Treasurer, let me say this: keeping your promises is not a silly populist game. It is how elected officials keep faith with the Australian people. It is fundamental to the operation of our democratic system.


The Prime Minister said that he would be prepared to take a hit in the polls for the country. How terribly noble of him! But families, students, the poor and so many others in our society are taking a hit already, a hit much larger and with a considerably more painful impact than this government's decline in polling—a decline that I am sure will continue.


The premiers and chief ministers—most of them conservative—were clearly labouring under the delusion the Abbott government would keep its promises. I think they have learned their lesson now. The Prime Minister attempted to muddy the waters in this regard, claiming this government's $80 billion cuts to the health and education budgets of states and territories would not take effect for years. It turns out, of course, they will start taking effect on 1 July. As with cuts in other areas, there is no plan for how schools and hospitals are meant to cope with these cuts. They are expected to simply find efficiencies. Only the coalition could regard a hospital as more efficient when it closes beds or a school more efficient as it sacks teachers.


While the people of Scullin will pay the price for this government's broken promises, this government will wear this budget like a crown of thorns at the next election—as it should. I was inspired by the Leader of the Opposition's rousing budget reply. It captured the real mood of the nation. I look forward to prosecuting the case against this government. But, more importantly, I look forward to making the case for a better, more inclusive government, one that keeps faith with the Australian people and one the Australian people can have faith in.


This is a cruel budget that rests on a false premise, but it is so much worse than that. It is narrow, unfair, bereft of vision or competence and deeply, dishonestly ideological. It has already defined this government, and Labor will ensure that it does not confine Australia's future.

Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (18:02):  There comes a time when you have to stand up and be counted, when all of us have to make serious decisions about our future. In particular, governments should do what they believe is right for the nation and not necessarily what they believe will be popular in the short term. That is the point we are at at the moment. I have always said that we as elected members are sent to this place not to agree with every whim of every constituent who comes to see us each day. We are sent here because we are considered to be well-rounded individuals who will make well-informed decisions on behalf of our electorates. That is what governments should do as well.


I turn to the budget. Is the budget today in crisis? There have been great discussions about that throughout the media and other places in Australia. This budget, the sixth one by Wayne Swan, that was left to us by the Labor government is $49 billion in the red. Is that a crisis? Could we as an incoming government have kicked the can down the road for a couple more years? Perhaps we could have, but by then the remedies would be more painful.


I am worried that the civilised democracies of the world are in some way failing. They are still, as Winston Churchill said, the worst form of government except for all the rest. But, in fact, it seems to be increasingly difficult in advanced democracies for governments to give people what they need rather than what they want. If governments give people what they need and the constituency turns to another party that says it will give them what they want, which is the easy way out, then those who have the strength to deliver what they need are never in power. I see this right across the democracies of the Western world. And that is why it is so important to act earlier rather than later, before the problem becomes insurmountable—and we do have enough of a problem at the moment.


Those who say that our debt is nothing to worry about, that it is not even to the average of the OECD nations, demonstrate to me that they have very little experience in managing debt and managing business debt. I was a farmer before I got to this place. Farmers say, 'We understand that there's good debt and there's bad debt.' Good debt for a farmer means that you might be expanding your agricultural operation. You might be buying the neighbour's farm, or you might be investing in land improvement. You might be investing in new machinery that will make you more efficient and grow a better crop. That is good debt because you are borrowing to grow a bigger pie. Bad debt is if you go and spend it on things like machinery you do not need, for instance, or overseas holidays, boats or beach shacks. Now, there is nothing wrong with any of those things, and many of my friends have them, but I strongly suggest that they do not borrow money to achieve those outcomes.


In a national sense, examples of good debt are when governments borrow to build roads, rail and new ports and make the nation a more prosperous place. Bad debt, but not necessarily bad spending, is when we borrow and borrow increasing amounts to deal with the day-to-day expenses of government—things like pensions, health and education. And especially bad debt—I will put in another category here—is when government borrows money and wastes it. We have seen a bit of that in the recent past: pink batts, overpriced school halls, hopelessly run low-cost-housing initiatives for the homeless and an NBN plan drawn up on the back of a coaster. Since I am probably at risk of getting completely off the subject, enough said on that particular subject at the moment.


But how have we come to be where we are? After six years of Labor government, we have total deficits of $191 billion and another $123 billion more in the pipeline. Treasury says that, without change, Australia faces deficits until 2024, and the Commission of Audit indicates that, without serious changes, they will not end then either. With no change in policy, we know that Australia would reach a peak debt of $667 billion. Remember Prime Minister Rudd's pronouncement—and he is a good friend, I am sure, of the member opposite, the member for Bruce. Mr Rudd said, 'We will be a government committed to surpluses.' But then, when he became elected and we had the GFC, he qualified that statement and said, 'We are a government that is committed to surpluses over the economic cycle.' Sixteen years plus—I just wonder: how long is that economic cycle? We are left in this mess because Labor has no plan but the fairy plan. That means that the fairies down at the bottom of the garden will do the job.


We already pay $1 billion a month in interest on the borrowings, and in another six or seven years, without change, that would double to $2 billion a month. Perhaps those who think that is manageable should consider where our economy is at the moment. Interest rates could very well double in a period like six or seven years. We are at the low end of a cycle on interest rates. Two-thirds of our debt is held overseas and so is subject to the vagaries of international exchange rates, and we, as an exporting nation, are very susceptible to volatile commodity prices. In only the last few weeks we have seen iron ore, for instance, drop below $100 a tonne, down from $130 less than six months ago. Those types of shocks for the Australian economy are very real and could happen at any stage. That is why we need to be more conservative than other nations.


We have known many of the problems facing the Australian economy for quite some time. Peter Costello's 2003 Intergenerational report laid it out on the table. We have an ageing population and a bulge which is going to put demands on our economy that we have never seen before. Costello, to his credit, is the only Treasurer up until Joe Hockey to actually have a go at trying to do something about it. It is all very new age to dump on Peter Costello now and say: 'He didn't do enough with the mining boom. Why didn't they save more money?' But at the time my memory was that there was plenty of pressure going around saying, 'Why are you taking all our taxes and running a $20 billion surplus?' So Peter Costello wisely invested in the Future Fund, around about $70 billion. That is now $88 billion. Since Costello left the Treasury, since we lost the election in 2007, what has been contributed to the Future Fund from government funds? Nothing, not another cent. Yet it was meant to target $140 billion, and that is just to meet the superannuation costs of public servants. Yes, the budget has some firm measures but none of us should believe any of the hyperbole predicting the end of the world as we know it from the usual suspects. What else can they say? Largely we are where we are now because of them. 


Take, for instance, the higher education reforms. Last year I was privileged to be part of a Liberal Party working group on online education. It was an eye-opener. The advent of the massive online open courses has been a revolution across the online world. Increasingly quality universities around the world are focusing their resources into developing quality degrees online. In the future you will see students in Australia being able to log onto their online course 24 hours a day for advice. They will have computer systems which will adapt to their learning ability, that will build new work programs around the student reflecting their weaknesses and their strengths. This will be a revolution. So instead of shopping down the end of the street at the local university for your degree, you will be able to have your degree from the very best universities in the world wherever they may be. 


We know that Australian universities, like our schools unfortunately, are slipping down the pecking order. The people who make the loudest noise would have us believe that everything is working now. It is not working now. We have got problems in the system now that we need to address. Unless we do something we are heading for a slow train wreck because much of the money that sustains our higher education system at the moment is coming from overseas students, chiefly out of Asia. If we keep slipping down that pecking order we will not have those students because increasingly they have better universities and they will have that online opportunity to get quality degrees at a reasonable price. We have to allow our universities the flexibility to adapt into this new marketplace and we really do need to have a number of quality universities in the top 20 and in the top 100 so that we can market brand Australia as an education destination.


Let us have a quick look at Medicare and the co-payment. Ten years ago we were spending $8 billion on Medicare; now it is $19 billion, more than double. The Australian population in 2004 was 20 million; now it is 23 million, an increase of 15 per cent. So we have doubled expenditure on Medicare while our population has only gone up 15 per cent. If we do nothing, by 2024 it will be $34 billion, or almost double again. I do not have to tell you the population will not be doubled by then. Clearly that is not sustainable. That is why we need to make a stand now and start to pull the budget back into order.


I have been saying throughout my electorate that the budget has something that everybody does not like and I think that is probably an indication that we are trying to spread the load across the electorate. On that basis I have been saying to Australians that we all have to bear a bit of pain and all have to do our bit for the nation. That is why I say they should consider the budget as a down payment on Australia's future. However, on the basis that we should spread the pain equally across Australia and the states and electorates, I must register my disappointment at the loss of the supplementary roads program to South Australian councils, one that cuts particularly close to home. This supplementary road program has been in place since 2004. It was recognised by John Howard and Peter Costello in those times that South Australia was the victim of a faulty formula in the distribution of the identified local roads funding program. In 2004 the government funded a three-year program to address this shortfall. In 2007 it extended it for another three years. In 2010 the then Rudd government gave it two more years and, in 2013, just one more year. You would have to think that that was just to get it past the election. To my mind, there is no way that, had the Labor Party been returned, we would ever have seen the program funded again on that basis—because it was not in the forward estimates.


Even though I understand that, in that case, it would be a new funding program for this government, I do not think we have got it right. The perception that the formula is flawed is held widely throughout South Australia. It has been in place since the early 1990s and I think that, if we are not to have the funding, at the very least we should have a review of this situation—and it should be done urgently. So I am calling on my colleagues in government to move towards that position, to fix a wrong that has existed for some time. If the South Australian councils have the opportunity to have their say and their case is found wanting, at least we can then move on from that conflict and say, 'That is behind us—you have had your opportunity and we have found that the formula is correct, so let's put up with it.' If, on the other hand, it is found to be deficient, then of course as a government interested in fairness we should do something about it.


Without taking us too far off track, in the 35 seconds I have left I would like to look briefly at what happened in Greece. While I do not liken Australia's debt situation to that of Greece, let me say that when we talk about Australian government debt we are talking about only 50 per cent of it. Fifty per cent of it is held by the states. For those that compare us to other OECD countries, they do not necessarily have state debt. In about 25 years, Greece went from not much debt to an absolute cot case and they had to cut the pension by over 60 per cent. (Time expired)

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (18:17):  For many months now, I have been bracing myself for the impact of this budget. I knew that this budget would be bad for Canberra and I warned my constituents accordingly—so much so, in fact, that the Liberal senator for the ACT accused me of scaremongering on more than one occasion. However, not even I was prepared for just how bad this budget turned out to be. The Abbott government made absolutely no attempt to hide its disdain for Canberra and for the Public Service. I knew that cuts to the Public Service were coming but, that said, I had not expected the cuts to be so harsh—some 16½ thousand jobs cut plus an increase in the efficiency dividend of 0.25 per cent. There are over 7,000 Public Service jobs to go in the next year alone. 


The impacts of this budget on Canberra will be even worse than I had feared. I have had constituents tell me that they think it could even be worse than 1996—and I will just remind those opposite of what happened to my city in 1996. In 1996, the Howard government was elected on a supposed promise to get rid of 2½ thousand public servants through natural attrition. That ended up being 15,000 public servants here in Canberra alone and 30,000 nationally. What was the impact on my town? House prices plummeted and we went through an economic slump for five years. We had two quarters of negative growth; people left town; the local shops closed down; businesses went under; bankruptcies, both non-business and business, went up. It had a huge impact not just on Canberra but on the entire capital region—Yass, Griffith, Queanbeyan, down at the South Coast and all around. It had an enormous impact, an enormous ripple effect, and it was five years before we came out of that hole. So when I am accused by Liberal senators for the ACT of scaremongering, I say to them: 'All I'm doing is reading the budget out loud.'


In addition to the Public Service job cuts, Canberra was hit with funding cuts to the ANU, the University of Canberra, NICTA and CSIRO. Canberra's world-class cultural institutions were hit with cuts that will lead to the loss of specialised and skilled staff. And in the first budget of the self-proclaimed infrastructure Prime Minister there was a distinct lack of infrastructure investment in the national capital.


This was the worst possible version of the attack on Canberra for which I had been bracing. In fact, as I said, some people have said that it is even worse than 1996 and what happened to this town then. However, what I had not expected was that this budget would also be a blatant and outrageous attack on the youth of Australia. I also did not expect a Prime Minister who had said that there is no greater friend of Medicare than him to destroy the fundamental principles of the universality of Medicare. I did not expect a Prime Minister who was a former health minister and knows full well the benefits of preventive and primary health to completely undermine the principles of preventive and primary health that exist throughout the MBS and PBS. And I did not expect a Prime Minister who said he would be the Prime Minister for Indigenous affairs to rip hundreds of millions of dollars of funding from Indigenous health.


I attended a crisis meeting last week with the Indigenous community health service provider in my electorate, Winnunga Nimmityjah. They provide a fantastic service to between 30 and 50 per cent of the region for everything from diabetes control to immunisation, child and neonatal health, GP services, dental health, physio, psychology and psychiatry—you name it. Winnunga provide a fantastic service to the Indigenous members of our community in Canberra and the capital region. At this crisis meeting they called of people not just in Canberra but from around the country I was told by those Indigenous health leaders that, through the cuts that will happen as a result of the Abbott government budget, the gap will not close but widen.


I did not expect a Prime Minister who promised prior to the election that he would make no changes to the age pension to rip funding from pensioners by lowering the indexation rate for that pension. I did not expect a government that had spent the last six years in opposition speaking about cost of living and framing every single debate around cost of living, to introduce at the first chance a budget that dramatically increases the cost of living for Australian families. Perhaps what I least expected was a government that said it wanted to fix the budget being a government that in fact created a false budget emergency so that it could be seen to be fixing the budget and not just reduce the deficit. Instead, this budget was full of new spending initiatives such as the gold plated parental leave, an $8 billion gift to the Reserve Bank and a new medical research fund.


Even though I went into this budget fearing the worst, I had obviously overestimated the Abbott government. The Australian people have seen this budget for what it is: grossly unfair, based on lies and bad for our country. If those opposite will not listen to me perhaps they will listen to my constituents. The letters I am about to read out are just some of the dozens of emails, letters and phone calls I have received over the past two weeks from Canberrans outraged by the Abbott government's budget of broken promises. The first reads:


Hi Gai


I live in Kambah and have two sons studying at a school in Canberra, one currently completing Year 12 and the other in Year 10.


Two weeks before Christmas last year I lost my job via a ""Voluntary"" redundancy (which of course wasn't really voluntary at all). I had been a dedicated and efficient public servant for the past 25 years. I have been unemployed since and although I've applied for many jobs, I have been unsuccessful in being able to obtain one (even just an interview). I am 46 years old so it will be quite some time before I can draw a superannuation pension therefore I have to work.


Before the Election, my two sons both had apprenticeships lined up. However, since and because of the Budget, both offers of apprenticeships have been withdrawn by their potential employers. This has really upset them and I worry greatly for their futures.


I don't know how we are going to survive. Really, I am so terribly worried about our future. In my 25 years as a public servant, I've never seen it this bad in Canberra.


Please FIGHT and fight hard for us against this budget and this destructive Government. They have gone in too hard, too fast and hit the people who can least afford it. I ask that you strongly oppose this Budget with all your might and trigger another Election.


The next one reads:


Dear Ms Brodtmann,


I am an expat Australian living in Asia. I was devastated to hear that the government has axed the Australian Network. I watch it almost every evening, and the AFL football on the weekend. It is my life line to home: the news, the drama series (world class) and of course the footy. I encourage my English language students to view the free language lessons available. Most importantly, it is 'Australia's presence' in the region, one of the G20, more powerful than a military base. The status it gives us, the prestige it bestows (most countries cannot have a global network), is uncountable, and surely worth more than the meagre millions being redirected. Please raise this matter with the government—Australians living and working o/s are collectively gutted! thank you for your time.


This letter reads:


Dear Gai,


What a nightmare the budget is! I understand that we, as a country, need to make changes to reduce our deficit and plan for the increase in cost of some areas of the future, but we are so disappointed that this budget is just so unimaginative and base.


The policy that distresses us most at the moment is the deregulation of the University fee structure and the resultant higher fees. Our son is currently in his second year at the University of Sydney, so he will be less affected than younger people yet to start out.


Please Gai we need you and your colleagues to do something about this terrible policy. What amendments can you propose, what parts can you block? How will our young people ever be able to afford to buy houses when they will be saddled with an $80K debt? How will they afford higher degrees and what will it do to their general spending power, none of this can be good for the economy.


We want to commend and encourage you in your fight for the best for this country.


Another letter reads:


I am an ACT resident so I write to you all as representatives with a feeling of desperation for common sense and decency in this country.


I find it hard to stomach seeing our current government present and then defend their proposed budget that targets the less well off in the country while providing what is effectively a handout to big business.


I've been unemployed here in Canberra for 12 months. So all these young people will now have to wait with zero income and then only get 6 months cover before plunging back to zero income. Sure there will always be ways to improve targeting but can the government please see and acknowledge that crime rates will be affected for instance, severe hardship will be imposed on families, depression rates increase? I have always looked to the government and paid my taxes all my life in the belief that the money is a fair contribution to society and those on the margins and should always be there. You don't balance a budget by kicking unemployed people in the guts and handing big sums in a Paid Parental Leave scheme that no-one else but Tony Abbot was calling for!


Another one reads:


This is the first time I have written to a politician since I was at university—a long time ago—but I feel I have a moral duty to say something now. As a sixth generation Australian I am appalled at what the government has done.


I see a government for the top 3 % in our society looking for the best possible way to fund reductions in their private and corporate income tax by reducing support for the most vulnerable in our society. The measures the government has announced are designed to create an underclass denied the long term health, education and social benefits we, as citizens of one of the wealthiest countries in the world, should make available to everyone.


How can it benefit our future to create an underclass of the chronically ill, under educated and disaffected? In this technological society there is and will continue to be fewer and fewer places for the unskilled. Why create more of them and how will these people work into their 70s? This budget will end any ambition that Australia might become 'the clever country'. It certainly would have ensured that I, as a policeman's daughter in the 1970s, would never have got to university. I am perfectly cognisant of the fact that we have an aging and longer living population but dumping half of them on a scrap heap of need doesn't seem to be a moral response. The ridiculous levy will be felt by few and paid by less.


These changes won't affect me much but they will affect my view of my country. Any society is judged on the basis of how it treats its weakest members. The Prime Minister has cast his attempt to change the nature of this country as an 'act of political courage'. Maybe, but it is not an intelligent act nor a goodhearted one. I would prefer to describe it as an 'act of political bastardry'. As my elected representative I am requesting that you do everything in your power to prevent these appalling assaults on our social fabric—even if that means we end up going to the polls again this year. 



And another reads:


Hi Gai,


I'm not normally one to write to politicians, however I feel in this case I need to express my concern with the way the country is being managed.


I am 28 years old, single with no children, earn around 100K per year with the federal APS and have private health insurance. I pay my fair share of taxes, contribute to the community through volunteer work and actively represent the Australian culture by being fair and equal to others.


However, I am greatly concerned with the recent federal budget and the impact it is going to have on me and the Canberra community.


Firstly, I am concerned with the large-scale public sector cuts being disproportionately thrown at the Canberra community. I am worried about the flow on effect this will have on the local economy including retail and hospitality, as well as the housing market, thus creating a mass exodus of locals finding greater stability in other areas of the country. I am so sick of having to defend my profession when I speak to non-locals, or continually view the Liberal Party's smearing of the public sector as lazy fat cats who sit ripe on high incomes. That 100K I'm earning—do you know how many Christmas's I have spent away from family, or holidays I have sacrificed to meet the government's policy objectives, or the late nights spent worrying about a deadline. I can assure you that I'm definitely not sitting around, smoking a cigar enjoying the so called lazy fat cat lifestyle of the public service.


Secondly, I am concerned about the federal government's withdrawal of $80 billion in state/territory funding for health and education, and the possibility that this may position the state and territories in a situation where they request an increase in the GST. Thankfully I am earning quite a nice salary, especially for my age, however how do you expect the general population to survive in this country when gas and electricity is going up, fuel prices continue to rise (especially in Canberra), healthy food is too expensive for a single income let alone a family, and on top of that the GST may rise.


Gai, how are people supposed to survive?


Lastly, I am concerned with the increase to the fuel excise in a city that heavily relies on cars because of an inadequate public transport system. Will the light rail project continue now that the ACT economy is going to lose funding?


I am very concerned about the way Canberra has been hit with this budget, and as a member of the voting public—a taxpayer and contributing member to the Canberra community—I want to ensure that my concerns are heard and acknowledged, and represented as necessary.


To those opposite, I implore you: if you will not listen to me, listen to the people of Canberra and of Australia. The people who have contacted me are not necessarily Labor supporters; they are not necessarily political. They are just ordinary Australians, ordinary Canberrans, who have been outraged by this budget, who have been betrayed by a Prime Minister who promised that he would be true to his word.


This is not only a budget of broken promises but a budget of broken dreams. It is a budget that will both entrench and widen the gap between the rich and the poor. It is a budget that is unfair and, to quote one of my constituents: 'devastating for Canberra and is a budget that asks Canberrans to do the heavy lifting for the nation'. (Time expired)

"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2014-05-26,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (18:32):  This is a tough budget; it had to be. To make an analogy of the mortgage on an Australian house: the house had been paid for, the mortgage had been paid off. We had savings in the bank but, in the space of six years, slowly, we as a nation had all our savings spent for us. The house had been remortgaged, then mortgaged again for another five years so that the mortgage was greater than the value of the house. The then government mortgaged it a bit more and started paying off the bill with a credit card. That is such a good analogy. That is the situation we are in. That is why this budget had to be tough. 


The coalition promised to stop the boats and to end the waste. We promised to build the roads of the 21st century and, most importantly, we promised to get the budget back under control. We have introduced and implemented policies necessary to stop the boats. We have not had any arrivals for over five months. We have begun investing in Australia's biggest infrastructure program, with $50 billion to be spent up to 2019. We are cutting red tape and getting rid of the waste. Earlier in this parliament we introduced measures to cut over $700 million in federal red tape costs. We are getting the budget back under control.


The reality is, if we had continued on that spending binge, wasting money on things like school hall rip-offs, broken-down laptops and with billions of dollars in deficit, our gross debt at the end of 2024, just 10 years in the future, would have reached $667 billion. The interest rate on our current debt equates to $12 billion a year, and that is rising. That is an amazing amount of money.


In the last three governments of Rudd, Gillard and Rudd, the millions, which were often quoted as huge amounts of money, slowly rolled into billions. People have got blase about debt. But what could we have done with $12 billion? We could have been building a four-lane divided highway from Sydney to Brisbane every year. We could have built 40 state-of-the-art regional base hospitals. Better still, over the last six years we could have established two or three of the Medical Research Future Fund that we are creating.


There are short-term measures which have changed the situation for the nation, but they had to be made so that there can be long-term repair. We want to be back on track to being a competitive nation, capable of tackling the challenges that the world throws up. We are dependent, to a large degree, on China's economy. What would happen to our economy if there was turmoil in China? There was the Arab Spring. What would happen to our economy if there was a 'Chinese Spring'? Who knows what could happen? We are building infrastructure that will deliver long-term productivity gains. It will create employment, with a run-off in associated industries. We will be in a much better situation to cope with any international economic shocks.


Contrary to Labor's misinformation campaign, pensions will continue to rise. They will go up twice a year for the term of this parliament according to the current indexation. Then they will go up according to CPI. Education spending will increase over the term of this parliament. To put things in perspective, annual assistance to the states for public hospitals will increase by more than nine per cent each year over the next three years and then four per cent in the fourth year. That is a massive increase of state expenditure. The funding for public hospitals will increase by more than $5 billion, from $13.8 billion this year to $18.9 billion in 2017-18. Overall health spending will increase by $10 billion or 16 per cent from $64.5 billion to $74.8 billion in 2017-18. Plus, we will have created the Medical Research Future Fund, which will itself deliver great efficiencies in the way we deliver health care. Medical research is where all the medical advances that we take for granted come from.


Also, contrary to the misinformation campaign that has hit the airwaves since the budget was released, there will be a record recurrent funding investment of $64.5 billion in schools over the next four years from the federal government. As I mentioned, the pension is not being reduced. It will increase again this September. Age pensioners will be better off as well because, by cutting the carbon tax, that annual cost of $550 for every household will be reduced. The energy supplement will continue. The pension supplement will continue.


The demographics of the nation are changing. By 2035, one in three of us will live to be 100. By that time, there will be a 400 per cent increase in those over 85 years of age. We have to make things sustainable. The pension age was already changed to 67 by the previous government for future years, from 2023. But we are giving a whole generation of people the chance to plan for their pension eligibility age by 2035. The reason for that is that there will be twice as many of us who are in the state of requiring government support. At the moment 80 per cent of people over 65 end up relying on a pension. If that doubles with the increases over time it would simply not be sustainable. The previous government recognised this and governments overseas have realised this. We have to take the hard decisions now.


The other thing is that just in this four-year term our debt—and I have mentioned the 10-year debt projections—if we sat back and did nothing, which some members on the other side of the House have recommended we do, we would be left with another $123 billion on top of the $200 billion we already owe. By means of this budget and the tough decisions, that $123 billion projected debt will be halved to $60 billion, and the 10-year debt will be down to $389 billion.


These are massive amounts of debt, and if we do not address these changes we will be in the situation of Greece, Ireland, Spain and all those nations that for the last 20 or 30 years have been living off the credit card. Most of these nations have got to the stage where their debt is so great that it is beyond the means of any nation to get rid of. So they are committed to paying massive amounts of interest on the international borrowings, virtually forever. Nevertheless, all those nations that I have mentioned have redressed this and are trying to get their debt under control. It is the same in the UK; they were in a situation where they realised that things had to change. People should not be afraid of change if they realise it is for their long-term sustainability. We, as a generation, cannot saddle our children and our children's children with paying perpetual amounts of the annual budget of the nation in interest payments.


The infrastructure spend that I have mentioned is a massive bill. Just in my electorate of Lyne, we will have $1.129 billion spent on the Pacific Highway dual lane expansion. That will deliver at least 1,000 direct jobs and probably the same number again in indirect jobs. It will bring our part of the mid-North Coast closer to the Brisbane market. Transport costs will shrink. The produce that we bring into the region, the product that we get out and our tourism products all rely on the Pacific Highway, so it will be a massive benefit.


The Bucketts Way, the artery of commerce in the south-west of the electorate, has been long ignored by the last government. They made all sorts of pronouncements about improving it, but we are actually delivering $17.8 million, including GST, to the Gloucester council and the Greater Taree City Council in the term of this government.


We have announced increases to black spots and Roads to Recovery funding, which are essential. You should see the state of some of the roads in the regions. They no longer have a continuous bitumen surface; they are a collection—a mosaic—of patches for stretches of hundreds and hundreds of metres. There is a clean sheet every now and then, rather than the other way round, with an odd patch every now and again. And that leads to road safety improvement. Financial assistance grants are quarantined to councils, so they will continue.


The deregulation of the higher education sector will mean that there is an expansion of the demand-driven system and, with the budget estimates and education assessments, hopefully that will lead to another 80,000 students being enrolled in education beyond school. The deregulation and the changes the budget bring in mean that it will be delivered through alternative pathways into universities. Colleges with diplomas, associate diplomas and associate degrees, of which there are several in my region, will have students who can access Commonwealth supported places because we have expanded the number of institutions that attract Commonwealth funding. As well, the existing institutions that have the ability to raise fees will be putting into their own funds for Commonwealth scholarships. One dollar in five of the money they raise from the deregulation will go into that. So people with low-socioeconomic capability and standing will have another fund to enhance their entry into higher education.


Contributions from the savings from the co-payment will be delivered into the Medical Research Future Fund. What a great initiative. Medical research is something that Australian scientists are really good at. If that can be used in some of the existing programs, the research can be sped up. New avenues of research can be developed. There is so much intellectual capital in the scientific, particularly in the biomedical and the medical, space. This will be an area of growth. If you look at all the medical scientists in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, the major centres, the spin-off to the economy is staggering. Talk about growing. The best businesses to grow in your own region are those that are already there. People look for these magic new industries, and they do come along all the time, but the quickest way to expand things is to expand what you do now. That is what that Medical Research Future Fund will do.


There are many challenges that the nation faces, but this budget is addressing them. All the social good and every program that Australians rely on will come into question. Can you imagine if we do not make the tough decisions now? Can you imagine if we did, as one of the previous members mentioned, kick the problem down the road, which countries overseas have done for decades? Their chickens have come home to roost. We have to make the tough decisions, and that is what this budget does. But they have been responsible, they have been measured and they are necessary. I commend these bills to the House.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (18:47):  Firstly let me say to the previous member that I have been an observer of budgets since I first came into this place in 1987, and this budget perpetrates the greatest fraud on the Australian community of any budget I have witnessed or known of. New members into this place need to really understand what a fraud this budget is. It is based on lies as a result of announcements made by the Prime Minister before the election that there would be no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts to pensions and no plans to increase university fees, and that Tony Abbott would be the infrastructure Prime Minister and the Prime Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Nothing could be further from the truth. All this budget does is perpetrate a fraud upon the Australian community.


Australians are rightly, as the Leader of the Opposition said, shocked and angry—shocked by the brutality of the government's attack on our way of life and angry at a Prime Minister who pretended to be on our side. We just need to look at the various items in the budget to get a really good appreciation of what that means. Health should not be determined by your wealth. However, a GP tax or more expensive medicines will put more pressure on families struggling to make ends meet. If people do not go to the doctor because of this tax, the health of people will fail, with more acute presentations. PBS medicines will also incur, of course, a co-payment.


Let me be very clear. We already know that people have taken the decision, as a result of the budget announcement, not to go to the doctors. We have heard this from doctors in Western Sydney. We know it from doctors in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health services. This is what is happening. People have been scared by this announcement. If the sickest and poorest of Australians do not see a doctor, that means the sickest and poorest Australians will die early. That is what will happen as a direct result of this budget. This government has failed one of its prime responsibilities, to care for its people, and it will of course cost us more in the long run.


Hospitals servicing the people of Lingiari will also face a $2.8 billion cut over five years. These hospitals are already bursting at the seams and struggling within their own budgets. The Northern Territory government has cut funding in health and education at the same time as this government has done the same thing. The Prime Minister lied to voters before the election, and his lies will now hurt poorer families and the most disadvantaged.


Lingiari schools will face cuts of up to $181.7 million over the next five years. From 2018, schools will be further handicapped by reduced indexation payments. University student loans will have to be repaid earlier with a substantial increase of interest payments from a current 2.25 per cent, and they will be asked to cough up 60 per cent of the cost of going to university.


Let us be very clear about this. People who come from regional Australia, from remote Australia, from my electorate—all of the Northern Territory except Darwin and Palmerston, including Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands, 1.34 million square kilometres, a very dispersed population—will be the most disadvantaged by these hideous attacks upon their livelihood and upon the way of life that they experience. University will become less of an attractive option, and regional universities such as Charles Darwin University will suffer as a result of the announcements which have been made in this budget. The result for young people in Lingiari will almost certainly mean a decline in the numbers of those interested in pursuing a tertiary education at Charles Darwin University or other universities around the country.


Lingiari pensioners, of course, will be hit as every other pensioner in Australia will be hit as a result of the announcements made in this budget. Now they will have to work longer and then receive a pension, if they are lucky, which is significantly reduced due to a change in the indexation system from the current 27.7 per cent of average male weekly earnings to a new, lesser, CPI index. Over time, that will cause a dramatic hit to their pocket, and they know it. This government is trying again to perpetuate a lie that somehow or another, because it will index pensions continually and move the CPI, it will not make a difference. The government knows it makes a difference. Old-age pensioners in this country know it makes a difference. Any reasonable Australian will understand that it will make a difference.


And of course the government have perpetrated the same hideous attack upon service pensioners. I cannot believe what the government have done, yet they have the hide to say that they are a friend of Australian Defence Force personnel and veterans. They are far from that.


Indeed, when we look at job seekers, we see people with no income support for six months. What will job seekers under 30 years old do with no income or support for six months? Who is going to support them in a place like Lingiari with dispersed populations, overcrowded houses, no jobs and no training opportunities? Who is going to do this? The mind boggles at the inane way in which this government has formulated this budget, because it has attacked the most vulnerable and, as the Leader of the Opposition said, it will create an underclass. And, of course, under-25-year-olds will lose their Newstart allowance to go onto the much lower youth allowance. This will put enormous pressure upon families not only in Lingiari but across this country.


Then we heard today about infrastructure. We heard the Deputy Prime Minister get up in question time today and pout on about how he had done such magnificent things in the seat of Lingiari as a result of this budget. The only infrastructure money of any substance for my electorate of Lingiari appears to be $45 million for six strategic bush roads. These were announcements which I made previously and which were accounted for in the forward estimates from the former Labor budgets. There were no new announcements—no new announcements—made for Lingiari. Overall, the Territory, with a sixth of the Australian landmass, will receive for infrastructure around $670 million over 10 years—$67 million a year—out of a national budget of $126 billion. Even the ACT will get $700 million, more than the Northern Territory. Have an understanding, Prime Minister, of the infrastructure needs of remote and regional Australia. You clearly do not, and certainly the Deputy Prime Minister has no idea.


Aboriginal people of Lingiari make up 40 per cent of the electorate's population. They have been particularly let down by this budget and by their own senator and minister, Senator Scullion. He is responsible as a senator and a cabinet minister for advocating for the Territory and its interests at the cabinet table. He has failed miserably. Senator Scullion sat by and watched $534 million be ripped out of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs budget? How can you be serious about closing the gap when you rip $534 million of program money from these budgets? $160 million over three years has been ripped out of the Aboriginal health budget. They have put that money into their health future fund. If you were going to take this money out because you thought you could find some efficiencies, you would invest the money back into front-line services. That is not what this government have done. They have abandoned Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians through these hideous cuts. Cuts to child care, arts centres, drug, alcohol and tobacco education and mental health programs will have an enormous impact on Australia's first peoples. In addition, Aboriginal legal services will have to endure cuts of $13 million over four years, which will result in more Aborigines going to jail for what will likely be trivial offences like nonpayment of fines. What a shame. Shame on Senator Scullion and shame on the Prime Minister and the Treasurer.


Indigenous health is something I know something about. I know a lot about some things, but this is something I know a particular amount about. The Abbott government need to come clean about the real impacts of these deep cuts to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. They have clearly failed to appreciate the serious repercussions of the cuts they have made and of the new taxes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health outcomes.


The evidence is undisputed. Smoking contributes to a four-year difference in the life expectancy of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Smoking contributes to 20 per cent of deaths of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. It directly causes a third of the burden of cardiovascular disease and cancer in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Yet this government, through this budget, is cutting funding to the anti-tobacco campaigns in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.


We know already that in cutting the Preventive Health Agency they are making a mockery of their supposed concern for the lives of ordinary Australians let alone Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. They have made it very, very clear that this fundamental, very important and essential part of our health infrastructure—the Preventive Health Agency—has no place in their future. We all know about the tsunami of diabetes which is confronting us. This organisation is very important, yet it is nothing to this government. They know that chronic disease will only be improved by encouraging people to seek treatment, get health checks and access preventative health services such as these smoking education campaigns.


The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health service will have to absorb the massive cost of the co-payments. Many will be unable to cover the cost of vital health services, such as pathology, imaging and a range of specialist services that are often required with complex health issues. The people who will suffer are the sickest and poorest people in this country, and those are the people for whom we are saying we want to close the gap on life expectancy. They are going to be hit hard by these proposals. We know that they are less likely to seek assistance through health services.


Let me talk about petrol for a moment. Constituents in my electorate pay on average more than 22c per litre for fuel than the national average bowser price. That is if you live in a city like Alice or Katherine. If you live in a remote community like Numbulwar or Alpurrurulam, before this heartless budget you would have expected to pay more than $2.55 a litre. This price will increase rapidly over the next four years because of the indexation arrangements for petrol they are going to reintroduce—and there will be no relief from this government. Again, the people who most need assistance in our community are going to be disadvantaged.


The majority of businesses in Lingiari are small businesses and they will not benefit from any of the company tax cuts the Prime Minister has made for his mates at the big end of town. Lingiari small businesses will simply see their business inputs, in particular fuel prices, continue to rise.


Then there is the hit to families. The Prime Minister said in May 2011:


A dumb way—


to cut spending—


would be to threaten family benefits or means test them further.


What has he done in this budget? In this budget of cruel surprises it is no real surprise that he has slugged family payments big time. We know what this means. The cut in family tax benefit end-of-year supplement will result in up to $306 per year less to spend at that important time for families when expenses mount up for Christmas. Lingiari Aboriginal families have over 20 per cent more 0-14-year-olds than the national average. They will be the hardest hit. Yet he has got billions of dollars to spend on the really subversive Paid Parental Leave scheme. What a way to spend your money. What a priority this government has got: feed the pockets of millionaires and don't look after families who are most in need. That is clearly what this budget is designed to do. It will create an underclass.


Lingiari will also feel the pain caused by cuts to local government from Regional Development Australia funding. In particular I am disappointed with the defunding of a project partnership between the Katherine Town Council and Godinymayin Yijard Rivers Arts and Cultural Centre to deliver stage 2 of the centre in the Katherine cultural precinct. This project was going to provide increased opportunities for income generation, community engagement, employment and training. You just cannot continue to perpetuate this fraud upon the Australian community. You promise one thing before the election and do entirely the opposite after it. 


Let me talk about veterans' affairs for a moment. The Prime Minister and the current Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Ronaldson, have stated many times that our veterans deserve to be recognised for their unique contribution to Australia. I agree wholeheartedly. Yet what he has done in this budget is cut the veterans' affairs budget by more than $100 million, down from Labor's record $12.5 billion in our 2013-14 budget. The coalition will scrap the senior supplement for veterans who hold a Commonwealth seniors card or gold card, which helps pay for energy costs, telephone and internet costs and water and sewerage expenses. In another blow to veterans, military and other untaxed superannuation income will be counted as income when applying for a Commonwealth seniors card and the deeming rate thresholds will be moved, hitting the part pension of some veterans with small amounts of assets.


You cannot continue to tell these fibs. The people of Lingiari are reeling after this budget. We need to understand that this parliament and this government have an obligation that we should never forget the fair go, we should never forget that Australia is a country where all can share and none should be left behind. But that is precisely what this government does. It will leave people behind, it will create a new underclass. It is a shame on this government, and every member of the government should be most concerned about what this budget will do to the way of life of so many hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Australians.

Mrs McNAMARA
 (Dobell) (19:02):  On 5 December 2013 I had the privilege of speaking in this place for the first time. On behalf of the people of Dobell I outlined my vision for a future with hope, reward and opportunity. I spoke of the need for the stable jobs that provide meaningful work essential to allowing us to take out long-term investments in our homes and our future. A stronger economy is the key to almost everything we wish for as a community. This government's first budget corrects our nation's course, setting of us on a path towards more jobs, higher wages, better services and a stronger and more cohesive community. These objectives drive our economic action strategy. We must repair the budget and build a strong and prosperous economy for all Australians. 


In my maiden speech I spoke about my desire to see Dobell prosper, my desire for a region home to a vibrant and healthy community well supported and connected through coordinated services and infrastructure, a region with more local employment and quality investment, a region where residents have choice. This budget forms the foundation upon which a stronger Dobell will be built. This government is getting on with the job of building a stronger economy so that everyone can get ahead. This means abolishing the carbon tax, ending the waste, stopping the boats and building the roads of the 21st century. But we must never forget why we were elected to do this. Labor's legacy to Australians is 200,000 more unemployed, gross debt projected to rise to $667 billion, $123 billion in cumulative deficits, more than 50,000 illegal arrivals by boat, the world's biggest carbon tax and a $1 billion per month interest bill. We simply could not continue as we were when Labor and the Greens were in charge. We could not afford to continue paying the mortgage on the credit card to the tune of $1 billion per month. We are doing what we said we would do.


The budget calls on everyone to contribute, to join and grow the workforce, to boost productivity and to help build a stronger economy with more investment. The government is making a historic investment in the 2014-15 budget to get on with building Australia's infrastructure. A core element of the government's economic action strategy is the commitment of an additional $11.6 billion for the Infrastructure Growth Package. By 2019-20 the Commonwealth's total investment in infrastructure will be $50 billion.


The people of Dobell and the Central Coast have long been calling for their fair share of infrastructure funding. For too long our needs were ignored. For six long years under Labor, the people of Dobell were neglected. Dobell will benefit from this government's commitment to build the infrastructure of the 21st century with $7.15 million for local infrastructure projects. Importantly, this investment will be geared towards enhancing our local economy, driving jobs growth and greater private investment in our region. 


As per our election commitment, we are providing $1 million to commence the Tuggerah Sports Precinct—a project that will deliver economic benefits to the Central Coast through increased sports tourism and, importantly, more jobs. The Tuggerah Sports Precinct will not only enable the hosting of regional and national sporting events; it will also provide local sporting clubs access to high-quality sports fields and facilities for local competitions. Our investment has been welcomed by local sporting organisations. Mr Ian Robilliard, Managing Director of the Central Coast Academy of Sport, welcomed our commitment, stating: 'The Tuggerah Sports Precinct is a much needed facility for the region and is well overdue.' Country Rugby League Infrastructure and Game Development Officer Mr Graham Boland endorsed this project stating: 'The development of this facility will allow for large-scale events and add immeasurably to the economic, social and health benefits of the Central Coast Community.' As the member for Dobell, this investment will help realise my determination for Dobell to become the sports tourism capital of New South Wales. 


In addition to supporting sports tourism, it is vital that we invest in and enhance existing infrastructure to support our local economy. The Norah Head boat ramp is Dobell's only sea access boat ramp. The boat ramp plays a vital role in supporting our tourist economy, drawing locals and visitors alike to our magnificent beaches and coastline. Our $700,000 investment will enable Wyong Shire Council to complete necessary repair work on this $3.25 million project. The Mayor of Wyong Shire Council, Councillor Doug Eaton, recently congratulated the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, Jamie Briggs, for visiting Norah Head in April to sign the funding agreement. The fact that the minister was able to observe firsthand the difference this money will make to the community, who will now be able to enjoy a safe, accessible and functioning boat ramp, was invaluable.


Investment in infrastructure is key to addressing our future growth needs. It is anticipated that the Central Coast will grow by an additional 100,000 people by 2031, requiring 45,000 new local jobs. The growth area largely falls within the Dobell electorate; therefore, as a government, it is crucial that we work with state and local governments to effectively meet growth in infrastructure demands. Our growth plan for the Central Coast addresses this need by providing funding for the Ridgeway and Jensen roads—two roads under pressure as a result of our rapid population growth. Our $2.75 million investment will enhance the safety and quality of these roads, affording motorists safer access to the growth suburbs of Lisarow and Ourimbah via the Ridgeway, and the lakeside suburbs of Tuggerawong and Wyongah via Jensen Road. Investment in Central Coast roads is part of this government's commitment to provide necessary infrastructure to support commuter access to employment.


In addition to these local road projects, the government will deliver substantial investment to ease the commute for the 30,000-plus Central Coast residents who travel daily outside the region for employment. After years of talk, this government will build the NorthConnex, delivering the missing link between the M1 and M2. NorthConnex is a significant project for the Central Coast and for the people of Dobell. But this is about more than reducing travel times; this is also importantly about investment and jobs. The budget commits $195.8 million for the M1 Productivity Package. This funding includes the widening of the Ml to six lanes between the Tuggerah and Doyalson interchanges. Together with the NorthConnex, these measures will deliver shorter and safer travelling options for Central Coast commuters, meaning they spend less time in traffic and more time with their families.


While this infrastructure assists those who commute for work, we must remain steadfast in our determination to strengthen the local economy and provide a broader range of job opportunities in Dobell. For too long our region has suffered an unemployment rate well above the national average. Coupled with low school completion rates and under-representation in tertiary education, it is crucial that we encourage and assist people to earn or learn. This government is delivering on its commitment of $2.7 million towards the development of skills and training facilities in Dobell to enable our young people to learn in order to earn. Changes to welfare payment eligibility will strengthen the incentive for young unemployed people to work or pursue education and training opportunities.


Mature job seekers will also benefit from this government's initiatives to encourage workforce participation. Restart aims at assisting those over 50 who have been receiving income support for over six months. Employers will receive a $10,000 incentive to employ a person aged 50 and over for up to two years. Potentially, this could benefit approximately 1,100 people in Dobell. Together with the government's Job Commitment Bonus and Relocation Assistance to Take Up a Job, job seekers should feel secure in pursuing employment opportunities. The best form of welfare is work and, where people are able to work, they should be encouraged and supported to do so. The higher education initiatives outlined in the budget support alternative pathways to higher education by providing direct financial support to all students studying diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degree courses. For young people in Dobell this means, for the first time, those studying a diploma through TAFE will receive the same financial assistance from the government as a student studying a bachelor degree at university.


The government will establish a Commonwealth scholarship scheme to assist disadvantaged students by providing support and encouragement to undertake tertiary education. Undergraduate students will no longer have to pay fees to access FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. 


I acknowledge that not all young people choose to study at university and those who chose to undertake an apprenticeship should equally be supported. The introduction of Trade Support Loans for apprentices will encourage more young people to undertake a trade and importantly complete their trade. Apprentices will have access to $20,000 over the entire period of their training. Apprentices who successfully complete their training will be rewarded with a 20 per cent reduction from the total of their loan. Like the HELP loans for tertiary students, the loans will be repayable once apprentices are earning a sustainable income. This is real support for apprentices which will provide a stronger incentive for young Australians to complete their apprenticeship and for many the opportunity to start their own business. 


Small business is the backbone of the Dobell economy—collectively, they are our largest employer—therefore support for small business is essential in enhancing local job opportunities. The budget contains a series of measures that will assist small business operators, including the establishment of the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. The Ombudsman will act as a one-stop-shop for small business when dealing with the federal government, thus reducing compliance costs and red tape. This enables small businesses to get on with the job of attending to their customers, to improve their productivity and to grow, generating greater job opportunities.


The former Labor government failed Australian small business, inter alia imposing the world's biggest carbon tax, which drove up costs and destroyed jobs. We are providing real assistance to small business. We are abolishing the carbon tax and reducing the burden of unnecessary red tape and we demonstrated this through parliament's first-ever regulation repeal day, which we held on 26 March this year. Small businesses will play a key part in the Abbott government's Economic Action Strategy to build a strong and prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia. 


Above all else, this budget delivers on our election commitments. In Dobell this includes $3.3 million to clean up and improve the water quality of Tuggerah Lakes. The Tuggerah Lakes Estuary Management Plan will receive this funding over three years to improve the water quality by expanding the upgrade of stormwater treatment zones, including the removal of sediment and other organic matter and the upgrading of gross pollutant traps. The main aim of this plan is to provide direction for the ongoing management of Tuggerah Lakes and its catchment in order to ensure the sustainability of its ecological systems. The people of Dobell care about Tuggerah Lakes, and this funding is an important part of this government's commitment to a healthier environment.


Dobell will directly benefit from the Green Army program. In Dobell, the program will improve our local environment by providing funds for dune restoration and rehabilitation at The Entrance North, along with practical environmental works to clean up the Tuggerah Lakes foreshore and enhance the Central Coast wetlands. In addition to providing support for our natural environment, the Green Army program supports Dobell job seekers through providing opportunities for young people to gain training and experience in areas of environmental and heritage conservation, and to explore careers in conservation management. The Green Army will be Australia's largest-ever team supporting environmental action across the country, building to 15,000 young Australians by 2018.


We have the plan to fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster. While this has been a tough budget, it is also a visionary budget which delivers on the commitments we took to the Australian people at the last election. First and foremost, we said that we would get the budget back on track, invest in job-creating infrastructure, and support local small business and job creation. We are doing what we said we would do, and we are doing it because it is absolutely necessary for the long-term welfare of our great nation. This budget lays the foundation for a stronger economy by reducing projected debt by almost $300 billion over the next decade. Our economic action strategy will build a strong, prosperous economy and a safe, secure Australia. This budget delivers for Australia and it delivers for Dobell. This budget is building a strong foundation for all Australians to get ahead. As I stated in my maiden speech, a stronger economy is the key to almost everything we wish for as a community. I am pleased to be delivering on our election commitments to build a more prosperous Dobell and a more prosperous Australia.

Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin) (19:16):  In thinking about what I would say about this budget in the debate on the appropriation bills, I did not really know where to start because it is just all so bad. But I want to stand up for the people of my electorate of Franklin and for the people of Tasmania. This budget is a terrible list of broken promises and wrong priorities. In fact, it is built on broken promises. It is asking the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our communities to do the heavy lifting.


The budget emergency touted by those opposite is not real. They doubled the deficit in their first six months in office. And it is about wrong priorities, because they have also got their rolled-gold Paid Parental Leave scheme—which, admittedly, they have watered down a bit, but which is still there and is $50,000 for wealthy people in our community.


Those opposite have manufactured their own budget crisis with this budget because people out there are frightened and scared. They are not spending money and they are not going to the GP. They are not doing these things because they have been frightened by this budget and the harsh cuts that will affect pensioners, families, young people, students—all of them on low incomes; many of them vulnerable and disadvantaged. Australia has a AAA credit rating, which we heard the Prime Minister actually admit to today, and we have low levels of debt compared to other countries. So there is no real budget emergency, other than the one that those opposite have confected.


The priorities are so wrong in this budget. The Prime Minister promised before the election that there would be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no changes to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS. He also promised no new taxes and no tax increases. And of course all of those promises have been broken.


Particularly frightening for my home state of Tasmania are the cuts to health and education. In the budget papers, page 7 of the glossy says that $80 billion in savings will be made. They will be taken away from Australian schools and hospitals over the next 10 years. We have even heard that this money is not real. But it is actually in their budget papers, so I am assuming it was real if they are making it a saving. Tasmania's share of this is more than $1.6 billion. The Tasmanian state budget is around $5 billion per annum. I am not quite sure where the Prime Minister expects Tasmania to find $1.6 billion or more over the next decade. There is $676 million in cuts to education—the Gonski reforms that were going to happen in years 5 and 6. That is money ripped out of every school in Tasmania and many schools in regional parts of my state. There is over $1 billion in health being cut. This will impact on hospitals in Tasmania.


Some of these cuts of course start on 1 July this year and will indeed hurt many Tasmanians. In fact, this budget is so bad for Tasmania that it has actually made many of the front pages. It has even made editorials. When you have newspapers in Tasmania saying things like, 'The states face the ugly political prospect of savagely cutting health and education services or looking for more revenue, and the most obvious revenue stream for states and territories is to increase the GST or to broaden its base,' you know the states are in trouble. Of course, we heard there would be no changes to the GST from the Prime Minister as well. Tasmania would be severely impacted if there were a change to the distribution of the GST to the tune of more than $700 million each and every year.


The Premier of Tasmania, Will Hodgman, has said in response that if there are increased demands placed on the state of Tasmania there will need to be commensurate support services provided. Of course there will not be any. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister have simply said: 'That's it. The states can deal with it on their own as they should.' But where exactly will the money come from? Are the states and territories going to have to make cuts to health and education right across the country? They have not only broken a promise that there would be no cuts to health and education; they have also left a real funding dilemma for the state. It is in fact a massive problem right across the country. 


Then of course there is the GP tax—$7 to visit a GP, $7 to get a blood test, $7 if you need an X-ray, $7 to vaccinate each of your kids each time they need it—and prescriptions for medicines are going up as well. This is after we heard, that there would be no cuts to health, no cuts to education and no changes to pensions. They have broken their promise to Tasmanians and they have broken their promise to Australians. To say one thing before an election and do a different thing afterwards—of course we have heard it before—should not occur and now Tasmanians are paying the price for this. The budget will be way too much pain for Tasmanians and very little gain for the state. In fact, there is nothing new in this budget for Tasmania. All I can find is a $100 million cut to the funding of the Midland Highway. Under Labor there was $500 million over 10 years and now there is only $400 million. That is a cut of $100 million in infrastructure for Tasmania. There are no new announcements just reannouncements, as we saw from the Prime Minister when he was in the state last week. 


Of course, we did hear something else from the Prime Minister when he was in Tasmania last week. We heard him say, 'It would not be the worst outcome in the world if young unemployed Tasmanians have to leave the state.' Also we heard from him, 'I don't think we should be necessarily heartbroken just because some people choose to leave.' So in Tasmania it has become learn, earn or leave. Apparently, it is okay that there are no jobs for Tasmanians in Tasmania and we really should not be heartbroken about it. Interestingly, the federal Department of Employment predicts there will be 11,400 new jobs in Tasmania by 2017. In that same period, 21,000 students are expected to leave school. That is 21,000 students for 11,400 new jobs. So the jobs are not there. We need places in training for them. Are there places available in TAFE? Are there places available in the university in regional Tasmania? We have heard the Minister for Employment, who happens to be a Tasmanian, Senator Abetz, say,' Of course, they could go and pick fruit.' Actually what he said was:


There are many examples of jobs in my home state of Tasmania, for example fruit picking …


Interestingly, the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association do not really like that idea and they are going to take it up with the minister. They have said:


If the Government wants us to be babysitters and to run these social welfare programs we will have a conversation about what's involved in that, but it won't be as a part of a commercial offering.


The youth unemployment rate in Tasmania is 17 per cent. Up on the north-west coast it is 22 per cent. There are no jobs for these people, and to expect them to live on fresh air for six months every year that they do not have a job is cruel and heartless and will increase poverty and homelessness in Tasmania. To have the Prime Minister simply come down and say, 'Well, you can leave,' is not okay. There is supposed to be a $100 million jobs and growth program with 31 projects for 2½ thousand jobs that was announced by Labor and that was supposed to be committed by the new government. Only five of those projects have received the funding. There was $100 million over four years. Where is the rest of the money? Where are the plans to create jobs in Tasmania? There are none. Instead, we are attacking the most vulnerable. We are taking $100 million out of infrastructure and we are not going to deliver the jobs and growth plan, but that is all right: Tasmanians can just leave.


People are not going to leave Tasmania. People all over the country are not going to leave regional Australia and move to the cities. Labor support the regions, even if the current government does not. We would invest in the regions and we did under the regional development fund. We have seen that program gutted as well. We have seen the indexation of financial assistance grants taken from councils. That is a $1 billion cut over four years. Councils will have to absorb these cuts. They had not budgeted for the loss of indexation over the four years. This will be an ongoing cut to councils in regional Australia. My home state of Tasmania will be hit hard by these.


There is so much in this budget that needs addressing that, as I said at the beginning, it is hard to know where to start. The coalition kept saying there would be no changes to pensions. We heard those opposite say today in the parliament: 'Pensions will continue to go up under us. There's nothing to worry about.' Why do the budget papers include a saving for pensions in the out years? There is a saving because they are changing the indexation, which is a cut in real terms to pensions.


We also see that from 1 July this year the concessions that are paid to the states to deliver concessions on water, electricity, local council rates and transport are being cut. In my home state of Tasmania that is $9 million from 1 July that the state government does not have and has not said whether it will make up. Councils are about to send out rates notices. Do they include a concession for ratepayers when those notices go out in two weeks? Who would know? 'It is not my problem,' says the Treasurer; 'It is up to the states.' It is a problem for the pensioners. He is the Treasurer of this country and he should be taking notice, because these pensioners are frightened. They have been frightened by this budget and by the actions of this government.


It is not fair. I think that is the overwhelming theme of this budget: it is not fair. It is not fair because the wealthy are doing less of the lifting and those people on low incomes are doing the majority of the lifting. When you have somebody on $200,000 a year actually committing $400 in an extra debt tax and you have people on $60,000 with two kids giving up over $6,000 a year in family payments, you know something is not right. We heard today that families will be affected by changes to family tax benefit. In fact, 1.5 million children will be affected by this government's changes.


It does not stop there. The changes to the pension include having to work until you are 70. I wonder whether they ever actually asked people what they thought of this—whether they asked the tradesmen, the nurses or the brickies labourers. I do not think they would have, because they cannot work until they are 70. They cannot work until they are 70 because they are in heavy labour jobs. Perhaps they should just retrain and do something else. I am sure that will be the answer that comes from those opposite.


We have also seen savage cuts to the public sector in this budget. Tasmania does have a number of public sector jobs, particularly in the science areas of CSIRO and the Australian Antarctic Division. CSIRO are particularly concerned about cuts that might be coming their way. Of course there is the ABC, who have the one per cent efficiency dividend coming off them. That will mean cuts in regional Australia and in my home state of Tasmania.


So all we in Tasmania hear with this budget is cuts, cuts, cuts, cuts, cuts, cuts, cuts, cuts. There is nothing new. There is no extra funding. In fact, if it gets bad enough you can do what the Prime Minister says: 'Just leave.' That is the only solution we have had from the new government. There is absolutely nothing in this budget for Tasmania.


Labor will be opposing these measures. We will be opposing changes to pensions, we will be opposing changes to family payments and, of course, we will be opposing the fuel excise increase as well. That was another nice surprise for people which they knew nothing about! No new taxes before the election; an increase in tax after the election. Who would have thought that that would occur?   I want to read an email from one of my constituents. I will not name her but you will get the general gist from the email about how Tasmanians are feeling about this budget:


I am writing you to encourage you to stand up against the threats to the most vulnerable members of our community by the plans outlined in the Abbott government's budget. Why are we buying new jet fighters and giving tax breaks to big business while making it more and more difficult for the poorest to have the basic necessities of life? Cutting bulk-billing for children and pensioners is not just a $7 impost. I am a pensioner.


Recently I went to the doctor, who sent me for blood tests and then called me back because of some abnormalities, which led to new blood tests and an ultrasound. Then I had to go back to the doctor to get the results. These changes would have meant an extra $42 for me within a two-week period. I would not have spent that $42 on a beer, a cigarette or a cigar. It probably would have gone towards my power bill or on food. I am however more concerned that children will not receive the medical care they need because some parents must decide between food or medical treatment. 


In Tasmania there is great youth unemployment, but maybe some do not want to work. However, most cannot find work. With no Newstart until they reach 30 we are going to see a rise in the number of youth homelessness. Surely the lucky country can do better than this.

Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (19:32):  It is a pleasure to rise to speak in support of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and the cognate bills. It is a shame that all the the member for Franklin said is that all Tasmanians are hearing is cuts, cuts, cuts. Perhaps that is because she is the one out there spreading that message, rather than some of the good things in the budget for Tasmania, particularly the nearly $40 million for the Hobart International Airport runway extension and also the numerous tourism projects that will be happening throughout Tasmania. I note that they criticised some of the tourism projects—for instance, the one to extend the tours of the Cadbury factory.



An honourable member interjecting— 




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  You certainly did criticise it. You claimed it was a rort and all the rest of it. The reality is that that was a tourism benefit for Tasmania which the Labor Party were opposed to, so shame on them. I want to speak on the appropriation bills. These bills are really the mop and bucket that we have with this budget. They are the broom, the scrubbing brush and the dustpan which are required to clean up the mess left behind by six years of Labor waste and incompetence. 


There is a well-established political cycle in this country. A Labor government comes in and takes a perfectly good economy and a perfectly good budget and goes about trashing them. That is what we saw throughout the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd debacle—waste and incompetence. They threw money around, hoping that if they gave away enough free money they would have more people voting for them. Eventually people saw through that. They saw that Labor was breaking the bank, trashing the house and booking up the bills to a credit that would be paid by the next generation. The Australian people took out some of the trash on election night. It was a pretty full wheelie bin that night. We all know that even after the wheelie bin was emptied by the electoral garbage truck the house would still be left in somewhat of a mess. That is why the Liberal-National government made sombre commitments to the Australian people before the election. 


We promised we would stop the boats, a problem created by Labor and the Greens when they were in office. We have fixed it already with our policies, which Labor and the Greens said would not work. We are stopping the boats, even though the rudderless Leader of the Opposition cannot bring himself to admit it.


We promised we would axe the carbon tax. That is an easy promise we thought we would be able to achieve by now. You would think we would be able to achieve it, particularly given that the Labor Party—and we have members of the Labor Party opposite smiling and laughing about it—promised themselves in their flyers that they were going to scrap the carbon tax. In fact, they said it had been scrapped. But now, no, they are voting against scrapping it. They are clinging onto the carbon tax in the Senate like a one-year-old clinging onto its gran's security blanket.


Most importantly, we promised that we would clean up Labor's mess by getting the budget back under control. That is what we are doing, even though Labor is doing its best to hamper the clean-up crew. We promised that we were going to build the roads and infrastructure of the 21st century. Of all of the measures outlined in this budget, the unprecedented investment in infrastructure is what will help my electorate the most. Of all the feedback that I have ever received as a member of parliament, through emails, phone calls, letters and talking to people face-to-face in the street and at different events, by far the biggest issue and the most raised issue is the Bruce Highway, followed closely by the local roads in general.


Queensland is a very large state. Our road network is critical—particularly, the new 1,700 kilometres of the Bruce Highway, which is a major arterial road connecting all the coastal regions. The Bruce Highway package, the $6.7 billion that we are going to invest—and a lot of that funding is contained over the forward estimates as outlined in the budget—includes projects like the Mackay ring road. The Mackay ring road is an interesting infrastructure piece because Labor talked about it a lot when they were in power but they never did anything about it. They actually tried to tell the public that it was in the budget, but when we went through the figures it was not. In fact, that was exposed in Senate estimates at the end of the Gillard road, when Senator Ian Macdonald actually questioned the head of Regional Development Australia about it and what was there for it. We found out that nothing was actually allocated to the Mackay ring road. This budget includes the dollars—over half a billion dollars—and it includes the dates. In 2016 we are going to start construction. That is what people want to know.


We have $20 million from the federal government and another $5 million from the states to do the detailed planning and preservation. There is actually $11 million in the budget for 2014-15. We have $428 million that is going to go to that $540 million total, with some state funds, to do the construction of stage 1 of the Mackay ring road. That is going to be vitally important for the Mackay area. It is going to be the largest piece of infrastructure we have ever seen in that area, and it is going to lift the local economy in leaps and bounds. We have had a downturn in the mining sector—thank you very much, Labor Party, partly because of your carbon tax and your mining tax—but now, on the back of that downturn, we are able to offer this big infrastructure project and get all the construction jobs flowing from that.


In the northern part of my electorate, the Sandy Gully Bridge is another important piece of infrastructure. It floods every time we get a bit of rain in the Bowen area. There is a $46 million federal contribution to that $57 million project that is going to get some state funds as well. This year there is $2.5 million allocated for the detailed design work. Yellow Gin Creek Bridge, also in the north of my electorate, will get a $36 million federal contribution, along with some state funds. There will be up to $45 million to upgrade that bridge and flood-proof it. Again, for the detailed design work there is $4 million in this federal budget for 2014-15. The rest of it for both those projects, Sandy Gully and Yellow Gin, will be in the outlying years of the forward estimates.


Also completing work in this coming financial year is the Vantassel Street to Cluden duplication in the Townsville end of my electorate, and a minor upgrade to the Burdekin Bridge, which is definitely something that is needed. There will be continuing funds for fixing up black spots and increasing overtaking lanes. That is vitally important but there are also other local projects that the Liberal-National government is delivering on in my electorate. 


We are shifting the junior soccer grounds and assisting in that exercise with a $1 million contribution. It is a million dollars that the Labor Party promised back in 2010—2010, and yet it never, ever happened. Guess what? We are now delivering it, because the program that they were going to fund it out of had wound up, so we have gone and found additional money in the budget to keep that project alive.


The Mackay gymnastics centre will be given an upgrade, creating a new extension to their existing premises with $750,000. We will have mobile CCTV units given to the local council with assistance of $200,000. We are going to light up some of the inner city car parks with an extra $200,000 to make them safer for late-night shoppers and workers who leave at night. There are Green Army projects that are doing excellent work with the Eco Barge in the Whitsundays and also work on the Don River.


North Queensland is the economic engine room of this country. We make a major contribution to the economy through agriculture, tourism and mining. Regional centres like Mackay service the mining projects of Central Queensland, in particular the Bowen Basin. Skills training and education are an important part of providing that service through trades learning and through universities.


While the 400-kilometre long electorate of Dawson does not technically include a university at this stage, we do have many full-time students as residents. CQ University's Mackay campus is only a few hundred metres from the southern boundary of the electorate and James Cook University is only a few hundred metres from our northern boundary. And students in North Queensland, who are probably less exposed to the lies, deceit and the exaggeration in the southern media, are scratching their heads when they see Bill Shorten's protégés in the far left movement bashing police and squealing into a microphone about how no-one will be able to afford to go to university anymore.


The students who actually took the time to educate themselves, instead of just printing out the union lines, listening to the Leader of the Opposition and then taking to the streets to chant the misinformation to the TV cameras, know that anyone can afford to go to university. No-one has to pay their portion of university expenses up-front—although they do have to pay their compulsory union fees up-front, which the other side brought in. No-one has to start repaying their student loans until they start earning more than $50,000 a year. That is pretty fair. That has got to be fair in anyone's books. 


When you take into consideration the higher incomes earned by university graduates—around 75 per cent more than a nongraduate—paying half the course fees is a pretty darn good investment. You do not have to put your money down until the investment starts paying dividends. The 'I want everything for free' sense of entitlement from the students we see revolting in the streets must come across as even more revolting to the hairdressers, the waitresses, the mechanics, and all the other non-university graduates who have to contribute through their tax dollars to university education. The protesting students are not happy about only half of their university fees being paid by those lower paid workers.


This budget does not stop anyone from going to university. In fact, it encourages more people to take on further education through subbachelor training by giving them access to the same system of student loans as university students. Further, education providers will be required to divert 20 per cent of any additional revenue they receive from deregulation for student places to Commonwealth scholarships and other support for disadvantaged students. Those Commonwealth scholarships will create major new support for regional students to go to university. I am proud to say students in North Queensland have not been led astray by the hype and hysteria propagated by the opposition leader. All the bleating in the world will not turn Labor's scurrilous lies about education, health and pensioners into reality.


Hysteria about cuts from those opposite could easily have been hosed down by reading the budget. Even comparing it with Labor's last budget and forward estimates this budget, represented by these bills, actually increases school funding to record highs. This Liberal-National budget invests record recurrent funding of $64½ billion in government and non-government schools over the next four years—that is, $1.2 billion more than the previous government would have spent over the forward estimates—to ensure schools in all states and territories receive extra funding.


It is a similar story in health, where the campaign of deceit from the Labor Party runs contrary to the facts. The facts, which show that funding to states for hospital services increases by more than nine per cent, or $1.3 billion a year, next year; in 2015-16, by more than nine per cent, or $1.4 billion, a year; in 2016-17, by more than nine per cent, or $1½ billion, a year. In 2017-18, it goes up by more than six per cent, or $1.1 billion, a year. In Queensland, hospital funding will increase each year, from $3.1 billion in 2014-15 to $3.8 billion in 2017-18.


Even more scurrilous are the lies that have been told about pension cuts. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame for the way they have scared pensioners with their alarmist campaign of deceit. The pension will continue to rise twice a year every year. Poor old pensioners are being wheeled out and taken for a ride by all those opposite. The way that Labor and the Greens kick the pensioners around like a political football says a lot about how they treat the generation that created the wealth that Labor squandered. None of those opposite—not one—has mentioned the fact that they are blocking the repeal of the carbon tax, which is the most unnecessary impost on every household and family, including pensioners. This campaign of deceit and lies about the budget has scared pensioners, it has incited violence amongst the students and it has distracted people from what is really important: getting this budget back under control while we still actually can. These bills and this budget delivers on that most important promise we made to the Australian people. I commend the bills to the House.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (19:47):  Cuts, cuts, cuts! That is all you see when you read through these appropriation bills. In fact, I tallied the number of cuts in these appropriation bills that we are debating tonight, Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-15 and cognate bills—126 government programs receive funding cuts from this government. It is a series of broken election commitments. The Prime Minister said a couple of days before the election that there would be, no cuts to health or education, no changes to pensions, no cuts to the ABC or SBS. Here we have it in the first budget of the Abbott government, completely breaking that promise that was made to the Australian public—a complete breach of faith and trust with the Australian community on one of the most important objects of government, the delivery of a budget. These bills absolutely decimate and destroy all those commitments, a complete breach of trust with the Australian people. More importantly, they make life tougher, harder for families, pensioners, single mums and students living in my community.


Labor will not vote against these bills. Unlike those opposite, we respect the conventions of the Australian Constitution, in particular, that oppositions should not block supply. It is not the fault of public servants throughout Australia, who have mortgages and families to feed, that this lousy budget is presented to the parliament. They should not suffer by an opposition blocking supply and refusing payments for the ordinary appropriations of government, most notably ensuring that public servants get paid. But we will point out the gross inequalities, the deficiencies and the unfairness of this budget when it comes to pensioners, families, students and single mums. 


In education, $60 million in federal grants will be cut by these appropriation bills, part of $236 million worth of cuts overall—programs such as the Digital Education Revolution, providing laptops and computer access for kids in schools; and More Support for Students with Disabilities, a program that very importantly provides that much-needed in-classroom assistance for kids with disabilities. Two weeks ago, I met a young family in my community that had two kids with disabilities—two kids in primary school with disabilities. They were in a very small public school that has a 60 per cent Indigenous population. I just keep thinking to myself—and it keeps me up at night to think—what that poor family is going to have to go through because of this government's cuts to the education portfolio.


We all know, and we have all seen the studies, about how important early intervention is in ensuring that students with disabilities get the best start on an education and the best start at the ability to participate in society. To cut funding for a particular program, the More Support for Students with Disabilities program, which is a $100 million cut, and not replace it with the Gonski loadings for kids with disabilities is almost criminal. It is an absolute disgrace. 


David Gonski made a very important point in a very important speech last week criticising the government for the approach that they are taking in the funding of schools. The point that David Gonski made was that it is not just the level of funding in school education that is important. What is also very important is where the funding is going and what the funding is targeted towards. In Australia at the moment we are seeing students fall further and further behind in international comparisons. Why? It is not because of the students at the high end. Our very talented students in wealthy schools are doing very well. They are above, or at, international comparisons. It is our kids in low-socioeconomic areas, our kids from an Indigenous background, our kids with disabilities and, our kids from non-English speaking backgrounds who are the ones struggling in schools. They are the ones who the Gonski funding would specifically target. That is the point that David Gonski was making. It is not simply about the overall amount of the pie but it is about where the pie is allocated. This budget is a dud because it does not fund the Gonski reforms in the fifth and sixth years.


A $38.4 million cut for an online diagnostic tool program, to help teachers assess the learning and assessment outcomes under NAPLAN, has been cut under these bills. It comes on top of the Schoolkids Bonus being cut, a with vital support for families on family tax benefits to ensure that their kids can meet the costs of going to school. These are unfair outcomes in education. They are unfair and will leave our kids, particularly some in my community, much worse off. 


The Prime Minister made a commitment a couple days before the election that there would be no cuts to the ABC or SBS budgets. But that is exactly what we have seen in these appropriation bills—$43.5 million cut from the ABC and from SBS and the abolition of the Australia Network, representing a $196.8 million cut. People in my electorate are particularly angry about this cut to funding for the ABC and SBS, particularly because of the commitment that was given by the Prime Minister a couple of days before the election. Close to 9,000 constituents in my community have signed a petition opposing the cuts to the ABC and SBS because they believe in a well-funded, independent public broadcaster as the hallmark of a modern, healthy democracy. The ABC Managing Director, Mark Scott, has pointed out this week that, unfortunately, because of these funding cuts there will be redundancies and there will be closure of services. That will affect rural and regional communities. That will mean that the broadcasting services that are delivered to rural and regional Australia will be cut by this government's callous approach to communications. 


In the arts budget, $87.1 million has been cut from arts programs—in particular, funding for the Australia Council and Screen Australia. Some may not believe that arts funding is important, but I do. Arts is the carrier of Australian culture. Arts is the way we tell the story about who we are—about our history, our heritage, our place in the world and the sort of society we live in. To callously cut this particular element of the budget through these appropriation bills is not in our nation's interest.


In the environment, $483 million is being cut from Landcare initiatives, putting the future of Landcare at risk. What will this mean for Landcare? What will it mean for people who have been employed under that wonderful program that has achieved so much in conservation for communities such as mine—particularly along the coastline—over many, many years? We do not know, because that funding cut has put the lives and welfare of many of those employees at risk.


These appropriation bills foreshadow $7.6 billion in cuts over the forward estimates to Australia's overseas development aid commitment. I recently travelled around the Pacific with the foreign minister, Julie Bishop. She gave a clear commitment to the leaders of the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Nauru: no cuts to the overseas development aid budget for our friends in the Pacific. Then MYEFO was released, and then the budget was released, and what do we find? That is exactly what has occurred under this government. They have cut funding for overseas development aid. That funds programs such as the Vanuatu Women's Centre that I visited with the foreign minister, which is providing important support for women living with domestic violence, important support for education and important support for immunisation and health outcomes in those communities. 


We do not know where those cuts are going to come from. We do not know which particular programs are going to be cut. I call on the foreign minister and the Prime Minister to at least have the decency—at least have the gumption—to outline to our friends in the Pacific which of their programs that are importantly funded and supported by Australian aid are going to be cut. Are any of those programs going to be health programs? Are they going to be education programs? Are they going to be programs such as Pacific Women Shaping Pacific Development? The leaders of those nations and our friends in the Pacific deserve to know.


This government has taken a disgraceful approach to international climate change initiatives. It is one of the key and most pressing issues facing the world economy, and what is Australia's view? We will pull out of all international climate change initiatives. What we are saying, particularly to the Asia-Pacific community, where we are a leading economy and a leading society, is that climate change does not matter; that climate change initiatives and clean energy initiatives do not matter. What sort of a message does that send to our friends in the Pacific and Asia about this nation's approach to climate change?


In the Pacific, climate change is not a looming threat; it is a present danger, and we are seeing already the effects on communities, particularly in low-lying states such as Kiribati, Vanuatu, Nauru and the Marshall Islands. We are seeing people being displaced because of climate change already, and what is Australia's approach? We have pulled out of those international initiatives. Recently, the foreign minister of the Marshall Islands, Tony deBrum, said this about Australia and its government:


Australia has always been our friend, but the change in their government last year has resulted in problems.


That is extraordinary. That is the view of the foreign minister of the Marshall Islands. In diplomacy, words such as those are very powerful. 


That is the view that our friends in the Pacific have of the Australian nation—that we have let them down and ignored them when it comes to the crises they are facing relating to climate change. We are ignoring that their crops are drying up, their infrastructure is being inundated, they are not receiving any rain anymore in particular regions and, importantly, they cannot feed themselves. We are sending the wrong message, and it is enshrined in these bills that we are taking the wrong approach when it comes to overseas development aid. We will continue to hold the government to account for the disgraceful approach that they have taken on overseas development aid.


All of these measures have been put in the budget on the basis of a confected budget emergency. The government is out there campaigning and scaring the public into believing that there is a budget crisis in Australia. I pose this question to the government: how on earth does a nation achieve three AAA credit ratings from independent ratings agencies when you have a budget crisis? We are one of only 10 nations throughout the world that have a AAA credit rating and I do not see any of those other nine nations having newspaper headlines or discussions within their national parliaments about a budget crisis. There simply is not one in Australia, and for this government to go out and claim that there is, to add $68 billion worth of expenditure to government programs and then claim that there is a budget emergency and have to cut to the bone on programs such as Medicare, health and education, and pensions, is an absolute disgrace. It is the wrong approach to be taking with the Australian public.


Labor have said that we understand the need to ensure that the budget is sustainable. When in government we took an approach that ensured that our budget was sustainable and met the Charter of Budget Honesty commitments to run surpluses over the medium to long term. We did that by ensuring that we had sufficient revenue coming into the budget, and that meant that there was a minerals resource rent tax, that meant there was a price on carbon, that meant that we means-tested the private health insurance rebate and that meant that we were proposing to tax people with whopping superannuation accounts of more than $2 million earning more than $100,000 a year. It also meant that we were not undertaking outrageous expenditure like an overrated paid parental leave scheme, like direct action, which has got no funding source at all in the provision of subsidies to polluting companies, and like some of the changes to veterans' pensions being introduced by this government. Labor had a plan for sustainability in our budget and it did not involve the cuts that are being undertaken in these appropriation bills. It is a disgrace that this government has put them forward in this budget.

"Broad, Andrew, MP",Nats,2014-05-26,"



Mr BROAD
 (Mallee) (16:49):  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker Andrews. It is nice to see you in that chair as opposed to in a helicopter. I would like to be in this place, like any member of parliament, and happily give away money. No member of parliament really comes to the House and wants to be the person who has to say no.



Ms Hall interjecting—




Mr BROAD:
  Let me continue. But my curse, I suppose, is that I do understand economics and I understand that you actually have to have a strong economy in order to attract and be able to build a great society.



Ms Hall interjecting—




Mr BROAD:
  In having a strong economy, you have to be able to afford a certain number of things, and how you do it is quite challenging. I hear someone across the chamber here interjecting, but what I can say is this: we need to find the balance between what we invest in and what we spend, and this has been the challenge in this budget. In this budget, we have found some difficult choices.


It needs to be said that for a very long time we have not adjusted the structural flaws in the budget. We have been spending more as a country than we have been getting in in income tax, and that leaves us with two choices. It leaves us with the choice of putting taxes up or finding some savings. We had to find that balance. In working through that balance, there have been some challenges. But I believe we have actually met the challenge very well.



Ms Hall interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs Andrews
):  Order! The member will be heard in silence.




Mr BROAD:
  The challenge is to ensure that businesses can continue to function. Across my electorate, we could have fallen in the trap. We could have removed the diesel fuel rebate. We could have not invested in roads. But instead we have chosen to keep the diesel fuel rebate, which is a recognition of agricultural productivity, and we have also chosen to invest in roads.


I hark back to a great cartoon series that I used to watch when I was a child, and that was The Simpsons. One time Homer Simpson ran for mayor by saying, 'Can't somebody else do it?' As I said at the start, we would love to turn up to this place and give away money, but what defines us as a government compared to the previous government is that we are prepared to make the difficult choices. When Homer Simpson ran for mayor with his slogan of 'Can't somebody else do it?' that very much reflects the budget-in-reply speech that we saw from Bill Shorten, talking about us being mean, talking about us being harsh. But what he essentially was saying was, 'Can't somebody else do it?' And that is us. We have been handed the hard task of running the country and deciding what the hard decisions are.


There have been a lot of lies out there and a lot of discussion out there in the public discourse. Winston Churchill once said, 'A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on.'




Dr Leigh:
  I preferred it when you quoted Simpson!




Mr BROAD:
  No, you will learn something from Churchill, because Churchill was a man—I kid you not—who had the strength of his convictions to make the tough call when the tough call had to be made. And this is a tough call that had to be made. In our current deficit, you will notice that we still have $49.9 billion of loss this year. Our projections next year are $29.8 billion, and even by 2017-18 we will see a deficit of $2.8 billion. So even then we are still only closing the gap, but the tough calls need to be made.


We have made some tough calls, but we have also invested very much in our future. I got emails all last week saying what we can and cannot do, and many of those emails would have us go down the same way as the Argentinian economy, where they put in huge disincentives for people to earn. We have not done that. We have not made that mistake. We have actually invested in building capacity. Cutting company tax rates has been fantastic. That will mean that a small business in my electorate will put on an extra apprentice, and that is what we have to do. If we can get one extra person—



Ms Hall interjecting—




Mr BROAD:
  Well, you should listen because you are going to learn something. If you can put on one extra person, that is an extra job in a country community. I did an apprenticeship, and a first-year apprenticeship is very tough to live on. In fact, if you are on a first-year wage, on $200 a week, it is quite a struggle. We have recognised this. We are actually the party for the worker, and we have recognised this. We have given a help scheme for apprentices. I know that as a first-year apprentice it was a very big deal for me to be able to buy the tyres on my car, but with a help scheme there is real recognition of this. For the first time, students who study at Longerenong agricultural college or at SuniTAFE will be able to access a help scheme. This has been an instrumental thing that we have campaigned for for a very long time—a recognition that rural trades are essential to growing our economy and growing our wealth.


We have expanded the research and development in agriculture by $100 million. We have also invested in our roads—our first mile of road. Did you know that the average truck now weighs 60 tonnes? We have to be able to get down that country road. We have added another $350 million for Roads to Recovery and another $300 million overall for Bridges to Recovery. This has been a great investment and real recognition that investing in roads is going to be key.


One of the tough decisions has been to put an excise on fuel and to index that excise. It is easy for the Labor opposition to sit back and say, 'That's a broken promise.' But we are linking the excise to road infrastructure. My electorate makes up one-third of the state of Victoria, and there are a lot of country roads. The people in my electorate say to me that they want to be able to make a phone call and they want to be able to drive on a country road. For a very long time we have seen not enough investment in country roads. It has been the coalition, which championed the Roads to Recovery policy, that has boosted that. That is recognition of the fact that boosting our investment in infrastructure lets us enhance our export capacity, which increases our wealth. Even out of my electorate, there is $5.3 billion of economic activity. I would say that there are not many electorates across Australia that have that level of economic activity.


We continue to invest in looking after our land. There is $525 million for the Green Army Program. I am going to have three Green Army projects in my electorate and I am going to try to get some more. The thing I like about the Green Army Program is that it gets young men and women aged 17 to 25 outdoors, breathing the fresh country air and getting involved in hands-on environmental management. This is how you actually move people away from being armchair environmentalists, of which we have seen too many, to being people who have a passion and an affinity for looking after the land. Not only will those people undertaking Green Army projects be doing something of value that will lift their self-esteem; they will also be getting some skills and doing some good environmental work that will help the region. We have $342 million in the Community Development Grants Program. That is money that will go into our communities to help build small infrastructure. Also part of the budget is the National Stronger Regions Fund. That is $1 billion that will be spent right across Australia to build those small projects that are very important to people.


For my electorate in the budget there is also an additional 3,000 places for the Clontarf Foundation. I met with some of these guys last week. They are young Aboriginal men who use sport as a motivation for getting them back to school and getting them back into learning. One of the key factors about this budget is that, unlike the previous government, which was not prepared to put some tough love into unemployment benefits and in driving people to work, we have introduced an earn or learn program. The earn or learn program will not have people living on $2 noodles for six months, as those opposite would have us believe; it will have some very good programs that will help people get a job. That is what we want.


Mr Deputy Speaker Randall—I think that is the right title. It sounds very regal for you, doesn't it? We want to see people get a job. Getting a job builds your self-esteem. Getting a job builds your self-worth. We do not want people to see themselves as unemployed. We want to see them as employable and looking for work. That is something we need to do right across Australia. In my electorate there are jobs, and a lot of them are currently being filled by Irish and German backpackers. We want our young Australians to get involved in the workforce. That does not mean you start off in the job that you always want. I never started off in the job I always wanted, and I am not sure I am in the job I always wanted now, but here I am. The point is—



Dr Leigh interjecting—




Mr BROAD:
  You could try. I think you had a good go but did not quite—I think you polled 17 per cent. Across my electorate we want to have people who are active and take a job. That is going to be very critical, Mr Deputy Speaker Randall. Is that the correct title?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Randall
):  Correct.




Mr BROAD:
  Even the senior Australians in my electorate can see the value of what we are doing with the GP co-payment. I have talked to pensioners, and whilst they do not particularly like it they know there is value in their covering some of the hard yards that are ahead, particularly when you tell them that it is going to go into the Medical Research Future Fund. This is a fund that could have huge benefits for Australia, not only in the way it could solve some illnesses that we need research into. One thing I have seen when I have studied extensively overseas is that medical research becomes something that links very much our universities, and if we can do this right then we can actually have some of our top research universities accessing some of these funds and driving not only training but also the research and the cures for the next century.


For people who are over 50, being unemployed is a big challenge. I want to make sure that those people in my electorate are very aware that, if they have been unemployed for six months, we are going to introduce a program that is going to help them get a job. There is nothing that does more for an older person's self-esteem than to see that they are still of value, that they can still get a job and that they can still contribute to the Australian economy and to their own pocket. We are introducing $10,000 over 24 months to help senior Australians get jobs. If you have been on welfare for six months or more, an employer will work with you and get $10,000 over 24 months to employ you. So there is a length of tenure for which you are going to have to stay there—for which they are going to have to keep you on. That measure, I think, will be very well received.


If you do have the chance—and many of you are very busy workers, I understand, as members of parliament—the Queen's Birthday long weekend is a good time to go on a road trip. One of the things that is great about the electorate of Mallee is that it has such fantastic places to visit. We have the Grampians, where you can have a kangaroo bounce up right to your front step. We have the Murray River, where you can take a houseboat. We want to drive tourism dollars in the Grampians. We want to drive tourism dollars along the Murray River. We understand that tourism is a very important part of the Australian economy. So the budget has a $43 million Tourism Demand-Driver Infrastructure Program, with small expenditures right across Australia that will make sure that people get out and experience Australia. I think this is another a great part of this budget.


We have not shirked our responsibility. When I have been out talking to people across my electorate, they are not saying, 'Woe is me!' What they are saying, without any political spin, is: 'We know that we have been living beyond our means for too long. We are not buying the line that there is no budget emergency. We are not buying the line that the Labor government should have continued the way it had been going for five years previously.' People are telling me that the budget is tough but fair. They are prepared to wear some of the cuts because they know that if they can walk with us we can walk through a few difficult years and there will be light on the other side. We have done it before. Unfortunately, we have been elected to have to do it again. But it is the tough decisions that define members of parliament, not just turning up and whingeing and throwing away money like a drunken sailor. We are prepared to make those tough decisions, and that is something that will define this government.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (17:02):  Whether you ask parents, pensioners or conservative premiers, it is pretty clear that this budget is deeply unpopular—perhaps the most unpopular budget since polling began. One of the reasons for this is that it breaks so many promises: pledges of no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts to pensions, no cuts to the ABC and no new taxes are smashed like plates at a Greek wedding. Broken too is the pledge not to cut more than 12,000 public servants, a broken promise which falls particularly hard on my electorate, and the promise not to make further cuts to foreign aid: now Australia will see itself doing less vaccination and building fewer sanitary projects—saving fewer lives. It appears that, when Mr Abbott was sermonising for the previous three years about the need for politicians to keep their word, he was referring to everyone but himself.


The other reason that people are angry about this budget is that it does not reduce the deficit. Let us not compare Hockey 2013 with Hockey 2014. Let us make the only fair comparison. As the Charter of Budget Honesty sets out, the fair comparison is with today's budget and the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook, independently prepared by the secretaries of Treasury and Finance during the caretaker period. By that comparison, this budget has a higher deficit this year, a higher deficit next year and a higher deficit across the forwards. The PEFO had us returning to surplus in 2016-17; this budget has us returning to surplus in 2017-18. The Treasurer's hyperbole about Australia's deficit levels are out of touch with the international reality, where Australia's debt levels are relatively low. But if the Treasurer were to care about the level of Australia's debt and deficits, he does himself no favours by bringing down a budget which increases them.


But the biggest reason that this budget sent shivers through the community is that it fails the fair go test. So many people in my community and other communities around Australia are asking about the budget, 'How will it make my life harder?' A single parent recently contacted me. She has worked hard all her life supporting herself and her two boys and was to be made redundant this year. As the redundancy date loomed closer she did her best to secure another job to guard against unemployment and to avoid disadvantaging her two boys, who rely on her income. But she struggled. 'I went for interview after interview,' she said. No-one was willing to give her a go. 'Our government are much the same,' she reflected. 'They look after those who are capable and successful and they leave the rest behind.'


An age pensioner got in touch. She told me about her life of contribution to the nation, her four working children and her six grandchildren. Throughout her life she has done her best, paying her taxes and raising a family, but now she tells me she feels like a burden on society. She said: 'I am one of those pensioners whose sole income is the pension—no superannuation payments, nothing. I feel sad, depressed and scared for my ability to pay my way when all the cuts start.'


And yet this is a budget which, while it takes away from pensioners, gives to those at the top of the distribution. You heard nothing on budget night about the $50,000 for millionaires parental leave scheme. It is a scheme I know the member for Mitchell has commented on in the past, and he has very astutely pointed to the shortcomings in his speech. I certainly do not want to traduce your impartiality, Deputy Speaker, but when he is in the House the member for Mitchell is a brave speaker on the evident flaws in paid parental leave. I commend him for so doing.


While I am quoting members of the other side of the House it is apposite to mention that today was an opportunity for the Minister for Education to quote from an excellent book, if I do say so: Battlers and Billionaires! I am very happy to continue in the vein that the education minister pursued in question time in making very clear that this is a budget for billionaires, not a budget for battlers.


For six years the non-concessional superannuation cap has stayed at $150,000. In this budget it was raised to $180,000. Let us think for a moment about who benefits from the $40 million of new expenditure over the forwards. Who is putting more than $150,000 a year into superannuation? Say you put 15 per cent of your income into superannuation—a relatively high contribution. That would mean you would need to have more than $1 million income every year to benefit from this measure.


So the talk of heavy lifting rings hollow in a budget which puts aside $40 million for people with seven-figure incomes to benefit and spends $50,000 on the most affluent families to have children. We have, of course, some modelling that has been done on that. How good is the modelling, you would have to ask? I do not want to verify the authority of the modelling; let me go directly to the Prime Minister, who said on 17 August 2010 that NATSEM is 'the most reputable and authoritative modelling organisation in Australia'. So what does NATSEM, the Prime Minister's No. 1 modelling firm, say about this budget? The analysis carried out by Ben Phillips shows very clearly the impact on households in the budget. We will go to 2017-18 and the results of the STINMOD model in that year show that, for couples with children, those in the bottom quintile are losing 6.6 per cent of their disposable income—on average nearly a $3,000 annual hit—while those in the top quintile are getting a benefit of 0.3 per cent, or about $500. Let me also go to single parents. Single parents in the bottom quintile are losing 11 per cent of their income—nearly $4,000 a year.


Overall, the budget is clearly redistributive from the bottom to the top. Those in the bottom quintile in 2017-18 are losing 2.2 per cent of their income and those in the top quintile are gaining 0.2 per cent of their income. So, on average, there is $991 taken away from the bottom quintile and $316 given to the top quintile. What is the context in which this is being done? It is being done at a time in which we have had an unprecedented rise in inequality.


Over the past generation, earnings for the top 10 per cent have risen three times as fast as earnings for the bottom 10 per cent. The top one per cent income share has doubled. The top 0.1 per cent income share has tripled. The richest three Australians, who could fit in the back seat of a limousine, have more wealth than the poorest one million Australians, which is about the population of Adelaide. Yet this is a budget which seems apparently to have been framed in the expectation that inequality in Australia was falling rather than rising. It is the kind of budget you might expect from a Prime Minister of whom Peter Costello once wrote:


He used to tell me proudly that he had learned all of his economics at the feet of Bob Santamaria. I was horrified.


I had the pleasure last week of visiting the youth and family centre in Devonport with Senator Urquhart and speaking to some of the youth workers there. We were speaking about the overall impact of the budget, but one of the measures that concerns them in particular is the impact on twentysomething young people in Tasmania who lose their job and have to wait six months to get unemployment benefits.


There is a deep concern among these youth workers, who had between them decades of experience, that this will lead to an exacerbation of mental illness and to people sleeping rough in their cars if they have them or on the streets if they do not. It could lead people to turn to crime as a way of simply feeding themselves. The philosophy that underpins the six-month waiting time to receive unemployment benefits is the notion that unemployment is a personal failing. It is not the fault of people in the north-west of Tasmania that jobs are scarce in that part of Australia.


The reason that one in 10 people who want a job cannot find one in north-west Tasmania is not that there has been an outpouring of laziness or a lack of willingness to work; it is the structural factors—the decline of the manufacturing and forestry sectors in Tasmania, which has led to this situation. To punish Tasmanians for that is cruel and unnecessary in the extreme. Tasmania, having one of the lowest income levels in the country, will be particularly hard hit by this budget.


The burden of the budget will also fall heavily upon National Party electorates, whose incomes are on average lower than the rest of Australia. So it is quite surprising to me that members of the National Party are lining up to support a budget which is hurting their electors.


Of course, as you transfer resources from the poor to the rich, you effectively transfer resources from spenders to savers. We know this because, if we look at the spending rates by quintile, a recent Reserve Bank working paper estimated that low-income families spend all of their income while high-income families save a quarter of their income. The effect of moving $10 billion from the bottom quintile to the top quintile is you are going to decrease spending by $2½ billion. That money is going to go into savings, and you would expect to see a hit on retail trade, and that is precisely what we have seen.


A report in the Financial Review last Friday noted that retail sales fell 5.1 per cent in the seven days after the budget, following a 4.6 per cent drop in the week beforehand according to the Australian Retail Index. The ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence indicator recorded a 3.2 per cent fall in the week ending 18 May, taking the decline in the measure to 14 per cent over the past four weeks. That is the most rapid drop in that index since the global financial crisis.


The Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer confidence survey has dropped to 92.9, which is nearly a three-year low. Confidence has fallen among Labor voters, where the index is a lousy 74.9. I can tell you a secret, Deputy Speaker, retailers do not care whether the money is coming out of the wallets of Labor voters or coalition voters. So, if you tank the consumer confidence of Labor voters, you will hurt the economy.


We have a Treasurer, who is really a shadow Treasurer in drag, trash-talking the economy at every opportunity. It is showing up not just in the retail sales numbers, not just in the two consumer confidence indicators I have mentioned, but also in a survey of the Australian Institute of Company Directors. Fewer than one in three company directors now believes the federal government is having a positive impact on their business decisions and consumer confidence. As it turns out, only eight per cent expressed support for the government's proposed unfair Paid Parental Leave scheme at last year's election. The member for Mitchell is with 92 per cent of company directors—a better place to be than both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, who are with just eight per cent of company directors. The result of this is that we have a government which is not speaking proudly about the economy on the national stage. When the Prime Minister went to Davos he did not speak about the two decades of uninterrupted growth and the bipartisan reforms which have underpinned that. Instead he trash-talked his own nation on the world stage. As political scientist Judith Brett wrote recently, the government is behaving like 'a bunch of winners taking it out on the losers'. She said: 'It all feels a bit like student politics in its short-term point scoring, its payback and its intense personal antagonisms.'


The Abbott-Hockey budget not only breaks promises and fails to address the deficit; it is deeply unfair and, because of that, it is hurting consumer confidence. The impact of this will continue to be felt until the Prime Minister and the Treasurer step out of the role of attacking the economy and step into the role of supporting the economy—recognising that although, in government, they have made Australian debt levels worse, they remain relatively low by international standards. Maybe talking about a budget emergency is the member for North Sydney's way of boosting his numbers in the coalition party room, but it is having a detrimental effect on economic confidence. Unnecessary talk of emergencies is one of the factors that are driving down retail sales and hurting consumer confidence. This government should govern for all Australians, not pursue measures which in effect take from the most vulnerable to give to the most affluent. This is an unfair budget and Australia can do better. (Time expired)

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2014-05-26,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry) (17:18):  I rise to speak on these appropriation bills which will start to set the course to get Australia back into a good position. Oh for the days of being elected as a new government in 2007 facing the budget that they inherited! Here we are as an incoming government that has been given a financial mess—not one we created—to clean up. Listening to lectures by the economic academics on the other side on how wrong this budget is defies belief. To think that they actually put these thoughts into books—I am worried about the education of young people who may pick them up and actually believe in them! It is well known and well documented that, when Labor came to power, they inherited a $20 billion surplus, they inherited cash in the bank. What have we received? It is deja vu 1996—budget black holes, debt. I want to remind people of their track record while they were in power. In 2008-09 they promised a $21.7 billion surplus. It would not have been too hard considering the fact that they had already inherited a $20 billion surplus and $50 billion in the bank. But what did they deliver? A $27 billion deficit. In fact, that is a $48.7 billion turnaround in just one year. To show you the enormity of that, in 1996, when we were elected, the whole of the deficit was only $96 billion.


In 2009-10, they promised a $57.6 billion deficit, so perhaps they were starting to speak about the true Labor ways of deficit, and still only delivered a $54.5 billion deficit. They improved their bottom line by $3.1 billion. In 2010-11, they promised a $40.8 billion deficit and blew that out by $6.7 billion to a $47.5 billion deficit. In 2011-12, they promised a $22.6 billion deficit and delivered a $43.4 billion deficit, a blow-out of $20.8 billion. And the cracker is 2012-13, from these great economic minds. They promised the Australian people a $1.5 billion surplus. They had the economy under control; they knew what they were doing; the GFC had finished. Instead, what did they deliver? They delivered an $18.8 billion deficit, a turnaround of $20.3 billion.


So to stand in this House and listen to Labor lecture the coalition on economic management defies belief. In fact, they could not even lie straight in bed if they intended to. They made all these promises and all these inferences. They knew what they were doing. The thing that really galls me is that they based everything on the global financial crisis. The global financial crisis did not run for six or seven years; in fact, the main part occurred in northern Europe and the US, in the Northern Hemisphere, and the effect of that was only over months. But this Labor Party, when in government, used it as the excuse to spend, spend, spend. It is as though they believed in Mark Latham's magic pudding.


As I said right at the very outset, we did not create this economic mess, but we have been charged with the responsibility to address it and to fix it. Wishful thinking will not fix the problem. No amount of rhetoric will address the issue. Only by addressing the core fundamentals of economic management can we get this economy onto a pathway to recovery. I say this: through the MYEFO period, we were to have a deficit accumulation of $667,000 million—$667 billion. Through the measures that have been implemented by this government, it has been able to be reduced to $389 billion. The problem is not fixed; it has just been reduced. I give all credit to the Treasurer and the financial team of Mathias Cormann for being able to get it down that far.


I do not like delivering a budget where people feel pain, because when I was here during the Howard government we had the budget under so much control with growth and prosperity that we were able to hand out tax cuts and cheques and still deliver budget surpluses. This mob opposite destroyed the confidence of the Australian people, overspent, overreached and were never apologetic for it. In fact, they thought it was their God given right to continue to spend, spend and spend. If they had kept going, my great-great-great-great grandchildren, who have not even been thought of—I am not even a grandfather yet—would be paying off their debt. They would have entrenched it so hard that there would be no way to recover. It is only when you do the hard yards and the heavy lifting as a government that you can turn it around.


One of the other areas that concerns me is the fact that we are paying in excess of $12,000 million each and every year in interest—$1 billion a month. At the same time, the Labor opposition criticised the government in relation to health, in relation to Gonski and in relation to the NDIS. The interest bill alone, per annum, is more than the cost of Gonski and NDIS together. I would like to think what $1,000 million a month would do for much-needed roadworks.


The other thing I take great umbrage at is when members opposite get up and deliberately mislead the House when they say we are cutting funding for health. The facts in the budget are that New South Wales hospital funding will increase each year, from $4.6 billion in 2014-15 to $5.9 billion in 2017-18, and hospital funding for New South Wales will increase from $4.2 billion this financial year to $4.6 billion on 1 July in the 2014-15 year. So I ask myself the question. I thought that when you actually increased, when the numbers went up, that was more money going out. But I can understand the comments of those opposite, because they actually believe that their deficits are surpluses. They told us on so many occasions that budgets would keep returning to surplus. But do you know what? They had no intention at all.


There is confusion out there. It is not like me to make negative comments on my state colleagues in the New South Wales parliament. I say this of my New South Wales colleagues because I want to be honest in relation to this budget. The fear that is being whipped up amongst our pensioners and concession cardholders is palpable. The fact is that the Commonwealth will provide—no adjustment to it—twice a year pension increases by the CPI. This year the CPI will be the highest form of measurement. So that is the benefit to our seniors. We are not cutting their pensions. All of the Commonwealth government concessions stay there. They stay there for pensioner concession cardholders, they stay there for Commonwealth healthcare cardholders and they stay there for Commonwealth senior cardholders. They stay there.


According to some of the numbers in relation to the New South Wales concessions, and to the New South Wales Treasury analysis on the information provided to me, over the next four years, or the forward estimates, $732 million in public transport concessions, $323 million in council rate discounts, $643 million in water bill exemptions, $881 million in electricity rebates and $1.2 billion in fee exemptions for drivers licence tests and mobility parking schemes are to be paid out to pensioners. The federal contribution to the New South Wales government is but $107 million from 1 July this year and $450 million through the forward estimates. So if you work out that, of the $807 million that New South Wales will be paying this year, we are paying $107 million. If all of these concessions are to go, I do not think it is actually the federal government's funding that is cutting these concessions. I think that the state government should be a little bit more honest, if it intends to cut concessions, as to whose budget it is playing with—because it is not the federal budget. As I said, those concessions are primarily the responsibility of the state government. The state should be honest enough—not just New South Wales; other states have jumped in on this—to fess up to the people where the cuts are coming from and why. They are not coming because of cuts made by the federal budget.


There are a couple of key reasons why I support this budget. First and foremost, it starts to get our economy back under control, reduces the deficit and therefore reduces interest bills. Also, there are particular aspects of this budget and appropriation which will help work with mobile telephone black spots in my electorate and the rollout of NBN in my electorate in particular, as I now have three more towers going up for fixed wireless networking in my electorate. As you would know, Deputy Speaker, as you have been up in my area a number of times, the geographic and topographic restrictions in my area and the spread of the population means that the broad land mass of my electorate will not receive cable to the home under any form of government. So fixed wireless installations are the answer, and they are getting underway.


Addressing mobile phone black spots was part of the $100 million package put up by the coalition prior to the election and is now in our budget. Particularly impressive is the money that will be spent with our defence forces. After $30 billion worth of cutbacks in Defence, we are starting to catch up. There is the allocation not just for the acquisition of the joint strike fighter but also for the support services, of which $986 million will be spent at Williamtown RAAF base, upgrading facilities for them to come, making sure that our national interest and our national security are protected by the best platforms available.


Making sure that the men and women of our nation have the best possible assets and face the minimum personal risk to themselves is paramount for any government. The decision by the coalition to invest in the air warfare destroyers, the LHDs, and now the joint strike fighters as a continuation of that, shows we are providing the best assets for our people. I look forward to that investment at Williamtown because the base upgrade will mean jobs for local people, as contractors will be engaged to upgrade runways and build new buildings, and because Lockheed Martin will be engaging a lot of people to work in a private capacity through contractors as a part of the project. There will also be flow-on effects to local companies such as Varley, to name but one, that will be manufacturing parts for the joint strike fighter in and around my region.


I also welcome the road funding aspect of the budget. I congratulate the Prime Minister and also the Deputy Prime Minister for wanting this government to be known as an infrastructure building government. For too long we heard the Labor Party, in particular the member for Hunter, bang on about things like the Scone bypass. There were many years of rhetoric, but we have put the money in place and work is commencing. We have put up the hard cash in the budget—it is a line item, not just a rhetorical promise days before an election. The money is there. The former Deputy Prime Minister in the days before an election promised there would be money for the Tourle Street Bridge, but it was not in their budget. There were all the promises by the former Labor member for Newcastle but they never amounted to anything. The money is there now and work is beginning. My colleague and friend to the north, the member for Lyne, will appreciate the $16 million for Bucketts Way. That is great funding, although it should come down into my patch a little bit more. He has been doing a tremendous job up there.


We are starting to see a greater rollout of roads of importance that will fix traffic congestion. We are starting to build the infrastructure of the future. Upgrades on the now M1, which used to be the F3, and the important piece of infrastructure, the connection between the M1 and the M2, so people no longer have to battle with traffic lights all the way through to get on the M1 and M2, are critically important. The best and brightest minds in the Labor Party lecture us when it comes to the economy, but I say to my constituent, and to the Australian community: have a look at their track record. They could not even get their projections right, let alone the outcome. They promised surpluses umpteen times, and delivered only deficits in the entire period they were in government.

"Giles, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (17:33):  For all the bluster, for all the wannabe Churchillian posturing we have seen in the past couple of weeks, this is fundamentally a government that lacks the courage of its convictions. The budget makes this clear—sadly, with devastating effects for our society. It presents a deeply ideological agenda, shrinking our sense of the public good, suggesting it is something that somehow arises out of necessity—but this simply is not so. The rationale underpinning this budget of broken promises is that there is an emergency. However, there seems to be some confusion, to say the least, amongst members opposite about the exact nature of this supposed emergency. We have heard the Prime Minister claim the house was on fire and then, confusingly, that Labor itself was the fire. On the other hand, we have heard the Treasurer downgrading the fire, saying it was just the kitchen, not the house, on fire. This is a government that cannot get its metaphors straight, let alone give a true account of its actions and purpose. Since then we have heard the Prime Minister say:


You see, we had a fire, and the budget is the fire brigade. And sure, sometimes the fire brigade knocks over a few fences in order to put out the fire.


'A few fences'? What the Prime Minister refers to as a few fences being knocked over are in fact people, families, communities, neighbourhoods—all of whom quite reasonably expected their government to be on their side and not to be using dehumanising rhetoric to justify knocking them over.


Of course, there is no fire, no emergency. The notion of an emergency is one that has been refuted by every economist in the country and, I might add, in other countries too. Even the National Commission of Audit chairman, Tony Shepherd, says so. If the government cannot convince one of the budget's architects that there is an emergency, then the argument is running threadbare, to say the least. The only crisis here is in the government's credibility and it is telling that they will not directly say what they mean, but they want to divide Australia and divide Australians, to take us back to the future, before Medicare, before higher education was opened up and before modern Australia.


There are, however, some clues as to what is meant. In his second reading speech, the Treasurer said, invoking Menzies, that we are a nation of lifters, not leaners. In this budget it is the most vulnerable Australians who are doing most of the lifting. The Treasurer spoke also of fairness and intergenerational responsibility, and yet young people will bear the brunt of this government's cruelty. The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling found that low-income couples, children and single parents will lose up to 15 per cent of their disposable income when these measures are fully implemented. NATSEM Principle Research Fellow, Ben Phillips, told Emma Griffiths from ABC News that around 1.2 million families would be, on average, around $3,000 a year worse off by 2017-18. An unemployed single parent of two school-age children would lose over $4,000 a year, or nearly 15 per cent of their disposable income, by 2017. This parent would still lose this amount if they found a job that paid $40,000. A couple with two school-age children who both work to bring in a combined income of $60,000 would lose $6,000 a year of their disposable income. Even if their annual income climbed to $90,000, the loss would remain the same. Mr Phillips described this as 'a substantial hit and these are of course to the families who are already in the most precarious positions'. I am inclined to stronger language. It is taking the most from those who have the least.


In addition, research by the Crawford School of Public Policy at the ANU has found that those receiving government benefits do the heavy lifting, as the Treasurer would say, in this budget. This research found that an unemployed single parent with an eight-year-old child would lose $54 a week, 12 per cent of their disposable income. The GP tax, which is another broken promise, whatever members opposite might say, will also hit the most vulnerable the hardest, tearing down a signal Australian achievement—universal health care—and undermining great steps forward that have been taken in terms of preventative health. The Scullin electorate has the highest rate of bulk-billing in Victoria and I would like to keep it this way. Those opposite have other ideas. We have seen the Prime Minister and the Treasurer mislead the public about who would have to pay the GP tax. The coalition have also been repeating the canard that people are seeing a GP too often, using an inaccurate and inflated figure. Surely a general practitioner is better qualified than a right-wing ideologue in assessing someone's medical condition or someone's health needs. The sick are doing the lifting in this budget.


The Treasurer has spoken about values being more important than figures in this budget—and I am sure that is true; I agree with him on that—but these are the wrong values that inform these budget decisions. The values message here is all too clear: if you are poor, then do not get sick. Or, more starkly: do not be poor—or young, for that matter. And the government's message to motorists, most of us, is just as blunt: if you drive, you will pay more. If you want to get public transport in the outer suburbs, good luck, because the coalition is ideologically opposed to investing in public transport infrastructure, much to the frustration of state colleagues in Victoria, at least. People in Scullin are crying out for public transport infrastructure investment because they have no choice but to drive all too often, and now they will pay at the pump for this government's broken promise on the petrol tax and its refusal to invest in Melbourne Metro and other public transport infrastructure projects. People in Scullin see through the accountancy tricks of this self-described infrastructure Prime Minister. They see no vision to keep our cities productive and liveable.




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—





Sitting suspended from

Mr GILES:
 Finally, I note the biggest lifters of all in this budget are the world's most vulnerable, as 21 per cent in budget savings come from our foreign aid budget. The cruellest cuts of all fall on those who are unable to defend themselves or even be heard here, those who rely on us the most. That is perhaps the most shameful aspect of this budget.


The public's instinctive awareness of the unequal distribution of budget pain has been backed up by NATSEM research, which found that the temporary two per cent income tax increase for the nation's top earners would have a token impact. As Mr Phillips stated:


If you're on $200,000 … your impact would be around $400 per year, and that compares to a single-earner family … who may be losing $3,000 to $4,000 per year by 2017-18 … the top income groups - so the top 20 per cent of households - would have either no impact or a very small positive impact.


A key difference between the government's debt tax and the attacks on low- and middle-income earners is that the debt tax is temporary. The cuts to family payments and other cuts are permanent. It is also worth mentioning, and it is quite interesting, that these figures would have been included in previous budget papers but in this budget they were missing—funny that.


I want to touch briefly on the impact this budget will have on young Australians, on our future. Firstly, I regard spending on education as investment not some dead-weight cost, which is how those opposite seem to treat it. Investing in our young and sometimes our not so young through lifelong learning is how we grow our economy in large part. Making education unaffordable by crippling students with large high-interest loans does not help grow our economy. It does not enable us to get the best and brightest into the most productive vocations.


I think of the conversations I have had with constituents in recent days. One constituent was fearful and angry at the government's proposal to allow for an increase in university fees and the impact this would have on his two daughters—one at university and another aspiring to study medicine at the University of Melbourne—and on the community in general. He was of the view that, as a country, we need to ensure at least that if people apply themselves then they have the same opportunities no matter their economic background. I could not agree more with my constituent but I am disappointed that I was unable to assure him that this government would hold to that maxim.


Prior to the election, when asked about increasing university fees, the Minister for Education, the member for Sturt, said:


 … we have no plans to increase fees …


And after the election he said: 



I
'
m not even considering it because we promised that we wouldn
'
t.


So much for that: another broken promise, another callous disregard and breach of faith with the Australian community.


Secondly, in terms of young people, I note the complete cut-off of any form of support for those under 30 is simply unconscionable in a society such as ours. The Treasurer and Prime Minister insist with robotic insistence that young people will simply find a job, even though Australia's youth unemployment rate is persistently at 12 per cent. The budget projections offer no prospect of this falling in the near future. Where are the jobs to come from, let alone the investment in these young Australians?


The government has also cut programs like Youth Connections which helped young people remain engaged in education and training, and to find work. Why would the government make education more expensive, shut down youth employment programs and then cut off the safety net—any safety net—for young people? It is difficult not to arrive at the conclusion that this government just wants to hurt young, vulnerable Australians. So much for the rhetoric of intergenerational fairness and responsibility.


Last week, I spoke with members of the Whittlesea and District Greek Elderly Citizens Club about the budget—or rather, they spoke to me. I did most of the listening as they told me in heartbreaking detail how difficult their lives would become because of decisions contained in this budget. They wanted to know why, if there was supposedly a budget emergency, there were still tax concessions for the wealthy to contribute to their superannuation and, in particular, how there could be $50,000 cheques sent to millionaires. They wanted to know how a one-off pay freeze to politicians pay was fair compared to a permanent cut to the pension. I had—and I have—no answer to these basic questions of fairness, because this budget is fundamentally unjust. It is also dishonest in its pretence at fairness when there is none. Constituents I hear from are in disbelief and are angry about what this government is seeking to do, and this is compounded by the words of the member for Higgins, who unselfconsciously wrote today in The Australian Financial Review:


Selfishness has taken over from self-reliance. For our children's sake, we need to reverse the trend.


This budget entrenches and embodies selfishness. And for our children's sake, I am seeking to reverse this trend—the trend of the government's making.


I do not think people want to get into a mathematical debate about the price of everything, but people are right to be concerned with the standard and quality of living. It is no accident that in recent weeks inequality has become a hot topic right across the developed world. Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century has shone the light on intergenerational inequality—something much spoken about by this government but little attended to. And yet this government seems determined to return Australia to a gilded age of inequality, whereby if you are not born into wealth, the game of life is rigged against you. 


As Piketty writes: 


The history of inequality is shaped by the way economic, social and political actors view what is just and what is not, as well as by the relative power of those actors and the collective choices that result.


This budget before us is an enactment of the excesses of wealth and power over the poor and vulnerable. It is unjust, and the Labor Party chooses to stand against these excesses.


The Prime Minister promised—I think this was a solemn promise—that this would be a 'no surprises, no excuses' government. On Melbourne radio, the day before the election, the Prime Minister said: 'The fact is the most important thing I can do for our country in the coming months is to ensure that it is possible once more to have faith in your polity, to have faith in your government and that means keeping commitments.' I could not agree more with the then opposition leader and now Prime Minister. But, sadly, the months since that day show that the people of Australia can have no faith whatever in this government, a government that treats the promises it made before the election as mere statements of puffery which can be walked away from, if not openly laughed at, as the Minister for Education seemed to do in the chamber today.


I am holding them to account for the broken promises of their government. The Treasurer of Australia described this process as 'silly populist games'. Treasurer, let me say this: keeping your promises is not a silly populist game. It is how elected officials keep faith with the Australian people. It is fundamental to the operation of our democratic system.


The Prime Minister said that he would be prepared to take a hit in the polls for the country. How terribly noble of him! But families, students, the poor and so many others in our society are taking a hit already, a hit much larger and with a considerably more painful impact than this government's decline in polling—a decline that I am sure will continue.


The premiers and chief ministers—most of them conservative—were clearly labouring under the delusion the Abbott government would keep its promises. I think they have learned their lesson now. The Prime Minister attempted to muddy the waters in this regard, claiming this government's $80 billion cuts to the health and education budgets of states and territories would not take effect for years. It turns out, of course, they will start taking effect on 1 July. As with cuts in other areas, there is no plan for how schools and hospitals are meant to cope with these cuts. They are expected to simply find efficiencies. Only the coalition could regard a hospital as more efficient when it closes beds or a school more efficient as it sacks teachers.


While the people of Scullin will pay the price for this government's broken promises, this government will wear this budget like a crown of thorns at the next election—as it should. I was inspired by the Leader of the Opposition's rousing budget reply. It captured the real mood of the nation. I look forward to prosecuting the case against this government. But, more importantly, I look forward to making the case for a better, more inclusive government, one that keeps faith with the Australian people and one the Australian people can have faith in.


This is a cruel budget that rests on a false premise, but it is so much worse than that. It is narrow, unfair, bereft of vision or competence and deeply, dishonestly ideological. It has already defined this government, and Labor will ensure that it does not confine Australia's future.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2014-05-26,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (18:02):  There comes a time when you have to stand up and be counted, when all of us have to make serious decisions about our future. In particular, governments should do what they believe is right for the nation and not necessarily what they believe will be popular in the short term. That is the point we are at at the moment. I have always said that we as elected members are sent to this place not to agree with every whim of every constituent who comes to see us each day. We are sent here because we are considered to be well-rounded individuals who will make well-informed decisions on behalf of our electorates. That is what governments should do as well.


I turn to the budget. Is the budget today in crisis? There have been great discussions about that throughout the media and other places in Australia. This budget, the sixth one by Wayne Swan, that was left to us by the Labor government is $49 billion in the red. Is that a crisis? Could we as an incoming government have kicked the can down the road for a couple more years? Perhaps we could have, but by then the remedies would be more painful.


I am worried that the civilised democracies of the world are in some way failing. They are still, as Winston Churchill said, the worst form of government except for all the rest. But, in fact, it seems to be increasingly difficult in advanced democracies for governments to give people what they need rather than what they want. If governments give people what they need and the constituency turns to another party that says it will give them what they want, which is the easy way out, then those who have the strength to deliver what they need are never in power. I see this right across the democracies of the Western world. And that is why it is so important to act earlier rather than later, before the problem becomes insurmountable—and we do have enough of a problem at the moment.


Those who say that our debt is nothing to worry about, that it is not even to the average of the OECD nations, demonstrate to me that they have very little experience in managing debt and managing business debt. I was a farmer before I got to this place. Farmers say, 'We understand that there's good debt and there's bad debt.' Good debt for a farmer means that you might be expanding your agricultural operation. You might be buying the neighbour's farm, or you might be investing in land improvement. You might be investing in new machinery that will make you more efficient and grow a better crop. That is good debt because you are borrowing to grow a bigger pie. Bad debt is if you go and spend it on things like machinery you do not need, for instance, or overseas holidays, boats or beach shacks. Now, there is nothing wrong with any of those things, and many of my friends have them, but I strongly suggest that they do not borrow money to achieve those outcomes.


In a national sense, examples of good debt are when governments borrow to build roads, rail and new ports and make the nation a more prosperous place. Bad debt, but not necessarily bad spending, is when we borrow and borrow increasing amounts to deal with the day-to-day expenses of government—things like pensions, health and education. And especially bad debt—I will put in another category here—is when government borrows money and wastes it. We have seen a bit of that in the recent past: pink batts, overpriced school halls, hopelessly run low-cost-housing initiatives for the homeless and an NBN plan drawn up on the back of a coaster. Since I am probably at risk of getting completely off the subject, enough said on that particular subject at the moment.


But how have we come to be where we are? After six years of Labor government, we have total deficits of $191 billion and another $123 billion more in the pipeline. Treasury says that, without change, Australia faces deficits until 2024, and the Commission of Audit indicates that, without serious changes, they will not end then either. With no change in policy, we know that Australia would reach a peak debt of $667 billion. Remember Prime Minister Rudd's pronouncement—and he is a good friend, I am sure, of the member opposite, the member for Bruce. Mr Rudd said, 'We will be a government committed to surpluses.' But then, when he became elected and we had the GFC, he qualified that statement and said, 'We are a government that is committed to surpluses over the economic cycle.' Sixteen years plus—I just wonder: how long is that economic cycle? We are left in this mess because Labor has no plan but the fairy plan. That means that the fairies down at the bottom of the garden will do the job.


We already pay $1 billion a month in interest on the borrowings, and in another six or seven years, without change, that would double to $2 billion a month. Perhaps those who think that is manageable should consider where our economy is at the moment. Interest rates could very well double in a period like six or seven years. We are at the low end of a cycle on interest rates. Two-thirds of our debt is held overseas and so is subject to the vagaries of international exchange rates, and we, as an exporting nation, are very susceptible to volatile commodity prices. In only the last few weeks we have seen iron ore, for instance, drop below $100 a tonne, down from $130 less than six months ago. Those types of shocks for the Australian economy are very real and could happen at any stage. That is why we need to be more conservative than other nations.


We have known many of the problems facing the Australian economy for quite some time. Peter Costello's 2003 Intergenerational report laid it out on the table. We have an ageing population and a bulge which is going to put demands on our economy that we have never seen before. Costello, to his credit, is the only Treasurer up until Joe Hockey to actually have a go at trying to do something about it. It is all very new age to dump on Peter Costello now and say: 'He didn't do enough with the mining boom. Why didn't they save more money?' But at the time my memory was that there was plenty of pressure going around saying, 'Why are you taking all our taxes and running a $20 billion surplus?' So Peter Costello wisely invested in the Future Fund, around about $70 billion. That is now $88 billion. Since Costello left the Treasury, since we lost the election in 2007, what has been contributed to the Future Fund from government funds? Nothing, not another cent. Yet it was meant to target $140 billion, and that is just to meet the superannuation costs of public servants. Yes, the budget has some firm measures but none of us should believe any of the hyperbole predicting the end of the world as we know it from the usual suspects. What else can they say? Largely we are where we are now because of them. 


Take, for instance, the higher education reforms. Last year I was privileged to be part of a Liberal Party working group on online education. It was an eye-opener. The advent of the massive online open courses has been a revolution across the online world. Increasingly quality universities around the world are focusing their resources into developing quality degrees online. In the future you will see students in Australia being able to log onto their online course 24 hours a day for advice. They will have computer systems which will adapt to their learning ability, that will build new work programs around the student reflecting their weaknesses and their strengths. This will be a revolution. So instead of shopping down the end of the street at the local university for your degree, you will be able to have your degree from the very best universities in the world wherever they may be. 


We know that Australian universities, like our schools unfortunately, are slipping down the pecking order. The people who make the loudest noise would have us believe that everything is working now. It is not working now. We have got problems in the system now that we need to address. Unless we do something we are heading for a slow train wreck because much of the money that sustains our higher education system at the moment is coming from overseas students, chiefly out of Asia. If we keep slipping down that pecking order we will not have those students because increasingly they have better universities and they will have that online opportunity to get quality degrees at a reasonable price. We have to allow our universities the flexibility to adapt into this new marketplace and we really do need to have a number of quality universities in the top 20 and in the top 100 so that we can market brand Australia as an education destination.


Let us have a quick look at Medicare and the co-payment. Ten years ago we were spending $8 billion on Medicare; now it is $19 billion, more than double. The Australian population in 2004 was 20 million; now it is 23 million, an increase of 15 per cent. So we have doubled expenditure on Medicare while our population has only gone up 15 per cent. If we do nothing, by 2024 it will be $34 billion, or almost double again. I do not have to tell you the population will not be doubled by then. Clearly that is not sustainable. That is why we need to make a stand now and start to pull the budget back into order.


I have been saying throughout my electorate that the budget has something that everybody does not like and I think that is probably an indication that we are trying to spread the load across the electorate. On that basis I have been saying to Australians that we all have to bear a bit of pain and all have to do our bit for the nation. That is why I say they should consider the budget as a down payment on Australia's future. However, on the basis that we should spread the pain equally across Australia and the states and electorates, I must register my disappointment at the loss of the supplementary roads program to South Australian councils, one that cuts particularly close to home. This supplementary road program has been in place since 2004. It was recognised by John Howard and Peter Costello in those times that South Australia was the victim of a faulty formula in the distribution of the identified local roads funding program. In 2004 the government funded a three-year program to address this shortfall. In 2007 it extended it for another three years. In 2010 the then Rudd government gave it two more years and, in 2013, just one more year. You would have to think that that was just to get it past the election. To my mind, there is no way that, had the Labor Party been returned, we would ever have seen the program funded again on that basis—because it was not in the forward estimates.


Even though I understand that, in that case, it would be a new funding program for this government, I do not think we have got it right. The perception that the formula is flawed is held widely throughout South Australia. It has been in place since the early 1990s and I think that, if we are not to have the funding, at the very least we should have a review of this situation—and it should be done urgently. So I am calling on my colleagues in government to move towards that position, to fix a wrong that has existed for some time. If the South Australian councils have the opportunity to have their say and their case is found wanting, at least we can then move on from that conflict and say, 'That is behind us—you have had your opportunity and we have found that the formula is correct, so let's put up with it.' If, on the other hand, it is found to be deficient, then of course as a government interested in fairness we should do something about it.


Without taking us too far off track, in the 35 seconds I have left I would like to look briefly at what happened in Greece. While I do not liken Australia's debt situation to that of Greece, let me say that when we talk about Australian government debt we are talking about only 50 per cent of it. Fifty per cent of it is held by the states. For those that compare us to other OECD countries, they do not necessarily have state debt. In about 25 years, Greece went from not much debt to an absolute cot case and they had to cut the pension by over 60 per cent. (Time expired)

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (18:17):  For many months now, I have been bracing myself for the impact of this budget. I knew that this budget would be bad for Canberra and I warned my constituents accordingly—so much so, in fact, that the Liberal senator for the ACT accused me of scaremongering on more than one occasion. However, not even I was prepared for just how bad this budget turned out to be. The Abbott government made absolutely no attempt to hide its disdain for Canberra and for the Public Service. I knew that cuts to the Public Service were coming but, that said, I had not expected the cuts to be so harsh—some 16½ thousand jobs cut plus an increase in the efficiency dividend of 0.25 per cent. There are over 7,000 Public Service jobs to go in the next year alone. 


The impacts of this budget on Canberra will be even worse than I had feared. I have had constituents tell me that they think it could even be worse than 1996—and I will just remind those opposite of what happened to my city in 1996. In 1996, the Howard government was elected on a supposed promise to get rid of 2½ thousand public servants through natural attrition. That ended up being 15,000 public servants here in Canberra alone and 30,000 nationally. What was the impact on my town? House prices plummeted and we went through an economic slump for five years. We had two quarters of negative growth; people left town; the local shops closed down; businesses went under; bankruptcies, both non-business and business, went up. It had a huge impact not just on Canberra but on the entire capital region—Yass, Griffith, Queanbeyan, down at the South Coast and all around. It had an enormous impact, an enormous ripple effect, and it was five years before we came out of that hole. So when I am accused by Liberal senators for the ACT of scaremongering, I say to them: 'All I'm doing is reading the budget out loud.'


In addition to the Public Service job cuts, Canberra was hit with funding cuts to the ANU, the University of Canberra, NICTA and CSIRO. Canberra's world-class cultural institutions were hit with cuts that will lead to the loss of specialised and skilled staff. And in the first budget of the self-proclaimed infrastructure Prime Minister there was a distinct lack of infrastructure investment in the national capital.


This was the worst possible version of the attack on Canberra for which I had been bracing. In fact, as I said, some people have said that it is even worse than 1996 and what happened to this town then. However, what I had not expected was that this budget would also be a blatant and outrageous attack on the youth of Australia. I also did not expect a Prime Minister who had said that there is no greater friend of Medicare than him to destroy the fundamental principles of the universality of Medicare. I did not expect a Prime Minister who was a former health minister and knows full well the benefits of preventive and primary health to completely undermine the principles of preventive and primary health that exist throughout the MBS and PBS. And I did not expect a Prime Minister who said he would be the Prime Minister for Indigenous affairs to rip hundreds of millions of dollars of funding from Indigenous health.


I attended a crisis meeting last week with the Indigenous community health service provider in my electorate, Winnunga Nimmityjah. They provide a fantastic service to between 30 and 50 per cent of the region for everything from diabetes control to immunisation, child and neonatal health, GP services, dental health, physio, psychology and psychiatry—you name it. Winnunga provide a fantastic service to the Indigenous members of our community in Canberra and the capital region. At this crisis meeting they called of people not just in Canberra but from around the country I was told by those Indigenous health leaders that, through the cuts that will happen as a result of the Abbott government budget, the gap will not close but widen.


I did not expect a Prime Minister who promised prior to the election that he would make no changes to the age pension to rip funding from pensioners by lowering the indexation rate for that pension. I did not expect a government that had spent the last six years in opposition speaking about cost of living and framing every single debate around cost of living, to introduce at the first chance a budget that dramatically increases the cost of living for Australian families. Perhaps what I least expected was a government that said it wanted to fix the budget being a government that in fact created a false budget emergency so that it could be seen to be fixing the budget and not just reduce the deficit. Instead, this budget was full of new spending initiatives such as the gold plated parental leave, an $8 billion gift to the Reserve Bank and a new medical research fund.


Even though I went into this budget fearing the worst, I had obviously overestimated the Abbott government. The Australian people have seen this budget for what it is: grossly unfair, based on lies and bad for our country. If those opposite will not listen to me perhaps they will listen to my constituents. The letters I am about to read out are just some of the dozens of emails, letters and phone calls I have received over the past two weeks from Canberrans outraged by the Abbott government's budget of broken promises. The first reads:


Hi Gai


I live in Kambah and have two sons studying at a school in Canberra, one currently completing Year 12 and the other in Year 10.


Two weeks before Christmas last year I lost my job via a ""Voluntary"" redundancy (which of course wasn't really voluntary at all). I had been a dedicated and efficient public servant for the past 25 years. I have been unemployed since and although I've applied for many jobs, I have been unsuccessful in being able to obtain one (even just an interview). I am 46 years old so it will be quite some time before I can draw a superannuation pension therefore I have to work.


Before the Election, my two sons both had apprenticeships lined up. However, since and because of the Budget, both offers of apprenticeships have been withdrawn by their potential employers. This has really upset them and I worry greatly for their futures.


I don't know how we are going to survive. Really, I am so terribly worried about our future. In my 25 years as a public servant, I've never seen it this bad in Canberra.


Please FIGHT and fight hard for us against this budget and this destructive Government. They have gone in too hard, too fast and hit the people who can least afford it. I ask that you strongly oppose this Budget with all your might and trigger another Election.


The next one reads:


Dear Ms Brodtmann,


I am an expat Australian living in Asia. I was devastated to hear that the government has axed the Australian Network. I watch it almost every evening, and the AFL football on the weekend. It is my life line to home: the news, the drama series (world class) and of course the footy. I encourage my English language students to view the free language lessons available. Most importantly, it is 'Australia's presence' in the region, one of the G20, more powerful than a military base. The status it gives us, the prestige it bestows (most countries cannot have a global network), is uncountable, and surely worth more than the meagre millions being redirected. Please raise this matter with the government—Australians living and working o/s are collectively gutted! thank you for your time.


This letter reads:


Dear Gai,


What a nightmare the budget is! I understand that we, as a country, need to make changes to reduce our deficit and plan for the increase in cost of some areas of the future, but we are so disappointed that this budget is just so unimaginative and base.


The policy that distresses us most at the moment is the deregulation of the University fee structure and the resultant higher fees. Our son is currently in his second year at the University of Sydney, so he will be less affected than younger people yet to start out.


Please Gai we need you and your colleagues to do something about this terrible policy. What amendments can you propose, what parts can you block? How will our young people ever be able to afford to buy houses when they will be saddled with an $80K debt? How will they afford higher degrees and what will it do to their general spending power, none of this can be good for the economy.


We want to commend and encourage you in your fight for the best for this country.


Another letter reads:


I am an ACT resident so I write to you all as representatives with a feeling of desperation for common sense and decency in this country.


I find it hard to stomach seeing our current government present and then defend their proposed budget that targets the less well off in the country while providing what is effectively a handout to big business.


I've been unemployed here in Canberra for 12 months. So all these young people will now have to wait with zero income and then only get 6 months cover before plunging back to zero income. Sure there will always be ways to improve targeting but can the government please see and acknowledge that crime rates will be affected for instance, severe hardship will be imposed on families, depression rates increase? I have always looked to the government and paid my taxes all my life in the belief that the money is a fair contribution to society and those on the margins and should always be there. You don't balance a budget by kicking unemployed people in the guts and handing big sums in a Paid Parental Leave scheme that no-one else but Tony Abbot was calling for!


Another one reads:


This is the first time I have written to a politician since I was at university—a long time ago—but I feel I have a moral duty to say something now. As a sixth generation Australian I am appalled at what the government has done.


I see a government for the top 3 % in our society looking for the best possible way to fund reductions in their private and corporate income tax by reducing support for the most vulnerable in our society. The measures the government has announced are designed to create an underclass denied the long term health, education and social benefits we, as citizens of one of the wealthiest countries in the world, should make available to everyone.


How can it benefit our future to create an underclass of the chronically ill, under educated and disaffected? In this technological society there is and will continue to be fewer and fewer places for the unskilled. Why create more of them and how will these people work into their 70s? This budget will end any ambition that Australia might become 'the clever country'. It certainly would have ensured that I, as a policeman's daughter in the 1970s, would never have got to university. I am perfectly cognisant of the fact that we have an aging and longer living population but dumping half of them on a scrap heap of need doesn't seem to be a moral response. The ridiculous levy will be felt by few and paid by less.


These changes won't affect me much but they will affect my view of my country. Any society is judged on the basis of how it treats its weakest members. The Prime Minister has cast his attempt to change the nature of this country as an 'act of political courage'. Maybe, but it is not an intelligent act nor a goodhearted one. I would prefer to describe it as an 'act of political bastardry'. As my elected representative I am requesting that you do everything in your power to prevent these appalling assaults on our social fabric—even if that means we end up going to the polls again this year. 



And another reads:


Hi Gai,


I'm not normally one to write to politicians, however I feel in this case I need to express my concern with the way the country is being managed.


I am 28 years old, single with no children, earn around 100K per year with the federal APS and have private health insurance. I pay my fair share of taxes, contribute to the community through volunteer work and actively represent the Australian culture by being fair and equal to others.


However, I am greatly concerned with the recent federal budget and the impact it is going to have on me and the Canberra community.


Firstly, I am concerned with the large-scale public sector cuts being disproportionately thrown at the Canberra community. I am worried about the flow on effect this will have on the local economy including retail and hospitality, as well as the housing market, thus creating a mass exodus of locals finding greater stability in other areas of the country. I am so sick of having to defend my profession when I speak to non-locals, or continually view the Liberal Party's smearing of the public sector as lazy fat cats who sit ripe on high incomes. That 100K I'm earning—do you know how many Christmas's I have spent away from family, or holidays I have sacrificed to meet the government's policy objectives, or the late nights spent worrying about a deadline. I can assure you that I'm definitely not sitting around, smoking a cigar enjoying the so called lazy fat cat lifestyle of the public service.


Secondly, I am concerned about the federal government's withdrawal of $80 billion in state/territory funding for health and education, and the possibility that this may position the state and territories in a situation where they request an increase in the GST. Thankfully I am earning quite a nice salary, especially for my age, however how do you expect the general population to survive in this country when gas and electricity is going up, fuel prices continue to rise (especially in Canberra), healthy food is too expensive for a single income let alone a family, and on top of that the GST may rise.


Gai, how are people supposed to survive?


Lastly, I am concerned with the increase to the fuel excise in a city that heavily relies on cars because of an inadequate public transport system. Will the light rail project continue now that the ACT economy is going to lose funding?


I am very concerned about the way Canberra has been hit with this budget, and as a member of the voting public—a taxpayer and contributing member to the Canberra community—I want to ensure that my concerns are heard and acknowledged, and represented as necessary.


To those opposite, I implore you: if you will not listen to me, listen to the people of Canberra and of Australia. The people who have contacted me are not necessarily Labor supporters; they are not necessarily political. They are just ordinary Australians, ordinary Canberrans, who have been outraged by this budget, who have been betrayed by a Prime Minister who promised that he would be true to his word.


This is not only a budget of broken promises but a budget of broken dreams. It is a budget that will both entrench and widen the gap between the rich and the poor. It is a budget that is unfair and, to quote one of my constituents: 'devastating for Canberra and is a budget that asks Canberrans to do the heavy lifting for the nation'. (Time expired)

"Gillespie, David, MP",Nats,2014-05-26,"



Dr GILLESPIE
 (Lyne) (18:32):  This is a tough budget; it had to be. To make an analogy of the mortgage on an Australian house: the house had been paid for, the mortgage had been paid off. We had savings in the bank but, in the space of six years, slowly, we as a nation had all our savings spent for us. The house had been remortgaged, then mortgaged again for another five years so that the mortgage was greater than the value of the house. The then government mortgaged it a bit more and started paying off the bill with a credit card. That is such a good analogy. That is the situation we are in. That is why this budget had to be tough. 


The coalition promised to stop the boats and to end the waste. We promised to build the roads of the 21st century and, most importantly, we promised to get the budget back under control. We have introduced and implemented policies necessary to stop the boats. We have not had any arrivals for over five months. We have begun investing in Australia's biggest infrastructure program, with $50 billion to be spent up to 2019. We are cutting red tape and getting rid of the waste. Earlier in this parliament we introduced measures to cut over $700 million in federal red tape costs. We are getting the budget back under control.


The reality is, if we had continued on that spending binge, wasting money on things like school hall rip-offs, broken-down laptops and with billions of dollars in deficit, our gross debt at the end of 2024, just 10 years in the future, would have reached $667 billion. The interest rate on our current debt equates to $12 billion a year, and that is rising. That is an amazing amount of money.


In the last three governments of Rudd, Gillard and Rudd, the millions, which were often quoted as huge amounts of money, slowly rolled into billions. People have got blase about debt. But what could we have done with $12 billion? We could have been building a four-lane divided highway from Sydney to Brisbane every year. We could have built 40 state-of-the-art regional base hospitals. Better still, over the last six years we could have established two or three of the Medical Research Future Fund that we are creating.


There are short-term measures which have changed the situation for the nation, but they had to be made so that there can be long-term repair. We want to be back on track to being a competitive nation, capable of tackling the challenges that the world throws up. We are dependent, to a large degree, on China's economy. What would happen to our economy if there was turmoil in China? There was the Arab Spring. What would happen to our economy if there was a 'Chinese Spring'? Who knows what could happen? We are building infrastructure that will deliver long-term productivity gains. It will create employment, with a run-off in associated industries. We will be in a much better situation to cope with any international economic shocks.


Contrary to Labor's misinformation campaign, pensions will continue to rise. They will go up twice a year for the term of this parliament according to the current indexation. Then they will go up according to CPI. Education spending will increase over the term of this parliament. To put things in perspective, annual assistance to the states for public hospitals will increase by more than nine per cent each year over the next three years and then four per cent in the fourth year. That is a massive increase of state expenditure. The funding for public hospitals will increase by more than $5 billion, from $13.8 billion this year to $18.9 billion in 2017-18. Overall health spending will increase by $10 billion or 16 per cent from $64.5 billion to $74.8 billion in 2017-18. Plus, we will have created the Medical Research Future Fund, which will itself deliver great efficiencies in the way we deliver health care. Medical research is where all the medical advances that we take for granted come from.


Also, contrary to the misinformation campaign that has hit the airwaves since the budget was released, there will be a record recurrent funding investment of $64.5 billion in schools over the next four years from the federal government. As I mentioned, the pension is not being reduced. It will increase again this September. Age pensioners will be better off as well because, by cutting the carbon tax, that annual cost of $550 for every household will be reduced. The energy supplement will continue. The pension supplement will continue.


The demographics of the nation are changing. By 2035, one in three of us will live to be 100. By that time, there will be a 400 per cent increase in those over 85 years of age. We have to make things sustainable. The pension age was already changed to 67 by the previous government for future years, from 2023. But we are giving a whole generation of people the chance to plan for their pension eligibility age by 2035. The reason for that is that there will be twice as many of us who are in the state of requiring government support. At the moment 80 per cent of people over 65 end up relying on a pension. If that doubles with the increases over time it would simply not be sustainable. The previous government recognised this and governments overseas have realised this. We have to take the hard decisions now.


The other thing is that just in this four-year term our debt—and I have mentioned the 10-year debt projections—if we sat back and did nothing, which some members on the other side of the House have recommended we do, we would be left with another $123 billion on top of the $200 billion we already owe. By means of this budget and the tough decisions, that $123 billion projected debt will be halved to $60 billion, and the 10-year debt will be down to $389 billion.


These are massive amounts of debt, and if we do not address these changes we will be in the situation of Greece, Ireland, Spain and all those nations that for the last 20 or 30 years have been living off the credit card. Most of these nations have got to the stage where their debt is so great that it is beyond the means of any nation to get rid of. So they are committed to paying massive amounts of interest on the international borrowings, virtually forever. Nevertheless, all those nations that I have mentioned have redressed this and are trying to get their debt under control. It is the same in the UK; they were in a situation where they realised that things had to change. People should not be afraid of change if they realise it is for their long-term sustainability. We, as a generation, cannot saddle our children and our children's children with paying perpetual amounts of the annual budget of the nation in interest payments.


The infrastructure spend that I have mentioned is a massive bill. Just in my electorate of Lyne, we will have $1.129 billion spent on the Pacific Highway dual lane expansion. That will deliver at least 1,000 direct jobs and probably the same number again in indirect jobs. It will bring our part of the mid-North Coast closer to the Brisbane market. Transport costs will shrink. The produce that we bring into the region, the product that we get out and our tourism products all rely on the Pacific Highway, so it will be a massive benefit.


The Bucketts Way, the artery of commerce in the south-west of the electorate, has been long ignored by the last government. They made all sorts of pronouncements about improving it, but we are actually delivering $17.8 million, including GST, to the Gloucester council and the Greater Taree City Council in the term of this government.


We have announced increases to black spots and Roads to Recovery funding, which are essential. You should see the state of some of the roads in the regions. They no longer have a continuous bitumen surface; they are a collection—a mosaic—of patches for stretches of hundreds and hundreds of metres. There is a clean sheet every now and then, rather than the other way round, with an odd patch every now and again. And that leads to road safety improvement. Financial assistance grants are quarantined to councils, so they will continue.


The deregulation of the higher education sector will mean that there is an expansion of the demand-driven system and, with the budget estimates and education assessments, hopefully that will lead to another 80,000 students being enrolled in education beyond school. The deregulation and the changes the budget bring in mean that it will be delivered through alternative pathways into universities. Colleges with diplomas, associate diplomas and associate degrees, of which there are several in my region, will have students who can access Commonwealth supported places because we have expanded the number of institutions that attract Commonwealth funding. As well, the existing institutions that have the ability to raise fees will be putting into their own funds for Commonwealth scholarships. One dollar in five of the money they raise from the deregulation will go into that. So people with low-socioeconomic capability and standing will have another fund to enhance their entry into higher education.


Contributions from the savings from the co-payment will be delivered into the Medical Research Future Fund. What a great initiative. Medical research is something that Australian scientists are really good at. If that can be used in some of the existing programs, the research can be sped up. New avenues of research can be developed. There is so much intellectual capital in the scientific, particularly in the biomedical and the medical, space. This will be an area of growth. If you look at all the medical scientists in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, the major centres, the spin-off to the economy is staggering. Talk about growing. The best businesses to grow in your own region are those that are already there. People look for these magic new industries, and they do come along all the time, but the quickest way to expand things is to expand what you do now. That is what that Medical Research Future Fund will do.


There are many challenges that the nation faces, but this budget is addressing them. All the social good and every program that Australians rely on will come into question. Can you imagine if we do not make the tough decisions now? Can you imagine if we did, as one of the previous members mentioned, kick the problem down the road, which countries overseas have done for decades? Their chickens have come home to roost. We have to make the tough decisions, and that is what this budget does. But they have been responsible, they have been measured and they are necessary. I commend these bills to the House.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (18:47):  Firstly let me say to the previous member that I have been an observer of budgets since I first came into this place in 1987, and this budget perpetrates the greatest fraud on the Australian community of any budget I have witnessed or known of. New members into this place need to really understand what a fraud this budget is. It is based on lies as a result of announcements made by the Prime Minister before the election that there would be no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts to pensions and no plans to increase university fees, and that Tony Abbott would be the infrastructure Prime Minister and the Prime Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Nothing could be further from the truth. All this budget does is perpetrate a fraud upon the Australian community.


Australians are rightly, as the Leader of the Opposition said, shocked and angry—shocked by the brutality of the government's attack on our way of life and angry at a Prime Minister who pretended to be on our side. We just need to look at the various items in the budget to get a really good appreciation of what that means. Health should not be determined by your wealth. However, a GP tax or more expensive medicines will put more pressure on families struggling to make ends meet. If people do not go to the doctor because of this tax, the health of people will fail, with more acute presentations. PBS medicines will also incur, of course, a co-payment.


Let me be very clear. We already know that people have taken the decision, as a result of the budget announcement, not to go to the doctors. We have heard this from doctors in Western Sydney. We know it from doctors in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health services. This is what is happening. People have been scared by this announcement. If the sickest and poorest of Australians do not see a doctor, that means the sickest and poorest Australians will die early. That is what will happen as a direct result of this budget. This government has failed one of its prime responsibilities, to care for its people, and it will of course cost us more in the long run.


Hospitals servicing the people of Lingiari will also face a $2.8 billion cut over five years. These hospitals are already bursting at the seams and struggling within their own budgets. The Northern Territory government has cut funding in health and education at the same time as this government has done the same thing. The Prime Minister lied to voters before the election, and his lies will now hurt poorer families and the most disadvantaged.


Lingiari schools will face cuts of up to $181.7 million over the next five years. From 2018, schools will be further handicapped by reduced indexation payments. University student loans will have to be repaid earlier with a substantial increase of interest payments from a current 2.25 per cent, and they will be asked to cough up 60 per cent of the cost of going to university.


Let us be very clear about this. People who come from regional Australia, from remote Australia, from my electorate—all of the Northern Territory except Darwin and Palmerston, including Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands, 1.34 million square kilometres, a very dispersed population—will be the most disadvantaged by these hideous attacks upon their livelihood and upon the way of life that they experience. University will become less of an attractive option, and regional universities such as Charles Darwin University will suffer as a result of the announcements which have been made in this budget. The result for young people in Lingiari will almost certainly mean a decline in the numbers of those interested in pursuing a tertiary education at Charles Darwin University or other universities around the country.


Lingiari pensioners, of course, will be hit as every other pensioner in Australia will be hit as a result of the announcements made in this budget. Now they will have to work longer and then receive a pension, if they are lucky, which is significantly reduced due to a change in the indexation system from the current 27.7 per cent of average male weekly earnings to a new, lesser, CPI index. Over time, that will cause a dramatic hit to their pocket, and they know it. This government is trying again to perpetuate a lie that somehow or another, because it will index pensions continually and move the CPI, it will not make a difference. The government knows it makes a difference. Old-age pensioners in this country know it makes a difference. Any reasonable Australian will understand that it will make a difference.


And of course the government have perpetrated the same hideous attack upon service pensioners. I cannot believe what the government have done, yet they have the hide to say that they are a friend of Australian Defence Force personnel and veterans. They are far from that.


Indeed, when we look at job seekers, we see people with no income support for six months. What will job seekers under 30 years old do with no income or support for six months? Who is going to support them in a place like Lingiari with dispersed populations, overcrowded houses, no jobs and no training opportunities? Who is going to do this? The mind boggles at the inane way in which this government has formulated this budget, because it has attacked the most vulnerable and, as the Leader of the Opposition said, it will create an underclass. And, of course, under-25-year-olds will lose their Newstart allowance to go onto the much lower youth allowance. This will put enormous pressure upon families not only in Lingiari but across this country.


Then we heard today about infrastructure. We heard the Deputy Prime Minister get up in question time today and pout on about how he had done such magnificent things in the seat of Lingiari as a result of this budget. The only infrastructure money of any substance for my electorate of Lingiari appears to be $45 million for six strategic bush roads. These were announcements which I made previously and which were accounted for in the forward estimates from the former Labor budgets. There were no new announcements—no new announcements—made for Lingiari. Overall, the Territory, with a sixth of the Australian landmass, will receive for infrastructure around $670 million over 10 years—$67 million a year—out of a national budget of $126 billion. Even the ACT will get $700 million, more than the Northern Territory. Have an understanding, Prime Minister, of the infrastructure needs of remote and regional Australia. You clearly do not, and certainly the Deputy Prime Minister has no idea.


Aboriginal people of Lingiari make up 40 per cent of the electorate's population. They have been particularly let down by this budget and by their own senator and minister, Senator Scullion. He is responsible as a senator and a cabinet minister for advocating for the Territory and its interests at the cabinet table. He has failed miserably. Senator Scullion sat by and watched $534 million be ripped out of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs budget? How can you be serious about closing the gap when you rip $534 million of program money from these budgets? $160 million over three years has been ripped out of the Aboriginal health budget. They have put that money into their health future fund. If you were going to take this money out because you thought you could find some efficiencies, you would invest the money back into front-line services. That is not what this government have done. They have abandoned Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians through these hideous cuts. Cuts to child care, arts centres, drug, alcohol and tobacco education and mental health programs will have an enormous impact on Australia's first peoples. In addition, Aboriginal legal services will have to endure cuts of $13 million over four years, which will result in more Aborigines going to jail for what will likely be trivial offences like nonpayment of fines. What a shame. Shame on Senator Scullion and shame on the Prime Minister and the Treasurer.


Indigenous health is something I know something about. I know a lot about some things, but this is something I know a particular amount about. The Abbott government need to come clean about the real impacts of these deep cuts to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. They have clearly failed to appreciate the serious repercussions of the cuts they have made and of the new taxes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health outcomes.


The evidence is undisputed. Smoking contributes to a four-year difference in the life expectancy of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Smoking contributes to 20 per cent of deaths of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. It directly causes a third of the burden of cardiovascular disease and cancer in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Yet this government, through this budget, is cutting funding to the anti-tobacco campaigns in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.


We know already that in cutting the Preventive Health Agency they are making a mockery of their supposed concern for the lives of ordinary Australians let alone Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. They have made it very, very clear that this fundamental, very important and essential part of our health infrastructure—the Preventive Health Agency—has no place in their future. We all know about the tsunami of diabetes which is confronting us. This organisation is very important, yet it is nothing to this government. They know that chronic disease will only be improved by encouraging people to seek treatment, get health checks and access preventative health services such as these smoking education campaigns.


The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health service will have to absorb the massive cost of the co-payments. Many will be unable to cover the cost of vital health services, such as pathology, imaging and a range of specialist services that are often required with complex health issues. The people who will suffer are the sickest and poorest people in this country, and those are the people for whom we are saying we want to close the gap on life expectancy. They are going to be hit hard by these proposals. We know that they are less likely to seek assistance through health services.


Let me talk about petrol for a moment. Constituents in my electorate pay on average more than 22c per litre for fuel than the national average bowser price. That is if you live in a city like Alice or Katherine. If you live in a remote community like Numbulwar or Alpurrurulam, before this heartless budget you would have expected to pay more than $2.55 a litre. This price will increase rapidly over the next four years because of the indexation arrangements for petrol they are going to reintroduce—and there will be no relief from this government. Again, the people who most need assistance in our community are going to be disadvantaged.


The majority of businesses in Lingiari are small businesses and they will not benefit from any of the company tax cuts the Prime Minister has made for his mates at the big end of town. Lingiari small businesses will simply see their business inputs, in particular fuel prices, continue to rise.


Then there is the hit to families. The Prime Minister said in May 2011:


A dumb way—


to cut spending—


would be to threaten family benefits or means test them further.


What has he done in this budget? In this budget of cruel surprises it is no real surprise that he has slugged family payments big time. We know what this means. The cut in family tax benefit end-of-year supplement will result in up to $306 per year less to spend at that important time for families when expenses mount up for Christmas. Lingiari Aboriginal families have over 20 per cent more 0-14-year-olds than the national average. They will be the hardest hit. Yet he has got billions of dollars to spend on the really subversive Paid Parental Leave scheme. What a way to spend your money. What a priority this government has got: feed the pockets of millionaires and don't look after families who are most in need. That is clearly what this budget is designed to do. It will create an underclass.


Lingiari will also feel the pain caused by cuts to local government from Regional Development Australia funding. In particular I am disappointed with the defunding of a project partnership between the Katherine Town Council and Godinymayin Yijard Rivers Arts and Cultural Centre to deliver stage 2 of the centre in the Katherine cultural precinct. This project was going to provide increased opportunities for income generation, community engagement, employment and training. You just cannot continue to perpetuate this fraud upon the Australian community. You promise one thing before the election and do entirely the opposite after it. 


Let me talk about veterans' affairs for a moment. The Prime Minister and the current Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Ronaldson, have stated many times that our veterans deserve to be recognised for their unique contribution to Australia. I agree wholeheartedly. Yet what he has done in this budget is cut the veterans' affairs budget by more than $100 million, down from Labor's record $12.5 billion in our 2013-14 budget. The coalition will scrap the senior supplement for veterans who hold a Commonwealth seniors card or gold card, which helps pay for energy costs, telephone and internet costs and water and sewerage expenses. In another blow to veterans, military and other untaxed superannuation income will be counted as income when applying for a Commonwealth seniors card and the deeming rate thresholds will be moved, hitting the part pension of some veterans with small amounts of assets.


You cannot continue to tell these fibs. The people of Lingiari are reeling after this budget. We need to understand that this parliament and this government have an obligation that we should never forget the fair go, we should never forget that Australia is a country where all can share and none should be left behind. But that is precisely what this government does. It will leave people behind, it will create a new underclass. It is a shame on this government, and every member of the government should be most concerned about what this budget will do to the way of life of so many hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Australians.

"McNamara, Karen, MP",LP,2014-05-26,"



Mrs McNAMARA
 (Dobell) (19:02):  On 5 December 2013 I had the privilege of speaking in this place for the first time. On behalf of the people of Dobell I outlined my vision for a future with hope, reward and opportunity. I spoke of the need for the stable jobs that provide meaningful work essential to allowing us to take out long-term investments in our homes and our future. A stronger economy is the key to almost everything we wish for as a community. This government's first budget corrects our nation's course, setting of us on a path towards more jobs, higher wages, better services and a stronger and more cohesive community. These objectives drive our economic action strategy. We must repair the budget and build a strong and prosperous economy for all Australians. 


In my maiden speech I spoke about my desire to see Dobell prosper, my desire for a region home to a vibrant and healthy community well supported and connected through coordinated services and infrastructure, a region with more local employment and quality investment, a region where residents have choice. This budget forms the foundation upon which a stronger Dobell will be built. This government is getting on with the job of building a stronger economy so that everyone can get ahead. This means abolishing the carbon tax, ending the waste, stopping the boats and building the roads of the 21st century. But we must never forget why we were elected to do this. Labor's legacy to Australians is 200,000 more unemployed, gross debt projected to rise to $667 billion, $123 billion in cumulative deficits, more than 50,000 illegal arrivals by boat, the world's biggest carbon tax and a $1 billion per month interest bill. We simply could not continue as we were when Labor and the Greens were in charge. We could not afford to continue paying the mortgage on the credit card to the tune of $1 billion per month. We are doing what we said we would do.


The budget calls on everyone to contribute, to join and grow the workforce, to boost productivity and to help build a stronger economy with more investment. The government is making a historic investment in the 2014-15 budget to get on with building Australia's infrastructure. A core element of the government's economic action strategy is the commitment of an additional $11.6 billion for the Infrastructure Growth Package. By 2019-20 the Commonwealth's total investment in infrastructure will be $50 billion.


The people of Dobell and the Central Coast have long been calling for their fair share of infrastructure funding. For too long our needs were ignored. For six long years under Labor, the people of Dobell were neglected. Dobell will benefit from this government's commitment to build the infrastructure of the 21st century with $7.15 million for local infrastructure projects. Importantly, this investment will be geared towards enhancing our local economy, driving jobs growth and greater private investment in our region. 


As per our election commitment, we are providing $1 million to commence the Tuggerah Sports Precinct—a project that will deliver economic benefits to the Central Coast through increased sports tourism and, importantly, more jobs. The Tuggerah Sports Precinct will not only enable the hosting of regional and national sporting events; it will also provide local sporting clubs access to high-quality sports fields and facilities for local competitions. Our investment has been welcomed by local sporting organisations. Mr Ian Robilliard, Managing Director of the Central Coast Academy of Sport, welcomed our commitment, stating: 'The Tuggerah Sports Precinct is a much needed facility for the region and is well overdue.' Country Rugby League Infrastructure and Game Development Officer Mr Graham Boland endorsed this project stating: 'The development of this facility will allow for large-scale events and add immeasurably to the economic, social and health benefits of the Central Coast Community.' As the member for Dobell, this investment will help realise my determination for Dobell to become the sports tourism capital of New South Wales. 


In addition to supporting sports tourism, it is vital that we invest in and enhance existing infrastructure to support our local economy. The Norah Head boat ramp is Dobell's only sea access boat ramp. The boat ramp plays a vital role in supporting our tourist economy, drawing locals and visitors alike to our magnificent beaches and coastline. Our $700,000 investment will enable Wyong Shire Council to complete necessary repair work on this $3.25 million project. The Mayor of Wyong Shire Council, Councillor Doug Eaton, recently congratulated the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, Jamie Briggs, for visiting Norah Head in April to sign the funding agreement. The fact that the minister was able to observe firsthand the difference this money will make to the community, who will now be able to enjoy a safe, accessible and functioning boat ramp, was invaluable.


Investment in infrastructure is key to addressing our future growth needs. It is anticipated that the Central Coast will grow by an additional 100,000 people by 2031, requiring 45,000 new local jobs. The growth area largely falls within the Dobell electorate; therefore, as a government, it is crucial that we work with state and local governments to effectively meet growth in infrastructure demands. Our growth plan for the Central Coast addresses this need by providing funding for the Ridgeway and Jensen roads—two roads under pressure as a result of our rapid population growth. Our $2.75 million investment will enhance the safety and quality of these roads, affording motorists safer access to the growth suburbs of Lisarow and Ourimbah via the Ridgeway, and the lakeside suburbs of Tuggerawong and Wyongah via Jensen Road. Investment in Central Coast roads is part of this government's commitment to provide necessary infrastructure to support commuter access to employment.


In addition to these local road projects, the government will deliver substantial investment to ease the commute for the 30,000-plus Central Coast residents who travel daily outside the region for employment. After years of talk, this government will build the NorthConnex, delivering the missing link between the M1 and M2. NorthConnex is a significant project for the Central Coast and for the people of Dobell. But this is about more than reducing travel times; this is also importantly about investment and jobs. The budget commits $195.8 million for the M1 Productivity Package. This funding includes the widening of the Ml to six lanes between the Tuggerah and Doyalson interchanges. Together with the NorthConnex, these measures will deliver shorter and safer travelling options for Central Coast commuters, meaning they spend less time in traffic and more time with their families.


While this infrastructure assists those who commute for work, we must remain steadfast in our determination to strengthen the local economy and provide a broader range of job opportunities in Dobell. For too long our region has suffered an unemployment rate well above the national average. Coupled with low school completion rates and under-representation in tertiary education, it is crucial that we encourage and assist people to earn or learn. This government is delivering on its commitment of $2.7 million towards the development of skills and training facilities in Dobell to enable our young people to learn in order to earn. Changes to welfare payment eligibility will strengthen the incentive for young unemployed people to work or pursue education and training opportunities.


Mature job seekers will also benefit from this government's initiatives to encourage workforce participation. Restart aims at assisting those over 50 who have been receiving income support for over six months. Employers will receive a $10,000 incentive to employ a person aged 50 and over for up to two years. Potentially, this could benefit approximately 1,100 people in Dobell. Together with the government's Job Commitment Bonus and Relocation Assistance to Take Up a Job, job seekers should feel secure in pursuing employment opportunities. The best form of welfare is work and, where people are able to work, they should be encouraged and supported to do so. The higher education initiatives outlined in the budget support alternative pathways to higher education by providing direct financial support to all students studying diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degree courses. For young people in Dobell this means, for the first time, those studying a diploma through TAFE will receive the same financial assistance from the government as a student studying a bachelor degree at university.


The government will establish a Commonwealth scholarship scheme to assist disadvantaged students by providing support and encouragement to undertake tertiary education. Undergraduate students will no longer have to pay fees to access FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. 


I acknowledge that not all young people choose to study at university and those who chose to undertake an apprenticeship should equally be supported. The introduction of Trade Support Loans for apprentices will encourage more young people to undertake a trade and importantly complete their trade. Apprentices will have access to $20,000 over the entire period of their training. Apprentices who successfully complete their training will be rewarded with a 20 per cent reduction from the total of their loan. Like the HELP loans for tertiary students, the loans will be repayable once apprentices are earning a sustainable income. This is real support for apprentices which will provide a stronger incentive for young Australians to complete their apprenticeship and for many the opportunity to start their own business. 


Small business is the backbone of the Dobell economy—collectively, they are our largest employer—therefore support for small business is essential in enhancing local job opportunities. The budget contains a series of measures that will assist small business operators, including the establishment of the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman. The Ombudsman will act as a one-stop-shop for small business when dealing with the federal government, thus reducing compliance costs and red tape. This enables small businesses to get on with the job of attending to their customers, to improve their productivity and to grow, generating greater job opportunities.


The former Labor government failed Australian small business, inter alia imposing the world's biggest carbon tax, which drove up costs and destroyed jobs. We are providing real assistance to small business. We are abolishing the carbon tax and reducing the burden of unnecessary red tape and we demonstrated this through parliament's first-ever regulation repeal day, which we held on 26 March this year. Small businesses will play a key part in the Abbott government's Economic Action Strategy to build a strong and prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia. 


Above all else, this budget delivers on our election commitments. In Dobell this includes $3.3 million to clean up and improve the water quality of Tuggerah Lakes. The Tuggerah Lakes Estuary Management Plan will receive this funding over three years to improve the water quality by expanding the upgrade of stormwater treatment zones, including the removal of sediment and other organic matter and the upgrading of gross pollutant traps. The main aim of this plan is to provide direction for the ongoing management of Tuggerah Lakes and its catchment in order to ensure the sustainability of its ecological systems. The people of Dobell care about Tuggerah Lakes, and this funding is an important part of this government's commitment to a healthier environment.


Dobell will directly benefit from the Green Army program. In Dobell, the program will improve our local environment by providing funds for dune restoration and rehabilitation at The Entrance North, along with practical environmental works to clean up the Tuggerah Lakes foreshore and enhance the Central Coast wetlands. In addition to providing support for our natural environment, the Green Army program supports Dobell job seekers through providing opportunities for young people to gain training and experience in areas of environmental and heritage conservation, and to explore careers in conservation management. The Green Army will be Australia's largest-ever team supporting environmental action across the country, building to 15,000 young Australians by 2018.


We have the plan to fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster. While this has been a tough budget, it is also a visionary budget which delivers on the commitments we took to the Australian people at the last election. First and foremost, we said that we would get the budget back on track, invest in job-creating infrastructure, and support local small business and job creation. We are doing what we said we would do, and we are doing it because it is absolutely necessary for the long-term welfare of our great nation. This budget lays the foundation for a stronger economy by reducing projected debt by almost $300 billion over the next decade. Our economic action strategy will build a strong, prosperous economy and a safe, secure Australia. This budget delivers for Australia and it delivers for Dobell. This budget is building a strong foundation for all Australians to get ahead. As I stated in my maiden speech, a stronger economy is the key to almost everything we wish for as a community. I am pleased to be delivering on our election commitments to build a more prosperous Dobell and a more prosperous Australia.

Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin) (19:16):  In thinking about what I would say about this budget in the debate on the appropriation bills, I did not really know where to start because it is just all so bad. But I want to stand up for the people of my electorate of Franklin and for the people of Tasmania. This budget is a terrible list of broken promises and wrong priorities. In fact, it is built on broken promises. It is asking the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our communities to do the heavy lifting.


The budget emergency touted by those opposite is not real. They doubled the deficit in their first six months in office. And it is about wrong priorities, because they have also got their rolled-gold Paid Parental Leave scheme—which, admittedly, they have watered down a bit, but which is still there and is $50,000 for wealthy people in our community.


Those opposite have manufactured their own budget crisis with this budget because people out there are frightened and scared. They are not spending money and they are not going to the GP. They are not doing these things because they have been frightened by this budget and the harsh cuts that will affect pensioners, families, young people, students—all of them on low incomes; many of them vulnerable and disadvantaged. Australia has a AAA credit rating, which we heard the Prime Minister actually admit to today, and we have low levels of debt compared to other countries. So there is no real budget emergency, other than the one that those opposite have confected.


The priorities are so wrong in this budget. The Prime Minister promised before the election that there would be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no changes to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS. He also promised no new taxes and no tax increases. And of course all of those promises have been broken.


Particularly frightening for my home state of Tasmania are the cuts to health and education. In the budget papers, page 7 of the glossy says that $80 billion in savings will be made. They will be taken away from Australian schools and hospitals over the next 10 years. We have even heard that this money is not real. But it is actually in their budget papers, so I am assuming it was real if they are making it a saving. Tasmania's share of this is more than $1.6 billion. The Tasmanian state budget is around $5 billion per annum. I am not quite sure where the Prime Minister expects Tasmania to find $1.6 billion or more over the next decade. There is $676 million in cuts to education—the Gonski reforms that were going to happen in years 5 and 6. That is money ripped out of every school in Tasmania and many schools in regional parts of my state. There is over $1 billion in health being cut. This will impact on hospitals in Tasmania.


Some of these cuts of course start on 1 July this year and will indeed hurt many Tasmanians. In fact, this budget is so bad for Tasmania that it has actually made many of the front pages. It has even made editorials. When you have newspapers in Tasmania saying things like, 'The states face the ugly political prospect of savagely cutting health and education services or looking for more revenue, and the most obvious revenue stream for states and territories is to increase the GST or to broaden its base,' you know the states are in trouble. Of course, we heard there would be no changes to the GST from the Prime Minister as well. Tasmania would be severely impacted if there were a change to the distribution of the GST to the tune of more than $700 million each and every year.


The Premier of Tasmania, Will Hodgman, has said in response that if there are increased demands placed on the state of Tasmania there will need to be commensurate support services provided. Of course there will not be any. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister have simply said: 'That's it. The states can deal with it on their own as they should.' But where exactly will the money come from? Are the states and territories going to have to make cuts to health and education right across the country? They have not only broken a promise that there would be no cuts to health and education; they have also left a real funding dilemma for the state. It is in fact a massive problem right across the country. 


Then of course there is the GP tax—$7 to visit a GP, $7 to get a blood test, $7 if you need an X-ray, $7 to vaccinate each of your kids each time they need it—and prescriptions for medicines are going up as well. This is after we heard, that there would be no cuts to health, no cuts to education and no changes to pensions. They have broken their promise to Tasmanians and they have broken their promise to Australians. To say one thing before an election and do a different thing afterwards—of course we have heard it before—should not occur and now Tasmanians are paying the price for this. The budget will be way too much pain for Tasmanians and very little gain for the state. In fact, there is nothing new in this budget for Tasmania. All I can find is a $100 million cut to the funding of the Midland Highway. Under Labor there was $500 million over 10 years and now there is only $400 million. That is a cut of $100 million in infrastructure for Tasmania. There are no new announcements just reannouncements, as we saw from the Prime Minister when he was in the state last week. 


Of course, we did hear something else from the Prime Minister when he was in Tasmania last week. We heard him say, 'It would not be the worst outcome in the world if young unemployed Tasmanians have to leave the state.' Also we heard from him, 'I don't think we should be necessarily heartbroken just because some people choose to leave.' So in Tasmania it has become learn, earn or leave. Apparently, it is okay that there are no jobs for Tasmanians in Tasmania and we really should not be heartbroken about it. Interestingly, the federal Department of Employment predicts there will be 11,400 new jobs in Tasmania by 2017. In that same period, 21,000 students are expected to leave school. That is 21,000 students for 11,400 new jobs. So the jobs are not there. We need places in training for them. Are there places available in TAFE? Are there places available in the university in regional Tasmania? We have heard the Minister for Employment, who happens to be a Tasmanian, Senator Abetz, say,' Of course, they could go and pick fruit.' Actually what he said was:


There are many examples of jobs in my home state of Tasmania, for example fruit picking …


Interestingly, the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association do not really like that idea and they are going to take it up with the minister. They have said:


If the Government wants us to be babysitters and to run these social welfare programs we will have a conversation about what's involved in that, but it won't be as a part of a commercial offering.


The youth unemployment rate in Tasmania is 17 per cent. Up on the north-west coast it is 22 per cent. There are no jobs for these people, and to expect them to live on fresh air for six months every year that they do not have a job is cruel and heartless and will increase poverty and homelessness in Tasmania. To have the Prime Minister simply come down and say, 'Well, you can leave,' is not okay. There is supposed to be a $100 million jobs and growth program with 31 projects for 2½ thousand jobs that was announced by Labor and that was supposed to be committed by the new government. Only five of those projects have received the funding. There was $100 million over four years. Where is the rest of the money? Where are the plans to create jobs in Tasmania? There are none. Instead, we are attacking the most vulnerable. We are taking $100 million out of infrastructure and we are not going to deliver the jobs and growth plan, but that is all right: Tasmanians can just leave.


People are not going to leave Tasmania. People all over the country are not going to leave regional Australia and move to the cities. Labor support the regions, even if the current government does not. We would invest in the regions and we did under the regional development fund. We have seen that program gutted as well. We have seen the indexation of financial assistance grants taken from councils. That is a $1 billion cut over four years. Councils will have to absorb these cuts. They had not budgeted for the loss of indexation over the four years. This will be an ongoing cut to councils in regional Australia. My home state of Tasmania will be hit hard by these.


There is so much in this budget that needs addressing that, as I said at the beginning, it is hard to know where to start. The coalition kept saying there would be no changes to pensions. We heard those opposite say today in the parliament: 'Pensions will continue to go up under us. There's nothing to worry about.' Why do the budget papers include a saving for pensions in the out years? There is a saving because they are changing the indexation, which is a cut in real terms to pensions.


We also see that from 1 July this year the concessions that are paid to the states to deliver concessions on water, electricity, local council rates and transport are being cut. In my home state of Tasmania that is $9 million from 1 July that the state government does not have and has not said whether it will make up. Councils are about to send out rates notices. Do they include a concession for ratepayers when those notices go out in two weeks? Who would know? 'It is not my problem,' says the Treasurer; 'It is up to the states.' It is a problem for the pensioners. He is the Treasurer of this country and he should be taking notice, because these pensioners are frightened. They have been frightened by this budget and by the actions of this government.


It is not fair. I think that is the overwhelming theme of this budget: it is not fair. It is not fair because the wealthy are doing less of the lifting and those people on low incomes are doing the majority of the lifting. When you have somebody on $200,000 a year actually committing $400 in an extra debt tax and you have people on $60,000 with two kids giving up over $6,000 a year in family payments, you know something is not right. We heard today that families will be affected by changes to family tax benefit. In fact, 1.5 million children will be affected by this government's changes.


It does not stop there. The changes to the pension include having to work until you are 70. I wonder whether they ever actually asked people what they thought of this—whether they asked the tradesmen, the nurses or the brickies labourers. I do not think they would have, because they cannot work until they are 70. They cannot work until they are 70 because they are in heavy labour jobs. Perhaps they should just retrain and do something else. I am sure that will be the answer that comes from those opposite.


We have also seen savage cuts to the public sector in this budget. Tasmania does have a number of public sector jobs, particularly in the science areas of CSIRO and the Australian Antarctic Division. CSIRO are particularly concerned about cuts that might be coming their way. Of course there is the ABC, who have the one per cent efficiency dividend coming off them. That will mean cuts in regional Australia and in my home state of Tasmania.


So all we in Tasmania hear with this budget is cuts, cuts, cuts, cuts, cuts, cuts, cuts, cuts. There is nothing new. There is no extra funding. In fact, if it gets bad enough you can do what the Prime Minister says: 'Just leave.' That is the only solution we have had from the new government. There is absolutely nothing in this budget for Tasmania.


Labor will be opposing these measures. We will be opposing changes to pensions, we will be opposing changes to family payments and, of course, we will be opposing the fuel excise increase as well. That was another nice surprise for people which they knew nothing about! No new taxes before the election; an increase in tax after the election. Who would have thought that that would occur?   I want to read an email from one of my constituents. I will not name her but you will get the general gist from the email about how Tasmanians are feeling about this budget:


I am writing you to encourage you to stand up against the threats to the most vulnerable members of our community by the plans outlined in the Abbott government's budget. Why are we buying new jet fighters and giving tax breaks to big business while making it more and more difficult for the poorest to have the basic necessities of life? Cutting bulk-billing for children and pensioners is not just a $7 impost. I am a pensioner.


Recently I went to the doctor, who sent me for blood tests and then called me back because of some abnormalities, which led to new blood tests and an ultrasound. Then I had to go back to the doctor to get the results. These changes would have meant an extra $42 for me within a two-week period. I would not have spent that $42 on a beer, a cigarette or a cigar. It probably would have gone towards my power bill or on food. I am however more concerned that children will not receive the medical care they need because some parents must decide between food or medical treatment. 


In Tasmania there is great youth unemployment, but maybe some do not want to work. However, most cannot find work. With no Newstart until they reach 30 we are going to see a rise in the number of youth homelessness. Surely the lucky country can do better than this.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2014-05-26,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (19:32):  It is a pleasure to rise to speak in support of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and the cognate bills. It is a shame that all the the member for Franklin said is that all Tasmanians are hearing is cuts, cuts, cuts. Perhaps that is because she is the one out there spreading that message, rather than some of the good things in the budget for Tasmania, particularly the nearly $40 million for the Hobart International Airport runway extension and also the numerous tourism projects that will be happening throughout Tasmania. I note that they criticised some of the tourism projects—for instance, the one to extend the tours of the Cadbury factory.



An honourable member interjecting— 




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  You certainly did criticise it. You claimed it was a rort and all the rest of it. The reality is that that was a tourism benefit for Tasmania which the Labor Party were opposed to, so shame on them. I want to speak on the appropriation bills. These bills are really the mop and bucket that we have with this budget. They are the broom, the scrubbing brush and the dustpan which are required to clean up the mess left behind by six years of Labor waste and incompetence. 


There is a well-established political cycle in this country. A Labor government comes in and takes a perfectly good economy and a perfectly good budget and goes about trashing them. That is what we saw throughout the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd debacle—waste and incompetence. They threw money around, hoping that if they gave away enough free money they would have more people voting for them. Eventually people saw through that. They saw that Labor was breaking the bank, trashing the house and booking up the bills to a credit that would be paid by the next generation. The Australian people took out some of the trash on election night. It was a pretty full wheelie bin that night. We all know that even after the wheelie bin was emptied by the electoral garbage truck the house would still be left in somewhat of a mess. That is why the Liberal-National government made sombre commitments to the Australian people before the election. 


We promised we would stop the boats, a problem created by Labor and the Greens when they were in office. We have fixed it already with our policies, which Labor and the Greens said would not work. We are stopping the boats, even though the rudderless Leader of the Opposition cannot bring himself to admit it.


We promised we would axe the carbon tax. That is an easy promise we thought we would be able to achieve by now. You would think we would be able to achieve it, particularly given that the Labor Party—and we have members of the Labor Party opposite smiling and laughing about it—promised themselves in their flyers that they were going to scrap the carbon tax. In fact, they said it had been scrapped. But now, no, they are voting against scrapping it. They are clinging onto the carbon tax in the Senate like a one-year-old clinging onto its gran's security blanket.


Most importantly, we promised that we would clean up Labor's mess by getting the budget back under control. That is what we are doing, even though Labor is doing its best to hamper the clean-up crew. We promised that we were going to build the roads and infrastructure of the 21st century. Of all of the measures outlined in this budget, the unprecedented investment in infrastructure is what will help my electorate the most. Of all the feedback that I have ever received as a member of parliament, through emails, phone calls, letters and talking to people face-to-face in the street and at different events, by far the biggest issue and the most raised issue is the Bruce Highway, followed closely by the local roads in general.


Queensland is a very large state. Our road network is critical—particularly, the new 1,700 kilometres of the Bruce Highway, which is a major arterial road connecting all the coastal regions. The Bruce Highway package, the $6.7 billion that we are going to invest—and a lot of that funding is contained over the forward estimates as outlined in the budget—includes projects like the Mackay ring road. The Mackay ring road is an interesting infrastructure piece because Labor talked about it a lot when they were in power but they never did anything about it. They actually tried to tell the public that it was in the budget, but when we went through the figures it was not. In fact, that was exposed in Senate estimates at the end of the Gillard road, when Senator Ian Macdonald actually questioned the head of Regional Development Australia about it and what was there for it. We found out that nothing was actually allocated to the Mackay ring road. This budget includes the dollars—over half a billion dollars—and it includes the dates. In 2016 we are going to start construction. That is what people want to know.


We have $20 million from the federal government and another $5 million from the states to do the detailed planning and preservation. There is actually $11 million in the budget for 2014-15. We have $428 million that is going to go to that $540 million total, with some state funds, to do the construction of stage 1 of the Mackay ring road. That is going to be vitally important for the Mackay area. It is going to be the largest piece of infrastructure we have ever seen in that area, and it is going to lift the local economy in leaps and bounds. We have had a downturn in the mining sector—thank you very much, Labor Party, partly because of your carbon tax and your mining tax—but now, on the back of that downturn, we are able to offer this big infrastructure project and get all the construction jobs flowing from that.


In the northern part of my electorate, the Sandy Gully Bridge is another important piece of infrastructure. It floods every time we get a bit of rain in the Bowen area. There is a $46 million federal contribution to that $57 million project that is going to get some state funds as well. This year there is $2.5 million allocated for the detailed design work. Yellow Gin Creek Bridge, also in the north of my electorate, will get a $36 million federal contribution, along with some state funds. There will be up to $45 million to upgrade that bridge and flood-proof it. Again, for the detailed design work there is $4 million in this federal budget for 2014-15. The rest of it for both those projects, Sandy Gully and Yellow Gin, will be in the outlying years of the forward estimates.


Also completing work in this coming financial year is the Vantassel Street to Cluden duplication in the Townsville end of my electorate, and a minor upgrade to the Burdekin Bridge, which is definitely something that is needed. There will be continuing funds for fixing up black spots and increasing overtaking lanes. That is vitally important but there are also other local projects that the Liberal-National government is delivering on in my electorate. 


We are shifting the junior soccer grounds and assisting in that exercise with a $1 million contribution. It is a million dollars that the Labor Party promised back in 2010—2010, and yet it never, ever happened. Guess what? We are now delivering it, because the program that they were going to fund it out of had wound up, so we have gone and found additional money in the budget to keep that project alive.


The Mackay gymnastics centre will be given an upgrade, creating a new extension to their existing premises with $750,000. We will have mobile CCTV units given to the local council with assistance of $200,000. We are going to light up some of the inner city car parks with an extra $200,000 to make them safer for late-night shoppers and workers who leave at night. There are Green Army projects that are doing excellent work with the Eco Barge in the Whitsundays and also work on the Don River.


North Queensland is the economic engine room of this country. We make a major contribution to the economy through agriculture, tourism and mining. Regional centres like Mackay service the mining projects of Central Queensland, in particular the Bowen Basin. Skills training and education are an important part of providing that service through trades learning and through universities.


While the 400-kilometre long electorate of Dawson does not technically include a university at this stage, we do have many full-time students as residents. CQ University's Mackay campus is only a few hundred metres from the southern boundary of the electorate and James Cook University is only a few hundred metres from our northern boundary. And students in North Queensland, who are probably less exposed to the lies, deceit and the exaggeration in the southern media, are scratching their heads when they see Bill Shorten's protégés in the far left movement bashing police and squealing into a microphone about how no-one will be able to afford to go to university anymore.


The students who actually took the time to educate themselves, instead of just printing out the union lines, listening to the Leader of the Opposition and then taking to the streets to chant the misinformation to the TV cameras, know that anyone can afford to go to university. No-one has to pay their portion of university expenses up-front—although they do have to pay their compulsory union fees up-front, which the other side brought in. No-one has to start repaying their student loans until they start earning more than $50,000 a year. That is pretty fair. That has got to be fair in anyone's books. 


When you take into consideration the higher incomes earned by university graduates—around 75 per cent more than a nongraduate—paying half the course fees is a pretty darn good investment. You do not have to put your money down until the investment starts paying dividends. The 'I want everything for free' sense of entitlement from the students we see revolting in the streets must come across as even more revolting to the hairdressers, the waitresses, the mechanics, and all the other non-university graduates who have to contribute through their tax dollars to university education. The protesting students are not happy about only half of their university fees being paid by those lower paid workers.


This budget does not stop anyone from going to university. In fact, it encourages more people to take on further education through subbachelor training by giving them access to the same system of student loans as university students. Further, education providers will be required to divert 20 per cent of any additional revenue they receive from deregulation for student places to Commonwealth scholarships and other support for disadvantaged students. Those Commonwealth scholarships will create major new support for regional students to go to university. I am proud to say students in North Queensland have not been led astray by the hype and hysteria propagated by the opposition leader. All the bleating in the world will not turn Labor's scurrilous lies about education, health and pensioners into reality.


Hysteria about cuts from those opposite could easily have been hosed down by reading the budget. Even comparing it with Labor's last budget and forward estimates this budget, represented by these bills, actually increases school funding to record highs. This Liberal-National budget invests record recurrent funding of $64½ billion in government and non-government schools over the next four years—that is, $1.2 billion more than the previous government would have spent over the forward estimates—to ensure schools in all states and territories receive extra funding.


It is a similar story in health, where the campaign of deceit from the Labor Party runs contrary to the facts. The facts, which show that funding to states for hospital services increases by more than nine per cent, or $1.3 billion a year, next year; in 2015-16, by more than nine per cent, or $1.4 billion, a year; in 2016-17, by more than nine per cent, or $1½ billion, a year. In 2017-18, it goes up by more than six per cent, or $1.1 billion, a year. In Queensland, hospital funding will increase each year, from $3.1 billion in 2014-15 to $3.8 billion in 2017-18.


Even more scurrilous are the lies that have been told about pension cuts. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame for the way they have scared pensioners with their alarmist campaign of deceit. The pension will continue to rise twice a year every year. Poor old pensioners are being wheeled out and taken for a ride by all those opposite. The way that Labor and the Greens kick the pensioners around like a political football says a lot about how they treat the generation that created the wealth that Labor squandered. None of those opposite—not one—has mentioned the fact that they are blocking the repeal of the carbon tax, which is the most unnecessary impost on every household and family, including pensioners. This campaign of deceit and lies about the budget has scared pensioners, it has incited violence amongst the students and it has distracted people from what is really important: getting this budget back under control while we still actually can. These bills and this budget delivers on that most important promise we made to the Australian people. I commend the bills to the House.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (19:47):  Cuts, cuts, cuts! That is all you see when you read through these appropriation bills. In fact, I tallied the number of cuts in these appropriation bills that we are debating tonight, Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2014-15 and cognate bills—126 government programs receive funding cuts from this government. It is a series of broken election commitments. The Prime Minister said a couple of days before the election that there would be, no cuts to health or education, no changes to pensions, no cuts to the ABC or SBS. Here we have it in the first budget of the Abbott government, completely breaking that promise that was made to the Australian public—a complete breach of faith and trust with the Australian community on one of the most important objects of government, the delivery of a budget. These bills absolutely decimate and destroy all those commitments, a complete breach of trust with the Australian people. More importantly, they make life tougher, harder for families, pensioners, single mums and students living in my community.


Labor will not vote against these bills. Unlike those opposite, we respect the conventions of the Australian Constitution, in particular, that oppositions should not block supply. It is not the fault of public servants throughout Australia, who have mortgages and families to feed, that this lousy budget is presented to the parliament. They should not suffer by an opposition blocking supply and refusing payments for the ordinary appropriations of government, most notably ensuring that public servants get paid. But we will point out the gross inequalities, the deficiencies and the unfairness of this budget when it comes to pensioners, families, students and single mums. 


In education, $60 million in federal grants will be cut by these appropriation bills, part of $236 million worth of cuts overall—programs such as the Digital Education Revolution, providing laptops and computer access for kids in schools; and More Support for Students with Disabilities, a program that very importantly provides that much-needed in-classroom assistance for kids with disabilities. Two weeks ago, I met a young family in my community that had two kids with disabilities—two kids in primary school with disabilities. They were in a very small public school that has a 60 per cent Indigenous population. I just keep thinking to myself—and it keeps me up at night to think—what that poor family is going to have to go through because of this government's cuts to the education portfolio.


We all know, and we have all seen the studies, about how important early intervention is in ensuring that students with disabilities get the best start on an education and the best start at the ability to participate in society. To cut funding for a particular program, the More Support for Students with Disabilities program, which is a $100 million cut, and not replace it with the Gonski loadings for kids with disabilities is almost criminal. It is an absolute disgrace. 


David Gonski made a very important point in a very important speech last week criticising the government for the approach that they are taking in the funding of schools. The point that David Gonski made was that it is not just the level of funding in school education that is important. What is also very important is where the funding is going and what the funding is targeted towards. In Australia at the moment we are seeing students fall further and further behind in international comparisons. Why? It is not because of the students at the high end. Our very talented students in wealthy schools are doing very well. They are above, or at, international comparisons. It is our kids in low-socioeconomic areas, our kids from an Indigenous background, our kids with disabilities and, our kids from non-English speaking backgrounds who are the ones struggling in schools. They are the ones who the Gonski funding would specifically target. That is the point that David Gonski was making. It is not simply about the overall amount of the pie but it is about where the pie is allocated. This budget is a dud because it does not fund the Gonski reforms in the fifth and sixth years.


A $38.4 million cut for an online diagnostic tool program, to help teachers assess the learning and assessment outcomes under NAPLAN, has been cut under these bills. It comes on top of the Schoolkids Bonus being cut, a with vital support for families on family tax benefits to ensure that their kids can meet the costs of going to school. These are unfair outcomes in education. They are unfair and will leave our kids, particularly some in my community, much worse off. 


The Prime Minister made a commitment a couple days before the election that there would be no cuts to the ABC or SBS budgets. But that is exactly what we have seen in these appropriation bills—$43.5 million cut from the ABC and from SBS and the abolition of the Australia Network, representing a $196.8 million cut. People in my electorate are particularly angry about this cut to funding for the ABC and SBS, particularly because of the commitment that was given by the Prime Minister a couple of days before the election. Close to 9,000 constituents in my community have signed a petition opposing the cuts to the ABC and SBS because they believe in a well-funded, independent public broadcaster as the hallmark of a modern, healthy democracy. The ABC Managing Director, Mark Scott, has pointed out this week that, unfortunately, because of these funding cuts there will be redundancies and there will be closure of services. That will affect rural and regional communities. That will mean that the broadcasting services that are delivered to rural and regional Australia will be cut by this government's callous approach to communications. 


In the arts budget, $87.1 million has been cut from arts programs—in particular, funding for the Australia Council and Screen Australia. Some may not believe that arts funding is important, but I do. Arts is the carrier of Australian culture. Arts is the way we tell the story about who we are—about our history, our heritage, our place in the world and the sort of society we live in. To callously cut this particular element of the budget through these appropriation bills is not in our nation's interest.


In the environment, $483 million is being cut from Landcare initiatives, putting the future of Landcare at risk. What will this mean for Landcare? What will it mean for people who have been employed under that wonderful program that has achieved so much in conservation for communities such as mine—particularly along the coastline—over many, many years? We do not know, because that funding cut has put the lives and welfare of many of those employees at risk.


These appropriation bills foreshadow $7.6 billion in cuts over the forward estimates to Australia's overseas development aid commitment. I recently travelled around the Pacific with the foreign minister, Julie Bishop. She gave a clear commitment to the leaders of the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Nauru: no cuts to the overseas development aid budget for our friends in the Pacific. Then MYEFO was released, and then the budget was released, and what do we find? That is exactly what has occurred under this government. They have cut funding for overseas development aid. That funds programs such as the Vanuatu Women's Centre that I visited with the foreign minister, which is providing important support for women living with domestic violence, important support for education and important support for immunisation and health outcomes in those communities. 


We do not know where those cuts are going to come from. We do not know which particular programs are going to be cut. I call on the foreign minister and the Prime Minister to at least have the decency—at least have the gumption—to outline to our friends in the Pacific which of their programs that are importantly funded and supported by Australian aid are going to be cut. Are any of those programs going to be health programs? Are they going to be education programs? Are they going to be programs such as Pacific Women Shaping Pacific Development? The leaders of those nations and our friends in the Pacific deserve to know.


This government has taken a disgraceful approach to international climate change initiatives. It is one of the key and most pressing issues facing the world economy, and what is Australia's view? We will pull out of all international climate change initiatives. What we are saying, particularly to the Asia-Pacific community, where we are a leading economy and a leading society, is that climate change does not matter; that climate change initiatives and clean energy initiatives do not matter. What sort of a message does that send to our friends in the Pacific and Asia about this nation's approach to climate change?


In the Pacific, climate change is not a looming threat; it is a present danger, and we are seeing already the effects on communities, particularly in low-lying states such as Kiribati, Vanuatu, Nauru and the Marshall Islands. We are seeing people being displaced because of climate change already, and what is Australia's approach? We have pulled out of those international initiatives. Recently, the foreign minister of the Marshall Islands, Tony deBrum, said this about Australia and its government:


Australia has always been our friend, but the change in their government last year has resulted in problems.


That is extraordinary. That is the view of the foreign minister of the Marshall Islands. In diplomacy, words such as those are very powerful. 


That is the view that our friends in the Pacific have of the Australian nation—that we have let them down and ignored them when it comes to the crises they are facing relating to climate change. We are ignoring that their crops are drying up, their infrastructure is being inundated, they are not receiving any rain anymore in particular regions and, importantly, they cannot feed themselves. We are sending the wrong message, and it is enshrined in these bills that we are taking the wrong approach when it comes to overseas development aid. We will continue to hold the government to account for the disgraceful approach that they have taken on overseas development aid.


All of these measures have been put in the budget on the basis of a confected budget emergency. The government is out there campaigning and scaring the public into believing that there is a budget crisis in Australia. I pose this question to the government: how on earth does a nation achieve three AAA credit ratings from independent ratings agencies when you have a budget crisis? We are one of only 10 nations throughout the world that have a AAA credit rating and I do not see any of those other nine nations having newspaper headlines or discussions within their national parliaments about a budget crisis. There simply is not one in Australia, and for this government to go out and claim that there is, to add $68 billion worth of expenditure to government programs and then claim that there is a budget emergency and have to cut to the bone on programs such as Medicare, health and education, and pensions, is an absolute disgrace. It is the wrong approach to be taking with the Australian public.


Labor have said that we understand the need to ensure that the budget is sustainable. When in government we took an approach that ensured that our budget was sustainable and met the Charter of Budget Honesty commitments to run surpluses over the medium to long term. We did that by ensuring that we had sufficient revenue coming into the budget, and that meant that there was a minerals resource rent tax, that meant there was a price on carbon, that meant that we means-tested the private health insurance rebate and that meant that we were proposing to tax people with whopping superannuation accounts of more than $2 million earning more than $100,000 a year. It also meant that we were not undertaking outrageous expenditure like an overrated paid parental leave scheme, like direct action, which has got no funding source at all in the provision of subsidies to polluting companies, and like some of the changes to veterans' pensions being introduced by this government. Labor had a plan for sustainability in our budget and it did not involve the cuts that are being undertaken in these appropriation bills. It is a disgrace that this government has put them forward in this budget.


Debate adjourned.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2014-05-26,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (20:02):  I would like to continue on a theme that I raised earlier today. In doing so I will put on the record once again that Shortland electorate is one of the oldest electorates in this country. We have many senior Australians and the proportion of residents in the Shortland electorate over the age of 65 is 26 per cent, which is well above the national average. I acknowledge the fantastic work that all the seniors that I represent in this parliament do throughout the community, and for that matter all the seniors throughout Australia. Quite often senior Australians are stereotyped as not having anything that they can contribute to our society, as being a burden, as being a drain on our economy, as being people who are not worthy of the support of us in this place.


Over the last month many seniors have contacted my office and shared their thoughts with me on this very topic. Prior to the budget my office was inundated with people ringing and saying how worried they were about the reports they had been reading in the papers, how worried they were that they were going to end up a lot worse off than they were at the moment and how basically they are living week to week and that they feel they have made enormous contributions to our country. They are not asking for much. They are just asking that they be able to maintain the standard of living they have now. They are asking that the government recognises that they have made their contribution. They have worked hard. They have paid their taxes. Now, all they ask is to be able to see a doctor when they are sick and be able to afford to see the doctor and to be able to purchase any medication that they need and be able to afford to purchase that medication. And they are asking for a little bit of recognition of the fact that they still contribute enormously to our society and community.


Within Shortland electorate, seniors and pensioners are the backbone of our volunteer network. Every organisation is run, to a large extent, by volunteers that are 65-plus. That is probably a little bit higher than the average, but at the outset I said Shortland electorate is a very old electorate. I was contacted this afternoon by a volunteer, Vicky. She and her husband, Stewart, do between them 60 hours a week volunteering at the marine rescue at Tuggerah Lakes. She pointed out to me that the economic contribution of seniors to our electorate is enormous.


I had a quick search on the net and looked at a University of Adelaide study which pointed out that volunteering had been a strong tradition within Australia, and I think most members of parliament recognise the contribution that volunteers make to our communities. But I am sure that when they do that they find out that most of those people are over 65 years of age. The study pointed out that the true extent of the monetary value of volunteering in Australia is in excess of $200 billion a year and that some 6.4 million people volunteer their time in Australia. Those were 2012 figures, and it is double the number that volunteered back in 1995. I think this House must acknowledge that senior Australians—that pensioners—continue to contribute to our country and to our economy, saving us over $200 billion a year. All they ask in return for that is the knowledge that their pension is sustainable, that they will be able to visit a doctor and that their standard of living is maintained. They want to know that if they are sick they will get access to health care. They do not want to have to pay a co-payment. They want to know that they have got secure housing. Unfortunately, this budget went to the very core of their security.


John, a constituent I represent, asked me to ask the Treasurer how his family would cope. I will not do that, but I will put on the record what he had to say. He is a 69-year-old retiree, and his wife will turn 60 this year. They were blessed with a child in their later years, and this child will soon be six years old. He has calculated their family income as $14,400 allocated pension and $16,518 part pension. That is including the pension supplement. This is a guy that was a tradesman who has worked all his life and has made enormous contributions to our country. He gets family tax benefit part A of $4,615 and he gets $2,657 family tax benefit part B. His total income is $38,191, and, yes, he volunteers. He also provides child care for his grandchildren whilst his older children go to work. So he is really helping the economy move along. He goes on to say that he owns his own home and he is very fortunate, but he needs to manage his finances with care and that his concerns have been heightened because of the budget, whilst acknowledging that there are many people worse off in society than he and his wife. This is the thing that always hits me: people contact me, point out their circumstances and say, 'It's really hard for me but there are people who are worse off than me.'


He says that he would like to know how the Treasurer expects them to cope when their income will be reduced by the loss of the family tax payment and other associated benefits. He says that his income will be reduced to $34,302. This is a man who is very frugal, does not go out, does not smoke and does not go drinking at the club. This is a man who looks after his son, provides support to his grandchildren and volunteers in the community. He feels that he is going to be hit really hard by this budget and he does not know how he is going to cope. This is a real person who has to struggle with these financial issues each and every day.


Here is a real-life example. I have had a pensioner ring me saying that she does not know how she is going to go on and feels she will have to kill herself because she will not cope. It really, really worries me. My staff have been talking with pensioners and seniors over the last month trying to reassure them and trying to make them feel better about the situation. My message to the government and my message to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister is: this budget is really hurting. It has created enormous pressure for pensioners and seniors in our community. They have made enormous contributions to Australia in the past and all they ask for now is financial security.

Mr Truss:
  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:


On 6 February 2014, I announced the Australian Government's commitment of $140.6 million to construct grade separations at Tonkin Highway's intersections with Benara Road, Morley Road and Collier Road.  


The project, known as NorthLink WA – Tonkin Grade Separations, is part of the Australian Government's Infrastructure Investment Programme of works for Western Australia, which is currently being settled.
