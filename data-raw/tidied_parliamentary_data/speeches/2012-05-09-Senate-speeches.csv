Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (09:33):  I rise today to speak on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Disability Support Pension Participation Reforms) Bill 2012. The key purpose of this bill is to implement the disability support pension reform which was announced in the budget last year. Principally, these measures relate to workforce participation for DSP recipients. This reform is covered in schedules 1 and 2. This bill also amends the part of the Social Security Act which relates to the overseas travel of people with a severe and permanent disability. This aspect is covered in schedule 3. Schedule 4 makes some minor amendments to the act.


The first measure in this bill alters the work rule for DSP recipients. It will allow some recipients to work up to 30 hours a week without losing eligibility for the DSP. In the past they were only able to work up to 15 hours a week before losing their eligibility. This schedule aims to encourage recipients of the DSP to return to work where possible by allowing recipients to engage in work for longer hours without penalising them. This bill seeks to provide an incentive for DSP recipients to maintain a presence in the workforce. 


These incentives are important because there are many people who are currently on the DSP who could achieve a much better quality of life through participation in the workforce. I think we would all agree that the DSP should not be seen as a destination payment. People should not be parked on the DSP; they should be encouraged and assisted to participate in the economy. We know that economic participation in the workforce is an important social engagement for people as well. At some stage in their life, an individual may qualify for the DSP. That does not mean that they should be parked there for the rest of their life. Schedule 1 recognises this important truth and seeks to encourage DSP recipients to find suitable employment without the threat of losing their pension.


Schedule 2 seeks to implement participation requirements for some DSP recipients. These recipients will be required to attend an interview upon request and will be provided with assistance to develop an individualised plan aimed at enhancing their employment opportunities. The requirements apply to DSP recipients aged under 35 or those who have been assessed with a work capacity of eight hours or more per week. These requirements are not intended to force DSP recipients to jump through hoops. Rather, they are designed to provide people with the tools to re-engage with the workforce and enjoy the benefits employment brings. It is not good enough for government to overlook any citizen's capacity to work. It is important to work with individuals to help them find the best way to participate. In addition to the benefits to each individual who is able to obtain employment as a result of these measures, you would expect the economy as a whole to benefit through the boost to productivity.


The third schedule of the bill relates to the portability of the DSP. It will allow those people with a severe and permanent disability who have no further realistic prospect of work to permanently receive their DSP while overseas. Currently, these people are subject to the 13-week rule under which their DSP cannot be taken overseas for a period of over 13 weeks. This schedule will mean DSP recipients who fall into this category will no longer lose their payment if they spend more than 13 weeks overseas.


Schedule 4 contains some minor amendments. Firstly, it amends references within the act to the data on average weekly earnings collected by the ABS, because the publication of this data has changed in frequency. This schedule also removes incorrect or redundant references to the pension age in the act. Finally, this schedule aligns some provisions of the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 with corresponding provisions in the Social Security Act for the purposes of household assistance under the Clean Energy (Household Assistance Amendment) Act 2011. 


It is important for governments of all persuasions to do what they can to help DSP recipients obtain a better quality of life through employment participation. I am happy to indicate that the opposition does not take issue with this legislation.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2012-05-09,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (09:39):  While the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Disability Support Pension Participation Reforms) Bill 2012 contains schedules the Greens support, we are greatly concerned about schedule 2, the participation requirements for disability support pension. As I said, there are some positive measures contained in the bill, such as partially rectifying the limitations on the portability of DSP and allowing people on DSP to work up to 30 hours before having their payments suspended or cancelled. However, the bill is still a product of the Welfare to Work reforms. This participate or perish mentality is evident in the new requirement for those with partial capacity to work to complete a participation interview and develop a participation plan.


The impact of this bill must also be measured in light of other changes that have been implemented to the disability support pension, particularly over the last two budget cycles. We have to remember that the government has changed the process for applying for DSP, and you have to now have 18 months worth of failure to find employment with a disability before you are allowed to apply for the disability support pension. I have articulated in this place on many occasions the deep concern we have about the impact this is having on people with a disability and the fact that they have to struggle on Newstart for 18 months while they try to find work with either a very substantial disability or a partial capacity to work. Then of course we have the changes to the impairment tables around eligibility for DSP. So we are actually already seeing significant impact on people living with a disability trying to find work and struggling to survive. We have to look at those changes in that light.


The present legislation and reforms further squeeze people living with a disability without properly addressing the barriers to their employment. We believe this continues the punitive mentality that was admittedly begun by the coalition but has been adopted with gusto by this government. Subsequent bills that we will be talking about today further implement the welfare to work mentality. I would like to focus my comments particularly on schedule 2, which is the participation requirements for people with DSP. As I have said, we support the other elements of this bill, particularly increasing the ability to work to 30 hours before people start losing their disability support pension. Under this bill, to continue to qualify for DSP a person who has a capacity to work and is under the age of 35 will have to fulfil additional participation requirements. These requirements will include attending a participation interview at Centrelink and developing a participation plan for people that Centrelink decides need one—but then what is the point of the government thinking they need a participation plan if it is not going to compel them to meet the requirements of the plan?


I have very deep concerns about this approach because I think it is a demonising approach. The assumption that people under the age of 35 with a disability do not want to work is an erroneous assumption. I have spent a lot of time talking to people with a disability and to people living on income support, and this fallacy that seems to be promoted by both of the major parties in this place that people on income support do not want to work and choose to live on the paltry income support that they receive is a flawed approach and is a very deliberate strategy by both the coalition and the government to demonise people on income support. This legislation applies the same belief because they believe that people with a disability do not want to work. I certainly have not met such people with a disability; in fact, I have been lobbied very heavily by people with a disability who ask whether we can please do more to help them find work and put policies in place to support them in the workplace. First and foremost, these measures do not address barriers to employment for those living with a disability. People with a disability or a partial disability have many barriers to work. The cost of this measure is $92.8 million, and we believe that should be better dedicated to measures that actually assist people on DSP gain employment or training, with a better focus for DES providers and case managers, improved transport and better support on the job. Instead, the money is being spent on this expensive administration exercise. 


I have been to several disability conferences over the last week and a half, and some figures have been quoted at those conferences. Australia is ranked 21 out of 29 OECD countries in employment rates for people with a disability and is ranked 27 out of 29 OECD countries for risk of poverty for people living with a disability. Furthermore, if this particular provision is not implemented with the utmost sensitivity, this measure could lead to serious negative outcomes for many people living with a disability. Of particular concern are those with poor or limited communication skills, those with mild intellectual disabilities or episodic or mental health issues and those whose capacity is rated just in excess of eight hours per week—remembering that this applies to people with a capacity to work eight hours a week, which is essentially one day a week. These people mostly have not been subject to participation requirements and may experience difficulty explaining, particularly to Centrelink, the circumstances and barriers they face to employment. 


I spent a lot of time in this last break talking to people living on income support—those living on DSP and particularly those living on Newstart. The constant refrain I heard was that there are problems interacting with Centrelink. I will be talking more about that later in the day. We believe care and a level of flexibility is necessary when considering imposing requirements on people living with a disability even if they are attending a Centrelink office, because this group of people is already vulnerable. Special care is especially necessary for people with a disability under the care of a guardianship or related tribunal or a nominee or carer. While exemptions can be granted under certain circumstances, this will not be effective if people are unable to explain why they have a right to a benefit because of poor communication or lack of understanding. As we know, Australia's social security system is extremely complex. I take the trouble to read many documents produced by Centrelink, and sometimes I have trouble understanding what they mean and I misinterpret what they mean. Other people who have poorer literacy or numeracy skills, or have not had excessive interaction with the bureaucracy, will find this even more difficult to understand. 


We are also deeply concerned about areas in the assessment process. As was articulated during the Senate inquiry into both the impairment tables and the government's changes to the process for applying for DSP, there is a significant variation in assessment processes and I do not believe those pro­cesses have been adequately reformed. This continues to foster complex participation requirements on vulnerable people. This is not new, I acknowledge, but it is continuing the process started by the Howard govern­ment and adopted with gusto by the present government. In the past 18 months, as I said, we have seen changes to the participation requirements for the majority of the DSP applicants and they are going through a process now where they have to keep applying for jobs and keep bailing, and then perhaps they will be considered for DSP. While we very strongly support approaches to help people with a disability into employment, fostering a process which leads to a sense of hopelessness does not help people when they are trying to gain employment. One of the key things which comes out of long-term engagement with Newstart is a sense of helplessness. So the longer people are living in poverty is yet another barrier to employment. We already know there are significant barriers to employment for people with a disability. Even where people with a disability find employment, keeping that employment in the face of significant barriers created by their disability is extremely concerning as well. 


During the Senate inquiry we heard of simple things which people who do not have a disability do not even question—for example, access to transport. If you are living in a regional area or in the outskirts of a metropolitan area, transport issues are even more magnified. We also know that for people living on a limited income finding accommodation in cities is very hard. They are driven to the outskirts or to regional areas because that is where they find affordable accommodation. As I said, there are multiple barriers to people with disabilities gaining employment in the first place. We should be addressing those barriers rather than saying to people under 35, 'We actually don't think you want a job, so this is going to force you into looking for work.' We do not believe that is an appropriate approach. We should be coming from an incentive basis rather than a punitive basis. 


We believe this approach further disempowers people and fuels negative stereotypes. This is the reason that so-called 'tough love' rhetoric is counterproductive. It reinforces stereotypes and builds up myths about the unemployed—which invariably could strengthen the negative attitudes employers could take to people with a disability. A survey of employers undertaken by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations in 2008 found widespread reluctance to consider employing long-term unemployed people, people with disability and mature age people. Subsequent work has also reinforced those findings. We believe this is a significant barrier, which the government should use more measures to address rather than making it worse. I would like to quote from a submission to the disability employ­ment services inquiry:


The task of finding meaningful work for people with disability requires creative, flexible and innovative approaches.  Increasingly it is being recognised that best practice in disability service provision requires a person-centred flexible approach that enables service providers to respond to the diversity of individuals and their needs.


Yet an international review of employment programs said of Australia, 'Despite a change in the employment service system in Australia, the compliance centred regime persists and this works against the development of a personalised approach to assisting jobseekers.' We need information and support, on-the-job training and mentoring for both the employee and the employer. Such measures will have a much more positive impact on outcomes than forcing people to go for interviews and making a plan. We acknowledge that the government has injected some resources into addressing issues around employment for people with disabilities. No further money for employment was announced in the budget yesterday. This is not enough. The money being spent here on essentially administrative processes would be better spent overcoming the barriers people living with a disability face when gaining employment. Forcing people to participate in this manner assumes that people do not want to find work and is a more demeaning approach, rather than the encouragement of an incentive based approach. 


We do not support schedule 2 of this bill. We do support the other schedules of this bill. We urge the government to reconsider the approach they take to people living with disability because we do not believe they are supporting people enough to find employment. Our position in the OECD countries is an embarrassment and we need to do more. The government seems to recognise that we need to do more but they are not taking the right approach which is an incentive based and supportive approach rather than a demonising approach. I know the government are going to say that that is not what this is about, but they obviously have not had the same phone calls and emails I have received from people expressing extreme concern, feeling they are being picked on, feeling they are being demeaned and that the government are implying that people are not trying to find work when in fact the reverse is true. Certainly communications I have received in my office and face-to-face communications with people with a disability reveal that they want to find work but need more support to find work. The current provisions are not sufficient to help people find work and stay in work. We do not believe this is an appropriate use of money. We do not support schedule 2. However, as I said, we support the other schedules.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (09:53):  I thank senators for their contributions to this debate. The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Disability Support Pension Participation Reforms) Bill 2012 introduces two key reforms to the disability support pension announced in 2011-12 federal budget as part of the Building Australia's Future Workforce package of measures. These significant reforms will, for the first time, introduce new participation requirements for certain disability support pensioners and allow disability support pensioners to work more hours without having their payment suspended or cancelled. This improved support for Australians with disability will help them into work wherever possible while making sure there is an essential safety net for those who are unable to support themselves fully through work. Many people with disability are great contributors to the workforce and many more want to work. This bill contains three disability support pension measures, all effective from 1 July 2012. In the first measure, more generous rules will allow all disability support pensioners to work up to 30 hours a week without having their payment suspended or cancelled. These people will be able to receive a part pension subject to usual means testing arrangements. Since the previous government's introduction of the Welfare to Work changes on 11 May 2005, newly granted disability support pensioners can work up to only 15 hours a week before their payment is suspended or cancelled. The 15-hour rule can make it difficult for disability support pensioners to find work limited to less than 15 hours a week. People will now be able to take up work or increase their hours, if they are able to do so, and the change will help address the low workforce participation rate of people with disability. The second measure will introduce new participation requirements to encourage disability support pensioners with some capacity to work to engage with the workforce. Disability support pension recipients under the age of 35, with a work capacity of at least eight hours a week—that is an important proviso—will be required to attend regular participation interviews with Centrelink to develop participation plans tailored to their individual circumstances. Senator Siewert, I think that is an important phrase: 'tailored to their individual circum­stances', helping build their capacity. Participation plans could involve working with employment services to improve job readiness, searching for employment, or undertaking training, volunteering or rehabilitation. There will also be the oppor­tunity to connect disability support pension recipients to other services and supports that they may need to overcome barriers to participation, such as drug and alcohol rehabilitation, mental health services and other community services. Exceptions to these participation requirements will apply to disability support recipients who have a work capacity of zero to seven hours or who work in an Australian disability enterprise or under the supported wage system or who are manifestly eligible for disability support pension.


The third measure introduces new, more generous rules to allow people receiving disability support pension who have permanent disability and no future work capacity to travel overseas for more than 13 weeks while retaining access to their pension, excluding certain add-on payments such as rent assistance. Existing portability rules will continue to apply to disability support pension recipients who may have some ability to work. Other working-age payments will not be affected by these changes to portability arrangements.


In closing can I say that the government refutes absolutely the assertion that Labor is of the view that people with disability do not want to work. Of course we know that people with disability are desperate; they really want support to get into the workforce. We are of the view that these measures will certainly assist people with disability into employment. This measure is designed explicitly to support people with disability into employment and to retain employment when they have it. It is designed to remove the barriers.


We should recognise that this measure should not be viewed in isolation. This measure came as a package of measures in the previous budget and includes a range of other measures to support people with disability into employment. You will recall that our government have uncapped the disability employment services. We have increased funding into disability employment services to the total value of $3.4 billion over four years. We have introduced a range of wage subsidies that people with disability have taken up in good numbers. The National Disability Strategy is designed to encourage people with disability into all aspects of community life, including employment.


Last week I was very pleased to be at the Every Australian Counts rally in Brisbane. There were 2½ thousand people there, joining thousands and thousands of people right around the country. I observed that the loudest applause occurred when any of the speakers spoke about the fact that an NDIS could potentially assist people into employment. That is what people with disability want. They want to get into jobs, they want to retain those jobs and they want to be supported to do it, and this measure will assist in that process.

Of particular concern are those with poor or limited communication skills, those with mild intellectual disabilities or episodic or mental health issues and those whose capacity is rated just in excess of eight hours per week—remembering that this applies to people with a capacity to work eight hours a week, which is essentially one day a week.

In the past 18 months, as I said, we have seen changes to the participation requirements for the majority of the DSP applicants and they are going through a process now where they have to keep applying for jobs and keep bailing, and then perhaps they will be considered for DSP. While we very strongly support approaches to help people with a disability into employment, fostering a process which leads to a sense of hopelessness does not help people when they are trying to gain employment. One of the key things which comes out of long-term engagement with Newstart is a sense of helplessness. So the longer people are living in poverty is yet another barrier to employment. We already know there are significant barriers to employment for people with a disability. Even where people with a disability find employment, keeping that employment in the face of significant barriers created by their disability is extremely concerning as well. 


During the Senate inquiry we heard of simple things which people who do not have a disability do not even question—for example, access to transport. If you are living in a regional area or in the outskirts of a metropolitan area, transport issues are even more magnified. We also know that for people living on a limited income finding accommodation in cities is very hard. They are driven to the outskirts or to regional areas because that is where they find affordable accommodation.

We do not believe that is an appropriate approach. We should be coming from an incentive basis rather than a punitive basis. 


We believe this approach further disempowers people and fuels negative stereotypes. This is the reason that so-called 'tough love' rhetoric is counterproductive. It reinforces stereotypes and builds up myths about the unemployed—which invariably could strengthen the negative attitudes employers could take to people with a disability. A survey of employers undertaken by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations in 2008 found widespread reluctance to consider employing long-term unemployed people, people with disability and mature age people. Subsequent work has also reinforced those findings. We believe this is a significant barrier, which the government should use more measures to address rather than making it worse. I would like to quote from a submission to the disability employ­ment services inquiry:


The task of finding meaningful work for people with disability requires creative, flexible and innovative approaches.  Increasingly it is being recognised that best practice in disability service provision requires a person-centred flexible approach that enables service providers to respond to the diversity of individuals and their needs.


Yet an international review of employment programs said of Australia, 'Despite a change in the employment service system in Australia, the compliance centred regime persists and this works against the development of a personalised approach to assisting jobseekers.' We need information and support, on-the-job training and mentoring for both the employee and the employer. Such measures will have a much more positive impact on outcomes than forcing people to go for interviews and making a plan. We acknowledge that the government has injected some resources into addressing issues around employment for people with disabilities. No further money for employment was announced in the budget yesterday. This is not enough. The money being spent here on essentially administrative processes would be better spent overcoming the barriers people living with a disability face when gaining employment. Forcing people to participate in this manner assumes that people do not want to find work and is a more demeaning approach, rather than the encouragement of an incentive based approach. 


We do not support schedule 2 of this bill. We do support the other schedules of this bill. We urge the government to reconsider the approach they take to people living with disability because we do not believe they are supporting people enough to find employment. Our position in the OECD countries is an embarrassment and we need to do more. The government seems to recognise that we need to do more but they are not taking the right approach which is an incentive based and supportive approach rather than a demonising approach. I know the government are going to say that that is not what this is about, but they obviously have not had the same phone calls and emails I have received from people expressing extreme concern, feeling they are being picked on, feeling they are being demeaned and that the government are implying that people are not trying to find work when in fact the reverse is true. Certainly communications I have received in my office and face-to-face communications with people with a disability reveal that they want to find work but need more support to find work. The current provisions are not sufficient to help people find work and stay in work. We do not believe this is an appropriate use of money. We do not support schedule 2. However, as I said, we support the other schedules.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (09:53):  I thank senators for their contributions to this debate. The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Disability Support Pension Participation Reforms) Bill 2012 introduces two key reforms to the disability support pension announced in 2011-12 federal budget as part of the Building Australia's Future Workforce package of measures. These significant reforms will, for the first time, introduce new participation requirements for certain disability support pensioners and allow disability support pensioners to work more hours without having their payment suspended or cancelled. This improved support for Australians with disability will help them into work wherever possible while making sure there is an essential safety net for those who are unable to support themselves fully through work. Many people with disability are great contributors to the workforce and many more want to work. This bill contains three disability support pension measures, all effective from 1 July 2012. In the first measure, more generous rules will allow all disability support pensioners to work up to 30 hours a week without having their payment suspended or cancelled. These people will be able to receive a part pension subject to usual means testing arrangements. Since the previous government's introduction of the Welfare to Work changes on 11 May 2005, newly granted disability support pensioners can work up to only 15 hours a week before their payment is suspended or cancelled. The 15-hour rule can make it difficult for disability support pensioners to find work limited to less than 15 hours a week. People will now be able to take up work or increase their hours, if they are able to do so, and the change will help address the low workforce participation rate of people with disability. The second measure will introduce new participation requirements to encourage disability support pensioners with some capacity to work to engage with the workforce. Disability support pension recipients under the age of 35, with a work capacity of at least eight hours a week—that is an important proviso—will be required to attend regular participation interviews with Centrelink to develop participation plans tailored to their individual circumstances. Senator Siewert, I think that is an important phrase: 'tailored to their individual circum­stances', helping build their capacity. Participation plans could involve working with employment services to improve job readiness, searching for employment, or undertaking training, volunteering or rehabilitation. There will also be the oppor­tunity to connect disability support pension recipients to other services and supports that they may need to overcome barriers to participation, such as drug and alcohol rehabilitation, mental health services and other community services. Exceptions to these participation requirements will apply to disability support recipients who have a work capacity of zero to seven hours or who work in an Australian disability enterprise or under the supported wage system or who are manifestly eligible for disability support pension.


The third measure introduces new, more generous rules to allow people receiving disability support pension who have permanent disability and no future work capacity to travel overseas for more than 13 weeks while retaining access to their pension, excluding certain add-on payments such as rent assistance. Existing portability rules will continue to apply to disability support pension recipients who may have some ability to work. Other working-age payments will not be affected by these changes to portability arrangements.


In closing can I say that the government refutes absolutely the assertion that Labor is of the view that people with disability do not want to work. Of course we know that people with disability are desperate; they really want support to get into the workforce. We are of the view that these measures will certainly assist people with disability into employment. This measure is designed explicitly to support people with disability into employment and to retain employment when they have it. It is designed to remove the barriers.


We should recognise that this measure should not be viewed in isolation. This measure came as a package of measures in the previous budget and includes a range of other measures to support people with disability into employment. You will recall that our government have uncapped the disability employment services. We have increased funding into disability employment services to the total value of $3.4 billion over four years. We have introduced a range of wage subsidies that people with disability have taken up in good numbers. The National Disability Strategy is designed to encourage people with disability into all aspects of community life, including employment.


Last week I was very pleased to be at the Every Australian Counts rally in Brisbane. There were 2½ thousand people there, joining thousands and thousands of people right around the country. I observed that the loudest applause occurred when any of the speakers spoke about the fact that an NDIS could potentially assist people into employment. That is what people with disability want. They want to get into jobs, they want to retain those jobs and they want to be supported to do it, and this measure will assist in that process.


Question agreed to.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (10:01):  I rise to speak on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support and Other Measures) Bill 2012. This bill seeks to implement a range of income support measures as set out by the government's Building Australia's Future Workforce package. The government is seeking to change the age requirements for social security payments and to propose an increase in the maximum age for youth allowance non-student recipients from 21 to 22 years of age. This would seek to cover any person who is at least 22 years old and who is not a full-time student or a new apprentice or someone who is undertaking less than 12 months study following a period on the Newstart allowance. Schedule 1 of the bill proposes that the same minimum age qualification of 22 years of age be reflected for Newstart allowance recipients.


Schedule 1 of this bill will also seek to amend and increase (1) the age of qualification for youth disability supplement; (2) minimum qualification age for sickness allowance; and (3) the minimum qualifi­cation age for the long-term income support rate. All three are currently set at 21 years of age and will increase to 22 years of age, with transitional arrangements provided for. This is set to apply from 1 July.


In the opposition's view, this package is rather piecemeal, with not much courage and not much innovation. This bill proposes changes to the eligibility rules for 'grand­fathered' parenting payment recipients—parents who have been continuously receiv­ing parenting payments since before 1 July 2006. Currently, grandfathered recipients are eligible for the parenting payment until their youngest child turns 16 years of age, provided that that child was in their care before 1 July 2011. From 1 July 2011 onwards, any new child born to or cared for by a grandfathered recipient will not extend that recipient's grandfathered status.


As such, this bill seeks to change the age of eligibility so that, from 1 January 2013, grandfathered recipients will no longer be eligible for parenting payment when the youngest eligible child in their care before 1 July 2011 turns 16 years if the child was born before 1 January 2000; 13 years if the child was born between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2000; or 12 years if the child was born on or after 1 January 2001—except now, instead of supporting their own legislation, the government appear to be backsliding. They are slashing the age of eligibility for parenting payments from 12 to eight years of age, claiming a $700 million saving—another fiddle on the road to surplus, I guess.


The opposition do not view this bill as serious social security reform. The bill does contain a number of other minor measures. But with those few observations, and despite them, I indicate that the opposition will not be opposing the bill.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2012-05-09,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:05):  This is yet another attempt by the government to extend the Howard government's Welfare to Work policy. As Senator Fifield pointed out, it has already been superseded by the government's new approach, which completely removes the grandfathering provisions of the Welfare to Work bills of 2005. If adopted, the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support and Other Measures) Bill 2012 will cease income support payments for many, many single parents who will be affected over the next four years. Of course, we are not just talking about single parents or sole parents in this instance. We are also talking about their children—the very children that the government talks about needing to support, which is why we need to be rushing through the changes to the education receipts process. The government says it knows that parents will be spending money on their children. The government says it knows that, if parents receive money, they will be spending it on their children. Why doesn't the same apply to this? Why does the government think that it is acceptable to cut the income support payments for single parents, who by their very definition have children? Any cut the government makes to single parents' payments affects their children. In other words, money they do not get will not be spent on supporting the welfare of their children. This proposal cuts income support to single parents and their children. It puts them on a lower level of payment. It is money directly out of their pockets and their children's support. So all this rhetoric about supporting the families of Australia and low-income Australians is nonsense when the approach the government is taking is demonising single parents.


There is a double whammy because they are not only cutting payments to single parents—which, as I have said, the next budget makes even worse. When you go onto Newstart you have different cut-offs for part-time work. So, rather than being able to earn $174 a fortnight without your support payments being affected, as you can currently, you can only earn around $62 a fortnight. Again, who do the government think this is hurting? It is hurting the most vulnerable Australians. I repeat that: it is hurting the most vulnerable Australians in this country, who are already living in poverty. This further entrenches them in poverty. We know that living in poverty is yet another barrier to employment.


We are debating this bill and subsequently down the line we are going to be debating another bill that takes the cut-off from 12 to eight years of age—in effect, ending the grandfathered provisions. I also feel it is my duty to remind the chamber that the government when in opposition in 2005 voted against the Welfare to Work measures. And, when the legislation came before the community affairs committee, ALP senators in fact joined with the Democrats and the Greens in saying: 'We are concerned about the transitional arrangements and the grandfathering provisions for the parenting payment given the significant difference between the payment levels for people who get to stay on the parenting payment (single) and those who end up on the Newstart allowance as primary carers. The legislation does not adequately provide appropriate safeguards to ensure that people currently on parenting payments will retain the payment until their youngest child turns 16.' That was said by the government when in opposition in 2005. They now seem to think that Welfare to Work is an acceptable way to treat the most vulnerable Australians. Of course, they were right: the provisions did not adequately protect those who were grandfathered, because they are presently doing the very thing that they were talking about, which is cutting those protections for those most vulnerable Australians.


The delivery measures cut approximately $58 per week from sole parents, and on top of that you have the impact on people's capacity to work part time. We know that single parents who are trying to survive on income support are amongst the poorest in this country. If you are living on parenting payment (single) you are basically living in poverty, as are your children. This bill will deepen that impoverishment without improving job prospects.


This is about budget savings. Let's be really clear about this. This is about budget savings. It is not about genuinely helping single parents into work. It is purely about the bottom line so that the government can claim it has a surplus. It is a budget cutback—there are no two ways about it.


One-third of single parents who are receiving the parenting payment are already in some form of paid work. This bill provides no changes to activity requirements or support. These parents have already been required to seek part-time employment since 2007. The only change being made is to the amount of money they will receive for their families. As I said, it is a significant cut in their income support. This does not provide an incentive to work because, as I said, one-third of single parents are already working part time. Moving people onto Newstart is going to make that work valued even less because the amount of money they can earn working part time is significantly less on Newstart—a double whammy.


Plunging families deeper into poverty will not help them find paid work. Research indicates that poverty is, in fact, a barrier to getting work. There is the stress around affordable housing. There was a report that came out just two weeks ago that highlighted the problems around finding affordable accommodation. Food related stress also impinges on people's capacity to find work, as does an inability to find the extra income for transport, clothing and all those other things that you need to survive.


We also have to bear in mind that single parents are desperately trying to find that balance between part-time work and supporting their families. Just because a child has turned 12 does not mean that it does not need the support and care of its parent. It is absolutely essential that we have flexibility in the system to enable people to work but also look after their families. Somebody rang me about this just the other day. She is a single parent and she lives in a regional area where the majority of work is shift work. There are no childcare services in that regional area that cover shift work. She asked me, 'How can I find work in this town when all the work is shift work based but child care starts at seven and finishes at five?' Where is she going to find child care? It is all very well for the government to say, 'We are going to provide cheaper child care.' If the child care is nonexistent it does not matter if it is cheaper. So what does that mother do when she is transferred onto Newstart and is then trying to exist on less money and cannot find part-time work because there is no part-time work that will also allow her to look after her children? If she left her kids alone to go and do shift work overnight she would be accused of neglecting her kids and then she would have DCP onto her. So much for a caring government that is really about trying to support people into employment!


As you can tell, the Greens do not support this particular amendment and, just for the record, we do not support the one that is also coming down at us, which we will be debating later, to drop the age of eligibility from 12 to eight. That will completely get rid of the grandfathered provisions and will plunge all single parents into this poverty trap. This bill also brings in cuts of $42 per week for young unemployed people aged 21 years. Unemployed 21-year-old people will lose access to Newstart allowance from July this year and will remain on the lower youth allowance for the year after their 21st birthday. Youth allowance for a single young person living away from home is $201 per week; the Newstart allowance is $243, nearly $244, per week. That is essentially a cut of $42 for young people living away from home and independent of their parents. As I have articulated and will articulate at some length later in this place, $244 is a minuscule amount of money to try to survive on—or not survive on—but it is getting cut by 20 per cent for those people who will be on youth allowance. You cannot live on that. Young people, again, will be living in poverty. As I have said and will continue to say at length in this place, poverty is yet another barrier to employment. How can you expect young people and students to live on less than people trying to survive on Newstart? At that time of their life young people are building the foundations of the rest of their life. We are condemning young people to poverty. That is an insecure foundation for young people to start their lives and build from. Where a young person is living at home a youth allowance rate of $133 per week applies. Where that person has not demonstrated financial independence from their parents a parental income test will apply to this group. This will of course further reduce payments for these young people.


The main argument in favour of this measure is that the gap between lower student payments—youth allowance and Austudy payments—and higher unemploy­ment allowance discourages participation in education. This is the same flawed argument that says that keeping Newstart payments low will magically encourage people into work. It is so low now and is not working; what makes the government think that dropping it even further will make it work? It is ridiculous for the government to think that a difference of $42 per week will act as a disincentive, particularly considering that even at the higher rate people are living in poverty. Living in poverty is not an incentive to work. People on Newstart do not have an incentive to work. Newstart is already below the poverty line of $130 per week. We know that setting it even lower will not magically encourage people to find work, because there are many barriers to people being able to find work. When is the government going to get this? It simply is not understanding the mechanics around barriers to employment. By putting young people further into poverty you entrench the poverty cycle.


This bill would cut the maximum rate of income support to unemployed 21-year-olds, regardless of their parents' income. We believe that, overall, we need to be increas­ing our income support payments, not cutting them. In fact, we need to overhaul the income support system in this country. It is complex, inadequate and confusing for people, does not meet current employment trends in this country, does not meet the insecure work situation/patterns that a large number of people are engaged in, does not meet the people's part-time work requirements and does not meet the temporary nature of the employment process that we have now. Of course, there is also the glaring problem that you are considered to be employed if you work even one hour a week. This antiquated income support system is trying to address all of those things. Each time the government cuts payments it makes it more difficult for people to survive and, I believe, makes it more difficult for them to be able to cope with this complex system.


Last year, even Ian Harper, the economist hand-picked by John Howard to set the minimum wage case, declared that Newstart is too low. He warned that giving people so little to survive on is causing desperation and depression. Many people now have said this. This bill puts single parents onto the lower Newstart rates and cuts youth allowance to below even the Newstart rate. It is not a good way to start people off in their working life. It drops people further into depression and hopelessness. Single parents' being dropped onto Newstart drops their income support, drops their ability to get ahead when they are working part time and develops a strong sense of hopelessness. What sort of scene is that setting for the children who are growing up in that environment, who are growing up in that intense poverty? We know that it affects their early childhood development. We know that we will have a better economy if we address those early childhood indicators.


Just last week I was at a seminar that was held to celebrate the work of the great Professor Fiona Stanley. Dr Clyde Hertzman, a Canadian who has been doing work with Professor Stanley, spoke to us about vulnerability indicators and the EDI, or early childhood development indicators. He was working with Stanford University. He pointed out that for every one per cent drop in vulnerability indicators for early development there is in fact a one per cent increase in GDP. Yet here is the government deliberately bringing in strategies to drop single parents further into poverty, and single parents are ipso facto looking after children. Instead of investing in those families the government is taking money away from them, making it harder for them to address the necessities of life and leading to their further vulnerability. A wise government would be investing in those families, not dropping them into poverty, making it harder and subjecting those children to poverty and increased vulnerability. A wise government would be very specifically investing in those families, investing in our most vulnerable Australians. Ignoring the social compact that we in this country should be developing with our vulnerable families and looking just at the economic development process of this country, would it not be a wise investment for us to address every degree of vulnerability if for no other reason than to increase GDP by one per cent? We would get that return. However, this government has chosen the coalition's approach of Welfare to Work that penalises and demonises people. In fact it has gone even further than the Howard government ever dared to go by dropping single parents and their families into poverty. That is what this bill does: it drops our most vulnerable young people into poverty by reducing their access, by making it even harder for them to struggle to survive.


Kids want an education; they want to gain access to an education. Keeping people in poverty and dropping their income support and thinking that they will automatically find work or education is a fallacy and an absolute nonsense. We do not support the provisions in this bill. We think it is the wrong approach and the government needs to reconsider how it allocates its money and how it makes its budget savings and at whose expense. This measure is at the expense of the most vulnerable Australians: our single parents and their children, the people we should be making our number one priority. We oppose these amendments.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:24):  At the outset I thank those who have made contributions to this second reading debate. The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support and Other Measures) Bill 2012 will give effect to important income support reforms contained in the Building Australia's Future Workforce package, which was announced in the 2011-12 budget. These amendments will provide a greater incentive for young Australians to engage in education, training and employment, and will encourage parents to re-engage in the workforce. It will help to restore equity to the eligibility conditions for parenting payment.


The Australian government's Building Australia's Future Workforce package is designed to ensure that all Australians are able to share in the benefits afforded by our growing economy. This package represents a significant investment in education, skills and employment opportunities that strengthen the future of Australia's workforce. Reforms to income support payments for young people are an integral part of the government's reform agenda and will provide greater incentives and support for young unemployed people to engage in education, training and employment. Education and employment are the key economic and social inclusion points. The government is committed to providing the right balance of support, assistance and incentives to ensure that people are able to take advantage of all of the opportunities that our economy has to offer.


This bill will amend the Social Security Act 1991 to delay access to Newstart allowance. From 1 July 2012, 21-year-olds may receive the same rate of youth allowance whether they are unemployed, in training or a student. This overcomes the financial disincentive for unemployed young people to undertake full-time study. There is a correlation between the completion of year 12, or an equivalent qualification, and the engagement of young people in education, employment or training.


The bill will also extend to 21-year-olds the 'earn or learn' participation requirements for youth allowance recipients who have not achieved year 12, or an equivalent qualification. A more generous income-free area and working credit will reward young people who take up part-time work as a stepping stone to full-time employment. From 1 July 2012, young job seekers receiving youth allowance will be able to earn more and still retain their payment. The income-free area will be increased from $62 to $143 a fortnight and their working credit limit will be increased from $1,000 to $3,500.


To ensure that all young people aged between 16 and 21 years of age under similar circumstances are in receipt of the same rate of income support payment, the bill also amends a number of payments, supplements and payment calculators to align the ages at which a person will cease to be qualified for youth disability supplement, sickness allowance and the long-term income support payment rate for students.


The government believes that these changes are the best way to support young Australians to participate in work or study, and to make the most of the opportunities that are available. It creates conditions that maximise the number of young people who remain in or return to education and training to get the qualifications and skills they need to be competitive in the labour market. It is important that this bill proceed now to ensure that young people are encouraged to learn or earn and are rewarded for part-time work as a stepping stone to more employment.


The Building Australia's Future Workforce package provides greater incentives for parents with school aged children to re-engage in the workforce. The government recognises that the best income support a parent can have is a job. That is why it is important that we provide the best possible incentives for parents to re-engage in work and present a positive working role model for their children. Through this bill the government is phasing out the arrange­ments for parenting payment recipients who have been on payment since before 1 July 2006. When their youngest child turns 12 years old, those recipients will now be treated the same as other parents, regardless of when they first claimed parenting payment. This measure creates better incentives for parenting payment recipients, including single parents, to return to the workforce by transitioning eligible parents onto Newstart allowance earlier. This recognises that most parents' capacity to undertake work or other activities increases as their children get older and that in the current income support system Newstart allowance is the most appropriate payment for working aged people to seek, find and maintain employment.


From 1 July 2013, a more generous income test will be introduced for all single, principal-care parents on Newstart allowance. This will enable those parents who may qualify for Newstart allowance to around $400 more per fortnight before losing their eligibility for payment. It will allow them to see greater benefits from their participation. As well as these increased benefits, it is important to note that parents caring for a child with a disability will continue to have access to a range of additional support, including carer allowance and participation exemptions for when their caring responsibilities need to come first.


The bill will also simplify the compliance framework and ensure that job seekers are not penalised because a weekend happens to fall before they have the opportunity to re-engage with an employment services provider. Announced as part of the Building Australia's Future Workforce package, daily penalty amounts for job seekers failing to attend an interview with an employment service provider will be aligned with the penalties for failing to attend an activity or a job interview, which is one-tenth of a person's fortnightly rate of participation payment. The department will monitor the implementation of this measure and its impact on the youth allowance recipients.


Finally, this bill will amend the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to provide the appropriation to fund the 12-month extension of the Student Education Trusts measure, as part of the extension of the Cape York Welfare reform trials, which was announced, as some in the chamber may recall, by the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigen­ous Affairs, in 2011. Parents and care givers in remote Indigenous communities in Far North Queensland will continue to be supported in saving for the cost of their children's education, which is a key element in achieving the Closing the Gap targets in Indigenous education.


I thank the senators for their contribution to the second reading debate. I commend the bill to the Senate.

The opposition do not view this bill as serious social security reform. The bill does contain a number of other minor measures. But with those few observations, and despite them, I indicate that the opposition will not be opposing the bill.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2012-05-09,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:05):  This is yet another attempt by the government to extend the Howard government's Welfare to Work policy. As Senator Fifield pointed out, it has already been superseded by the government's new approach, which completely removes the grandfathering provisions of the Welfare to Work bills of 2005. If adopted, the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support and Other Measures) Bill 2012 will cease income support payments for many, many single parents who will be affected over the next four years. Of course, we are not just talking about single parents or sole parents in this instance. We are also talking about their children—the very children that the government talks about needing to support, which is why we need to be rushing through the changes to the education receipts process. The government says it knows that parents will be spending money on their children. The government says it knows that, if parents receive money, they will be spending it on their children. Why doesn't the same apply to this? Why does the government think that it is acceptable to cut the income support payments for single parents, who by their very definition have children? Any cut the government makes to single parents' payments affects their children. In other words, money they do not get will not be spent on supporting the welfare of their children. This proposal cuts income support to single parents and their children. It puts them on a lower level of payment. It is money directly out of their pockets and their children's support. So all this rhetoric about supporting the families of Australia and low-income Australians is nonsense when the approach the government is taking is demonising single parents.


There is a double whammy because they are not only cutting payments to single parents—which, as I have said, the next budget makes even worse. When you go onto Newstart you have different cut-offs for part-time work. So, rather than being able to earn $174 a fortnight without your support payments being affected, as you can currently, you can only earn around $62 a fortnight. Again, who do the government think this is hurting? It is hurting the most vulnerable Australians. I repeat that: it is hurting the most vulnerable Australians in this country, who are already living in poverty. This further entrenches them in poverty. We know that living in poverty is yet another barrier to employment.


We are debating this bill and subsequently down the line we are going to be debating another bill that takes the cut-off from 12 to eight years of age—in effect, ending the grandfathered provisions. I also feel it is my duty to remind the chamber that the government when in opposition in 2005 voted against the Welfare to Work measures. And, when the legislation came before the community affairs committee, ALP senators in fact joined with the Democrats and the Greens in saying: 'We are concerned about the transitional arrangements and the grandfathering provisions for the parenting payment given the significant difference between the payment levels for people who get to stay on the parenting payment (single) and those who end up on the Newstart allowance as primary carers. The legislation does not adequately provide appropriate safeguards to ensure that people currently on parenting payments will retain the payment until their youngest child turns 16.' That was said by the government when in opposition in 2005. They now seem to think that Welfare to Work is an acceptable way to treat the most vulnerable Australians. Of course, they were right: the provisions did not adequately protect those who were grandfathered, because they are presently doing the very thing that they were talking about, which is cutting those protections for those most vulnerable Australians.


The delivery measures cut approximately $58 per week from sole parents, and on top of that you have the impact on people's capacity to work part time. We know that single parents who are trying to survive on income support are amongst the poorest in this country. If you are living on parenting payment (single) you are basically living in poverty, as are your children. This bill will deepen that impoverishment without improving job prospects.


This is about budget savings. Let's be really clear about this. This is about budget savings. It is not about genuinely helping single parents into work. It is purely about the bottom line so that the government can claim it has a surplus. It is a budget cutback—there are no two ways about it.


One-third of single parents who are receiving the parenting payment are already in some form of paid work. This bill provides no changes to activity requirements or support. These parents have already been required to seek part-time employment since 2007. The only change being made is to the amount of money they will receive for their families. As I said, it is a significant cut in their income support. This does not provide an incentive to work because, as I said, one-third of single parents are already working part time. Moving people onto Newstart is going to make that work valued even less because the amount of money they can earn working part time is significantly less on Newstart—a double whammy.


Plunging families deeper into poverty will not help them find paid work. Research indicates that poverty is, in fact, a barrier to getting work. There is the stress around affordable housing. There was a report that came out just two weeks ago that highlighted the problems around finding affordable accommodation. Food related stress also impinges on people's capacity to find work, as does an inability to find the extra income for transport, clothing and all those other things that you need to survive.


We also have to bear in mind that single parents are desperately trying to find that balance between part-time work and supporting their families. Just because a child has turned 12 does not mean that it does not need the support and care of its parent. It is absolutely essential that we have flexibility in the system to enable people to work but also look after their families. Somebody rang me about this just the other day. She is a single parent and she lives in a regional area where the majority of work is shift work. There are no childcare services in that regional area that cover shift work. She asked me, 'How can I find work in this town when all the work is shift work based but child care starts at seven and finishes at five?' Where is she going to find child care? It is all very well for the government to say, 'We are going to provide cheaper child care.' If the child care is nonexistent it does not matter if it is cheaper. So what does that mother do when she is transferred onto Newstart and is then trying to exist on less money and cannot find part-time work because there is no part-time work that will also allow her to look after her children? If she left her kids alone to go and do shift work overnight she would be accused of neglecting her kids and then she would have DCP onto her. So much for a caring government that is really about trying to support people into employment!


As you can tell, the Greens do not support this particular amendment and, just for the record, we do not support the one that is also coming down at us, which we will be debating later, to drop the age of eligibility from 12 to eight. That will completely get rid of the grandfathered provisions and will plunge all single parents into this poverty trap. This bill also brings in cuts of $42 per week for young unemployed people aged 21 years. Unemployed 21-year-old people will lose access to Newstart allowance from July this year and will remain on the lower youth allowance for the year after their 21st birthday. Youth allowance for a single young person living away from home is $201 per week; the Newstart allowance is $243, nearly $244, per week. That is essentially a cut of $42 for young people living away from home and independent of their parents. As I have articulated and will articulate at some length later in this place, $244 is a minuscule amount of money to try to survive on—or not survive on—but it is getting cut by 20 per cent for those people who will be on youth allowance. You cannot live on that. Young people, again, will be living in poverty. As I have said and will continue to say at length in this place, poverty is yet another barrier to employment. How can you expect young people and students to live on less than people trying to survive on Newstart? At that time of their life young people are building the foundations of the rest of their life. We are condemning young people to poverty. That is an insecure foundation for young people to start their lives and build from. Where a young person is living at home a youth allowance rate of $133 per week applies. Where that person has not demonstrated financial independence from their parents a parental income test will apply to this group. This will of course further reduce payments for these young people.


The main argument in favour of this measure is that the gap between lower student payments—youth allowance and Austudy payments—and higher unemploy­ment allowance discourages participation in education. This is the same flawed argument that says that keeping Newstart payments low will magically encourage people into work. It is so low now and is not working; what makes the government think that dropping it even further will make it work? It is ridiculous for the government to think that a difference of $42 per week will act as a disincentive, particularly considering that even at the higher rate people are living in poverty. Living in poverty is not an incentive to work. People on Newstart do not have an incentive to work. Newstart is already below the poverty line of $130 per week. We know that setting it even lower will not magically encourage people to find work, because there are many barriers to people being able to find work. When is the government going to get this? It simply is not understanding the mechanics around barriers to employment. By putting young people further into poverty you entrench the poverty cycle.


This bill would cut the maximum rate of income support to unemployed 21-year-olds, regardless of their parents' income. We believe that, overall, we need to be increas­ing our income support payments, not cutting them. In fact, we need to overhaul the income support system in this country. It is complex, inadequate and confusing for people, does not meet current employment trends in this country, does not meet the insecure work situation/patterns that a large number of people are engaged in, does not meet the people's part-time work requirements and does not meet the temporary nature of the employment process that we have now. Of course, there is also the glaring problem that you are considered to be employed if you work even one hour a week. This antiquated income support system is trying to address all of those things. Each time the government cuts payments it makes it more difficult for people to survive and, I believe, makes it more difficult for them to be able to cope with this complex system.


Last year, even Ian Harper, the economist hand-picked by John Howard to set the minimum wage case, declared that Newstart is too low. He warned that giving people so little to survive on is causing desperation and depression. Many people now have said this. This bill puts single parents onto the lower Newstart rates and cuts youth allowance to below even the Newstart rate. It is not a good way to start people off in their working life. It drops people further into depression and hopelessness. Single parents' being dropped onto Newstart drops their income support, drops their ability to get ahead when they are working part time and develops a strong sense of hopelessness. What sort of scene is that setting for the children who are growing up in that environment, who are growing up in that intense poverty? We know that it affects their early childhood development. We know that we will have a better economy if we address those early childhood indicators.


Just last week I was at a seminar that was held to celebrate the work of the great Professor Fiona Stanley. Dr Clyde Hertzman, a Canadian who has been doing work with Professor Stanley, spoke to us about vulnerability indicators and the EDI, or early childhood development indicators. He was working with Stanford University. He pointed out that for every one per cent drop in vulnerability indicators for early development there is in fact a one per cent increase in GDP. Yet here is the government deliberately bringing in strategies to drop single parents further into poverty, and single parents are ipso facto looking after children. Instead of investing in those families the government is taking money away from them, making it harder for them to address the necessities of life and leading to their further vulnerability. A wise government would be investing in those families, not dropping them into poverty, making it harder and subjecting those children to poverty and increased vulnerability. A wise government would be very specifically investing in those families, investing in our most vulnerable Australians. Ignoring the social compact that we in this country should be developing with our vulnerable families and looking just at the economic development process of this country, would it not be a wise investment for us to address every degree of vulnerability if for no other reason than to increase GDP by one per cent? We would get that return. However, this government has chosen the coalition's approach of Welfare to Work that penalises and demonises people. In fact it has gone even further than the Howard government ever dared to go by dropping single parents and their families into poverty. That is what this bill does: it drops our most vulnerable young people into poverty by reducing their access, by making it even harder for them to struggle to survive.


Kids want an education; they want to gain access to an education. Keeping people in poverty and dropping their income support and thinking that they will automatically find work or education is a fallacy and an absolute nonsense. We do not support the provisions in this bill. We think it is the wrong approach and the government needs to reconsider how it allocates its money and how it makes its budget savings and at whose expense. This measure is at the expense of the most vulnerable Australians: our single parents and their children, the people we should be making our number one priority. We oppose these amendments.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (10:24):  At the outset I thank those who have made contributions to this second reading debate. The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support and Other Measures) Bill 2012 will give effect to important income support reforms contained in the Building Australia's Future Workforce package, which was announced in the 2011-12 budget. These amendments will provide a greater incentive for young Australians to engage in education, training and employment, and will encourage parents to re-engage in the workforce. It will help to restore equity to the eligibility conditions for parenting payment.


The Australian government's Building Australia's Future Workforce package is designed to ensure that all Australians are able to share in the benefits afforded by our growing economy. This package represents a significant investment in education, skills and employment opportunities that strengthen the future of Australia's workforce. Reforms to income support payments for young people are an integral part of the government's reform agenda and will provide greater incentives and support for young unemployed people to engage in education, training and employment. Education and employment are the key economic and social inclusion points. The government is committed to providing the right balance of support, assistance and incentives to ensure that people are able to take advantage of all of the opportunities that our economy has to offer.


This bill will amend the Social Security Act 1991 to delay access to Newstart allowance. From 1 July 2012, 21-year-olds may receive the same rate of youth allowance whether they are unemployed, in training or a student. This overcomes the financial disincentive for unemployed young people to undertake full-time study. There is a correlation between the completion of year 12, or an equivalent qualification, and the engagement of young people in education, employment or training.


The bill will also extend to 21-year-olds the 'earn or learn' participation requirements for youth allowance recipients who have not achieved year 12, or an equivalent qualification. A more generous income-free area and working credit will reward young people who take up part-time work as a stepping stone to full-time employment. From 1 July 2012, young job seekers receiving youth allowance will be able to earn more and still retain their payment. The income-free area will be increased from $62 to $143 a fortnight and their working credit limit will be increased from $1,000 to $3,500.


To ensure that all young people aged between 16 and 21 years of age under similar circumstances are in receipt of the same rate of income support payment, the bill also amends a number of payments, supplements and payment calculators to align the ages at which a person will cease to be qualified for youth disability supplement, sickness allowance and the long-term income support payment rate for students.


The government believes that these changes are the best way to support young Australians to participate in work or study, and to make the most of the opportunities that are available. It creates conditions that maximise the number of young people who remain in or return to education and training to get the qualifications and skills they need to be competitive in the labour market. It is important that this bill proceed now to ensure that young people are encouraged to learn or earn and are rewarded for part-time work as a stepping stone to more employment.


The Building Australia's Future Workforce package provides greater incentives for parents with school aged children to re-engage in the workforce. The government recognises that the best income support a parent can have is a job. That is why it is important that we provide the best possible incentives for parents to re-engage in work and present a positive working role model for their children. Through this bill the government is phasing out the arrange­ments for parenting payment recipients who have been on payment since before 1 July 2006. When their youngest child turns 12 years old, those recipients will now be treated the same as other parents, regardless of when they first claimed parenting payment. This measure creates better incentives for parenting payment recipients, including single parents, to return to the workforce by transitioning eligible parents onto Newstart allowance earlier. This recognises that most parents' capacity to undertake work or other activities increases as their children get older and that in the current income support system Newstart allowance is the most appropriate payment for working aged people to seek, find and maintain employment.


From 1 July 2013, a more generous income test will be introduced for all single, principal-care parents on Newstart allowance. This will enable those parents who may qualify for Newstart allowance to around $400 more per fortnight before losing their eligibility for payment. It will allow them to see greater benefits from their participation. As well as these increased benefits, it is important to note that parents caring for a child with a disability will continue to have access to a range of additional support, including carer allowance and participation exemptions for when their caring responsibilities need to come first.


The bill will also simplify the compliance framework and ensure that job seekers are not penalised because a weekend happens to fall before they have the opportunity to re-engage with an employment services provider. Announced as part of the Building Australia's Future Workforce package, daily penalty amounts for job seekers failing to attend an interview with an employment service provider will be aligned with the penalties for failing to attend an activity or a job interview, which is one-tenth of a person's fortnightly rate of participation payment. The department will monitor the implementation of this measure and its impact on the youth allowance recipients.


Finally, this bill will amend the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to provide the appropriation to fund the 12-month extension of the Student Education Trusts measure, as part of the extension of the Cape York Welfare reform trials, which was announced, as some in the chamber may recall, by the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigen­ous Affairs, in 2011. Parents and care givers in remote Indigenous communities in Far North Queensland will continue to be supported in saving for the cost of their children's education, which is a key element in achieving the Closing the Gap targets in Indigenous education.


I thank the senators for their contribution to the second reading debate. I commend the bill to the Senate.

 (Western Australia) (10:35):  So the bill is now on, is it?




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Yes, Senator.




Senator CORMANN:
  The bill is now on! So here we go. This is a government that is in outrageous shambles. This is a government that is weak, that is incompetent, that is dysfunctional, that is divided, that could not run a—




Senator Fierravanti-Wells:
  A chook raffle!




Senator CORMANN:
  They could not run a chook raffle. I was going to say something else there, Mr Deputy President, but I would not have wanted to be unparliamentary.


We are dealing here, of course, with the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012—a very serious issue. Phoenixing activity is something that the coalition is very concerned about. It is activity which is typically associated with directors who transfer the assets of an indebted company into a new company, of which they are also directors, effectively in order to avoid paying debts that they are required to pay.


The government has previously attempted to address this, and again and again, parliamentary committee after parliamentary committee has pointed out the deep flaws in the government's approach, has sent the government back to the drawing board, has told the government: 'The way you are trying to go about it is not fixing the problem; the way you are trying to go about it is going to capture all of the companies across Australia rather than just targeting companies that are actually engaged in fraudulent phoenixing activity.' And here we have a report before us, which I have not actually been able to officially see yet—which nobody in the Senate other than members of the committee have been able to officially review yet. I am led to believe that there are some recommendations in the report on this bill, from government members, on how this legislation needs to be improved and needs to be amended, yet the Senate has not been given an opportunity to even consider the report that Senator Polley, on behalf of the Chair of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, has just tabled.


So this is a government that is in disarray. This is a government that has to continue to chop and change with the program because it does not have a clue what it is doing. This is a government that can never follow proper process. This is a government that always gets itself into trouble because it would not know what proper process was if it fell over it. People across Australia are sick and tired of this government. They know that this is the worst and most incompetent government in the history of Federation. They know that it is a weak, incompetent, divided and dysfunctional government. The chopping and changing with the program here in the Senate today is just another reflection of the deep division and dysfunction in this government.


We in the Senate are now being asked to make a judgment on this legislation without having the benefit of being able to properly assess and review the report of a committee that was charged by the Senate to review the merits or otherwise of the legislation. Quite frankly, that is not good enough. There is a proper process to be followed here. When the Senate asks one of its committees to review the merits or otherwise of a piece of proposed legislation then all senators from across the chamber should have the opportunity to properly review its findings, to make judgments on whether or not they might want to change a previously held position.


As I have said, the coalition are strongly opposed to fraudulent phoenixing activity, and we support all appropriate measures to stamp out this practice. The problem is that this government's approach does not do that. This government's approach does not actually do anything to fix fraudulent phoenixing activity—in fact, this government, in this legislation, has not even defined what phoenixing activity is! This is a piece of legislation that gives a blanket increase in powers to ASIC, which will impose all sorts of additional burdens and risks on companies across the board and which, despite repeated attempts to achieve some improvements to the government's approach, has not been improved in any way, shape or form.


We have to remember that last year the government included a series of different measures, supposedly to target aspects of phoenixing activity in the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 8) Bill and the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2011. After these particular bills were examined by the House of Representatives Economics Committee, that committee made a unanimous and bipartisan recommendation that the govern­ment not proceed with those provisions. The House Economics Committee made a unanimous finding that the government got it wrong, that the government's approach was incompetent—that it was not right, that it was not going to achieve what the government said it wanted to achieve. This is the House Economics Committee, because the only committee report that I can rely on as a senator in relation to the government's approach to phoenixing activity is the House Economics Committee inquiry report, related to a different bill! I have not had the benefit of being able to review the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry report into this bill—which is a completely outrageous change in process, and mismanagement of process, which of course we have come to get used to from this bad and terrible Labor government. In its report the House Economics Committee:




… 
notes concerns from the business community and


its representatives that the Bills potentially apply to the broad range of


directors whether engaged in phoenix activity or not. The committee


recommends that the Government should investigate whether it is


possible to tighten the provisions of the Bills to better target phoenix


activity.



That was the assessment of a committee that included government members. Given that it had Labor members on the committee that came up with that sort of assessment, that is as damning as you are going to get from a Labor member of parliament in relation to their own government. As I say, go back to the drawing board, you have not got it right. You have come up with a piece of legislation that is targeting all company directors and all companies. You are telling us you are trying to fix phoenixing activity but in fact you are coming in with this grab-all of red tape, of additional powers for ASIC that is going to have implications for company directors across the board. Go back to the drawing board is what Labor members of the House Economics Committee said.


I gather that Labor senators on the Senate Economics Committee inquiry equally had concerns about the government's approach to this legislation. But I would not know because I have not been able to review what government senators of the Senate committee actually thought in relation to this particular piece of legislation.



Senator Marshall interjecting—




Senator CORMANN:
  Senator Marshall, it has only just been tabled. I was asked to make this speech on the second reading on behalf of the coalition within two seconds of Senator Polley having tabled the Senate Economics Legislation Committee report, which was due for tabling later this afternoon. This chopping and changing by this government is just another sign of a government in disarray. It is another sign of a government that has lost the plot. It is another sign of a deeply divided, weak and incompetent government where nobody knows who is in charge anymore, nobody knows who is doing what. This is a government that is all over the place. I say to the people of Australia, 'You are right, this is a government that should be up for the chop.' This is a government that should face an election sooner rather than later, because they are in their dying days. The level of incompetence that is now on display here today, the level of dysfunction, the level of absolute incompetence and disarray that is yet again on display here today in the Senate just shows to anyone who did not already know that this is a government that deserve to be kicked out at the next election and the sooner the better.


After the damning assessment of the government's previous attempt to introduce measures to arrest phoenixing activities when Labor members of the House Economics Committee told the government to go back to the drawing board, the government did exactly that. The government withdrew the provisions in relation to phoenixing from the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 8) Bill because clearly on reflection they conceded that those provisions did not actually appropriately target phoenixing activity. So here we have this latest foray, and pardon for being suspicious, pardon for suspecting that this incompetent government wants to avoid scrutiny by the Senate. What have the government got to hide? Why are the government tabling a report that is supposed to advise senators on the merits or otherwise of the government's approach on phoenixing and then trying to ram this legislation through within two seconds of having tabled the report, before anyone has got a proper chance to consider the findings and recommendations in that report? It might well be that on reading the coalition senators' dissenting report and considering the recommendations that we have made on how this legislation could be improved, Senator Siewert might be of the view that the coalition perspective on this is quite reasonable and quite legitimate. It could well lead to a change of position by the Greens or otherwise. But this arrogant, contemptuous government come into this chamber and want to rush through a piece of legislation that they clearly believe has got some flaws in it because if they were confident that this piece of legislation would stand the scrutiny of the Senate they would not ask the Senate to pass judgment on it before we have been able to properly consider the report that was tabled only a little while ago.


I understand that this arrogant government and this arrogant minister do not take seriously the role and responsibility of the Senate to scrutinise the activities of executive government. This minister does not care much about the proper democratic processes. This minister knows that proper scrutiny by the Senate is a bit of a nuisance when you have got a bad and incompetent government like the current one, coming in with one bad piece of legislation after the other. This is a minister who knows that he is part of a bad, incompetent government and part of a divided, deeply dysfunctional government. He of course knows that the reason the Senate is being messed around like this today is that his government cannot organise the processes properly. This should be of serious concern to any of the reasonable and mature people on the Labor side, but nobody is here to stand up and take a stand against what is being asked of the Senate today.


As I have mentioned, the coalition are strongly opposed to fraudulent phoenix activity and we support all appropriate measures to stamp out this process. We recognise that phoenix activity can cause significant harm to workers and small business people who are denied their legitimate entitlements. If left unchecked, it can erode the reputation of Australia's strong business community and reduce confidence in our world-class corporate regulatory framework. However, we are concerned that the government's approach to this important public policy matter is confused, ad hoc, piecemeal and not appropriately targeted. 


The Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012 is meant to enhance the ability of ASIC to combat phoenix activity. The bill gives ASIC significant new discretionary powers to place a company into liquidation. These powers can be used in a wide range of circum­stances. The bill also alters the publication requirements of corporate insolvency notices to allow for publication on a single ASIC administered website. Finally, the bill establishes a duty for receivers, adminis­trators and liquidators to notify the secretary of FaHCSIA upon their appointment to a company that is a paid parental leave employer.


Look at this. The attendants in the Senate are very helpful. We of course had to ask for this document. As I am on my feet speaking on this legislation, being asked to pass judgment on this legislation on behalf of the coalition, I am being handed a copy of the still warm report. It is a photocopy; it is not even a properly printed copy. I bet that the Senate printers were not even ready to have it properly printed. I am being handed a copy of this report as we are standing here debating this legislation. This is outrageous. This government every day is going from bad to worse. Whenever people across Australia think that it cannot get any worse it does, and we are continuing down this slippery slide to the next election, which no doubt will result in a pretty firm judgment by the Australian people. 


This is a report that includes recom­mendations by the government as well. Government senators on this committee are unhappy with this legislation. Government members of this committee are recom­mending that the government review proposed subsection 489EA(6). I am sure that Senator Siewert and Senator Marshall—Senator Marshall, are you on Economics Committee?




Senator Marshall:
  I am a participating member like you are.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Cameron

Senator CORMANN:
  I accept that admonishment, Mr Acting Deputy President. Here we have got three recommendations from the government senators on this committee to change this piece of legislation. So even government senators do not think that this legislation is up to scratch. Even government senators think that this legislation needs further change.


This incompetent, dysfunctional, weak and divided government, which is treating this Senate chamber with absolute contempt, wants all senators to consider this legislation, this set of proposals, without having had the benefit of properly considering both the recommendations by government senators and the recommendations that were made in the very good dissenting report by coalition senators. I suspect that this will be the first time that Senator Marshall will be able to read the coalition senators' dissenting report, because it is not usual practice that government senators are provided with a copy of dissenting reports before they are tabled. There are some very good recommendations in the coalition senators' dissenting report. The first is:


That the Senate oppose this Bill.


The second is:


That the government undertakes a comprehensive and co-ordinated legislative approach to combating fraudulent phoenix activity that includes an appropriate definition of 'fraudulent phoenix activity'.


It might well have been that the eloquent words of Senator Bushby, who is the Deputy Chair of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, might have persuaded Senator Marshall to change his mind, or, if not Senator Marshall, perhaps Senator Siewert. Who knows? The point is that the reason we do these reports, the reason we have these inquiries into legislation, is so that the Senate has a proper opportunity to assess the legislation based on the judgment that was made by one of its committees.


Recommendation 3 by coalition senators is:


That regulators including ASIC ensure that they fully utilise existing legislative and regulatory powers to combat fraudulent phoenix activity.


One thing that became very clear during the inquiry, as I understand it, is that ASIC actually already have a lot of powers that at present they are not utilising, either because they have not got the resources or because they are not appropriately prioritising those activities. They have already got a lot of powers that they could use to better target fraudulent phoenix activity. Forever increasing regulatory powers, forever increasing red tape, does not do anything to fix the problem any better. If you have got an organisation that is not utilising its powers now, either because it has not got the resources or because it has not got the appropriate prioritised agenda, that organisation will not do anything just because the government, with the flick of a pen, increases its powers and increases red tape.


Recommendation 4 from the coalition senators' part of the report is:


That any proposed broad new powers for regulators such as ASIC that would apply to corporations and directors that are not engaged in fraudulent phoenix activity be subject to proper public scrutiny and debate rather than be bundled into legislation that is supposed to apply to only one discrete policy area.


I could not have said it better myself. What a sensible recommendation by the coalition members on the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. But, of course, senators across the chamber will not have had the opportunity to properly consider the findings and recommendations that were made by coalition senators, because nobody in this chamber has actually had an opportunity to review the coalition senators' dissenting report and recommendations.


I finish where I started. This is a serious policy issue. This is an issue that the coalition actually wants to see properly addressed. This legislation does not do that. For the government now to come in in another fit of incompetence, to abort proper process and to force the Senate to deal with this legislation without actually having had an opportunity to consider a report that was put together, at its request, by a committee of the Senate is just completely outrageous and inappropriate. It is just another demon­stration of an arrogant, incompetent govern­ment on its last legs, a government which clearly does not know where it is going these days, a government that is so focused on itself that it does not know how to focus on the public interest anymore. This is a government that is so weak, so incompetent, so divided, so deeply dysfunctional. It is time for this government to go. It is time for this government to face the Australian people so that the Australian people can pass judgment on this terrible and ongoing Labor Party incompetence.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (10:55):  The Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012 is important legislation and is part of this government's Protecting Workers' Entitlements package, part of a continued process of ensuring workers' hard-worked-for entitlements are protected in circumstances where companies trade insolvently, go bust and go into liquidation, leaving workers stranded without access to important entitlements such as accumulated annual leave, accumulated long-service leave and redundancy entitlements.


This is not controversial legislation. It has been part of this government's process of ensuring that there are a suite of reforms that adequately protect workers' entitlements in this country. In fact, when this legislation was reported on by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, a member of that committee reported to the House on 27 February 2012:


The committee considers that the bill comprises uncontroversial measures that will assist in curbing the amoral practice of phoenixing. Indeed, in a briefing issued on 23 January 2012, the law firm Minter Ellison stated:


The … bill contains some reasonable measures for facilitating the protection of workers' entitlements. and these measures are unlikely to affect the position of the majority of directors.


Therefore, the committee has decided not to inquire into the bill and recommends that the House or the Federation Chamber consider the bill forthwith.


That was the determination of the House economics committee, clearly advising that this legislation is not controversial. That is why I find Senator Cormann's contribution to this debate somewhat amusing. Really the contributions from those opposite are all about protecting the interests of big business at the expense of those who will benefit from this legislation, and that is of course workers in this country who are seeking to avoid situations where their hard-fought-for and hard-won entitlements go unpaid in circumstances where companies go bust. This is an important improvement to our corporations power and an important addition in the fight against unethical and immoral practices within the corporate world.


The process of phoenixing is something that is abhorred by the Australian public and not supported by any member of this parliament. We have heard all the stories about businesses setting up one day, trading themselves to a point where they can no longer hope to repay their creditors and then completely walking away from obligations that they have entered into in good faith. We see failed businesses being left without being wound up, simply abandoned without any attempt to fulfil any of the company's obligations to its stakeholders, only to see that same enterprise, the same persons involved, begin trading soon after the failure, often within the same industry, often with the same directors and in some cases with an almost identical name. This practice leaves in its wake a destructive mess that costs the economy a great deal and hurts innocent people, both inside and outside the business. That is phoenixing.


I find Senator Cormann's comments regarding a lack of definition of the circumstances of phoenixing to be somewhat perplexing given that they are clearly defined in this legislation. They are defined in proposed section 489EA, which empowers ASIC to order the winding up of a company in four clearly separate and distinct sets of circumstances—and these are outlined in the provisions of the bill.


Phoenixing, in short, is a process of allowing a company to go broke—but never winding it up or paying out anything to its creditors—and then simply starting up a new company as if the destruction of the other one had never happened. We see this practice all too often in this country, particularly, unfortunately, in the construction industry and the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. According to the Australian Taxation Office, there are about 6,000 phoenix companies in Australia and between 7,500 and 9,000 directors of those companies. It is a practice which plagues many industries in Australia. We know the damage done to our economy by shonky practices in an industry that is this nation's lifeblood—I speak, of course, of the construction industry—although we are seeing this practice creep into other industries and we are seeing more and more people being hurt.


The Australian Security Industry Association, in response to a report into the security industry by Fair Work Australia, has called for greater compliance and enforce­ment to address issues such as rates of pay, sham contracting and, of course, phoenixing. Even in the energy industry, we are beginning to see reports that ASIC is investigating Mr Ben Polis over the collapse of his business, Polis Australia, trading at the time as Green Energy Australia. Unfortun­ately, we are starting to see a lot of this in the retail energy sector. Basically all you need to have to start up a company trading as a retailer in the energy industry these days is a laptop computer and a mobile phone—you can then begin taking and signing up customers. ASIC is looking into allegations that, in this particular case concerning Mr Ben Polis, the assets belonging to Polis Australia were transferred to his new business without payment. When it collapsed, Green Energy Australia owed $397,000 to creditors. We then see Mr Polis running a new company, which has risen from the ashes like the mythical bird itself, trading as EnergyWatch. At the same time, the Fair Work Ombudsman is investigating the failure to pay $500,000 in staff entitlements to employees of EnergyWatch.


In an article for the Sydney Morning Herald on 12 April this year, Maurice Blackburn Lawyers raised the example of the directors of a printing business telling a pregnant worker that she had 'caused an inconvenience' and giving her the sack just before Christmas. The directors of the company, Wongtas, were taken to court over this in 2010. Soon after, the directors of Wongtas placed this company into liquidation and registered a new company—Wangtas—which recommenced the same operations at the same location. The Federal Court has held that the liquidation of Wongtas had been carried out for the purpose of avoiding potential penalties under the Fair Work Act. Even with that Federal Court ruling, proceedings could not be maintained against Wongtas because the company no longer existed. Unfortunately, that means that this pregnant employee was not paid her wages—and of course she never got her job back. This bill introduces a series of measures to help people hurt by such practices by strengthening ASIC's capacity to deal with phoenixing. ASIC will be empowered to place companies into liquidation when they have been abandoned by their directors.


This bill also gives effect to commitments made to amend the process for access to the General Employee Entitlements Redundancy Scheme, GEERS. GEERS was established by the former government following the collapse of National Textiles. We all remember that National Textiles was a company owned and operated by the brother of then Prime Minister John Howard. The company had fallen in a heap, leaving all employee entitlements unfunded. GEERS was set up in its wake. GEERS allows employees to access entitlements in situations where unpaid wages, accrued long-service leave and other forms of applicable leave have been lost because a company has failed. GEERS aims to provide employees with access to these entitlements in a fair and reasonable time frame. However, a significant downfall of the current scheme is that it requires a failed company to be placed into liquidation before employees can seek, through GEERS, to access those unpaid entitlements. As I have pointed out, in phoenixing situations it is often the case that the company is simply abandoned rather than being wound up or liquidated. When this occurs, employees are not eligible to access GEERS. In order to have an abandoned company placed into liquidation, a court order must be sought, and this court process often takes a lengthy period of time at great cost to those seeking the order for liquidation. In the case of employees seeking such an order, a considerable amount of their entitlements are often eaten up in legal fees rather than going towards those next steps in life which inevitably flow from losing your job in the collapse of the company.


Even worse is the situation for employees who are seeking access to an abandoned company in the case where the company has been deregistered. In that scenario, orders must be sought to have the company reinstated and then you still have to go through the process I outlined to get it liquidated—all this to access a scheme which, in its current incarnation, is meant to be a last resort for employees to get the entitlements they need to move on with their lives. It is a government sponsored scheme which often takes an unbearable and unrealistic amount of time to access.


This bill will allow ASIC to place a company into liquidation in a reasonable time frame, therefore allowing employees to access GEERS in that reasonable time frame. That will mean that the pain and cost of litigation can be avoided. That is why this is a positive reform. The new ASIC powers will follow the same rules which apply when a company is deregistered by the com­mission. These new, common-sense powers will mean that companies which are clearly no longer trading and have been abandoned can be wound up and placed into liquidation. This will give employees caught up in a corporate collapse the certainty they deserve of access to their unpaid entitlements.


In addition, this bill introduces a provision requiring companies placed in administration to use a single website for the posting of public notices. At the moment, many companies going through such a liquidation process place such notices in metropolitan newspapers where they are often missed by creditors and employees who have an interest in ensuring that the liquidation process is completed. A new single website—a single point of call—for people in such situations will ensure they have access to the information they need to begin the process of regaining their entitlements. At the moment we see the administrators placing notices in the ASIC Gazette as well, and that is required by the Corporations Act. But, again, a single port of call through a website is a common-sense approach that allows administrators and stakeholders to keep up to date with developments and have easy access to the information that they require.


These measures make an important improvement to our corporations power. The bill means that employees caught up in unethical and unjustified phoenixing pro­cesses can have access to the government's GEER Scheme in a fair and timely manner. It delivers on the commitments that this government has made as part of its Protecting Workers' Entitlements package. It strengthens ASIC's powers to place companies into liquidation when they have been abandoned by their directors and allows for a cost-effective process involving the publication of insolvency notices in a single, publicly available website.


Phoenixing is corporate Australia at its worst. It is unethical, it is immoral and, importantly, it is un-Australian. This bill represents an important step in tackling this broad and far too wide problem in our economy. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2012-05-09,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (11:10):  I rise to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012. This is an area in which I have a particular interest, given the work I did formerly at the Australian Government Solicitor's Office, and for quite a number of years I was involved in insolvency practice. Phoenixing, particularly in relation to the winding up of companies that had failed to pay their tax, was my daily bread and butter. It is interesting to hear Senator Thistlethwaite speak on this issue. More often than not the companies that do engage in phoenixing activities are, as Senator Thistlethwaite justly says, in the construction industry. That is where I saw many of the worst examples of phoenixing. Often I would have discussions with union officials—sad discussions with union officials—who had come to me representing their members because companies had not paid, in particular, their dues to the Australian Taxation Office and therefore in any eventual winding up the workers had a very difficult place in the pecking order. I want to place this on the record because it is my view that this area needs much more attention than this bill gives it.


Can I present some practical examples relating to some of the things that Senator Cormann and, to some extent, Senator Thistlethwaite said. Senator Thistlethwaite focused on some high-profile windings up. I would like also to place on the record that I had my fair share of interesting windings up. In fact, Senator Marshall, I actually wound up the holding company that ran that famous piggery. That was a very interesting exercise. There are certainly some very interesting characters on the list of serial directors who set up companies and then deliberately send them into phoenixing arrangements and trade insolvently, particularly those with whom the Australian Taxation Office has come into close contact. I will not put names on the record.


The point I make is that any package that deals with phoenixing must look at what existing powers are available to the Commonwealth—and they have always been available to the Commonwealth, yet some of those powers have not been used. One of the most common situations I found myself in was where I would be winding up a company which had directors that had previously had companies; those companies went into liquidation, then they set up companies with similar names and they went into liquidation. Often I would be dealing with directors who had had a string of companies that had been wound up, and here they were again before the courts being wound up. Why? Because, regrettably, there had not been a prosecution, there had been underresourced regulators, there had been insufficient follow-up on complaints and there had been inadequate penalties to act as a deterrent. Unfortunately, if these directors are not prosecuted for insolvent trading and the regulator might have the powers to prosecute but does not have the resources to undertake those prosecutions, the inevitable will happen: these companies will go into liquidation; the creditors—often the workers—will not get their entitlements; and another company will start up down the road the next week.


Another issue with phoenixing that I found in my experience was the use by companies and company directors of the voluntary administration provisions, which also enabled them to undertake creative accounting and enter into arrangements which often paid 5c in the dollar and then again, ultimately, the company could be put into liquidation and the directors would start up again.


My concern with this legislation is not that I do not want to combat phoenixing but that the measures to combat phoenixing should be packaged up in a much broader reform than is currently before us. Senator Thistlethwaite mentioned section 489EA and ASIC orders for the winding up of a company. The legislation may well canvass that sort of issue, but what is clear is that work done by the Senate Standing Committee on Economics as well as work previously done by Senator Sherry and other assistant treasurers provides a much better and much more comprehensive starting point for the direction of this legislation. This is not a definition of what phoenixing activity is. This is a broad definition of the talks about the winding up of a company. It does not go into the specifics of the sorts of phoenixing activity that we see daily.


Senator Cormann referred to the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, and that committee presented a unanimous and bipartisan recommendation that the government not proceed with provisions. It specifically commented:


... the committee notes concerns from the business community and its representatives that the Bills potentially apply to the broad range of directors whether engaged in phoenix activity or not. The committee recommends that the Government should investigate whether it is possible to tighten the provisions of the bill to better target phoenix activities.


As I understand, the government sub­sequently withdrew the provisions from the bill which the Economics Committee was then considering and has yet to provide an indication as to how they will tighten the provisions to better target phoenixing activities as recommended by the committee. A number of senators were involved in a Senate inquiry which, while it came from the other aspect of considering activities of liquidators, nevertheless touched on phoenixing. Senator Williams in particular went into more detail in relation to some companies he had had experience with. We have yet to see a government response to that committee report, which also touches on these matters and lends credence to my appeal to the government that this is a far wider issue than what this legislation currently canvasses, particularly in fairness to all—not just the corporate sector—small businesses and workers who often find themselves at the lower end and ultimately are the ones who suffer the most as a consequence of companies going into liquidation. In the construction industry it is the subcontractors, the workers and the businesses providing materials who ultimately will not be paid.


The necessity for a clear definition is fundamental to any legislation. It is fundamental that that definition include the fraudulent activity which is the cornerstone of phoenixing activities. The definition should be targeted at the specific activities which the government is seeking to eliminate. A clear definition would protect those legitimate companies and ensure they do not inadvertently get caught up in what is quite draconian legislation. My criticism is that there needs to be greater definition of what phoenixing is about. While Senator Thistlethwaite touched on this, there is a range of areas which, in my experience, could be looked at. When one examines whether a company has been engaged in phoenixing activities, there is a range of Commonwealth areas with which the company could have had involvement—the tax office or a range of other aspects of government—which would have given certain indicators. For example, directors may have previously been directors of companies which had gone into liquidation. One accepts that some companies do go into liquidation as serial offenders. I dealt with one colourful character frequently in the courts. I must have wound up 10 or 12 of his companies. He repeatedly turned up in the courts, in my case because we were winding him up for failure to pay tax.


Yes, there is a rightful role in relation to ASIC improperly overseeing and enforcing legislation but my point is that I would like to see ASIC utilise more fully the existing powers available to it. While the government is now looking to add additional powers, a far better reform package would look at the existing powers ASIC and other organisations to see how they can be better utilised. The concern I have, as Senator Cormann expressed, is that the government seems to be taking an ad hoc and piecemeal approach to the targeting of fraudulent phoenixing activities by introducing different pieces of related legislation in an unco­ordinated manner rather than withdrawing the current bill, looking at this matter in a much more global way, engaging in meaningful consultation with stakeholders to address their legitimate concerns and determining a comprehensive and co­ordinated legislative approach to this important public policy matter. 


As a starting point—and I mentioned Senator Sherry before—the government should consider the proposals paper on combating phoenixing activities released in November 2009 by Senator Sherry, who was then the Assistant Treasurer, one of five assistant treasurers in the short history of the Labor government. Of the 11 proposals for combating phoenixing activities in that proposals paper, none are reflected in these new ASIC powers. The 11 proposals may in fact be a good place for the government and the new Assistant Treasurer to start when they go back to the drawing board, as they properly should on this important area of policy. 


The coalition has a number of other concerns about the government's approach to phoenixing activities including how effective previous regulatory efforts have been in combating this practice, the appropriateness of available penalties and the lack of recognition by the government of the role and capacity of liquidators in taxing phoenix activities. I mention the report the Senate committee had undertaken in relation to liquidators' activities because we have yet to see the government's response. I think that is an important component if we are going to consider phoenixing activities. I echo Senator Cormann's comments on Senator Mark Bishop, the chair of the economics committee, in the report tabled by Senator Polley a few moments ago. Can I also place on record that tabling a report on an important piece of legislation and then having the legislation follow shortly thereafter is really indicative of the shambolic way that this government runs its Senate procedures. But even Senator Bishop makes comments in relation to the definition of winding up by ASIC and, indeed, even Senator Bishop makes references to how the definition needs to be improved. 


I turn now to the coalition senators' dissenting report, which picks up the Treasury proposals paper and the document that I referred to in relation to Senator Sherry. I would like to quote from the Treasury proposals paper issued in November 2009, which describes the systematic way that such phoenix activity is conducted:


Fraudulent phoenix activity involves the evasion of tax and other liabilities such as employee entitlements through the deliberate, systematic and sometimes cyclic liquidation of related corporate trading entities.


Coalition senators recognise that phoenix activity causes significant harm, most especially to workers and small businesses who are denied their legitimate entitlements. They state correctly:


If left unchecked it can erode the reputation of Australia’s strong business community and reduce confidence in our world class corporate regulatory framework.


Despite efforts of this government, it still does not get it right. 


The coalition senators' dissenting report refers to the unanimous and bipartisan recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics and then goes on to state the obvious—that there is no definition of fraudulent phoenix activity. The report picks up the point made by the Australian Institute of Company Directors:


We are firmly of the view that if new legislation is being introduced to target a specific problem, then the legislation must clearly define the issue sought to be addressed and specifically regulate that problem.


It is very clear that the government has not made any meaningful attempt to define what constitutes fraudulent phoenix activity or to delve into the specifics of what that activity entails. You cannot make a meaningful attempt to reduce phoenix activity if you do not specifically and properly define what that activity is and what it entails, and be a lot more specific about it. As I said, whilst the bill does make an attempt to significantly increase ASIC's powers, it fails to address the existing powers and how those powers have been utilised. In any reform in this area, one does have to examine the deficiencies in the current regulatory framework to see why activity has gone unchecked. 


Phoenixing activity has been a factor of corporate life. I used to practice in this area in the early 1990s and mid-1990s. We still have these issues. I take Senator Conroy's point that governments of both persuasions need to look at this area. (Time expired)

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (11:30):  I rise to speak in support of the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012. It is a pleasure to speak on this bill, as it is great Labor policy. Before I get into the substance of my speech I would like to comment on some of the previous contributions. I want to commend in some respects the contribution just made by Senator Fierravanti-Wells, but unfortunately I think she will probably be dragged into the office of the shadow minister, Senator Cormann, because Senator Fierravanti-Wells's contribution has really made his look very ordinary. It is very clear when you contrast the two contributions that Senator Fierravanti-Wells has actually come to grips with some of the issues and some of the problems that this bill is trying to seek to address. Given Senator Cormann's contribution, one would not even think that he had the most basic understanding of what the actual problem was. So I do feel for you, Senator Fierravanti-Wells. You should not come in outshining the shadow minister in the way you did, and I am sure he will have some very harsh words for you. 


It was an extraordinarily ordinary contribution by Senator Cormann, who ran a line about the fact that he did not have access to the committee report prior to it being tabled today. I flicked through the Notice Paper to see whether Senator Cormann is a member of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, and indeed he is. He is a participating member of the committee. As every senator in this place would know, the committee has to meet and endorse the draft of the report prior to it being circulated. All Senator Cormann had to do was ring up and say, 'I would like to see a copy of that report,' just like every other senator can do and does have to do. But for some reason it is beyond Senator Cormann to have the wit or the nous to actually help himself and ring up, and get a copy of the report so that he could be informed by it. 


He then went on to acknowledge that the only part of the report that the committee does not have access to and that government members do not have access to is the opposition's dissenting comments, which of course are kept secret from everybody else—but not the report itself, as everyone knows. I do not really think we can believe very much of what Senator Cormann has to say on this bill. He certainly was not portraying the reality about the existence of the report to the Senate, and I suspect the rest of his contribution was equally as poor. 


I also want to pick up on what Senator Fierravanti-Wells said. She very clearly identified the serious nature of this problem and how it has been ongoing. In fact, I like the example that she used, in that, when she was practising in this field as a solicitor in the nineties, a director had gone through the phoenixing of 10 to 12 companies yet was still around. I think that demonstrates that there is a very serious problem. 


Senator Fierravanti-Wells's position—reflected also in the dissenting comments in the report—is that we should have a look at what existing powers ASIC has and utilise them before we go into relegislating. If Senator Fierravanti-Wells knows this has been a problem for 20-odd years, ASIC obviously does not have the power to do something about it and they need extra legislative muscle to tackle this problem. Of course, that is why the government are legislating, because we need to give ASIC the powers and the ability to crack down on phoenixing. It simply is not good enough to say, 'We acknowledge that this problem is there and we think it is terrible but we are going to allow it to flourish.' That is what the opposition are saying today. They are going to oppose this legislation. They acknowledge that it is a serious problem that needs to be dealt with, but they are going to oppose it and let this problem flourish. 


Senator Fierravanti-Wells at least had one criticism of the legislation, saying that it does not go far enough. If it does not go far enough, that is something the government will have to revisit. But, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, put up some amendments. If you want it to go further, put up some amendments for the government to consider. But let us go as far as we want to go. We think we are going far enough at this point in time. We may have to come back and revisit this in the future if it does not close the loopholes that have been identified, but if you do not think it goes far enough, support how far it does go and put up some amendments to make it go further. We can accommodate that fairly easily; we can at least look at amendments. You would think you would do that. But to simply say, 'We do not think it goes far enough, so we are going to say no' is really just the way this opposition work in this place and of course in the House. Their answer to every problem is to simply do nothing and say no. Whenever the govern­ment tries to proactively move to close loopholes, to stop people being ripped off, to stop phoenixing of companies so that people pay their tax and entitlements to working people and to take away this blight from the business community, the opposition say no and frustrate the government. They want to oppose it. There is never any constructive engagement with the government; they simply say no. I do not think it is good enough.


But I am pleased by and do get some confidence from the fact that Senator Fierravanti-Wells at least understands the issue and what is at stake. I just think it is very disappointing that someone who obviously understands it has not had the courage to stand up in the party room and say, 'Actually, this is good stuff and we should be supporting the government and encouraging the government to go further.' But it is obvious to everyone what the stumbling block in the opposition party room is. It is the shadow minister who has not got a clue about this particular issue. It is a bit of an embarrassment, as was his contribution today.


The Labor Party are getting on with the work of implementing the protecting workers' entitlements package and fulfilling our commitment to cracking down on companies that undertake phoenixing behaviour. In our market based economy there is a responsibility of government to represent the public interest. When the private sector writes off carbon pollution, for instance, as an externality, it is the role of government to ensure that the true cost is accounted for. When the private sector fails to provide appropriate infrastructure, it falls to the government to intervene with initiatives such as the National Broadband Network. When there is evidence of widespread sex based discrimination in Australian workplaces, it is the responsibility of government to take action. We have taken action in that regard and I will be tabling a report on legislation that the government are moving in that area later today.


In an ideal world, the government would not be forced to take this kind of action. But, unfortunately and increasingly, we bear witness to shameless, cynical behaviour by elements of our business community. Phoenixing represents a particularly heinous form of corporate cynicism whereby a company enters into a calculated collapse in order to escape its financial obligations to its workers and other creditors. Soon afterwards, these companies are seen to rise from the ashes, much like the mythological bird. The Australian Taxation Office estimates that there are approximately 6,000 phoenix companies in Australia today. This is not a small problem; it is a significant problem. It is well past time that it was addressed and it is well past time that the opposition supported the government in doing this.


The government seeks to address in this bill the complex issue of phoenixing in three separate ways. Firstly, and most significantly, the bill seeks to empower ASIC with the ability to place abandoned businesses into liquidation in appropriate and prescribed circumstances without applying to the courts. Effectively, it seeks to thwart the current practice whereby a business can enter into a state of limbo, neither living nor dead, thus avoiding certain financial obligations. Previously, newly unemployed workers have sometimes been able to gain access to certain outstanding entitlements through the General Employee Entitlements Redundancy Scheme, GEERS. At present, however, it is a precondition that corporations are actually placed into liquidation before their former employees are able to sue for their entitlements through GEERS. Unfortunately, this does not always happen as it should.


Workers who have just lost their incomes and who are often neither financially nor emotionally equipped to do so find themselves faced with the requirement to undertake court action before being able to gain access to the entitlements that they are owed. I think that is an incredibly unfair burden on workers at the moment. They are the ones who are forced to take a company to court to force it into liquidation before they are able to access their entitlements. That is not an appropriate thing for workers to have to do, especially when in nearly every case they have lost their income and do not have any other income at that particular time. It is the role of government through its regulators to force that issue and ensure that that action is taken quickly and efficiently. These actions will represent a significant step towards the realisation of the government's protecting workers' entitlements package.


The bill also seeks to change the reporting requirements of newly insolvent companies. External administration notices will be required to be made available on the ASIC website. This is a sensible and modern approach to an existing outdated and costly system. Senator Thistlethwaite, whose contribution I commend to everybody, went through that process in some detail. Currently businesses are required to publish a notice of their insolvency either in a newspaper or in the ASIC Gazette. This approach does not befit the digital age. It is essentially decentralised and lacking in clarity. The requirement to publish a notice of external administration on the ASIC website will reduce the administrative burden on creditors, who are currently required to monitor numerous newspapers for relevant notifications, particularly as there is no set newspaper or day of the week on which notices must be published. It will make it far easier for all interested parties, including workers, to gain access to this often crucial information.


Furthermore, this measure will result in significant savings to the creditors of companies that enter into external administration. It is estimated that this reform will result in approximately $15 million of savings, some of which will undoubtedly find its way into the pockets of deserving ex-employees.


Finally, this bill will require liquidators to inform FaHCSIA in the event that they are appointed to an employer with Paid Parental Leave responsibilities. This will ensure that FaHCSIA will have the information it needs to determine whether to persist with parental leave payments to the company in question or whether it would be more appropriate to direct those payments to the individual employee. This final amendment forms but a minor part of a suite of reforms that this bill seeks to implement, yet it gives me great pleasure to commend it. Paid parental leave is a triumph of this government and another example of good Labor policy. Australians, particularly Australian women, have long fought for the right to paid parental leave and over 150,000 working parents have so far enjoyed the fruit of that labour. It must be gratifying for these parents to know that the government continues to place great importance on the right to paid parental leave, as this bill shows.


Workers and fair-minded business people must also find it gratifying to see that this government is pressing on with its agenda of reform and is tackling the complex issue of phoenixing—a despicable practice, a sad symptom of corporate greed and a strong argument for continued vigilance by a government that is not afraid to intervene on behalf of Australian workers. I commend this bill to the Senate.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (11:43):  I thank those senators who took part in the debate on the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the stakeholders for their contributions at the various stages. This bill delivers on the Gillard government's protecting workers' entitlements package, its election com­mitments and part of its insolvency reform package, announced on 14 December 2011. There is no rush or surprise in any of it. The bill strengthens ASIC's powers to place into liquidation companies that have been abandoned by their directors. It will benefit the employees of those abandoned companies by enabling quicker access to their unpaid entitlements through the government's employee assistance scheme. The bill also paves the way for a more streamlined and cost-effective process involving the publication of insolvency notices via a single, publicly available website. This will benefit creditors of companies in external administration by reducing the cost of complying with these regulatory obligations and making it easier for creditors to keep track of information about companies in external administration. The bill, as Senator Marshall said, also contains some miscellaneous amendments in relation to paid parental leave and the powers of the court in relation to company reinstatements.


In conclusion, this bill will ensure that ASIC can step in to wind up a company to ensure that employees receive quicker access to their entitlements from the government's employee assistance scheme. By imposing a requirement on insolvency practitioners to inform FaHCSIA of their appointment, the bill will ensure FaHCSIA becomes aware when a company goes into external administration, so as to allow it to take over responsibility for paying employees under the Paid Parental Leave scheme. The bill also implements an important part of the government's insolvency reform package by facilitating the establishment of a single, insolvency notices website. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (12:45):  The Cancer Council of Australia and the Heart Foundation have advised that tobacco kills over 15,000 Australians each year and five million worldwide and is widely recognised as the single largest preventable cause of illness and premature death in Australia. The adverse effects of smoking on a smoker's health are proven and well documented. As I have said before in this chamber, cigarettes are poisonous. Smoking will damage your health. Smoking is likely to kill you.


The government's world-first tobacco plain-packaging laws are a significant step in reducing the impact of these poisonous products on the health and wellbeing of all Australians. Our plain-packaging legislation has elevated Australia to a position of global leadership in the field of tobacco control. We are setting a global precedent that has big tobacco shaking in their boots—and that is something we can all be proud of.


There is still more we can do for the health and wellbeing of Australians and to consolidate our global leadership and very strong reputation in the field of tobacco control. Smoking in movies by actors with youth appeal continues to promote positive images of tobacco products to young people and children. It is now widely accepted that these images are a significant risk factor for smoking initiation among adolescents. The World Health Organisation have pointed to studies that show 'smoking in movies misleads youth into thinking that tobacco use is normal, acceptable, socially beneficial and more common than it really is'. These studies also show that 'such movies rarely portray the harm of tobacco, instead portraying the product as conducive of a cool and glamorous lifestyle'. In March this year the US Surgeon General report Preventing tobacco use among youth and young adults stated:


In 2010, nearly a third of top-grossing youth-rated movies—those with G, PG, or PG-13 ratings—contained images of tobacco use.


Teens and young adults are sensitive to what they see and hear in the world around them. If they are exposed to images that portray smokers as cool, attractive, rebellious, fun-loving, risk-taking, or other characteristics they admire, young people may want to smoke, too.


The report finishes by stating:


The evidence is sufficient to conclude that there is a causal relationship between depictions of smoking in movies and the initiation of smoking among young people.


The Australian Medical Association, in its 2008 study Take smoking out of kid's movies, found that 70 per cent of top box office films contained depictions of smoking, including 75 per cent of most PG rated films. In my view, it is unacceptable that we continue to allow images that may promote smoking in films and television. This runs the risk of shaping the views of young people and potentially may lead to them taking up these deadly products.


International instruments underpin our commitment to providing Australians the highest standard of health and wellbeing. Australia is a signatory of the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Article 13 of the treaty recognises that a comprehensive ban on advertising, promotion, and sponsorship would reduce the consumption of tobacco products and that each party shall, in accordance with its constitution or constitu­tional principles, undertake a comprehensive ban of all tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship.


The rest of the world is moving in the direction of cutting out or reducing portrayals of tobacco products and smoking in movies. In November last year, the Indian government introduced measures to reduce portrayals of smoking in its multibillion-dollar Hindi cinema or Bollywood movie industry. These measures include film and television programs in India being required to 'justify' smoking content to the Central Board of Film Certification, display on-screen warnings, be screened at times when minors are least likely to be watching and carry a classification one step short of an adult rating. The Indian government has recognised that Hindi cinema plays a key role in influencing young people's beliefs and behaviours in relation to social norms for smoking and it has taken action. So can we in Australia.


Any reasonable person would acknowledge that the Australian government plays an active role in reducing smoking in Australia—as it should. Over past decades we have seen bans on advertising for cigarettes and tobacco products, bans on smoking in public places, quit services promoted and a myriad of programs designed to limit the marketing and prevalence of cigarettes in our community. As recently as last night in the budget the government announced a new measure to help combat smoking: duty-free cigarettes will be reduced from 250 cigarettes per passenger to just 50 cigarettes per passenger. I very much welcome that measure.


Some of the antismoking regulations in this country are among the toughest in the world. However, I am concerned that, while we may be trailblazers on the plain packaging and other fronts, we do slip behind the worldwide standard for smoking in movies. I am concerned that the Australian government might inadvertently provide incentives that allow people to make movies that propagate the smoking message.


The Australian government provides generous tax incentives for film, television and other screen production in Australia. In 2010-11 the government provided some $145 million in tax offsets to screen producers. The producer offset encourages the production of Australian film and television projects and is administered by Screen Australia. The producer offset can provide up to 40 per cent of qualifying Australian production expenditure for a feature film. It can provide funding for goods and services provided in Australia for the making of a film, the use of land located in Australia for the making of a film and the use of goods that are located in Australia at the time they are used in the making of a film. In 2010-11, the Australian government provided $87 million for filmmakers under this scheme.


The location offset is a 16.5 per cent rebate which supports the production of large-budget film and television projects shot in Australia. A film's qualifying Australian production expenditure must be at least $15 million, and at least 70 per cent of any eligible film's total production costs must occur in Australia. For example, Minister Crean recently announced a $12.8 million investment to the makers of The Wolverine, an investment which the Australian economy will see returned in spades. The Wolverine will inject $80 million into the Australian film and production industry and will create over 2,000 local jobs.


The PDV offset, a 30 per cent rebate, supports postproduction works and digital and visual effects production, PDV, in Australia, regardless of where a project is shot. This includes animatronics, audio special effects, music composition and recording, models or miniatures, and editing. There must be a minimum PDV expenditure in Australia of $5 million.


I believe it is now time for the government to consider the introduction of conditions to be applied about the smoking content of any production before government funding is provided. It is also time to seriously investigate the application of such constraints to overseas productions filmed in Australia. Classification is also worthy of exploration. The 2009 World Health Organisation report Smoke-free movies: from evidence to action suggested that all future movies with scenes of smoking should be given an adult rating, with the possible exception of movies that reflect the dangers of smoking use or that depict a figure from history who smoked.


The Cancer Council, in their last position paper in 2007, pointed to the benefits of international regulations such as the inclusion of a requirement for all movie credits to include certification of no pay-offs or 'no inducements' and the banning of tobacco brand depictions in movies. The Cancer Council have also suggested counteradvertising, such as the use of control advertisements, as an effective measure to counter smoking in movies. Control advertisements would be played immediately after or before a movie that depicts smoking in either cinema or DVD format. An ideal outcome would be for the film and media industry to be part of the movement to remove portrayals of smoking in movies and the media. I note that several commercially successful films such as The Devil Wears Prada, Casino Royale and The Hangover do not portray tobacco or tobacco related products.


Labor governments have actively targeted tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship in an attempt to improve the health and wellbeing of all Australians. I applaud the government for that. I applaud the government for its world-first tobacco plain-packaging laws, and I want to say in this debate on matters of public interest that I intend to encourage the government to take even more action in the areas that I have outlined to eradicate these insidious and deadly products from the lives of all Australians.

Senator Brandis:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order. You should ask the minister to be directly relevant to the question. The question asked the minister to confirm whether certain figures were true. She has responded by saying that the figures in the budget papers are accurate. She has now gone on to engage in her usual ritualised abuse of the opposition. That cannot bear directly upon the question of whether a given figure is accurate or not.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:16):  As the senator would know, the economic forecasts are undertaken on the advice of Treasury.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator WONG:
  I will take the interjection from the other side that called them a guess. Who they are impugning are the officers of Treasury, the people who advised Mr Costello. You might like to have a go at public servants who are not here to defend themselves! It is true that revenue has not come back for a number of budgets as fast as originally considered by the Treasury. You have seen a number of speeches by the Treasurer and by the head of Treasury which go to some of the structural reasons driving that. If Senator Cormann believes he could have been ahead of that curve, he certainly did not say anything at the time. 


In terms of the return to surplus, I make this point: we have chosen to make savings to protect the surplus. In other words, the nearly $34 billion worth of savings in this budget are put in place not just to ensure any new expenditure is offset but so there is a substantial net savings position, which is all about protecting the bottom line because we are determined to bring the budget back to surplus not just in 2012-13 but also beyond.


Mr President, you will see the results of those decisions which are not only a surplus in this coming financial year but surpluses building over time. Our forecasts are broadly in line, certainly in terms of GDP, with those of the RBA and the IMF. I have made the point previously that, in terms of global growth, the Treasury estimates of what is occurring in Europe are probably more conservative than the International Monetary Fund's.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:19):  I make the point that the drivers behind what is occurring with revenue—as outlined by the Treasurer and others in the Treasury and in the budget papers—are in part structural and in part cyclical. As the senator would know, being a senator from Western Australia, we are in a very strong investment phase in the resources industry, a very capital intensive industry investing very heavily at the moment. By dint of that, for a given amount of economic activity, you will not see the same level of revenue that you would if that economic activity was focused on high levels of production. So the budget papers go through a very detailed discussion of what is occurring in relation to revenue. I say again that this government has demonstrated its determination to return the budget to surplus by making savings to protect the bottom line, something that as yet Senator Cormann has never been able to achieve with his colleagues.

We will do what we have done over the last budget, this budget and the mid-year review, which is to make savings to protect the surplus. But I am asked about promises. Perhaps Senator Cormann can remind everybody in this place that he said very explicitly: 


We will not proceed with any of Labor's other promises that they have attached to the mining tax.


He ruled out using any MRRT revenue. Too bad—you have been dumped on that, haven't you? The Leader of the Opposition says he is going to support the family tax benefit increases which are funded from the mining tax. That is completely inconsistent with what Senator Cormann said, completely inconsistent with the way in which those Western Australian senators on that side have campaigned against the mining tax. All of a sudden, magically, that revenue is good enough to use. It was not good enough for a company tax cut, but it is good enough for family tax benefits.

 (Victoria—Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (15:02):  On 22 March, Senator Waters asked me a question about the Bimblebox Nature Refuge. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The answer read as follows—





QUESTION



Does the federal government still agree that Bimblebox is an area of high conversation value?




RESPONSE



Yes. The Australian government provided funding for the Bimblebox Nature Refuge through the National Heritage Trust for inclusion in the National Reserve System (NRS), in recognition of the property's excellent condition and high biodiversity values.


The addition of Bimblebox to the NRS increased the level of protection in the under-represented Desert Uplands bioregion from 3.08 per cent to 3.20 per cent and the Alice Tablelands sub region from 4.26 per cent to 4.54 per cent. Sites within the property contain the greatest understorey floristic biodiversity for Poplar Box Woodland and Silver Leaf Ironbark (vegetation communities listed as ""of concern"" under Queensland legislation) within the under-represented Desert Uplands bioregion.


National environment law does not give the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities the power to decide mining leases or to make commercial decisions on mining proposals. National environment law does, however, protect certain species relevant to the Bimblebox Nature Refuge, such as the endangered Black-Throated Finch, the endangered Star Finch and the vulnerable Squatter Pigeon. The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Com­munities will not approve any proposal that will have an unacceptable impact on any of these species or any other matter protected under national environment law.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (15:02):  I move:


That the Senate take note of answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to the 2012-13 Budget.


Here we have it again: another year, another increase in borrowings; another year, yet more put on the national credit card. Year after year, in all my time here, we have seen government ministers come in here and make devout promises, putting their hand on the Bible and swearing these forecasts are correct, swearing that it will all be better next year. But what we have seen year after year is nothing but rhetoric. These are all empty promises. What we heard from the Treasurer in the other place last night will again be proven to be nothing but an empty promise. This government, when it comes to managing the nation's accounts, has absolutely no credibility. In the words of Senator Wong this afternoon, she had determination to deliver these results; but results speak louder than any determination or any contrived commitment to serious management of the nation's finances. Labor's achievements in this regard are truly extraordinary. What we have seen after the budget tabled last night is a tally of $174 billion in deficits over only four years of Labor budgets. They have turned net assets into net debt of $145 billion.


At this point I would like to take up the issue raised by Senator Joyce with Senator Wong this afternoon about net versus gross debt. Net debt is an important comparison, but what the government does not want to explain when it talks about net debt and when it offsets the gross borrowings mainly with the Future Fund—a fund created by the former coalition government, I hasten to add—is that the Future Fund is already taken into account when we look at other liabilities the Commonwealth owes. If you want a fair comparison, taking into account the assets held in the Future Fund and other Commonwealth assets, you should also look at the other liabilities of the Commonwealth. But that is not what this government actually wants to talk about. This government wants to count the Future Fund twice, and it does that by trying to pretend that the superannuation liabilities that the Future Fund was set up to cover are not being in any way considered when we take into account net debt. That is a very important point, because to every Australian taxpayer those superannuation liabilities are just as due and we are just as liable for them as any bond issued by the Commonwealth and held by the latest overseas investor that has funnelled the money into this government. The point that Senator Joyce raises is very important. You cannot count the Future Fund twice and net it off against gross debt without taking into account the liabilities for which it was set up to fund and has not yet done so completely. 


In the current financial year alone, the government's forecast has been shown to be completely without basis in reality. Less than 18 months ago we heard that the current financial year was going to have a $12 billion deficit. A year ago this week it was going to be $22 billion. Last December it was going to be $37 billion. It was going to be $44 billion as of last night. God only knows what it is going to be by 30 June, because if we keep running up that scale it will get into the high-forty billions, because this government is simply unable to manage the nation's accounts. 


We are paying $8 billion a year in interest. It works out at $22 million a day that we are paying in interest—not for what great leaders like Sir Henry Bolte might have done, in building freeways and national assets, but merely to have funded the cash splash and the electoral bribes this government is so enamoured with. There is a better way to look at the $22 million a day. Everyone should put a jar in their home kitchen and every day, every member of their family should put a $1 coin in it. It is costing a dollar a day from every Australian just to service the interest bill that this government has run up. And that is not a dollar a day that you can put towards a holiday, to paying off the mortgage or to something you might buy. That is a dollar a day purely to fund and service the debt this government has created. It is an extraordinary level of debt. 


Of course, today we heard the catch-all excuse: the global financial crisis, the excuse that keeps on giving. Indeed, a cynic might wonder that today from Senator Wong we actually heard a bit of a warm up, a bit of a simmer of the global financial crisis excuse. I bet that this time next year, if you are still in office, we will be hearing that again. Something happens and the government will always find an excuse. Well, this government is out of excuses. No-one believes you. No-one believes this government will deliver a surplus. It will not be in office to do so. And we will never see the final accounts. This government has got a track record of debt, deficit and deceit.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (15:07):  In taking note of answers given to questions without notice today, what those on the other side obviously fail to understand is that this is a budget for working Australians. It is not a budget just for a few select people out in the community, which is what those on the other side want and are always pushing. This budget is about spreading the benefits of the boom so that all corners of the country benefit from it, not just one single state or one single area. It is going to bring much-needed new financial relief to families and businesses that have been under pressure. There are a number of ways we are going to do that and I will talk about them in a minute. 


We are returning to surplus on time and as promised, and those on the other side just cannot deal with that. They just do not want to deal with it. They have got a huge mental block when it comes to accepting that we are actually managing to do that and will achieve it. What that does is put paid to their last few years of argument that we could not do it, so they have to stand up and oppose it. I notice that Senator Bushby is still in the chamber. I would like to know what Senator Bushby thinks he is going to say to all those families that he wants to deny the Schoolkids Bonus to. I would like to know what Senator Abetz is going to say to all those Tasmanian families. In fact, Mr Deputy President, I would like to know what you are going to say to all those families that your government is denying cash to—that is, the $410 for each child in primary school or $820 for each child in high school under the Schoolkids Bonus. 


I do not know whether opposition senators are aware that there are 34,800 families in Tasmania that expect to receive some of that income, and 30,600 families in Tasmania are currently missing out on the education tax refund, which the Schoolkids Bonus is replacing. It is replacing it for a reason. It is because people were not claiming what they were entitled to. Families are struggling. We know families are struggling. We want to help those families. The best way we can help those families is through the education process and making it easier for them so they do not have to save their receipts, so they do not have to put in paperwork and so they can get the money upfront. I challenge the opposition senators from Tasmania, in particular, to stand up in front of those families and go to those schools and tell them that they are going to deny those families and those children the cash that they could use to help with their education, whether it be music lessons, excursions or whatever.


I was bitterly disappointed to hear the other night an implication that parents would waste the money, that they would not spend it on their children's education. But I am absolutely certain that when the baby bonus came in and members of the opposition were asked about people receiving it their argument was that they did not really care what people spent the money on; they just wanted people to have the money. So I do not understand the hypocrisy, meanness of spirit and the distrust of families and of the parents of these children by the opposition, claiming that they will spend the money on other things and that it will not be spent on education.


One of the benefits of the surplus is obviously that it will protect low- and middle-income Australians and those in the community most vulnerable. It will do that through things like the aged-care reform, the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the blitz that we are going to have on the dental waiting lists as well. We will achieve a surplus, despite the global uncertainty. We will deliver a surplus in a targeted and responsible way, with targeted and respon­sible savings that help, as I said, those low- and middle-income Australians.


Since the budget the Liberals have once again revealed their true colours. They continue to work against working families in Australia. To those senators from Tasmania on the other side who continue to work against those working families in Tasmania I say: you really need to hang your heads in shame. I am nearly speechless trying to think of the words to use when those people in Tasmania who you and I represent— (Time expired)

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2012-05-09,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:12):  I also rise to take note of answers by government senators to questions from coalition senators. I listened with great interest to Senator Bilyk and I noted the challenges that she made in talking about how last night they delivered a budget for working Australians. This budget is all politics. It is a political budget. It is a budget that is determined to save a government with deep internal divisions and leadership instability. It is a government that is in trouble, and the thing that a government in trouble does when it starts panicking is splash money around.


Everybody knows, as Senator Bilyk rightly points out, that people like it if you offer money to them. They think that is a great thing. But it is incumbent on government to be responsible in how it spends taxpayer money. It needs to be able to use the fiscal tools it has available to it to try to create an economic environment in which business can thrive, wealth can be created, jobs can be created, people can get jobs and money can move around. In an overall sense, they need to grow the cake so that everybody has an opportunity to partake in a strong economy, get a good, secure job and be able to look after themselves and their families. Irresponsible decisions such as when govern­ments take great slabs of money and throw it all around in a desperate attempt to cling on to power in the falling days of their govern­ment just do not cut it. It smacks of political desperation. There is a lack of any coherence in this budget and a lack of any narrative, which suggests that this government does not have an ongoing, long-term plan to put Australia on a long-term, stable economic footing.


The senator also talked about returning to surplus on time. She seemed to be labouring under the misapprehension that the government has actually delivered a surplus. But the fact is that all that happened last night was that the Treasurer handed down a piece of paper that predicted a surplus which we will not know about until about September next year, at which time the election will have come and gone and the Australian people will have had no opportunity to determine whether that surplus was delivered.


Looking at the Labor Party's record on surpluses, even under the current term of this Labor government since 2007 the Labor government have handed down surplus predictions. The Treasurer has stood up in parliament in the other place and said, 'We will deliver a surplus.' Has he? No. In fact, it has been something like 23 years since the Labor Party have actually delivered a surplus, despite predicting a surplus on more than one occasion while in government. There is a world of difference between the Treasurer standing up in the other place and saying, 'We will deliver a surplus on time,' and delivering that in actual fact. Before we know whether a surplus will be delivered, we need to see how much money came in and how much was spent. If you look at just the current year, they started off predicting a $12 billion deficit. That has blown out over the course of MYEFO and other updates to a current fiscal position as of last night of a $44 billion deficit. As Senator Ryan said, goodness knows what that will actually be when we find out what it is in the end. It is on a massive upwards trajectory. It is likely to be in the 50s.


So when the Treasurer stood up last night and said, 'We are returning to surplus on time,' and when Senator Bilyk stands up in this place and says it, it is laughable that anyone would believe it. Their record shows that anything they predict will fail to be delivered. Just in this current year they have a black hole of over $20 billion in their budget. They have a $22 billion black hole in their budget.


That leads to the next issue I want to raise, and that is, as the minister was discussing, the increase in the debt limit. We have gone from $75 billion to $150 billion to $200 billion to $250 billion—and now we have to go up to $300 billion. You do not need to increase your borrowing limit if you are spending less than you earn. If you are spending less than the amount of money that is coming in, you do not need to ask for a bigger overdraft. It is just farcical. It is an admission on the government's own part when they say, 'We need to increase the debt limit,' that they do not expect that the $1.5 billion will actually be delivered. They are building in, hidden amongst the appropria­tion bills, this $50 billion increase in the hope that nobody will notice it, because they acknowledge themselves that their debt will go higher.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (15:17):  I do wish to make a contribution to today's debate but, before I do, I want to say that I have read a number of articles in the newspapers lately and it is amazing but there is a common theme that comes out of them, and that is, 'Be careful of what the Liberals say and what the Liberals will do.' Listening to the contributions coming from Senator Ryan and Senator Bushby today, I am absolutely confused. I hear Senator Bushby talking about jobs. I hear Senator Bushby talking about creating employment oppor­tunities. This would be the same Senator Bushby who voted against the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan, the program that kept thousands and thousands of Australians employed through the global financial crisis.


I will not say that the contribution from Senator Ryan was hysterical because it was anything but. To hear Senator Ryan talking about nation-building stuff, you might think the global financial crisis was something that we made up. For goodness sake! I do not know how far the silver spoon was shoved into Senator Ryan's mouth but if he did not realise just how close we were to recession through those last couple of years of 2009 and 2010 then I do not know what planet he was on. It is absolutely ridiculous that we have that side of the chamber bagging the living daylights out of us. They are bagging us because we spend money to create employment, bagging us because we stimulate the economy to keep people employed, bagging us because we made a massive injection of some $16.2 billion during that terrible financial time in order to keep business people employed and to build fantastic facilities for generations of young Australians to come. Here is the rub: I have been to the opening of probably 50 or 60 buildings under the Building the Education Revolution, which was a federal Labor government initiative, and, holy be, who is in the crowd getting their photos taken? Have one guess.




Senator Bilyk:
  Who? You tell us!




Senator STERLE:
  The member for Canning, Mr Don Randall, has been at every single one. Good on you, Don! He voted against them, but that does not matter. What an insult!


Getting back to the budget: as we have been clearly told, the government is returning the budget to surplus. In one breath, we have the Liberals, ably assisted by the Nationals, bagging us for spending money to create opportunity and employ­ment and telling us we are spending too much money. In the next breath, remem­bering that the government is going to deliver a surplus next year, they condemn us for not spending money. The sad thing is that, year in, year out, we have to go through this nonsense, this charade. We bring down budgets, year in, year out, and we have the same old argument. The other side of the political fence condemns every opportunity and every positive that is created by the government, but the social side actually congratulates the government, because this budget will share the benefits of the boom.


As everyone knows, I come from a mining state and I fully support the mining industry. I have never said anything else. But the sad part, Mr Deputy President, is that your colleagues from Western Australian are hypocritical. We know that in Western Australia there are two speeds. There is absolutely no doubt that we have a patchwork economy. We have an industry that is thriving—it is bubbling along—and that is employing a lot of Australians, not just Western Australians. We have industries that hang off the mining industry. If they are lucky enough to be servicing the mining industry or to be otherwise involved in the mining industry, they are doing well too. But the boom is a double-edged sword and there are many industries in Western Australia that really are suffering because of it. They are suffering because they are losing experienced people. They cannot compete with the wages that are being paid in the mining industry. We have industries, such as my old industry, in which trucking families have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars on building companies but have trucks parked at the back of the yard against the fence, not because they are not paying the right money but because they cannot compete. Let us look at aged-care facilities. Who would cook in an aged-care facility for $30,000 a year when you could get $130,000 at a mine? (Time expired)

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2012-05-09,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (15:22):  I will begin with Senator Sterle's comments about jobs. It is quite amazing that the reduction in company tax is no longer there. Let me quote the Prime Minister:


If you are against cutting company tax, you are against economic growth. If you are against economic growth, then you are against jobs.


Those were the words of the Prime Minister. She is obviously against jobs because the government is not going to cut the company tax rate. I am sorry to see that Senator Sterle is leaving the chamber, because I want to talk about the treatment of the transport industry in this budget.


Mr Deputy President, as you know, when the GST came in on 1 July 2000, 18½c of excise per litre was returned to the truckies. Of the 38c excise, truckies paid a road user charge of 19½c and the remaining 18½c went back to the them. Now the truckies are going to get only 12½c back. This government has taken 6c a litre from every truckie in Australia. That will apply to any truck with a tare weight of 4½ tonnes or more. The transport industry uses eight billion litres of diesel a year, so that 6c equates to an extra $480 million. That is how much tax the government is adding to our transport industry. But it gets worse: on 1 July 2014 the Labor government's carbon tax is going to add almost 7c a litre to the truckies' diesel tax. That will be another $515 million on top of the $480 million—$1 billion extra a year in diesel tax on our truckies, the people who carry our nation. Yet the government says it is creating jobs. Of course, regional Australia will be the worst affected by this. The town where I live does not have a railway line. Everything comes in on the road; all our exports, our cattle from abattoirs and our wheat all go out on the road. It is a tax on regional Australia especially.


Talking about the budget, we will never see this amazing $1.5 billion surplus. We will probably have an election in August next year before the real figures are released in September next year, because the figures will show the budget in the red because the government will be borrowing again. The government has said that it is allowing for an extra $39 billion increase in revenue. It is not going to get that. It will not get an extra $39 billion. We have a five per cent deterioration in our terms of trade, business is quiet—of course the mining industry is doing well in some areas, but retail sales are quiet—and regional Australia is doing it tough, especially in those areas that do not have mines. That money will not come in.


According to the budget two years ago, the government was going to borrow $12 billion. Twelve months ago that had become more than $22 billion. Six months ago it went to $37 billion. Now, as we found out yesterday, it has gone to $44 billion that is going to be borrowed in this financial year alone. To have budgeted two years ago to borrow $12 billion and have it now come in at $44 billion is not even a good guess. That is not projecting budget forecasts or being anywhere close to forecasts; it is simply a bad guess. That is why the Australian people do not trust this government. They do not trust this government because of its broken promises on the carbon tax, they do not trust it because of its waste of money on school buildings, pink batts and the so-called stimulus package—job creating programs that have led us into this much debt and that have of course had a huge effect on raising interest rates over that period. If we are going to have a budget surplus of $1.5 billion, why are we raising the credit limit to $300 billion? Senator Joyce asked Senator Wong what would be the gross dollar amount at which it would peak. Would it be $278 billion? Would it be $290 billion? We could not get an answer. That is nothing unusual from Senator Wong. Tell us the truth. Let the Australian people know the truth.


We know your history of managing money. Throughout my life I have seen that every time a Labor government has been elected in a state or here in Canberra it has sent us broke. No mistake; it happens all the time, and this government is no exception. It is amazing that road funding is going to be reduced by so much. The government is taking money out of roads but talks about looking after infrastructure and productivity. This budget will never deliver a surplus. In September 2013 we will find out the real facts.

 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (15:33):  I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:


That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review) Bill 2012, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.


I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The statement read as follows—





STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 2012 WINTER SITTINGS





HEALTH INSURANCE AMENDMENT (PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVIEW) BILL





Purpose of the Bill 



The purpose of the bill is to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 (the Act) to improve the efficiency of the Professional Services Review (PSR) Scheme and broaden its scope by:


clarifying administrative arrangements and streamlining the peer review process; 


including services rendered or initiated by allied health practitioners within the scope of the Scheme;


authorising the Determining Authority to consider matters that are required to be referred to Medicare Participating Review Committees (MPRC) and impose equivalent sanctions; and


retrospectively validating actions taken in relation to PSR matters that have  been brought into question as a result of the Full Federal Court's decision in Kutlu v Director of Professional Services Review ('Kutlu').  


The bill would also enable the Director of the PSR agency to re-refer matters to a new PSR Committee process if the person under review has successfully challenged a previous PSR process on the grounds that a person was not validly appointed as a PSR Panel member or Deputy Director.  The PSR is a scheme set up under Part VAA of the Act to protect the integrity of the Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits programs.




Reasons for Urgency



The bill is necessary to retrospectively validate actions taken under the Act and any flow on acts that have been brought into question as a result of the Full Federal Court's decision in Kutlu. In Kutlu the Court held that failing to consult with the Australian Medical Association as required by the Act invalidated appointments of a number of PSR Panel Members and Deputy Directors and all PSR processes involving the invalidly appointed Panel members and Deputy Directors.  The validating provisions of the bill will not affect the rights and liabilities of parties to proceedings for which leave to appeal to the High Court has been granted before the bill is assented to, if the validity of PSR Panel member or Deputy Director appointments is in issue in those proceedings.


If the bill does not pass Parliament by the end of the 2012 Winter sittings, there is a risk that further litigation may proceed and any PSR decisions before the court may be ruled invalid and may expose the Commonwealth to further costs.

      (iii)   that leading experts believe the loss of the Tripa forest could lead to the local extinction of Sumatran orang-utans by the end of 2012, and international primate experts such as Ms Jane Goodall and Mr Richard Leakey have called for the protection of the Tripa forest,

      (vi)   while the Indonesian Government has launched a police investigation into the criminal activity in the area, palm oil companies continue to illegally clear protected forest, a process that has destroyed countless livelihoods,


      (vii)   Australia is a significant consumer of palm oil from South East Asia, particularly Indonesia, as Australia imports 130 000 tonnes of palm oil each year,

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2012-05-09,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (17:49):  The Gillard government's budget is indeed a budget of cooked books, with the toxic carbon tax as its centrepiece and with yet more debt. Before I make any observations about last night's budget, let me make this observation about what has just happened in the Senate. When it comes to spending taxpayers' money as fast as possible, this Labor government has no shame. This Labor government has no shame when it comes to getting taxpayers' dollars out the door as quickly as possible. What just happened is the first step, the first instalment, in executing Labor's cooking of the books. What just happened was all about helping this dodgy Labor government deceive the Australian people, make the Australian people believe that somehow there will be a genuine surplus in 2012-13, when of course when it is all said and done there is certainly no prospect of there being anything near a budget surplus delivered by this Labor government.


This budget does nothing to strengthen our economy in the face of serious economic storm clouds on the global horizon. In fact it does not cut spending and it does increase taxes, and of course it lifts the debt ceiling yet again to $300 billion. And of course it does impose the world's largest carbon tax on the Australian people—a tax which we were promised we would not get, which will push up the cost of living, which will make Australia less competitive internationally, which will increase the cost of doing business in Australia, which will cost jobs and which will impose all those economic sacrifices on the people of Australia without doing anything whatsoever to reduce emissions either on a global level or here in Australia.


In the budget tabled by the Treasurer last night there is no consistent economic strategy and there is no specific focus on increasing our productivity and international competitiveness. It was a traditional Labor budget—a budget with more spending, more taxes and more debt. The government this time around promised that it would deliver a surplus in 2012-13. Minister Shorten this morning was getting a bit ahead of himself—he was already saying at a breakfast with about 600 accountants that the government had delivered a surplus, that the budget was now back in surplus. Of course I had to remind Minister Shorten this morning, as I remind Labor senators in this chamber, that, no, this government has not delivered a surplus; this government has not got the budget back into surplus—all this government has done is promise a surplus, because right now we are of course in a massive deficit situation. 


Let me talk for a moment about what we do know about where our public finances are at. We know that in this financial year, according to the budget tabled last night, our deficit will be $44.4 billion. That is quite staggering. There are still six weeks to go in this financial year, so who knows how much more spending they can rack up on the nation's credit card in this last six weeks. I just reflect on the fact that when this government went to the last election, when it released its pre-election economic and fiscal outlook, we were told that the deficit this financial year would be $10.4 billion—and $10.4 billion is already a very serious deficit. It is clearly evidence of a government that does not know how to live within its means, that does not know how to manage money, that does not know how to manage public finances carefully; $10.4 billion is a very serious deficit in anyone's imagination.


Within three months of that statement having been made by the Labor Party before the last election, the deficit for this financial year had gone to $12.3 billion and by the time of the budget last year it was a deficit of $22.6 billion. By the time of the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, just before Christmas last year, it was a deficit of $37.1 billion, and now it is going to be a staggering deficit of $44.4 billion. That is a blow-out in the deficit for this financial year of more than $34 billion since the last election. How can anyone take seriously what this government says when it tries to make us believe that somehow in 2012-13 it will deliver a wafer-thin surplus of $1.5 billion. Of course it will not. 


The government has used every accounting trick in the book to make it look like it will deliver a surplus in 2012-13. It has shifted expenditure from 2012-13 to 2011-12. Shifting expenditure for next financial year into this financial year is not a spending cut in 2012-13—it is cooking the books to create the illusion that there will be a surplus, to make people believe something that is not there, to deceive the Australian people yet again. People across Australia understand that this is what is being done. People across Australia are not being fooled by this. People across Australia know that this is a government that over the last four budgets has delivered $174 billion worth of accumulated deficits. People across Australia know that this government inherited a strong budget position. This government inherited a budget with no government net debt and with a $22 billion surplus. The government inherited a budget position where we had invested $60 billion in accumulated surpluses in the Future Fund, in order to cover the expense of future Public Service superannuation liabilities. And what has this reckless, incompetent, weak, divided and dysfunctional government done? They have been spending like drunken sailors. They have not been able to balance the books in a single budget so far when they have had to deliver a budget outcome, despite having benefited from the best terms of trade in 140 years and despite having imposed more than 20 new and ad hoc taxes on the people of Australia.


This is not the only thing the Labor Party have done to cook the books. They have done the shifting of spending from this year into next year, rather than cut spending. They have also done the typical Labor Party trick where they have included the most optimistic revenue growth forecasts in 25 years. This Treasurer has a habit of making overly optimistic revenue growth forecasts. To take you back a couple of months to the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook just before Christmas, the government downgraded their GDP growth forecasts and, at the same time, they massively upgraded the expectation of revenue from company tax receipts. Of course it did not make sense and, sure enough, what happened? The revenue did not come in according to expectations. The revenue was lower than expectations because the Treasurer's expectations were wildly excessive and wildly overoptimistic. And when that eventually came out the Treasurer threw his hands up in the air and said, 'The revenue's been falling away. The revenue is not what we thought it would be.' Of course it was never going to be and a prudent government, a government that manages our public finances properly plans for this. 


So what has the government done in this budget? The government wants us to believe that between this year and next year government revenue will increase by a staggering 11.8 per cent or $39 billion. The government wants us to believe that revenue will increase to about $369 billion, even though the terms of trade have been downgraded to 5¾ per cent and even though our GDP growth is still expected to be only 3¼ per cent. We have not seen this sort of revenue growth in more than 25 years. At that time we were experiencing significantly stronger growth in the terms of trade. 


There is much I could say about this budget but let me conclude by saying this. This is a typical Labor budget. It is a spend, tax, high-debt budget. It is a budget for which generations of Australians will have to pay for many years to come. Of course, already in this budget many Australians are being asked to pay the price for the reckless and wasteful spending of this bad Labor administration over the last four and a bit years.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2012-05-09,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (18:13):  This matter of public importance this evening is a perfect irony because it mentions the words 'cooked books'. Who wrote the book on accounting tricks? Who made an art form of fiddling the figures? Who are the patrons of nobbling the numbers in this country? If you go to the encyclopaedia and look up the term 'cooked books', four words appear—'Liberal Party of Australia'. That is the definition in the encyclopaedia of 'cooked books'. Some people may say I am taking a partisan critical view of the Liberal Party and that is understandable. I am not the biggest advocate of Liberal Party policies, I must say. But do not take it from me; take it from the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the independent body established by the accounting profession in this country to self-regulate accountants and auditors, to ensure that the people of Australia can trust and have faith in accounting, in accounting practices and in accounting firms.


What was the view of the Institute of Chartered Accountants regarding the Liberal Party of Australia and their election costings? Their view was simple. They fined the Liberal Party of Australia's accountants $5,000 each—two partners—for breaches of professional standards. One may ask how this situation came about. How did it come to pass that the Liberal Party of Australia's accountants received fines for breaches of professional standards? It is quite simple. They received fines because they agreed to audit the Liberal Party of Australia's election costings at the 2010 election. They agreed to produce a work of fiction, to produce a fantasy, to dress it up as reality. In fact, they were hoodwinked by Joe Hockey, they were hoodwinked by Andrew Robb and they were hoodwinked by the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott.


It is incumbent upon me to explain the circumstances under which the Liberal Party of Australia received these fines from the Institute of Chartered Accountants. At the last election, when it came time to submit their election costings to Treasury—a process which they are again opposing and refusing to do for the people of Australia—they came up $11 billion short. It was not $11 million, it was not $111 million, it was not $1 billion but $11 billion. There was an $11 billion black hole in their election costings.


Can you imagine it if a large corporation, if a managed investment scheme, if a superannuation trust produced accounts that were $11 billion in the red and tried to dress them up as if they had balanced the books? Any shareholder, any investor, any superannuation member would be livid, they would be angry. Importantly, they would want the person to be prosecuted. What was the view of Andrew Robb prior to the last election when the process of submitting election costings was criticised by the government, by Treasury and by the media? As the shadow finance minister, Andrew Robb's comment was, talking about their accountants:


If they make a mistake with the auditing of accounts for companies or prospectuses or mislead, they are at risk of being punished and going to jail.


They nearly did. The Liberal Party of Australia's accountants nearly went to jail because they teamed up with the Liberal Party and attempted to dress up these figures which were shown not to be election costings and say that they were an audited set of accounts. What did the Institute of Chartered Accountants find in respect of the fictional work produced by the Liberal Party? They imposed the fines on the Liberal Party's accountants because their costings of coalition policies failed to contain 'a statement that the procedures performed do not constitute either an audit or a review'. That was the view of the independent Institute of Chartered Accountants, the body set up by the accounting profession to self-regulate and ensure that the Australian people have trust and confidence in audited accounts in this country. The Liberal Party failed. The Liberal Party let down the people of Australia.


Prior to that they were saying that the people of Australia can have trust and confidence in their accounts, that the Liberal Party's figures can be trusted. In fact, Joe Hockey, the shadow Treasurer at the time said:


You know what? If the fifth-biggest accounting firm in Australia signs off on our numbers it is a brave person to start saying there are accounting tricks. I tell you it is audited. This is an audited statement.'


They were the words of the shadow Treasurer of Her Majesty's opposition. Then of course the independent Institute of Chartered Accountants found that to be a lie, found that to be a furphy, found that to be a work of fiction. It was not the case at all. The Liberal Party managed to convince—probably reluctantly—a poor firm of small business people, accountants, to sign off on a set of accounts that obviously were not audited books. This is the approach that those opposite take to our nation's finances. They come in here and have the hide and the temerity to criticise this government for delivering a budget surplus, for delivering a set of social programs and for delivering a pathway to economic growth that is fully costed and covered by the revenues in the forward estimates. They claim to be an alternative government, when in reality they are not.


Do not take it from me. Take it from Laura Tingle, writing in the Financial Review on 3 September 2010, in response to this trickery by those opposite in seeking to produce audited accounts to the Australian public in 2010. She said:


… they are liars and clunkheads.


But whatever the combination, they are not fit to govern.


That was the view of Laura Tingle, writing in the Financial Review in 2010 in the wake of this trickery by the Liberal Party of Australia in trying to deceive the Australian public into believing that their election costings would balance the books. Now they are trying to fit up the Australian public again. They come in here and criticise this government for producing a balanced budget, for producing costings covering all of the expenditure items in the forward year and the forward estimates, but they will not indicate to the Australian people how they intend to fund any of these reckless promises that they are making in their election commitments.


We find, through leaks from the shadow cabinet, that they are planning $70 billion worth of cuts to programs and services in this country. I believe, as a representative of New South Wales, that the people of my state have the right to know how the alternative government in this country is going to meet that $70 billion cut in services. Where will the cuts come from? Perhaps some of those opposite who speak after me can enlighten the Senate and the Australian public: which programs are you intending to cut from the federal budget? Will it be the childcare rebate? Will it be the increases to superannuation and retirement incomes that are programmed as part of this government's commitment to retirement incomes and workers? Will it be the increases in the pensions that are foreshadowed in this budget? Will it be the family tax benefit increases that are a crucial part of this federal government's budget? Why won't they and why can't they explain to the Australian people what cuts they are going to make to services and programs in our economy?


When the Leader of the Opposition replies to the budget on Thursday evening, we will get the same trickery, the same platitudes, the same rhetoric about being able to balance the budget, to deliver all these programs that they are promising whilst at the same time getting rid of the minerals resource rent tax and removing the carbon-pricing legislation yet somehow managing to meet their commitment to reduce carbon emissions in our economy by five per cent. Quite simply, they are not fit to manage our economy. They are not fit to manage the local corner store, let alone a $330 billion economy, with the faith and trust of the Australian people.


This week the Labor government delivered the budget, and it is a solid financial and economic management process to manage our economy back to a system of long-term growth, a system that will ensure that, as we reach that long-term growth trajectory, we do so in a non-inflationary manner, we do so by protecting jobs and we do so by promoting investment in our economy. The budget sets out a $1.5 billion surplus over this year, growing to $7.5 billion by 2015-16—again a process of transition to growth over a period of time coming off the back of the write-down in revenue that occurred because of the global financial crisis.


Our policies will iron out the ripples in industry composition of growth, ensuring that the right conditions are in place for non-mining sectors to share in the growth of the minerals boom. We are doing this of course through the minerals resource rent tax, diverting some of the superprofits that are made by these companies back into retirement incomes, into rural and regional infrastructure and into support for small businesses.


In this budget there is plenty of support for small business. From 2012-13 companies will be able to carry back tax losses of up to $1 million so they can get a refund against the tax that they have previously paid. From 1 July they will be able to immediately write off capital equipment expenditure in a particular year up to the value of $6,500. That is met with an instant write-off on vehicles up to the value of $5,000 in the year 2012-13. We have got an agreement through COAG to reduce red tape and we are working through that process with the various state governments. And of course we are rolling out the National Broadband Network, which will see improvements in productivity and ways of doing business in this country.


Last week I was fortunate to travel to Luke Hartsuyker's electorate of Cowper on the North Coast, where I met with representatives of Coffs Harbour City Council. They were telling me how overwhelmingly supportive they were of the Labor Party's program to roll out the NBN. They could not wait for the NBN to come to the North Coast of New South Wales. They get it: they see the advantages that will come in investment. Already, creative industries are beginning to set up in the Coffs Harbour area, in that local government area. Finally, when they have the NBN, those businesses will be able to thrive because they will not have to be based in Sydney. They will have the broadband capacity to send digital files that are produced in those regional areas to Sydney and to Melbourne. They see the job creation opportunities. They have produced a program called Coffs Connect, and they are ready. They are ready to sign up and be part of this revolution that will occur in the digital economy in Australia because of the National Broadband Network. They understand the productivity improvements that will be made because of this important economic program.


The budget contains a wealth of support for families over the coming 12 months and in the forward estimates. The family tax benefit A will be increased from 1 July 2013. That will benefit 1.1 million families in this country. The supplementary allowance will increase by $210 for singles and by $350 for couples. The schoolkids bonus, which we are just about to debate in this chamber, will provide much-needed relief for parents as they meet the costs of sending their kids to school. There are tax cuts for families. There is an increase in the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $18,000. There are increases in pensions programmed in from 1 July this year. As well as that we are meeting our commitment to deliver a national disability insurance scheme. We are boosting the amount of funding going to aged care and increasing the number of aged-care places in our economy as our population ages.


We are continuing our investments in rural and regional infrastructure in this country. We are pushing up retirement incomes and of course we are doing this in the context of growing our economy.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2012-05-09,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (18:28):  We are getting towards the middle of the year, towards Christmas in July. There are only three things I wish for Christmas in July. Wish No. 1 is for the Labor Party to keep Julia Gillard as the Prime Minister. They must keep Julia Gillard as the Prime Minister. Wish No. 2 is that the carbon tax must remain the Labor Party's central plank, their central policy. Wish No. 3 is that they must continue to tell people that having $300 billion hocked up on the nation's credit card is not a problem. If I can have all three wishes, I will be a happy person but will not be in opposition for much longer. The only thing I could think of that would be better than that is if they were to make Craig Thomson Australian of the Year, but I do not think that is going to happen. This is really a statement about the complete financial ineptitude of this government and showing the Australian people just how ludicrous it has become.


I woke up this morning and heard that France has elected a socialist Prime Minister who is going to remove himself from the austerity measures that had been negotiated, and therefore the whole austerity plan in Europe is looking like it is going to fall over. I found out that Greece is one step worse—they do not even appear to really have a government at this current time. And the Germans do not seem too keen to keep on bailing people out. Then I read in our own budget papers that we are talking about an 11 per cent increase in our revenue streams. This is marvellous! It is a heroic outcome! Then we see that, as always, they are trying to sneak through the debt. It is easy for people to understand that, if you owe money, you must pay it back. There are no tricks to this. I tried. I thought: 'Maybe I should give them the benefit of the doubt. Today I will ask the finance minister of the Commonwealth of Australia a very simple question that any person who has any basic understanding of commerce and finance would understand, which is: what is your peak debt position?' Any person working in a bank will tell you that that is a fundamental question for any credit paper: what is the peak debt position? The minister's answer is there for posterity. You can watch it any time you want. It is the most agonising three minutes of film you will ever see—Penny Wong trying to answer the most basic fundamental question. A loan officer in a bank would be able to answer, but the finance minister of the Commonwealth of Australia could not.


Why are we giving ourselves a $300 billion overdraft? Why are we getting a $300 billion credit limit? These people who cannot answer the most basic question always run to something else. They said: 'It is not the gross debt, you see. It is the net debt.' It is so easy to fix it—change three simple letters and everything is better. I am curious. I am a very curious person, so I thought I would have a look. I thought: 'Here is our gross debt position. It is $274.231 billion.' You can buy a few Smarties for that. Our net debt was $143.345 billion. That is where they have latched on to it. I thought, 'We have to drill down through this to find out where this figure comes from.' I followed their accountancy statements and went up to the notes where they give the calculation that net debt equals the sum of deposits held, government securities, loans and other borrowings minus the sum of cash deposits, advances paid, investments, loans and placements.


I thought 'loans and placements' was interesting and I wondered how much we had there. There was over $100 billion in loans and placements. I thought I had better start digging through that and see what was going on there. I thought, 'Let's find out what is happening in loans and placements.' So I went and found it in their notes—$107 billion. It is made up of $30.6 billion of investments and deposits. Okay, I will grant you that. You can have that. Book it. There is an IMF quota of $8.8 billion. Well, I do not know about that. I thought I would have a close look at that. Then we have the other one—$68.3 billion of 'other'. It is like sundries. They have said: 'These are other things we do not quite know about, so we will just bang them under ""other"". If we bang them under ""other"" no-one will ask. No-one will ever inquire.' What is this 'other'? If this 'other' has $68.3 billion in it, you should grab some of that 'other' and put it in your account. Then you will not have to extend your overdraft limit. Problem solved. If this 'other' is there and the net debt is correct then grab some of the 'other' and put it in your account and therefore you will not have to increase the overdraft to $300 billion. But I think you will find you actually cannot grab that 'other' because it stands for 'other people's money'—predominantly public servant superannuants—and they do not like the idea of you using their money to pay off your debt.


This is the most dangerous thing. A Prime Minister can be fixed. We can forget about Craig Thomson. We can close our eyes and Peter Slipper disappears. When we get to government we will get rid of the carbon tax. But the debt—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Crossin
):  Senator Joyce, I understand you are referring to members of the other chamber, so I am just going to remind you that one of those people does happen to be the Speaker of the House. I would just remind you about using their correct titles.




Senator JOYCE:
  I accept your admonishment, Madam Acting Deputy President. You are dead right: Mr Slipper is the Speaker of the House. How could we forget that? Who put him there, pray tell? There is a question for the kiddies: who made Peter Slipper the Speaker? Let's think about it. It would have been Julia Gillard.




Senator Feeney:
  That is the Prime Minister.




Senator JOYCE:
  Yes, the Prime Minister—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Joyce, I am reminding you that no matter who you refer to in the House of Representatives they have a title to be used.




Senator JOYCE:
  Mr Peter Slipper is definitely the Speaker of the House. I agree. Mr Peter Slipper, the member for Fisher, is definitely the Speaker of the House and he was most definitely nominated and put there by the Australian Labor Party, whose Prime Minister is Ms Julia Gillard. What a marvellous decision that was by her!


If you are going to believe any person in accountancy or finance the only thing you can judge them by is their track record and their capacity for accuracy—how much of what they say becomes fact. Two years ago the government said that this year we would have a deficit and that we would be out the back door by $13 billion. That was a very bad outcome, so we were worried about that. But they told us about the sunny out plans of fiscal rectitude. They told us better days were ahead. They told us that after they put in place the carbon tax and had taken Jerusalem things would get better. But the next year things got worse. The next year they said that this year it would get much worse, that we would be out the back door by $22 billion. So they basically got close to doubling the figure in their previous statement. They were almost 100 per cent wrong. But we have had some consistency because the next year—this year—we find they are out the back door by $44.4 billion. So there is a consistency here. They are generally 100 per cent wrong one year out. So whatever they have said about the surplus next year, if they follow the trend—and the Treasurer talks about things following trends; he is a very trendy guy—they will be 100 per cent wrong next year as well.


I will take bets with any person who wants to tell me that they will have a $1.5 billion surplus even after they have cooked the books, because they are so totally incompetent that the only thing you can rely on is them being wrong. If this was a credit paper, it would get kicked out the door. You would get absolutely assassinated by the credit bureau. If you worked for them, they would say to you, 'You will lose your job if you keep presenting rubbish like this.' I remember an old boss of mine, Mr Muntz. He would have written all over it what an absurd proposition has been brought up.


Now we have these other mad things. We have all these things wandering off in the capital account, wandering off the balance sheet. The NBN is the classic one. Pray tell: do you honestly believe it is worth what you are borrowing for it? If it is not, shouldn't you be booking a provision for the loss? Do you think you can flog this white elephant off for the $50 billion we are going to borrow to build it? There is not a chance. If it is such a good deal, why aren't you just issuing NBN bonds? NBN would stand for 'next budget nightmare'. NBN bonds are what you should be issuing. If it is such a great proposition the market would love them and go and buy them. But it is not. No-one who is sane would buy an NBN bond, so it is coming through Australian government securities. The reason they would not buy one is that it would not be worth it. Our debt is going through the roof and, as Bill Mortley, my first boss in accounting, told me about this, if you did not laugh you would cry because it is so totally and utterly out of control. But we have to pay it back— (Time expired)

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (18:39):  I rise to speak on this MPI because it provides a good opportunity to put on record the positive benefits that will come out of this federal budget for the Australian nation and for Australia's people and to refute some of the claims put forward by Senator Joyce and those opposite, who continue to run a negative campaign that does not serve them well let alone Australians and certainly does not highlight the fact that this budget very much provides a positive benefit for so many Australians throughout our community. Why is that? It is because this budget is about spreading the benefits of the boom to all corners of our country by delivering a much-needed new financial relief to families and businesses who may be feeling under pressure at this time. We of course are returning the budget to surplus in that process. In doing so, we will provide a buffer in the uncertain global times that may lie ahead and give the Reserve Bank room to cut interest rates, which is another thing that will be very much welcomed by Australian families.


Not only are we delivering a surplus, despite various revenue losses; we are delivering reforms which will make our economy stronger, make our community stronger and provide for a much fairer society. Some of those reforms are groundbreaking reforms. They are Labor reforms. They include the first historic steps towards a national disability insurance scheme, something that is so welcomed by so many in the community sector, including those living with disability and their families and friends. On top of that of course is the much-needed aged-care reform to help senior Australians stay in their homes. That is very much welcomed by those in my state of Tasmania, which has Australia's fastest-ageing population. There is also a big investment in dental care, to deliver a blitz on our public dental waiting lists. That is very much welcomed by those in my home state, as it is by people across the country. As we know, the public dental waiting list has become quite long since the time that the Howard government scrapped the Commonwealth dental scheme. There is a huge investment in our health system, featuring 76 major projects in regional Australia. That is important and welcome for those in the health sector and for those who need to access it. This of course is all part of Labor's commitment to manage the economy responsibly in the interest of working Australians, not just the fortunate few.


There is something in this budget for just about everyone, but I am pleased to see the creation of a National Children's Commissioner. That is an important federal policy that looks to our responsibility to look after children who may be at risk. The National Children's Commissioner will have a broader role in the interests of children and children's policy in this country.


There are a number of other areas that will have benefits for the community. I am pleased to see that SBS has received funding additional to its base government funding over the next four years. There will be something like a 27 per cent increase in funding for SBS, which is important for that national broadcaster. SBS has also received funding to enable it to launch a new national free-to-air Indigenous television service, which will be so welcome to everybody in our nation, not just those of Indigenous background. It will be important in enabling the next generation to understand the culture of our first Australians.


Also in the budget were new, reduced limits on the amount of cigarettes and tobacco that people are allowed to bring into Australia. This is an important complement to some of the tobacco measures that have passed through the parliament. We take seriously the issue of tobacco related illness. Because of that, inbound travellers, who presently are able to bring in something like 250 cigarettes or 250 grams of cigars and tobacco products tax free, will from 1 September this year be able to bring in only 50 cigarettes or 50 grams of cigars. That very much complements our antismoking strategy, which includes, of course, the world's first plain-packaging legislation, the 2010 increase in tobacco excise, a significant investment in antismoking social-marketing campaigns, the restriction on advertising of tobacco products on the internet and subsidised nicotine replacement therapies and other support measures to help people quit smoking and discourage people from taking up the habit. We have done that, and the results are very positive. Something like 15.1 per cent of people aged 14 years and over smoke—that is a 2010 figure—as opposed to 30.5 per cent in 1988. Nevertheless, something like 15,000 Australians die from a smoking related disease every year, so there is still much work to be done.


This government's budget is really about sharing the benefits of the mining boom. It is about recognising that a fair go is not just a quintessentially Labor value but a founding principle of this nation. When the colonies came together to form this nation in 1901 they did so on the understanding that a Commonwealth should always mean exactly that: that the wealth and prosperity created in this country is common to all of us. In Australia we manage that wealth through a process of horizontal fiscal equalisation. This principle recognises that not all states have an equal revenue base. Right now, some states like WA and, potentially, Queensland are flush with mining revenue. They have the right minerals and are taking them out of the ground at the right time. Others, like Tasmania, rely on long-term industries such as manufacturing that are facing unprecedented issues such as the extraordinarily high Australian dollar and changes to freight and shipping conditions out of our state. All states should be able to provide a decent standard of care, and the Commonwealth exists to support states during those times.


That is why Mr Abbott's recent calls for the GST to be distributed on a per capita basis are an attack on Australian values and, in particular, on smaller states such as Tasmania. Tasmanian Liberal senators should be embarrassed by their leader's position. They have been incredibly quiet in relation to their leader's position on the GST. They probably are incredibly embarrassed and probably have been called by various constituents on the fact that they are not standing up for Tasmania and Tasmania's fair share of the distribution of GST.


We know that on 2 May, when visiting Western Australia, Mr Abbott responded to the campaign started by WA Premier Colin Barnett and recently joined by other Liberal premiers to change the GST allocation. In the estimation of these Liberal premiers, the policy of horizontal fiscal equalisation that has served Australia and their own states so well in difficult times, such as times of industry infancy when boom towns were gloom towns, is no longer good enough. Conveniently, it is not good enough right now when Liberal governments are reaping the benefits of the mining boom, but it was fine in 2006-07 when WA was a net beneficiary of the HFE policy. Never one to miss out on a short-term political grab, Mr Abbott said to his Western Australian audience that he was sympathetic to Mr Barnett's argument and that the current distribution of the GST needed to more closely reflect an arrangement based on population. That would clearly disadvantage the smaller states, which, naturally, have a narrow revenue base.


The federal Labor government will not disadvantage smaller states. It believes in the common wealth of this nation. It has provided a budget that does very much spread the benefits of the boom to all corners of our country by delivering to our families and businesses under pressure much-needed new financial relief that is very much welcomed by them.

Senator SINODINOS
 (New South Wales) (18:49):  I only have a minute, but you only need a minute to talk about this budget. The budget has no coherent economic strategy to deliver stronger economic growth, sustainable budget surpluses and to tackle debt. What has happened is that the Labor government is on its knees seeking forgiveness from the Australian people over the carbon tax. That explains why it has broken a number of promises in order to deliver a further families package to try to take people's focus off the carbon tax. In the whole speech there was only one reference to the carbon price. People out there are asking, 'Doesn't the government still stand for the carbon tax?' No, they could not mention the name but they had to mention the extra compensation they are now trying to promote in the community in order to assuage the anger of people out there about the carbon tax.



In the course of doing that they have had to break further promises around company tax, foreign aid, our defence forces, flip-flopping on the business carry-back of losses— (Time expired)

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (18:54):  I rise to speak about the legacy of asbestos in this country and in relation to some recent movements on this issue. I last spoke in this place about this deadly carcinogen during Asbestos Awareness Week, in November. At that time I spoke about the launch of a new parliamentary group for asbestos related disease, as well as the newly identified problem of exposure to asbestos through home renovations, and the obligations of renovation TV programs to raise awareness regarding the safe removal of asbestos. The Block, a Channel 9 program, recently did just that by running an awareness segment a fortnight ago. I have also been advised by Channel 7's Better Homes and Gardens program that they too take their obligations regarding asbestos awareness seriously and, during previous programs, have also focused on the dangers of this substance. I would like to take this opportunity to commend Better Homes and Gardens and The Block and call on other similar programs to follow their lead.


The problems associated with asbestos in this country are far deeper than just this. I recently travelled to Western Australia to meet with Robert Vojakovic AM, president of the Australian Asbestos Disease Society. It may have been an average working day for the majority of people in Perth, but others focused on ensuring that they had their regular check-up with Dr Greg Deleuil. The waiting room was packed, and these were just a small sample of the thousands of people ADSA had helped over 30 years or more. I had always known that the work of ADSA was enormous, but the true breadth of the support they provide to those living with asbestos related disease hit me when I entered ADSA's Perth premises. There were so many people, so many files of deceased sufferers who had lost their lives way too soon.


The majority of victims of asbestos in Western Australia were exposed to the deadly carcinogen from the mining of blue asbestos at Wittenoom, which is today a ghost town. From the early 1940s until 1966 more than 20,000 people resided at Wittenoom, including nearly 5,000 children. These residents were exposed to the blue asbestos fibres being mined in the region, putting many in the high-risk category of developing lung cancer, malignant mesothelioma, asbestos and other pleural plaques. To date more than 2,000 Wittenoom inhabitants, including both workers and their family members have died from asbestos related disease. This burden of disease is not confined to Wittenoom residents alone. Each year, more than 600 Australians die from asbestos related disease, with this figure not expected to peak until 2020. It is vital that medical researchers continue their search for effective treatments and ultimately a cure.


In a bid to raise much needed funds for such research, just last week Robert, his wife and a team of ADSA supporters walked from Kalgoorlie to Perth in a bid to raise funds for the children of Wittenoom. The walk was the brainchild of Derryn Carnaby, and her motivation was highly personal as both of her parents and two of her brothers died from asbestos related diseases they contracted through exposure at Wittenoom. Over five days the group made the 600-kilometre trek from Kalgoorlie to Perth, something I am told many labelled as just plain crazy. The walkers were greeted by more than 150 people when they completed what is now being known as the ADSA Inaugural Walk.


Upon their arrival at the ADSA headquarters, Robert Vojakovic said: 'So many people think that asbestos is a thing of the past, but it is not. It is in the air we breathe and the houses we live in. People need to be confronted with this knowledge so they can take appropriate steps to protect themselves and their children. Awareness is crucial.'


I was pleased to personally donate to this important cause. Also, ADSA were pleased to receive a message from the Prime Minister in support of their efforts. I would like to take this opportunity to commend Robert, his wife, Rose, and all the volunteers and staff who work so tirelessly in a bid to minimise the impact of asbestos related disease in Western Australia.


Of course, the curse of asbestos goes well beyond our sovereign boundaries. In fact some parts of the South East Asia cannot buy enough asbestos building materials for the development of their towns, villages and cities. Without proper safeguards for workers or regulations for inhabitants, it is like stepping back in time to the 1950s in Australia all over again. Too many countries simply ignore the warnings of the World Health Organisation and the ILO in favour of a cheap building product and of progress. They are condemning so many people to illness and a slow death. It is heartbreaking and frustrating all at once.


The global ban initiative continues, though, from trade unions and activists such as Laurie Kazan-Allen, the coordinator of the International Ban Asbestos Secretariat. I met Ms Allen on her recent visit to Australia. She is an inspirational woman who works tirelessly in pursuit of a global ban on asbestos as well as campaigning for the rights of those affected by asbestos related disease. Ms Kazan-Allen and I spoke about a number of asbestos related matters, including the need for internationally recognised guidelines regarding the diagnoses of asbestos related disease, something I have also raised recently with the Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek MP.


We also spoke of the recent win for victims of the Eternit company, with an Italian court sentencing the former owner and major shareholder of Enternit, a fibre-cement company in Italy, to 16 years jail each over the negligence shown to workers who died from an asbestos related disease. The trial, which lasted five years, set a precedent around the world and is the biggest trial against a multinational for asbestos related deaths.


The push for a global ban must continue, and I believe Australia is very well placed to lead the international community in such an undertaking. The Australian Labor Party has already committed to the idea of leading international calls for a global treaty to ban the use of, and trade in, asbestos. It suggests we do this by leading diplomatic efforts and by hosting a 'Global Alliance Against Asbestos Conference' here in Australia. The ALP updated its party platform at national conference last year to recognise the legacy asbestos leaves, particularly on vulnerable people in the developing world. As a Western nation in the Asian region I believe Australia should play a mentoring role to our poorer neighbours in sharing the processes which led to the 2003 ban and the regulations we have implemented in this country since that time. How countries such as Canada can continue to mine and export asbestos truly beggars belief.


We must remember that the victims of asbestos related diseases are not just confined to the regions in which this cancerous substance was mined, as it was loaded onto trucks, shipped off through the cities and ports of the country and poured, pressed and mixed into manufacture as well. Asbestos invaded the lives of thousands of Australians far from where it came. Australia has experienced two waves of asbestos related disease. The first was associated with the mining of the substance and manufacturing of asbestos products and the second wave from asbestos use was in industry, mostly in the building and construction industry.


But asbestos related diseases are not limited to the thousands of workers who were exposed before the carcinogenic nature of this substance was known. As I have spoken about previously in this place, we are now seeing a third wave of asbestos related disease, linked to home renovations. The reality of this was highlighted by the recent death of Everest-man Lincoln Hall. Mr Hall, who survived a night on Mount Everest in 2006, minus shelter and appropriate equipment, was exposed to asbestos as a child while helping his father build a cubby house with asbestos sheeting. Mr Hall's death is a stark reminder that asbestos does not discriminate.


Last week, seven directors of a company were found to have committed breaches over the company's asbestos compensation fund. That company, of course, was James Hardie. When the company was moved offshore in 2001 it issued a media release which said a compensation foundation was fully funded and would provide certainty for the victims. The reality of course was very different, as the fund was $1.5 billion short and soon faced bankruptcy. The High Court rejected the arguments of the directors, who claimed they had not approved a statement issued to the Stock Exchange before the company moved offshore 11 years ago. I think this is an important reminder that company directors provide accurate information to their board, and those on the board must read this information and ensure the accuracy of public statements that follow. When they fail to do this, they will be held to account—that is what the High Court has now put in place. I commend ASIC in this process for staying the course for five years and seeing this important case out. The decision by the High Court of Australia sets a strong precedent regarding company directors' liability. And through that process justice has finally been served for the many victims of the infamous James Hardie company.
